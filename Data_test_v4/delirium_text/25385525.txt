25385525|t|Delayed-onset delirium tremens - a diagnostic and management challenge.
25385525|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium tremens (DT) is one of the most serious complications of alcohol withdrawal, affecting 5-10% of in-patients with a mortality rate up to 15%. DT, characterised by delirium and tremors, appears within 48-72 h of abstinence and persists for about 5-10 days. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of DT in a young man with delayed onset on the 15th day after the cessation of alcohol use, despite an uncomplicated detoxification with benzodiazepine treatment. CONCLUSION: We hypothesise that the intake of country liquor in our patient, which contains higher percentages of alcohol, causes a prolonged imbalance of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid and glutamate receptor activity, leading to the picture of delayed-onset DT and that an atypical presentation at the time of admission and atypicality in early course are clinical pointers to the subsequent development of delayed-onset DT.
