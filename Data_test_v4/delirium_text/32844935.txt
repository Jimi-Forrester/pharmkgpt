32844935|t|Benzodiazepinics and the treatment of delirium: a literature review.
32844935|a|OBJECTIVE To discuss the role of the benzodiazepine class in delirium patient management. METHODS Using the PubMed database, articles were reviewed after the year 2000 containing in their title the words 'delirium' and 'benzodiazepines'. DISCUSSION Delirium is an acute confusional state that leads to altered attention, awareness, and cognition. It presents with some well-established risk factors, especially older individuals with cognitive decline. There is currently no definite consensus regarding its pathophysiology, nor regarding pharmacological measures, especially concerning the benzodiazepine class. CONCLUSION Evidence suggests that there may be a role for the use of pharmacological class in the treatment of this condition, indicating a change in the previously paradigmatic pattern of treatment.
