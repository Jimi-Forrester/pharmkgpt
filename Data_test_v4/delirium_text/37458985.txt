37458985|a|Brain endothelial extracellular vesicles carrying amyloid beta (EV-Abeta) can be transferred to neural progenitor cells (NPCs) leading to NPC dysfunction. However, the events involved in this EV-mediated Abeta pathology are unclear. EV-proteomics studies identified Serpine-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, PAI-1) as a major connecting "hub" on several protein-protein interaction maps. Serpine-1 was described as a key player in Abeta pathology and was linked to HIV-1 infection as well. Therefore, the aim of this work was to address the hypothesis that Serpine-1 can be transferred via EVs from brain endothelial cells (HBMEC) to NPCs and contribute to NPC dysfunction. HBMEC concentrated and released Serpine-1 via EVs, the effect that was potentiated by HIV-1 and Abeta. EVs loaded with Serpine-1 were readily taken up by NPCs, and HIV-1 enhanced this event. Interestingly, a highly specific Serpine-1 inhibitor PAI039 increased EV-Abeta transfer to NPCs in the presence of HIV-1. PAI039 also partially blocked mitochondrial network morphology alterations in the recipient NPCs, which developed mainly after HIV + Abeta-EV transfer. PAI039 partly attenuated HIV-EV-mediated decreased synaptic protein levels in NPCs, while increased synaptic protein levels in NPC projections. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying EV-Serpine-1 related Abeta pathology in the context of HIV infection. They are relevant to HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) in an effort to elucidate the mechanisms of neuropathology in HIV infection.
