39331102|t|Non-Pharmacological Exercise Randomized Controlled Trials in Alzheimer's Disease.
39331102|a|This narrative review aimed to summarize evidence on responses to exercise in pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) and on how long-term exercise programs work to improve neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive performance. We conducted a narrative review of the body of research on the benefits of long-term exercise programs in improving cognitive performance and reducing neuropsychiatric scores in patients with AD. Long-term exercise therapy appears to improve blood flow, increase hippocampal volume, and promote neurogenesis in patients with AD. Higher levels of physical activity are associated with a lower chance of developing the disease, and most prospective studies have shown that physical inactivity is one of the most prevalent modifiable risk factors for the development of AD. Exercise appears to be beneficial in improving cognitive function, a neuropsychiatric symptom of AD. Exercise has been shown to have fewer side effects, such as non-pharmacological effects and better adherence than medication. In this review, experts provided a snapshot and authoritative summary of evidence for non-pharmacological exercise in patients with AD based on the best synthesis efforts, identified the main knowledge gaps and relevant barriers, and provided directions for future research. Furthermore, experts in randomized trial designs provided practical details and recommendations for researchers working in this area, underscoring the importance of relevant topics.
