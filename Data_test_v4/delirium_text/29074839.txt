29074839|t|Acute Onset Vascular Dementia with Bi-Thalamic Infarct in an HIV-Positive Subject.
29074839|a|BACKGROUND Bi-thalamic infarctions are rare and marked by clinical polymorphism. Their association with HIV has never been reported. CASE REPORT We report a 51-year-old right-handed man with no medical history, who presented an acute onset vascular dementia associated with an antero-retrograde amnesia, a word-finding difficulty, and a dysexecutive syndrome. The CT scan was normal. Brain MRI revealed a paramedian and bi-thalamic infarction, evoking an occlusion of the Percheron artery. The electrocardiogram, transthoracic and transesophageal cardiac ultrasound, and Doppler echo of cervical arteries gave normal results. The biological work-up revealed a positive serology to HIV1. The patient was lost to follow-up and was reported dead 2 months later from an unknown cause. CONCLUSIONS This case illustrates the need to perform an HIV serology in the presence of a bi-thalamic infarction with no obvious cause, particularly in a young subject.
