26401691|t|sAbetaPPalpha is a Potent Endogenous Inhibitor of BACE1.
26401691|a|Proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) by the enzyme BACE1 (BACE) is the initial step in production of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), and as such has been a major target of Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug discovery efforts. Overproduction of Abeta results in neuronal cell death and accumulation of amyloid plaques in AD and in traumatic brain injury, and is also associated with stroke due to cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Herein we report for the first time that sAbetaPPalpha, the product of the cleavage of AbetaPP by alpha-secretase, is a potent endogenous direct inhibitor of the BACE enzyme, and that its inhibition is likely by an allosteric mechanism. Furthermore, using small-angle X-ray scattering, we show that sAbetaPPbeta, which is identical to sAbetaPPalpha except for a 16-amino acid truncation at the carboxy terminus, adopts a completely different structure than sAbetaPPalpha and does not inhibit BACE. Our data thus reveal a novel mechanistic role played by sAbetaPPalpha in regulating overproduction of Abeta and restoring neuronal homeostasis and neuroprotection. Identification of sAbetaPPalpha as a direct BACE inhibitor may lead to design of new therapeutics targeting pathologies associated with overproduction of Abeta.
