36482443|t|Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure in melanoma patients: a retrospective study on prognosis and histological features.
36482443|a|Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are endocrine disrupting chemicals which could be associated with cancer development, such as kidney and testicular cancers, pancreatic and hepatocellular carcinoma and thyroid tumor. Available scientific literature offers no information on the role of PFAS in melanoma development/progression. Since 1965, a massive environmental contamination by PFAS has occurred in northeastern Italy. This study compared histopathology and prognosis between melanoma patients exposed (n = 194) and unexposed (n = 488) to PFAS. All patients were diagnosed and/or treated for melanoma at the Veneto Oncological Institute and the University Hospital of Padua (Italy) in 1998-2014. Patients were categorized in exposed or unexposed groups according to their home address and the geographical classification of municipalities affected by PFAS contamination as provided by Veneto Government in 2018. Presence of mitoses was found in 70.5% of exposed patients and 58.7% of unexposed patients (p = 0.005). Median follow-up was 90 months (IQR 59-136). 5-year overall survival was 83.7% in exposed patients and 88.0% in unexposed patients (p = 0.20); 5-year disease-specific survival was 88.0% in exposed patients and 90.9% in unexposed patients (p = 0.50); 5-year disease-free survival was 83.8% in exposed patients and 87.3% in unexposed patients (p = 0.20). Adjusting for imbalanced characteristics at baseline (presence of mitoses), survival was not statistically different between exposed and unexposed patients (overall survival: HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.58, p = 0.57; disease-specific survival: HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.59, p = 0.99; disease-free survival: HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.64, p = 0.62). Although the magnitude of PFAS exposure was not quantifiable, our findings suggested that exposure to PFAS was associated with higher level of mitosis in melanoma patients, but this did not translate into a survival difference. Further studies are required to investigate this relationship and all effects of PFAS on prognosis.
