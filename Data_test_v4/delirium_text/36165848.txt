36165848|t|Defining the unknowns for cell therapies in Parkinson's disease.
36165848|a|First-in-human clinical trials have commenced to test the safety and efficacy of cell therapies for people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Proof of concept that this neural repair strategy is efficacious is based on decades of preclinical studies and clinical trials using primary foetal cells, as well as a significant literature exploring more novel stem cell-derived products. Although several measures of efficacy have been explored, including the successful in vitro differentiation of stem cells to dopamine neurons and consistent alleviation of motor dysfunction in rodent models, many unknowns still remain regarding the long-term clinical implications of this treatment strategy. Here, we consider some of these outstanding questions, including our understanding of the interaction between anti-Parkinsonian medication and the neural transplant, the impact of the cell therapy on cognitive or neuropsychiatric symptoms of PD, the role of neuroinflammation in the therapeutic process and the development of graft-induced dyskinesias. We identify questions that are currently pertinent to the field that require further exploration, and pave the way for a more holistic understanding of this neural repair strategy for treatment of PD.
