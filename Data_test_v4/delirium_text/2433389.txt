2433389|t|The Mini Mental State in those with developmental disabilities.
2433389|a|The Mini Mental State Examination is a useful screen for the detection of cognitive disorders among psychiatric patients. In the absence of a developmental disability, the inability to perform satisfactorily on the Mini Mental State (MMS) (score less than 24) is likely to be related to delirium, dementia, or affective disorders. The mildly retarded or learning disabled should perform satisfactorily (greater than 24) on the MMS but may show impairment with delirium, dementia, or affective disorders. In the absence of a psychiatric disorder, it takes moderate mental retardation (IQ less than 55) or severe reading disability with IQ less than 70 to produce an MMS score of less than 24. The MMS should not be considered a screen for mental retardation, because retarded individuals can function adequately (greater than 24) on the MMS.
