30081499|t|Unraveling the Pathways to Neuronal Homeostasis and Disease: Mechanistic Insights into the Role of RNA-Binding Proteins and Associated Factors.
30081499|a|The timing, dosage and location of gene expression are fundamental determinants of brain architectural complexity. In neurons, this is, primarily, achieved by specific sets of trans-acting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their associated factors that bind to specific cis elements throughout the RNA sequence to regulate splicing, polyadenylation, stability, transport and localized translation at both axons and dendrites. Not surprisingly, misregulation of RBP expression or disruption of its function due to mutations or sequestration into nuclear or cytoplasmic inclusions have been linked to the pathogenesis of several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders such as fragile-X syndrome, autism spectrum disorders, spinal muscular atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. This review discusses the roles of Pumilio, Staufen, IGF2BP, FMRP, Sam68, CPEB, NOVA, ELAVL, SMN, TDP43, FUS, TAF15, and TIA1/TIAR in RNA metabolism by analyzing their specific molecular and cellular function, the neurological symptoms associated with their perturbation, and their axodendritic transport/localization along with their target mRNAs as part of larger macromolecular complexes termed ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules.
