39295447|t|Dexmedetomidine for agitation in dementia: Current data and future direction.
39295447|a|BACKGROUND: The incidence and prevalence of dementia, and thus dementia-related behavioral and psychological symptoms, are increasing significantly. Currently, there are limited safe and efficacious options for treating these symptoms. Dexmedetomidine has been used for agitation related to delirium and showed significant benefit in prior studies. This raises the question whether dexmedetomidine could also provide a safe and effective treatment for BPSD, including agitation related to dementia. METHODS: Our team searched PubMed, Cochrane Database, and Ovid with the terms dexmedetomidine and dementia. Only studies published in English language journals, or with official English language translations, and human studies were included. All reports of dexmedetomidine for dementia were included regardless of study type. RESULTS: No completed studies on dexmedetomidine for agitation in dementia were identified. The TRANQUILITY study is in progress, although results are yet to be published. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine has shown benefit for hospital delirium and for agitation in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. However, there are no completed studies published on dexmedetomidine for agitation in dementia. Controlled studies with larger sample sizes are needed to assess the efficacy, safety, and the best route of administration for this drug in managing BPSD including agitation.
