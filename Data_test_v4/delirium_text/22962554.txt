22962554|a|BACKGROUND: The Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial (ADAPT) tested whether non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD). The results were null. We analyzed ADAPT data to examine if the effects of NSAIDs on AD risk differed depending upon APOE genotype or age as has been suggested by previous observational studies. METHODS: ADAPT randomized 2,528 cognitively intact older adults to either celecoxib, naproxen sodium or placebo; 2,388 participants provided blood samples for APOE genotyping. Proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the effects of naproxen or celecoxib versus placebo on incident AD by age at enrollment and APOE genotype. RESULTS: The proportion of subjects providing a biological sample did not differ between the treatment groups. In models of AD risk, none of the tests for 2-way interactions between either NSAID and age or APOE genotype were significant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The data did not support the hypothesis that the association between NSAIDs and AD risk differed by age or APOE genotype.
