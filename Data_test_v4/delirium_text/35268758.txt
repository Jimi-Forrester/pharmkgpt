35268758|t|Secondary Metabolites with Anti-Inflammatory from the Roots of Cimicifuga taiwanensis.
35268758|a|The genus Cimicifuga is one of the smallest genera in the family Ranunculaceae. Cimicifugae Rhizoma originated from rhizomes of Cimicifuga simplex, and C. dahurica, C. racemosa, C. foetida, and C. heracleifolia have been used as anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic remedies in Chinese traditional medicine. Inflammation is related to many diseases. Cimicifuga taiwanensis was often used in folk therapy in Taiwan for inflammation. Phytochemical investigation and chromatographic separation of extracts from the roots of Cimicifuga taiwanensis has led to the isolation of six new compounds: cimicitaiwanins A-F (1-6, respectively). The structures of the new compounds were unambiguously elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic data analysis (1D- and 2D-NMR, MS, and UV) and comparison with the literature data. The effect of some isolates on the inhibition of NO production in lipopolysaccharide-activated RAW 264.7 murine macrophages was evaluated. Of the isolates, 3-6 exhibited potent anti-NO production activity, with IC50 values ranging from 6.54 to 24.58 muM, respectively, compared with that of quercetin, an iNOS inhibitor with an IC50 value of 34.58 muM. This is the first report on metabolite from the endemic Taiwanese plant-C. taiwanensis.
