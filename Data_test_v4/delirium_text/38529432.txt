38529432|t|Unveiling the Role of Endometrial CD-138: A Comprehensive Review on Its Significance in Infertility and Early Pregnancy.
38529432|a|This review comprehensively examines the role of endometrial CD-138 (syndecan-1) in the context of infertility and early pregnancy. The endometrium, a dynamic tissue responsive to hormonal cues, plays a central role in fertility, and understanding the molecular intricacies governing its function is crucial. CD-138, a cell surface proteoglycan, emerges as a critical player expressed by various endometrial cell types. Our exploration encompasses a brief overview of the endometrium, introducing CD-138 as a significant molecular entity. The rationale for the review underscores the importance of elucidating endometrial factors in fertility and addresses existing knowledge gaps related to CD-138. Throughout the review, we unravel the multifaceted nature of CD-138 and its involvement in infertility, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic marker. Furthermore, insights into CD-138's role during early pregnancy, including trophoblast-endothelial interactions, are discussed. In conclusion, the findings underscore the clinical implications of CD-138, suggesting its utility in diagnostics and offering prospects for targeted therapeutic interventions. The identified knowledge gaps propel future research directions, promising to deepen our understanding of this enigmatic molecule and its transformative potential in reproductive medicine.
