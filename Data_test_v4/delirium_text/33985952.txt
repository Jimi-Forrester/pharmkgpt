33985952|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The association of perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale with amyloid accumulation among patients with Alzheimer disease-related cognitive impairment is unknown. We evaluated this association in patients with Alzheimer disease-related cognitive impairment and beta-amyloid deposition, assessed with [18F] florbetaben PET/CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR imaging and [18F] florbetaben PET/CT images of 144 patients with Alzheimer disease-related cognitive impairment were retrospectively evaluated. MR imaging-visible perivascular spaces were rated on a 4-point visual scale: a score of >=3 or <3 indicated a high or low degree of MR imaging-visible perivascular spaces, respectively. Amyloid deposition was evaluated using the brain beta-amyloid plaque load scoring system. RESULTS: Compared with patients negative for beta-amyloid, those positive for it were older and more likely to have lower cognitive function, a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, white matter hyperintensity, the Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele, and a high degree of MR imaging-visible perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale. Multivariable analysis, adjusted for age and Apolipoprotein E status, revealed that a high degree of MR imaging-visible perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale was independently associated with beta-amyloid positivity (odds ratio, 2.307; 95% CI, 1.036-5.136; P = .041). CONCLUSIONS: A high degree of MR imaging-visible perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale independently predicted beta-amyloid positivity in patients with Alzheimer disease-related cognitive impairment. Thus, MR imaging-visible perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale are associated with amyloid pathology of the brain and could be an indirect imaging marker of amyloid burden in patients with Alzheimer disease-related cognitive impairment.
