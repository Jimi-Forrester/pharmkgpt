33120941|t|COVID-19-Associated Neurological Disorders: The Potential Route of CNS Invasion and Blood-Brain Relevance.
33120941|a|Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel human coronavirus that has sparked a global pandemic of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). The virus invades human cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor-driven pathway, primarily targeting the human respiratory tract. However, emerging reports of neurological manifestations demonstrate the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2. This review highlights the possible routes by which SARS-CoV-2 may invade the central nervous system (CNS) and provides insight into recent case reports of COVID-19-associated neurological disorders, namely ischaemic stroke, encephalitis, encephalopathy, epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, and inflammatory-mediated neurological disorders. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion, neuroinflammation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction may be implicated in the development of the observed disorders; however, further research is critical to understand the detailed mechanisms and pathway of infectivity behind CNS pathogenesis.
