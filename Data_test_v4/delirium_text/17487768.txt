17487768|t|Incidence and precipitating factors of delirium after coronary artery bypass grafting.
17487768|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyze large contemporary patient population, undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting at our institution, and identify the prevalence and precipitating factors of delirium development. DESIGN: Baseline demographics, operative data and postoperative outcomes of 1367 consecutive patients were recorded prospectively and analysed using multivariate logistic regression analysis, to determine independent predictors of postoperative delirium development. RESULTS: Delirium was detected in 42 (3.07%) patients. Eight factors: age more than 65 years, peripheral vascular disease, Euroscore>/=5, preoperative IABP support, postoperative blood product usage and postoperative low cardiac output syndrome were independently predicting delirium development after coronary artery bypass procedures. Postoperative delirium was associated with significantly higher mortality rate (16.6% vs. 3.9%, p=0.013), prolonged mechanical ventilation time (9.2+/-3.1 vs. 5.05+/-7.6, p=0.04) and increased length of intensive care unit stay (6.8+/-4.9 vs. 2.0+/-2.7 days, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is a dangerous complication, prolonging intensive care unit stay and postoperative mortality. Factors associated with delirium development are advanced age, peripheral vascular disease, diminished cardiac function and blood product usage.
