35309255|t|Structural Covariance of the Ipsilesional Primary Motor Cortex in Subcortical Stroke Patients with Motor Deficits.
35309255|a|The analysis of structural covariance has emerged as a powerful tool to explore the morphometric correlations among broadly distributed brain regions. However, little is known about the interactions between the damaged primary motor cortex (M1) and other brain regions in stroke patients with motor deficits. This study is aimed at investigating the structural covariance pattern of the ipsilesional M1 in chronic subcortical stroke patients with motor deficits. High-resolution T1-weighted brain images were acquired from 58 chronic subcortical stroke patients with motor deficits (29 with left-sided lesions and 29 with right-sided lesions) and 50 healthy controls. Structural covariance patterns were identified by a seed-based structural covariance method based on gray matter (GM) volume. Group comparisons between stroke patients (left-sided or right-sided groups) and healthy controls were determined by a permutation test. The association between alterations in the regional GM volume and motor recovery after stroke was investigated by a multivariate regression approach. Structural covariance analysis revealed an extensive increase in the structural interactions between the ipsilesional M1 and other brain regions in stroke patients, involving not only motor-related brain regions but also non-motor-related brain regions. We also identified a slightly different pattern of structural covariance between the left-sided stroke group and the right-sided stroke group, thus indicating a lesion-side effect of cortical reorganization after stroke. Moreover, alterations in the GM volume of structural covariance brain regions were significantly correlated to the motor function scores in stroke patients. These findings indicated that the structural covariance patterns of the ipsilesional M1 in chronic subcortical stroke patients were induced by motor-related plasticity. Our findings may help us to better understand the neurobiological mechanisms of motor impairment and recovery in patients with subcortical stroke from different perspectives.
