The extreme nature of this infectious virus and its ability to spread without control has made it mandatory to find an efficient auto-diagnosis system to assist the people who work in touch with the patients. As fuzzy logic is considered a powerful technique for modeling vagueness in medical practice, an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) was proposed in this paper as a key rule for automatic COVID-19 detection from chest X-ray images based on the characteristics derived by texture analysis using gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) technique. Unlike the proposed method, especially deep learning-based approaches, the proposed ANFIS-based method can work on small datasets. The results were promising performance accuracy, and compared with the other state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed method gives the same performance as the deep learning with complex architectures using many backbone.
