38591201|t|Alleviating Neurodegenerative Diseases Associated with Mitochondrial Defects by Therapeutic Biomolecules.
38591201|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are emerging as a global health concern in the current sce-nario, and their association with mitochondrial defects has been a potential area of research. Mi-tochondria, one of the essential organelles of the cell, serve as the cell's powerhouse, producing energy and ensuring cellular health. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease have been found to be primarily triggered by mitochondrial malfunction. One of the key byproducts of mitochondrial respiration, reactive oxygen species, also contributes significantly to mitochondrial DNA muta-tions that eventually cause mitochondrial breakdown. This review paper comprehensively examines the potential of therapeutic biomolecules, specifi-cally mitochondria-specific antioxidants, in mitigating the impact of mitochondrial defects on neurodegenerative diseases. It provides a detailed analysis of the mechanisms involved in mito-chondrial dysfunction, the potential therapeutic targets of these biomolecules, and their structure-activity relationship information are also discussed in this review. Various research articles and publications were used extensively in compiling the data, and the structures of biomolecules were prepared using software such as ChemDraw and ChemSketch. Crucial elements triggering mitochondrial abnormalities were identified and a tabular compilation of bioactive antioxidant compounds along with their therapeutic targets, was presented. Mitochondria-specific antioxidant therapy is an innovative and promising strategy for the man-agement of neurodegenerative diseases associated with mitochondrial defects. This review pro-vides a thorough summary of the current state of research and promising avenues of research and development in this field, emphasizing the importance of further investigations and clinical trials to elucidate their therapeutic benefits.
