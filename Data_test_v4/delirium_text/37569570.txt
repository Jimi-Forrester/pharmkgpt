37569570|a|HIV-1 replication in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract causes severe CD4+ T-cell depletion and disruption of the protective epithelial barrier in the intestinal mucosa, causing microbial translocation, the main driver of inflammation and immune activation, even in people living with HIV (PLWH) taking antiretroviral drug therapy. The higher levels of HIV DNA in the gut compared to the blood highlight the importance of the gut as a viral reservoir. CD4+ T-cell subsets in the gut differ in phenotypic characteristics and differentiation status from the ones in other tissues or in peripheral blood, and little is still known about the mechanisms by which the persistence of HIV is maintained at this anatomical site. This review aims to describe the interaction with key subsets of CD4+ T cells in the intestinal mucosa targeted by HIV-1 and the role of gut microbiome and its metabolites in HIV-associated systemic inflammation and immune activation that are crucial in the pathogenesis of HIV infection and related comorbidities.
