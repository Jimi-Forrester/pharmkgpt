37778696|a|Neuroinflammation and the resulting neurodegeneration is a big challenge for the healthcare system, especially with the aging population. Neuroinflammation can result from a variety of insults to the central nervous system leading to an interplay between immune and brain cells that sustains chronic inflammation and injures neural cells. One facilitator of this toxic interplay are exosomes. Exosomes are nano-sized, bilayer lipid vesicles secreted by cells containing proteins, nucleic acids and lipids. Because exosomes can be internalized by other cells, their contents can elicit inflammatory responses and trigger toxicities in recipient cells. On the flip side, exosomes can act as therapeutic vehicles carrying protective cargo to maintain homeostasis. This review discusses exosome biogenesis, composition, and its role in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the context of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. The emerging roles of exosomes as biomarkers of neurologic diseases and as therapeutic delivery vehicles are also discussed. With all of these varying roles, interest and excitement in exosomes continue to grow exponentially and their promise as brain therapeutics is only beginning to be explored and harnessed.
