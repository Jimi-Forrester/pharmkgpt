35064896|a|The presence of auto-antibodies that target synaptic machinery proteins was documented recently in immune-mediated cerebellar ataxias. The autoantigens include glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65), voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (VGCC), metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1 (mGluR1), and glutamate receptor delta (GluRdelta). GAD65 is involved in the synthesis, packaging, and release of GABA, whereas the other three play important roles in the induction of long-term depression (LTD). Thus, the auto-antibodies toward these synaptic molecules likely impair fundamental synaptic machineries involved in unique functions of the cerebellum, potentially leading to the development of cerebellar ataxias (CAs). This concept has been substantiated recently by a series of physiological studies. Anti-GAD65 antibody (Ab) acts on the terminals of inhibitory neurons that suppress GABA release, whereas anti-VGCC, anti-mGluR1, and anti-GluR Abs impair LTD induction. Notably, the mechanisms that link synaptic dysfunction with the manifestations of CAs can be explained by disruption of the "internal models." The latter can be divided into three levels. First, since chained inhibitory neurons shape the output signals through the mechanism of disinhibition/inhibition, impairments of GABA release and LTD distort the conversion process from the "internal model" to the output signals. Second, these antibodies impair the induction of synaptic plasticity, rebound potentiation, and LTD, on Purkinje cells, resulting in loss of restoration and compensation of the distorted "internal models." Finally, the cross-talk between glutamate and microglia/astrocytes could involve a positive feedback loop that accelerates excitotoxicity. This mini-review summarizes the pathophysiological mechanisms and aims to establish the basis of "auto-antibody-induced cerebellar synaptopathies."
