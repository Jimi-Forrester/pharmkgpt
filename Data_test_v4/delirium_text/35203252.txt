35203252|t|Correlation between Sialylation Status and Cell Susceptibility to Amyloid Toxicity.
35203252|a|The interaction between the cell membrane and misfolded protein species plays a crucial role in the development of neurodegeneration. This study was designed to clarify the relationship between plasma membrane composition in terms of the differently linked sialic acid (Sia) content and cell susceptibility to toxic and misfolded Abeta-42 peptides. The sialylation status in different cell lines was investigated by lectin histochemistry and confocal immunofluorescence and then correlated with the different propensities to bind amyloid fibrils and with the relative cell susceptibility to amyloid damage. This study reveals that expressions of Sias alpha2,3 and alpha2,6 linked to galactose/N-acetyl-galactosamine, and PolySia are positively correlated with Abeta-42-induced cell toxicity. PolySia shows an early strong interaction with amyloid fibrils, favoring their binding to GM1 ganglioside containing alpha2,3 galactose-linked Sia and a loss of cell viability. Our findings demonstrate that cell lines with a prevailing plastic neuron-like phenotype and high monoSia and PolySia contents are highly susceptible to amyloid Abeta-42 toxicity. This toxicity may involve a change in neuron metabolism and promote a compensative/protective increase in PolySia, which, in turn, could favor amyloid binding to GM1, thus exacerbating cell dysmetabolism and further amyloid aggregation.
