18688088|t|p70 S6 kinase and tau in Alzheimer's disease.
18688088|a|The 70-kDa S6 kinase (p70S6K) is a Ser/Thr (S/T)-directed kinase that plays a crucial role in cell growth, cell differentiation, and cell cycle control. This article presented evidence that supports both toxic and protective roles of p70S6K activity towards tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. The p70S6K can phosphorylate tau at S262, S214, and T212 sites. Phosphorylation at these sites might release tau from microtubules, resulting in microtubule disruption. Evidence also suggests that p70S6K regulates the translation of tau mRNA by phosphorylating the 40S ribosomal protein S6. The extracellular amyloid-beta deposition in AD brains could be a causative factor that activates p70S6K. We hypothesized that amyloid-beta deposition activates p70S6K whose anti-apoptotic property subsequently keeps neurons from entering into the apoptotic process. This process provides the opportunity for the newly synthesized tau to be phosphorylated by p70S6K and by other tau kinases. This hyperphosphorylated tau then aggregates and is progressively deposited in neurons.
