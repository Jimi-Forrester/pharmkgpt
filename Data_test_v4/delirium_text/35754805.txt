35754805|t|A Novel Variant of X-Linked Moesin Gene in a Boy With Inflammatory Bowel Disease Like Disease-A Case Report.
35754805|a|Variants in the MSN gene were recently reported as the cause of a primary immunodeficiency disease called X-linked moesin-associated immunodeficiency (X-MAID). Hitherto, only 10 patients were reported worldwide. Here, we report a boy who presented with recurrent high fever, oral ulcers, abdominal pain, and hematochezia for over 2 weeks. His serum inflammatory markers were elevated, and colonoscopy showed multiple colon ulcers and terminal ileum ulcers which resemble colitis caused by inflammatory bowel disease. A novel heterozygous variant c.934G>T(p.Glu312Ter) in the MSN gene was identified using whole exome sequencing (WES) and trio analysis. Intestinal ulcers were almost healed after inducing therapy with steroids and maintenance treatment of anti-TNFalpha therapy. We summarized the genotype and phenotype of reported X-MAID patients and presented the patient's unique phenotype in this study. This study also expanded the spectrum of MSN mutation-caused immunodeficiency.
