36471433|a|BACKGROUND: Aggregation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in the brain is one of the key pathological events in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reducing Abeta levels in the brain by enhancing its degradation is one possible strategy to develop new therapies for AD. Neprilysin (NEP) is a membrane-bound metallopeptidase and one of the major Abeta-degrading enzymes. The secreted soluble form of NEP (sNEP) has been previously suggested as a potential protein-therapy degrading Abeta in AD. However, similar to other large molecules, peripherally administered sNEP is unable to reach the brain due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). METHODS: To provide transcytosis across the BBB, we recombinantly fused the TfR binding moiety (scFv8D3) to either sNEP or a previously described variant of NEP (muNEP) suggested to have higher degradation efficiency of Abeta compared to other NEP substrates, but not per se to degrade Abeta more efficiently. To provide long blood half-life, an Fc-based antibody fragment (scFc) was added to the designs, forming sNEP-scFc-scFv8D3 and muNEP-scFc-scFv8D3. The ability of the mentioned recombinant proteins to degrade Abeta was first evaluated in vitro using synthetic Abeta peptides followed by sandwich ELISA. For the in vivo studies, a single injection of 125-iodine-labelled sNEP-scFc-scFv8D3 and muNEP-scFc-scFv8D3 was intravenously administered to a tg-ArcSwe mouse model of AD, using scFc-scFv8D3 protein that lacks NEP as a negative control. Different ELISA setups were applied to quantify Abeta concentration of different conformations, both in brain tissues and blood samples. RESULTS: When tested in vitro, sNEP-scFc-scFv8D3 retained sNEP enzymatic activity in degrading Abeta and both constructs efficiently degraded arctic Abeta. When intravenously injected, sNEP-scFc-scFv8D3 demonstrated 20 times higher brain uptake compared to sNEP. Both scFv8D3-fused NEP proteins significantly reduced aggregated Abeta levels in the blood of tg-ArcSwe mice, a transgenic mouse model of AD, following a single intravenous injection. In the brain, monomeric and oligomeric Abeta were significantly reduced. Both scFv8D3-fused NEP proteins displayed a fast clearance from the brain. CONCLUSION: A one-time injection of a BBB-penetrating NEP shows the potential to reduce, the likely most toxic, Abeta oligomers in the brain in addition to monomers. Also, Abeta aggregates in the blood were reduced.
