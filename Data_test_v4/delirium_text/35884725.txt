35884725|t|Quantifying GABA in Addiction: A Review of Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Studies.
35884725|a|Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling plays a crucial role in drug reward and the development of addiction. Historically, GABA neurochemistry in humans has been difficult to study due to methodological limitations. In recent years, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS, MRS) has emerged as a non-invasive imaging technique that can detect and quantify human brain metabolites in vivo. Novel sequencing and spectral editing methods have since been developed to allow for quantification of GABA. This review outlines the clinical research utilization of 1H-MRS in understanding GABA neurochemistry in addiction and summarizes current literature that reports GABA measurements by MRS in addiction. Research on alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, and cannabis addiction all suggest medications that modulate GABA signaling may be effective in reducing withdrawal, craving, and other addictive behaviors. Thus, we discuss how improvements in current MRS techniques and design can optimize GABA quantification in future studies and explore how monitoring changes to brain GABA could help identify risk factors, improve treatment efficacy, further characterize the nature of addiction, and provide crucial insights for future pharmacological development.
