38438846|a|OBJECTIVE: In patients with stable hemodynamic status after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) after preoperative investigations can provide outcomes comparable to those of emergency surgery. However, no established guidelines exist regarding the preparation period before surgery. We report the results of the use of an inpatient cardiac rehabilitation program followed by CABG after an ACS to improve post-operative outcomes and prognosis after discharge. METHODS: From 2005 to 2017, 471 patients underwent either isolated or combined CABG at our institution, and of those, the 393 who received isolated CABG were included in the analysis. Twenty-seven patients (6.9%) were admitted with ACS and underwent preoperative rehabilitation before undergoing CABG, with a subsequent review of surgical morbidity and mortality rates. Propensity score matching yielded a cohort of 26 patients who underwent preoperative rehabilitation (group A) and 26 controls (group B). Preoperative characteristics were similar between groups. RESULTS: The completion rate of the rehabilitation program was 96.3%. All programs were conducted with inpatients, with an average length of stay of 23 +- 12 days. All patients completed in-bed exercises, and 85% completed out-of-bed exercises. The 30-day postoperative mortality was 0% in both groups A and B, and the rate of postoperative major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events at 12 months did not differ significantly between groups (7.7% vs 3.9%, respectively; p = 1.0). The duration of mechanical ventilation (1.3 +- 0.3 vs 1.5 +- 0.3 days, respectively; p = 0.633), length of intensive care unit stay (4.4 +- 2.1 vs 4.8 +- 2.3 days, respectively; p = 0.584) and length of hospital stay (25 +- 13 vs 22 +- 9 days, respectively; p = 0.378) did not differ significantly between groups. CONCLUSIONS: No complications of preoperative rehabilitation were observed, suggesting that it is an acceptable option for patients who experience ACS and undergo CABG. These results are promising in offering more robust designs of future trials.
