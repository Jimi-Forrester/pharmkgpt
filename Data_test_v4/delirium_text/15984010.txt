15984010|a|Various C-terminally truncated amyloid beta peptides (Abeta) are linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of Abeta38, Abeta40, and Abeta42 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 30 patients with AD and 26 control subjects. CSF Abeta42 levels was decreased in patients with AD, whereas CSF Abeta38 and Abeta40 levels were similar in patients with AD and control subjects. All three Abeta peptides were interrelated, particularly CSF Abeta38 and Abeta40. Diagnostic accuracy of CSF Abeta42 concentrations was not improved by applying the ratios of CSF Abeta42 to Abeta38 or Abeta40.
