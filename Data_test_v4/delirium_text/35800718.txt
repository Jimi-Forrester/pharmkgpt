35800718|a|Background: Oxidative stress has a predominant role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and therefore the modulation of genes and the identification of biological pathways associated with antioxidant therapies, have an impact on its treatment. Objective: The objective of this study was the comparison of 2 methods for the analysis of real-time PCR (qPCR) data, through the use of the evaluation of genes that mediate the effect of Phycocyanobilin (PCB) and its validation in animal models. Methods: We evaluated the effect of PCB:" in vitro" on gene modulation through qPCR analyzed by parametric ANOVA and multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) in a model of glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in the SH-SY5Y cell line and" in vivo"; in animal models of multiple sclerosis (MS) and cerebral ischemia (CI). Results: The results showed that PCA is a robust and powerful method that allows the assessment of gene expression profiles. We detected the significant down-regulation of the CYBB (NOX2), and HMOX1 by the action of PCB in SH-5YSH cell line insulted with Glutamate. The decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines and markers related to apoptosis and innate immune response, mediated the effect of PCB in the animal models of MS and CI, respectively. Conclusion: We concluded that the mechanisms by which PCB protected cells included the reduction of oxidative stress damage, which could contribute to its clinical efficacy for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
