28012839|t|Prevalence and Risk Factors for Delirium in Acute Stroke Patients. A Retrospective 5-Years Clinical Series.
28012839|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is characterized by disturbances of attention and cognition that cause functional decline and complications. The predisposing factors of delirium are age, male gender, systemic or metabolic disorders, dementia, and stroke. This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of delirium and to identify risk factors. METHODS: This is a retrospective study that includes patients admitted over 5 years with acute stroke. Patients with transient ischemic attack or venous thrombosis were excluded. Delirium was defined according the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Demographical characteristics, clinical-radiological profile, dependence on discharge (modified Rankin Scale score of >=3 and Barthel Index < 65%), and mortality during hospitalization were compared between patients with and without delirium. RESULTS: A total of 1161 patients were admitted (910 ischemic and 162 hemorrhagic). During hospitalization, 118 patients presented with delirium (10.2%) and 93 died (8%). On discharge, 517 patients were dependent (44.5%). Delirium was significantly associated with age, male gender, cortical infarcts in anterior circulation, higher leukocyte count, cholesterol and fibrinogen levels, lower albumin, atrial fibrillation, previous diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, and hemorrhagic stroke. Logistic regression results showed that only previous Alzheimer's disease was related to delirium (odds ratio 21.68 [95% confidence interval 1.190-395.026, P = .038]). Dependence on discharge was associated with delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Ten percent of the patients presented with delirium associated with older age, Alzheimer's disease, and cortical anterior stroke. Patients with delirium had a higher risk of functional dependence on discharge.
