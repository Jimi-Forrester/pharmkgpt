31827929|t|Neurosurgical Care of Nonpowder Firearm Injuries: A Narrative Review of the Literature.
31827929|a|BACKGROUND: Nonpowder firearms discharge a projectile using compressed gases. Unlike traditional firearms, there is a perception that nonpowder guns do not cause serious injury. However, intracranial injury disproportionally affects children and can cause significant neurological disabilities and mortality. Management of nonpowder firearm injuries has received little attention in the literature and presents unique surgical challenges. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of the literature of the management of nonpowder firearm injuries with particular emphasis on intracranial injury. RESULTS: Modern nonpowder firearms have muzzle velocities which are capable of penetrating the skin, eyes, and bone. Direct intracranial injury commonly results from entrance of projectile through thinner portions of the skull. Operative intervention is needed to debride and safely explore the trajectory to remove fragments which can easily cause neurovascular injury. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgeons play a crucial role in managing serious nonpowder firearm injuries. A multidisciplinary team is needed to manage the direct results of penetrating injury and long-term sequalae.
