37535309|a|Traditional Chinese medicines such as hyperoside-rich Acanthopanax senticosus and Crataegus pinnatifida have been confirmed to exhibit anti-oxidative stress properties. Hyperoside, the main ingredient of numerous antioxidant herbs, may have the ability to postpone the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. This study investigates the possible therapeutic mechanism of hyperoside as a natural antioxidant against Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Caenorhabditis elegans and PC12 cells. Specifically, hyperoside reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and Abeta42-induced neurotoxicity in C. elegans worms. Meanwhile, hyperoside reduced ROS production and increased mitochondrial membrane potentialin Abeta42-induced PC12 cells, which possibly due to the increase of antioxidant enzymes activity and the diminution of malondialdehyde levels. Hoechst 33,342 staining and flow cytometry analysis results suggested that hyperoside reverses cell apoptosis. Network pharmacology predicts potentially relevant hyperoside targets and pathways in AD therapy. As anticipated, hyperoside reversed Abeta42-stimulated downregulation of the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2/HO-1. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 partially abolished the protective capability of hyperoside. The results of molecular docking further indicated that the PI3K/Akt pathways may be involved in the protection of Abeta42-induced PC12 cells by hyperoside treatment. The study provides theoretical information for research and development of hyperoside as an antioxidant dietary supplement.
