38944636|a|Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique for modulating cortical activities and improving neural plasticity. Several studies investigated the effects of rTMS, etc., but the results are inconsistent. This study was designed to examine whether rTMS applied on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (l-DLPFC) showed an effect on improving cognitive deficits in SZ and whether the early efficacy could predict efficacy at subsequent follow-ups. Cognitive ability was assessed using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) scale at baseline, weeks 2, 6, and 24. We found a significant interaction between time (weeks 0, 2, 6, and 24) and intervention on immediate memory and RBANS total scores (p = 0.02 and p = 0.04), indicating that both 10-Hz and 20-Hz rTMS stimulations had a delayed beneficial effect on immediate memory in SZ. Moreover, we found that 20-Hz rTMS stimulation, but not 10-Hz rTMS improved immediate memory at week 6 compared to the sham group (p = 0.029). More importantly, improvements in immediate memory at week 2 were positively correlated with improvements at week 24 (beta = 0.461, t = 3.322, p = 0.002). Our study suggests that active rTMS was beneficial for cognitive deficits in patients with SZ. Furthermore, efficacy at week 2 could predict the subsequent efficacy at 24-week follow-up.
