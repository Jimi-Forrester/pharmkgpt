12826736|a|To investigate whether atrophy of the substantia innominata as shown on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), reflecting degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert, predicts response to donepezil treatment in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), we studied correlations between the thickness of the substantia innominata and clinical efficacy. Eighty-two patients were divided into responders, including transiently and continuously responding groups, and nonresponders, based on the changes in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score from baseline at 3 months and at 12 months. Atrophy of the substantia innominata was more pronounced in transiently and continuously responding groups than nonresponders, but no significant change in the thickness between transiently and continuously responding groups was found. The MMSE score changes from baseline at 3 months and at 12 months significantly inversely correlated with the thickness of the substantia innominata. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the overall discrimination rate with the thickness of the substantia innominata was 70% between responders and nonresponders. We conclude that atrophy of the substantia innominata on MRI helps to predict response to donepezil treatment in patients with AD.
