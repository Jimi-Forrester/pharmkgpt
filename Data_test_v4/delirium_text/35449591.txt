35449591|t|Cell models for Down syndrome-Alzheimer's disease research.
35449591|a|Down syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosomal abnormality and leads to intellectual disability, increased risk of cardiac defects, and an altered immune response. Individuals with DS have an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21) and are more likely to develop early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) than the general population. Changes in expression of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21)-encoded genes, such as amyloid precursor protein (APP), play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD in DS (DS-AD). However, the mechanisms of DS-AD remain poorly understood. To date, several mouse models with an extra copy of genes syntenic to Hsa21 have been developed to characterise DS-AD-related phenotypes. Nonetheless, due to genetic and physiological differences between mouse and human, mouse models cannot faithfully recapitulate all features of DS-AD. Cells differentiated from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), isolated from individuals with genetic diseases, can be used to model disease-related cellular and molecular pathologies, including DS. In this review, we will discuss the limitations of mouse models of DS and how these can be addressed using recent advancements in modelling DS using human iPSCs and iPSC-mouse chimeras, and potential applications of iPSCs in preclinical studies for DS-AD.
