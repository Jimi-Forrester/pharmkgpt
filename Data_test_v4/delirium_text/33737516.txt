33737516|t|Retinal ganglion cell dysfunction in preclinical Alzheimer's disease: an electrophysiologic biomarker signature.
33737516|a|The current study evaluated retinal function using electroretinography (ERG) in cognitively healthy (CH) participants with preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), as classified by cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) Abeta42/Tau ratio. Individuals with normal retinal morphology ascertained by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography were enrolled. Full-field ERG, pattern PERG, and photopic negative response (PhNR) were performed in 29 adult participants (58 eyes). Amplitude and implicit times of the ERG wave components were analyzed. Preclinical AD participants showed marked retinal ganglion cell dysfunction relative to controls. The PhNR was significantly diminished in preclinical AD relative to controls. PhNR amplitude and N95 implicit time differentiated CH individuals with CSF biomarkers of AD pathology with 87% sensitivity and 82% specificity. These quantitative electrophysiologic findings expand our understanding of early retinal functional changes that precede cognitive decline in AD. Retinal ganglion cell dysfunction, as detected by ERG, may be a clinically useful, non-invasive in vivo biomarker for early disease detection, which is necessary for ultimately pursuing early intervention.
