37492273|t|Evaluating the frequency of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients: A cross-sectional study.
37492273|a|Background and Aims: Due to the recent emergence of COVID-19, the exact pathology of this disease has not been determined. Therefore, this study evaluated the frequency of neurological symptoms in patients with COVID-19. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 2200 in patients with COVID-19 who were selected from an educational hospital in Sanandaj, Iran, from April 2020 to March 2021. The research samples were selected by census, all patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the hospital. The data collection tool was a checklist of the studied variables (dizziness, headache, and impaired consciousness) prepared by the researchers based on the specialists' opinions. The researcher completed these checklists based on the patients' hospitalization records. The data were analyzed by descriptive and analytical statistical tests using SPSS Software Version 20. The quantitative variables were compared using the independent t-test. The chi 2 test was also used to compare qualitative variables. A p Value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The mean age of the patients was 57.41 years old, of whom 53.1% were male. The average blood oxygen level of the patients was 88.10%, and most disease symptoms were related to shortness of breath and cough, with a frequency of 24.3%. In addition, 20.8% of patients needed hospitalization in intensive care unit. The highest frequency of central and peripheral nervous system manifestations was related to headache, ageusia (loss of sense of taste), hyposmia (A decreased sense of smell and anosmia (The complete loss of smell). Finally, 15.3% of patients died, and 84.7% recovered. The analytical findings showed a significant relationship between the disease outcome and patients' dizziness, consciousness disorder, seizure and ageusia. There was a significant relationship between gender and headache in patients. There was a significant difference between the mean age and oxygen level with central and peripheral nervous system manifestations (dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, smell disorder) and the disease outcome in patients. Conclusion: The pathophysiology of COVID-19 virus infection involving the central nervous system is not fully understood. Neurological symptoms of this virus include delirium, headache, decreased level of consciousness, and seizures. Identifying the symptoms and mechanisms of neurological complications of COVID-19 is necessary for proper screening and complete treatment because a patient infected by COVID-19 may not show respiratory failure signs but may be a carrier. A complete and accurate knowledge of the symptoms and complications of this infection for proper screening of patients to prevent transmission and spread of this disease is critically needed.
