30924329|t|Prolines Affect the Nucleation Phase of Amyloid Fibrillation Reaction; Mutational Analysis of Human Stefin B.
30924329|a|Proline residues play a prominent role in protein folding and aggregation. We investigated the influence of single prolines and their combination on oligomerization and the amyloid fibrillation reaction of human stefin B (stB). The proline mutants influenced the distribution of oligomers between monomers, dimers, and tetramers as shown by the size-exclusion chromatography. Only P74S showed higher oligomers, reminiscent of the molten globule reported previously for the P74S of stB-Y31 variant. The proline mutants also inhibited to various degree the amyloid fibrillation reaction. At 30 and 37  C, inhibition was complete for the P74S single mutant, two double mutants (P6L P74S and P74S P79S), and for the triple mutant P6L P11S P74S. At 30  C the single mutant P6L completely inhibited the reaction, while P11S and P79S formed amyloid fibrils with a prolonged lag phase. P36D did not show a lag phase, reminiscent of a downhill polymerization model. At 37  C in addition to P36D, P11S, and P79S, P6L and P11S P74S also started to fibrillate; however, the yield of the fibrils was much lower than that of the wild-type protein as judged by transmission electron microscopy. Thus, Pro 74 cis/trans isomerization proves to be the key event, acting as a switch toward an amyloid transition. Using our previous model of nucleation and growth, we simulated the kinetics of all the mutants that exhibited sigmoidal fibrillation curves. To our surprise, the nucleation phase was most affected by Pro cis/trans isomerism, rather than the fibril elongation phase.
