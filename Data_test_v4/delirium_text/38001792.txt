38001792|a|BACKGROUND: With the development of an aging sociality, aging-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, are dramatically increasing. To find small molecules from natural products that can prevent the aging of human beings and the occurrence of these diseases, we used the lifespan assay of yeast as a bioassay system to screen an antiaging substance. Isoquercitrin (IQ), an antiaging substance, was isolated from Apocynum venetum L., an herbal tea commonly consumed in Xinjiang, China. AIM OF THE STUDY: In the present study, we utilized molecular-biology technology to clarify the mechanism of action of IQ. METHODS: The replicative lifespans of K6001 yeasts and the chronological lifespans of YOM36 yeasts were used to screen and confirm the antiaging effect of IQ. Furthermore, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) assay, the survival assay of yeast under stresses, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting analyses, the replicative-lifespan assay of mutants, such as Deltasod1, Deltasod2, Deltagpx, Deltacat, Deltaskn7, Deltauth1, Deltaatg32, Deltaatg2, and Deltarim15 of K6001, autophagy flux analysis, and a lifespan assay of K6001 yeast after giving a mitophagy inhibitor and activator were performed. RESULTS: IQ extended the replicative lifespans of the K6001 yeasts and the chronological lifespans of the YOM36 yeasts. Furthermore, the reactive nitrogen species (RNS) showed no change during the growth phase but significantly decreased in the stationary phase after treatment with IQ. The survival rates of the yeasts under oxidative- and thermal-stress conditions improved upon IQ treatment, and thermal stress was alleviated by the increasing superoxide dismutase (Sod) activity. Additionally, IQ decreased the ROS and MDA of the yeast while increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes. However, it could not prolong the replicative lifespans of Deltasod1, Deltasod2, Deltagpx, Deltacat, Deltaskn7, and Deltauth1 of K6001. IQ significantly increased autophagy and mitophagy induction, the presence of free green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the cytoplasm, and ubiquitination in the mitochondria of the YOM38 yeasts at the protein level. IQ did not prolong the replicative lifespans of Deltaatg2 and Deltaatg32 of K6001. Moreover, IQ treatment led to a decrease in Sch9 at the protein level and an increase in the nuclear translocation of Rim15 and Msn2. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that the Sch9/Rim15/Msn signaling pathway, as well as antioxidative stress, anti-thermal stress, and autophagy, were involved in the antiaging effects of IQ in the yeasts.
