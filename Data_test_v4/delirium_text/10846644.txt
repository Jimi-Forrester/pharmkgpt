10846644|a|Managing individuals with acute illness who are at high risk for alcohol withdrawal presents multiple challenges to the treatment teams caring for them. Following realization that management of this group was often characterized by severe withdrawal symptoms (delirium tremens, seizures and the need for leather restraints), a Task Force developed protocols to guide care. Its principal goal was to avoid cardiorespiratory and neurologic morbidities associated with severe withdrawal. The first 441 episodes of care treated after protocol implementation are described in this report. There were no instances of oversedation requiring pharmacological reversal or intubation, few individuals suffered seizures outside of the emergency department and the use of leather restraints declined dramatically. Outstanding issues arising from analysis include the necessity of subjecting the symptom severity instrument to rigorous psychometric study and reconsideration of the appropriateness of a symptom-triggered approach in treating this population. Our experience suggests that use of a nonprescriptive approach by educated and motivated nursing and medical staffs can reduce serious morbidity in this at-risk population.
