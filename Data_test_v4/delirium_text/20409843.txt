20409843|a|With the aging of the population, the incidence and prevalence of cognitive disorders are increasing. Blood pressure plays an important role in the pathogenesis or clinical progression of stroke, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. Data from different studies reveal that the uses of antihypertensive medications decrease the risk of dementia and cognitive dysfunction. Several studies also have demonstrated a relationship between hypotension, cognitive decline, and dementia. In this review we are trying to demonstrate the relationship between blood pressure and cognitive function and also the effect of antihypertensive medications on dementia and cognitive dysfunction.
