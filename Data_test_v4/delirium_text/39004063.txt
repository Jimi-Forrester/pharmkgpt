39004063|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of age-related cognitive decline. Recent studies have established a close relationship between mitophagy and the pathogenesis of AD. Various phytochemicals have shown promising therapeutic effects in mitigating the onset and progression of AD. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the typical features of mitophagy and the underlying mechanisms leading to its occurrence in AD, highlighting its significance in the disease's pathogenesis and progression. Additionally, we examine the therapeutic mechanisms of synthetic drugs that induce mitophagy in AD. Finally, we summarize recent advances in research on phytochemicals that regulate mitophagy in the treatment of AD, potentially guiding the development of new anti-AD drugs.
