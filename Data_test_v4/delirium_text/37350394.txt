37350394|a|Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal malignant proliferative disease. In recent years, with the use of all-trans retinoic acid to induce cancer cell differentiation in acute promyelocytic leukemia, and its advantages of high efficacy and low toxic side effects, tumor differentiation therapy has become a research hotspot; however, the mechanisms underlying its role remain to be fully established. Nod-like receptor family pyridine domain containing 3 (NLRP3) is the most extensively studied and well-characterized inflammasome, is involved in a variety of inflammation-related diseases, including cancer, and is a very attractive potential target for the study of novel therapeutic agents. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is a double-edged sword in tumor therapy, with evidence of protective anti-tumor and pro-tumor effects in different types of cancer. Whether the NLRP3 inflammasome promotes disease progression or exerts a protective anti-tumor effect in hematological malignancies remains contested. In the present study, the protective anti-tumor effects of NLRP3 on leukemia cells during their differentiation and maturation were investigated. It was found that the upregulation of NLRP3 expression induced using Phorbol 12-Myristate 13-Acetate played a role in promoting the differentiation and maturation of leukemia cells into monocytes/macrophages, and it was directly involved in the apoptosis of leukemia cells and the differentiation and maturation of CD11b+ cells. These results provide novel theoretical evidence for exploring the mechanism of differentiation therapy in leukemia and improves our understanding of the role of NLRP3 in hematologic tumors.
