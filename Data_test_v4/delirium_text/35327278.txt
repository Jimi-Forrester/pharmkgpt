35327278|a|This study examined the efficacy of curcumin (Cur) against lead (Pb)-induced oxidative damage, inflammation, and cholinergic dysfunction. Institute for Cancer Research (ICR) mice received Pb (II) acetate in drinking water (1%) with or without Cur via oral gavage. Blood and brain tissues were collected for investigation. Pb increased the inflammatory markers and oxidative parameters, which were ameliorated by Cur administration. Cur treatment also improved memory loss, learning deficit, and cholinergic dysfunction via elevating acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzymatic activity and protein expression. In silico molecular docking supported the results; Cur had a potent binding affinity for AChE receptors, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), phosphorylations of IkappaB kinase (IKK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38). According to the chemical absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profile, Cur could serve as a potential candidate for Pb detoxication substance via exerting antioxidant activity. Taken together, our results suggest that Cur is a natural compound that could be used for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders via suppressing lead-induced neurotoxicity.
