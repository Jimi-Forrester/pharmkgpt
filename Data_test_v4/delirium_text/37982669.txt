37982669|t|Proteomic Analysis of the Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP): GDF-15, IGFBP-2, and Cystatin-C Are Associated with Multiple Aging Traits.
37982669|a|Cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging, results in a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) with an increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and proteases. Evidence from non-human models demonstrates that SASP contributes to tissue dysfunction and pathological effects of aging. However, there are relatively few human studies on the relationship between SASP and aging-related health outcomes. Proteins from the SASP Atlas were measured in plasma using aptamer-based proteomics (SomaLogic). Regression models were used to identify SASP protein associations with aging-related traits representing multiple aspects of physiology in 1,201 participants from two human cohort studies (BLSA/GESTALT and InCHIANTI). Traits examined were fasting glucose, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, alkaline phosphatase, blood urea nitrogen, albumin, red blood cell distribution width, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, gait speed and grip strength. Study results were combined with fixed-effect inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis. In the meta-analysis, 28 of 77 SASP proteins were significantly associated with age. Of the 28 age-associated SASP proteins, 18 were significantly associated with one or more clinical traits, and seven SASP proteins were significantly associated with three or more traits. Growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2), and Cystatin-C showed significant associations with inflammatory markers and measures of physical function (grip strength or gait speed). These results support the relevance of SASP proteins to human aging, identify specific traits that are potentially impacted by SASP, and prioritize specific SASP proteins for their utility as biomarkers of human aging.
