This article describes the most common and impactful dietary regimens for commonly encountered neurological disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Plant-based, low-fat, high-fiber diets, rich in antioxidants and other lifestyle interventions may reduce the burden and disability of common neurological disorders. The ketogenic diet, the diet of choice for the treatment of refractory epilepsy, is such an example. Diverse neurological disorders demonstrate several common pathophysiological mechanisms including increased oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and disrupted metabolism. Dietary interventions can potentially influence these pathophysiological processes and thus favorably alter clinical outcomes. Adequate dietary choices should be considered as part of a continuum of healthy lifestyle choices.
