36362220|a|Numerous studies have shown that microglia are capable of producing a wide range of chemokines to promote inflammatory processes within the central nervous system (CNS). These cells share many phenotypical and functional characteristics with macrophages, suggesting that microglia participate in innate immune responses in the brain. Neuroinflammation induces neurometabolic alterations and increases in energy consumption. Microglia may constitute an important therapeutic target in neuroinflammation. Recent research has attempted to clarify the role of Ghre signaling in microglia on the regulation of energy balance, obesity, neuroinflammation and the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases. These studies strongly suggest that Ghre modulates microglia activity and thus affects the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. This review aims to summarize what is known from the current literature on the way in which Ghre modulates microglial activity during neuroinflammation and their impact on neurometabolic alterations in neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the role of Ghre in microglial activation/inhibition regulation could provide promising strategies for downregulating neuroinflammation and consequently for diminishing negative neurological outcomes.
