39611402|a|INTRODUCTION: Non-pharmacological distraction using video games (VG) is still under-explored in pediatric surgical patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted this randomized controlled study of 150 children, aged 4-12 years, scheduled for elective surgery in a tertiary care hospital to estimate the distractive effect of VG on immediate preoperative anxiety in children. In the intervention group (I), playing with VG was encouraged till anesthetic induction. The control group (C) received usual care with verbal reassurance. Modified Yale preoperative anxiety scale (mYPAS) score and presence of anxiety (mYPAS >30) were noted in the preoperative area (T1), at parental separation (T2), and anesthetic induction (T3). Parental separation anxiety score (PSAS) >3 was considered unacceptable parental separation. We used the Mann-Whitney test and t-test to find significance of intergroup mean difference of anxiety and logistic regression to find risk factors for immediate preoperative anxiety. RESULTS: The mean m-YPAS (+-SD) scores at T1 and T2 were 38 (+-10.9) and 52.2 (+-18.7) in group C and 46.5 (+-13.5) and 33 (IQR: 28.3-65.5) in group I, respectively. The incidence of anxiety at T2 was higher in group C (81.3%) than in group I (59%). More children in group I (53/75) had acceptable separation than in group C (32/75) (P = 0.001). VG led to a 2.32 times lower risk of anxiety at T2 (P = 0.036). In children with acceptable separation, the incidence of anxiety was lower in group I (59%) than in group C (87%). CONCLUSION: VG-based distraction effectively reduced preoperative anxiety in children undergoing elective surgeries.
