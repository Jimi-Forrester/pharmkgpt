31878903|a|For a long time the attention given to the hip fracture patient group was minor and without any certain consideration to their frailty. To improve the care for these patients Skane University Hospital in Lund has during the past 19 years worked actively with developing the care. This paper aims to describe what impact the care process development has had on functional outcome and mortality, as well as to analyze the impact of comorbidity and fracture type. METHODS: Patients older than 50 years with non-pathological cervical and trochanteric hip fracture admitted between Jan 1st 1999 and Dec 31st 2017 were included and data was retrieved from the National Quality Register for hip fracture patients, RIKSHOFT. Variables regarding patient characteristics, fracture type, operation method, lead-times and outcome were analyzed. For comparison Fischer's exact test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used for the categorical data and Pearson correlation coefficient for the continuous. To further analyze the effect over time a linear regression model was used. RESULTS: A total of 7827 patients were included. A significant shift in the overall morbidity was seen, with an increase in patients of higher ASA grade. No correlation was seen between outcome and the care process development. The mortality rate for the group as a whole the mortality rate had decreased over time. The total length of stay had decreased significantly over time. There was no statistically significant change in mortality rate over time when relating it to time-to-surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Although the patients display a higher morbidity over time, the mortality rate has not changed significantly, which might indicate an effect of the care process development. The care process development does not seem to impact on outcome as much as other factors. This study supports the possibility to create a more specific algorithm for hip fracture patients, taking specific subgroups into consideration.
