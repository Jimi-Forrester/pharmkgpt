38138213|t|The Management and Diagnosis of Anti-NMDA Receptor Autoimmune Encephalitis in Pregnant Women: A Case Report and Literature Review.
38138213|a|Rationale: Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is a form of autoimmune synaptic encephalitis, often mediated by neuronal surface antibodies. Clinically, it manifests through a diverse range of neurological and psychiatric symptoms, primarily affecting young women with ovarian teratoma, which is rare in pregnant women. Patient concerns: We report a case of a 35-year-old multiparous pregnant patient at 38 weeks of gestation presented to the emergency room with seizure, psychiatric symptoms like delirious speech with mystical visual and auditory hallucinations, bradylalia, and retrograde amnesia. Diagnosis: The diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis with anti-NMDA antibodies was concluded by considering the lumbar puncture results, brain imaging, and the patient's persistent symptoms. Outcomes: This case is noteworthy for its rarity and the symptoms' breadth. At 38 weeks of gestation, the patient underwent a cesarean section, resulting in excellent maternal recovery observed during the 6-month follow-up and good neonatal adaptation. Lessons: Our goals include raising awareness about this condition and emphasizing the significance of early diagnosis. This encephalitis is treatable and potentially reversible, underscoring the importance of prompt identification.
