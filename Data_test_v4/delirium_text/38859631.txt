38859631|a|Prior research indicates that APOE-e4 allele(s) and working without compensation may be independently associated with risk for cognitive decline. This study investigated whether the interaction of type of work (paid versus unpaid) and presence of APOE-e4 allele(s) was associated with cognitive dysfunction in women in mid- and late-life. Participants included 340 females (mean age = 74.7 years) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. A two-way ANOVA to assess the simple main effects of type of work and APOE-e4 allele status on cognition as well as their interaction was performed. A two-way ANCOVA including age, education, and marital status as covariates was also conducted. The presence of one or two APOE-e4 allele(s) and unpaid work was associated with greater cognitive dysfunction. A significant interaction effect revealed engagement in paid work, regardless of the presence of APOE-e4 allele(s), was associated with better cognitive functioning. Consistent with prior literature, women who engage in unpaid forms of labor for the majority of their life may be at higher risk for cognitive decline, regardless of presence of APOE-e4 allele(s). Further research is needed to identify the factors related to unpaid labor that may increase risk for cognitive dysfunction.
