31668517|t|Identifying Anti-prion Chemical Compounds Using a Newly Established Yeast High-Throughput Screening System.
31668517|a|Prion-like protein aggregation underlies the pathology of a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases in humans, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. At present, few high-throughput screening (HTS) systems are available for anti-prion small-molecule identification. Here we describe an innovative phenotypic HTS system in yeast that allows for efficient identification of chemical compounds that eliminate the yeast prion [SWI+]. We show that some identified anti-[SWI+] compounds can destabilize other non-[SWI+] prions, and their antagonizing effects can be prion- and/or variant specific. Intriguingly, among the identified hits are several previously identified anti-PrPSc compounds and a couple of US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs for AD treatment, validating the efficacy of this HTS system. Moreover, a few hits can reduce proteotoxicity induced by expression of several pathogenic mammalian proteins. Thus, we have established a useful HTS system for identifying compounds that can potentially antagonize prionization and human proteinopathies.
