33260655|t|Chronic BACE-1 Inhibitor Administration in TASTPM Mice (APP KM670/671NL and PSEN1 M146V Mutation): An EEG Study.
33260655|a|OBJECTIVE: In this exploratory study, we tested whether electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms may reflect the effects of a chronic administration (4 weeks) of an anti-amyloid beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 inhibitor (BACE-1; ER-901356; Eisai Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in TASTPM (double mutation in APP KM670/671NL and PSEN1 M146V) producing Alzheimer's disease (AD) amyloid neuropathology as compared to wild type (WT) mice. METHODS: Ongoing EEG rhythms were recorded from a bipolar frontoparietal and two monopolar frontomedial (prelimbic) and hippocampal channels in 11 WT Vehicle, 10 WT BACE-1, 10 TASTPM Vehicle, and 11 TASTPM BACE-1 mice (males; aged 8/9 months old at the beginning of treatment). Normalized EEG power (density) was compared between the first day (Day 0) and after 4 weeks (Week 4) of the BACE-1 inhibitor (10 mg/Kg) or vehicle administration in the 4 mouse groups. Frequency and magnitude of individual EEG delta and theta frequency peaks (IDF and ITF) were considered during animal conditions of behaviorally passive and active wakefulness. Cognitive status was not tested. RESULTS: Compared with the WT group, the TASTPM group generally showed a significantly lower reactivity in frontoparietal ITF power during the active over the passive condition (p < 0.05). Notably, there was no other statistically significant effect (e.g., additional electrodes, recording time, and BACE-1 inhibitor). CONCLUSIONS: The above EEG biomarkers reflected differences between the WT and TASTPM groups, but no BACE-1 inhibitor effect. The results suggest an enhanced experimental design with the use of younger mice, longer drug administrations, an effective control drug, and neuropathological amyloid markers.
