21624886|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive and functional decline in dementia generally impairs performance of basic care activities. Staff assistance during these activities frequently results in confusion, anxiety, and distress, expressed through resistance to care (RTC). METHODS: A single-system ABA withdrawal design (n = 1) evaluated the effect of video-simulated presence (VSP) for decreasing RTC and increasing participation. A family member pre-recorded videos for use during episodes of RTC, in which the family member spoke directly to the participant to encourage participation. RESULTS: Introduction of the VSP significantly reduced RTC during the basic care tasks of feeding and talking medication. This effect was reversed when the intervention was withdrawn. Participation increased following VSP, demonstrating clear trends toward clinical significance. CONCLUSIONS: This person-centered intervention, based on VSP of a family member, provides encouraging results for reducing RTC and increasing participation of adults with dementia in basic care tasks.
