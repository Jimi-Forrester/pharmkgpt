8339940|a|Gradually progressive memory loss is the keystone of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Other diagnostic signs include deterioration of language and perception, judgment losses, and behavioral problems such as agitation and paranoia. The clock drawing test is a simple in-office measure of spatial orientation. CT or MRI is recommended to rule out vascular injury; blood tests can exclude other types of dementia. Serial mental status exams can document disease progression. Drug therapy is appropriate for managing mental symptoms, including early depression and anxiety. Some patients may derive benefit from tacrine. Management must also include education and support of the AD patient's caregivers.
