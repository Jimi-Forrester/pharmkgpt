29633471|a|A proper equilibrium of post-translational protein modifications is essential for normal cell physiology, and alteration in these processes is key in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Recently, for instance, alteration in protein SUMOylation has been linked to amyloid pathology. In this work, we aimed to elucidate the role of protein SUMOylation during aging and increased amyloid burden in vivo using a His6 -HA-SUMO1 knock-in mouse in the 5XFAD model of Alzheimer's disease. Interestingly, we did not observe any alteration in the levels of SUMO1-conjugation related to Alzheimer's disease. SUMO1 conjugates remained localized to neuronal nuclei upon increased amyloid burden and during aging and were not detected in amyloid plaques. Surprisingly however, we observed age-related alterations in global levels of SUMO1 conjugation and at the level of individual substrates using quantitative proteomic analysis. The identified SUMO1 candidate substrates are dominantly nuclear proteins, mainly involved in RNA processing. Our findings open novel directions of research for studying a functional link between SUMOylation and its role in guarding nuclear functions during aging.
