6120034|a|Lorazepam 0.05 mg X kg-1 and diazepam 0.1 mg X kg-1 administered intravenously were compared as sedatives for 42 patients undergoing Caesarean Section under epidural anaesthesia. After receiving the drug, 15 per cent of the diazepam patients and 32 per cent of the lorazepam patients were still agitated. Ten per cent of the diazepam patients and 36 per cent of the lorazepam patients had severe symptoms of delirium. These included hallucinations, confusion, agitation, restlessness, inappropriate weeping and repetitive hand movements. Memory impairment was greater with lorazepam. Thirty-five per cent of the diazepam patients had pain at the injection site. None of the lorazepam patients had such pain. Respiratory rate, heart rate and mean blood pressure did not change significantly in either group. Half the patients who had been given lorazepam had side effects that were bothersome enough to cause them to complain the following day. Lorazepam and diazepam were both unsatisfactory as sedatives for patients having Caesarean Section.
