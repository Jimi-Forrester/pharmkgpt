35579786|t|Knowledge, Attitudes, and Cultural Beliefs about Healthy Aging and Alzheimer's Disease among Older Chinese Americans in New York City.
35579786|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Related Dementias (ADRD) are a growing concern across the globe. Unfortunately, racial/ethnic minorities in the United States (U.S.), such as Chinese Americans, have lower ADRD knowledge, and these individuals are less likely to be targeted and engaged in recommended dementia prevention and care. The objective of this study is to examine knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about healthy aging and ADRD among older Chinese Americans living in New York City. Chinese Americans with very low English proficiency were recruited from a senior center in New York City. Accordingly, surveys were translated and focus groups were conducted in Mandarin or Cantonese. Questionnaires assessed demographic and health characteristics. Focus groups followed an open-ended protocol which was guided by the published literature. Focus group discussions were audio recorded, transcribed, and translated to English for qualitative analysis. Analysis of qualitative data proceeded according to the constant comparative method. A total of 18 participants were recruited. Average age of participants was 76.4 years and participants were 72.2% female. The majority were married (72.2%). Participants reported chronic conditions, including diabetes (38.9%) and dyslipidemia (22.2%). Participants commonly reported that their health limited their ability to accomplish things (66.7%) and achieve things (66.7%). While 16.7% of participants reported no bodily pain, slight pain was reported by 44.4%, moderate pain by 33.3%, and extreme pain by 5.6%. Qualitative analysis revealed several prominent themes, including: (1) perceptions about normal aging; (2) fears about loneliness and cognitive decline; (3) understanding of healthy aging; (4) cultural influences on aging; and (5) perceptions of ADRD. Results from this study highlight a set of cultural beliefs about healthy aging as well as knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs pertaining to ADRD. These results may inform opportunities for increasing healthy aging practices and knowledge about dementia among underserved older Chinese Americans.
