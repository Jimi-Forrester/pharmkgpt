32687230|a|The mitochondria-targeting drugs can be conventionally divided into the following groups: those compensating for the energy deficit involved in neurodegeneration, including stimulants of mitochondrial bioenergetics and activators of mitochondrial biogenesis; and neuroprotectors, that are compounds increasing the resistance of mitochondria to opening of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pores. Although compensating for the energy deficit and inhibition of MPT are obvious targets for drugs used in the very early stages of Alzheimer-like pathology, but their use as the monotherapy for patients with severe symptoms is unlikely to be sufficiently effective. It would be optimal to combine targets that would provide the cognitive-stimulating, the neuroprotective effects and the ability to affect specific disease-forming mechanisms. In the design of such drugs, assessment of their potential mitochondrial-targeted effects is of particular importance. The possibility of targeted drug design for simultaneous action on mitochondrial and neurotransmitter's receptors targets is, in particularly, based on the known interplay of various cellular pathways and the presence of common structural components. Of particular interest is directed search for multitarget drugs that would act simultaneously on mitochondrial calcium-dependent functions, the targets (receptors, enzymes, etc.) facilitating neurotransmission, and the molecular targets related to the action of so-called disease-modifying factors, in particular, the formation and overcoming of the toxicity of beta-amyloid or hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The examples of such approaches realized on the level of preclinical and clinical trials are presented below.
