We examined whether resting metabolic rate, the largest component of daily energy expenditure, is elevated in Alzheimer's patients compared with healthy older controls. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: General Clinical Research Center and Baltimore VA Medical Center. PATIENTS: Twenty-five noninstitutionalized demented patients (74 +/- 8 years; mean +/- SD) with a wide range of Mini-Mental Examination scores (1 to 20) and 73 healthy older individuals (69 +/- 7 years). MEASUREMENTS: Resting metabolic rate was measured by indirect calorimetry, fat-free mass and fat mass by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and daily energy intake by food diaries. RESULTS: No differences in fat-free mass and fat mass were noted between Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy older controls. Resting metabolic rate was similar in Alzheimer's disease patients (5446 +/- 962 kJ/day) and healthy older individuals (5647 +/- 887 kJ/day). These results persisted when resting metabolic rate was statistically adjusted for differences in body composition and age. CONCLUSION: These results provide no evidence for an elevation in resting energy requirements in noninstitutionalized demented patients.
