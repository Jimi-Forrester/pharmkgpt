34224050|t|A Novel Role of Nogo Proteins: Regulating Macrophages in Inflammatory Disease.
34224050|a|Nogo proteins, also known as Reticulon-4, have been identified as myelin-derived inhibitors of neurite outgrowth in the central nervous system (CNS). There are three Nogo variants, Nogo-A, Nogo-B and Nogo-C. Recent studies have shown that Nogo-A/B is abundant in macrophages and may have a wider effect on inflammation. In this review, we focus mainly on the possible roles of Nogo-A/B on polarization and recruitment of macrophages and their involvement in a variety of inflammatory diseases. We then discuss the Nogo receptor1 (NgR1), a common receptor for Nogo proteins that is also abundant in microglia/macrophage in the CNS. Interaction of Nogo and NgR1 in microglia/macrophage may affect the adhesion and polarization of macrophages that are involved in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. Overall, this review provides insights into the roles of Nogo proteins in regulating macrophage functions and suggests that, potentially, Nogo proteins maybe a new target in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
