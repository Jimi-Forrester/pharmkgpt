38070309|t|Nurse-led ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block: A randomised controlled trial of two different patient flow systems in an emergency department.
38070309|a|INTRODUCTION: Elderly with hip fractures present complex challenges. Effective pain management is crucial for recovery and quality of life. However, pain control can be difficult and requires customized care. METHODS: We conducted an unblinded, randomised controlled trial investigating the effects of ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block in patients with hip fracture performed by specially trained nurses (Group Nurse) compared to anaesthesiologists (Group Anaesthesiologist). The hypothesis was that a single shot ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block would result in a total summarized lower dynamic numeric rating scale score for pain intensity during the first 120 min after admission for patients in Group Nurse compared to Group Anaesthesiologist measured in five timepoints. The primary outcome was measured by a cumulative numeric rating scale score for dynamic pain (with flexion of the hip until maximum 30  from bed surface) during the first 120 min after admission to the emergency department. RESULTS: From February 2020 to June 2021, 263 patients were screened, of which 42 (16.0%) consented and were randomly allocated; 21 in each arm. The primary outcome was not different between groups (p = 0.24), and displayed no substantial superiority of specially trained nurses over anaesthesiologist. No complications or adverse effects were observed in either group. The use of systemic analgesics and the development of delirium was similar between the two groups. In the Nurse Group, patients were administered their ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block earlier. CONCLUSION: Our study did not demonstrate a statistically significant beneficial effect of specially trained nurses over anaesthesiologist on cumulative pain in performing ultrasound-guided femoral nerve blocks, while no side-effects/complications or adverse effects were observed in either group. CLINICALTRIAL: The trial was registered on October 31, 2019 at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04145752).
