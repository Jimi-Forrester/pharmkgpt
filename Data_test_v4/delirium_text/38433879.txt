38433879|t|A Pilot Study to Evaluate a New Hep-GRP Care Pathway to Improve Outcomes Among Canadian Older Adults with Liver Cirrhosis.
38433879|a|Background: Older adults with cirrhosis have complex medical needs that are not satisfied by organ specific management. Interdisciplinary approach may mitigate comorbidity and improve patient satisfaction. Methods: A pilot study consisted of dual specialist interdisciplinary referral pathway and mixed virtual care delivery model are prospectively evaluated in older adults (65 years and older) with cirrhosis during the COVID-19 pandemic between September and December 2022. Participant attitudes towards telemedicine were surveyed. Results: 68 participants with cirrhosis were consecutively assessed by hepatology. The mean age was 73 years. 39 (57%) screened positive for one or more geriatric syndrome(s). Comprehensive geriatric assessments were conducted via telemedicine in 18 participants, with additional referrals to physiotherapy and nutritional education. Compared to a historic cohort matched for age, sex, and Child-Pugh class, acute health service utilization measured by ER visits among those received dual specialist interdisciplinary consultation were lowered by 1.11 per patient at three-month follow up period (p = .0006, 95% CI 0.47-1.74). Majority participants (87.6%) preferred telemedicine or mixed method visits. Conclusion: An interdisciplinary approach to older adults with cirrhosis will likely be beneficial, and routine screening for geriatric syndrome may lead to reduced acute health-care utilization in the short term. Telemedicine and virtual screening tools in seniors should be fully explored to improve access to care.
