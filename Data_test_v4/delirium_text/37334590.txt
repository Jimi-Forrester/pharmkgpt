37334590|a|BACKGROUND: Gender, APOE e4 status and age have different effects on brain amyloid deposition in patients with mild cognitively impaired (MCI). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of genderxAPOE e4 status interaction on Abeta deposition in the brains of individuals with MCI in different age groups by PET scanning. METHODS: 204 individuals with MCI were classified into younger or older groups based on whether they were under or over 65 years of age. APOE genotyping, structural MRI, amyloid PET scans, and neuropsychological tests were performed. The effect of genderxAPOE e4 status interaction on Abeta deposition was assessed in different age groups. RESULTS: APOE e4 carriers had higher amyloid deposition than noncarriers in the whole group. Females with MCI had more amyloid deposition in the medial temporal lobe than males in the whole cohort and younger group. Older individuals with MCI had higher amyloid deposition than younger individuals. In stratified analysis by age, female APOE e4 carriers had significantly increased amyloid deposition compared to their male counterparts only in the medial temporal lobe in the younger group. Amyloid deposition was increased in female APOE e4 carriers compared to noncarriers in the younger group, whereas higher amyloid deposition was observed in male APOE e4 carriers in the older group. CONCLUSION: Women in the younger group with MCI who were APOE e4 carriers had more amyloid deposition in the brain, while men in the older group with MCI who were APOE e4 carriers had higher amyloid deposition.
