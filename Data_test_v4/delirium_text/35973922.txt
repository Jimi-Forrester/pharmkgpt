35973922|t|Readmission and In-Hospital Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Dementia.
35973922|a|BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The prevalence of dementia and aortic stenosis (AS) increases with each decade of age. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a definitive treatment for AS, but there are scarce data on morbidity, mortality, and readmission risk after TAVR in patients with dementia. METHODS/MATERIALS: We identified all admissions for TAVR in patients with AS in the National Readmissions Database in 2017-2018 and stratified them according to the presence or absence of a secondary diagnosis of dementia. Inpatient outcomes were compared using logistic regression. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to compare 30-, 60-, and 90-day readmissions. RESULTS: A total of 48,923 index hospitalizations for TAVR were identified, of which 2192 (4.5 %) had a secondary diagnosis of dementia. Presence of dementia was associated with higher odds of delirium, pacemaker placement, acute kidney injury, and fall in hospital. The hazard of 30-day readmission was not significantly different between patients with and without dementia, but patients with dementia experienced a higher hazard of 60-day readmission (HR 1.15, 95 % CI 1.03-1.26, p = 0.011) in the unadjusted model and higher hazard of 90-day readmission in both unadjusted (HR 1.18, 95 % CI 1.08-1.30, p < 0.001) and adjusted models (aHR 1.14, 95 % CI 1.04-1.25, p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with dementia who undergo TAVR are at higher risk of in-hospital adverse outcomes and 60- and 90-day readmissions compared with patients without dementia. These estimates should be integrated into shared decision-making discussions with patients and families.
