31657806|t|[Delirium: a reappraisal of clinical characteristics and treatment perspectives after the transition from the DSM-IV to the DSM-5].
31657806|a|The aim of this commentary is to discuss some clinical characteristics and treatment perspectives of delirium in the light of transition from the DSM-IV to the DSM-5. Such a transient dysfunction of cerebral metabolism, essentially reversible, presents an acute or subacute onset, and manifests itself clinically through a wide range of neuropsychiatric abnormalities. Delirium is a predictor of cognitive decline and is associated with a greater mortality. First line treatment of delirium is represented by haloperidol though atypical antipsychotics effectiveness and tolerability are increasingly evident.
