38128506|a|INTRODUCTION: Epidemiological data indicate that neurodegenerative diseases show a high prevalence with a progressive increasing trend, especially in aging populations, as is the case in rural areas. The objective of this study was to assess the quantitative impact of neurodegenerative diseases in rural areas of the Spanish-Portuguese border region and to describe the epidemiological profile of the most prevalent disorders in one of the most depopulated and aged regions of Europe. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was designed to estimate the prevalence of subjects diagnosed with the most common neurodegenerative disorders: dementia (Alzheimer's disease & other dementias), Parkinson's disease & Parkinsonism and Multiple sclerosis in the Spanish-Portuguese cross-border border region in 2020. It includes Braganca and Guarda Districts (Portugal), and Salamanca (Castilla y Leon, Spain). RESULTS: Neurodegenerative diseases accounted for 1.85% in the Spanish-Portuguese cross-border region in 2020; a total of 5,819 records: 987 (prevalence, 2.51%) were reported in Salamanca (Spain); 2,332 (prevalence, 1.87%) in Braganca; and 2,500 (prevalence, 1.66%) in Guarda. Female population suffered from them in higher proportion (2.35% vs. 1.32%). Dementia represented 1.19% (3,744), Parkinson's disease & Parkinsonism 0.58% (1,823) and Multiple sclerosis 0.08% (252). These disorders impacted older age groups. In the rural border region of Spain, 1 out of 4 cases were institutionalized. CONCLUSION: The findings reveal the health impact of neurodegenerative diseases in the Spanish-Portuguese cross-border region. The epidemiological data emphasizes the region's circumstances and highlights research priorities. Intervention strategies must be implemented in the region to ensure quality healthcare in rural areas.
