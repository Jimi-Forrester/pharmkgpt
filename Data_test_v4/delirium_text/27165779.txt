27165779|t|Science Signaling Podcast for 10 May 2016: PKCalpha in Alzheimer's disease.
27165779|a|This Podcast features an interview with Alexandra Newton and Rudolph Tanzi, authors of a Research Article that appears in the 10 May 2016 issue of Science Signaling, about activating mutations in protein kinase Calpha that may promote the type of neural defects that characterize Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes cognitive loss and, eventually, death. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta), synaptic depression, and synaptic degeneration. Alfonso et al found activating mutations in the gene encoding protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha) in some families with inherited Alzheimer's disease. Loss of PKCalpha function prevented Abeta-induced synaptic depression in brain tissue from mice, suggesting that activated forms of PKCalpha may contribute to Alzheimer's disease in some patients.Listen to Podcast.
