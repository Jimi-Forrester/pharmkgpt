24974339|t|Tryptophanol-derived oxazolopiperidone lactams: identification of a hit compound as NMDA receptor antagonist.
24974339|a|N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) exacerbated activation leads to neuron death through a phenomenon called excitotoxicity. These receptors are implicated in several neurological diseases (e.g., Alzheimer and Parkinson) and thus represent an important therapeutic target. We herein describe the study of enantiopure tryptophanol-derived oxazolopiperidone lactams as NMDA receptor antagonists. The most active hit exhibited an IC50 of 63.4 muM in cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons thus being 1.5 fold more active than clinically approved NMDA antagonist amantadine (IC50=92 muM).
