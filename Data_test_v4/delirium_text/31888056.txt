31888056|t|CCL11 Differentially Affects Post-Stroke Brain Injury and Neuroregeneration in Mice Depending on Age.
31888056|a|CCL11 has recently been shown to differentially affect cell survival under various pathological conditions including stroke. Indeed, CCL11 promotes neuroregeneration in neonatal stroke mice. The impact of CCL11 on the adult ischemic brain, however, remains elusive. We therefore studied the effect of ectopic CCL11 on both adolescent (six-week) and adult (six-month) C57BL6 mice exposed to stroke. Intraperitoneal application of CCL11 significantly aggravated acute brain injury in adult mice but not in adolescent mice. Likewise, post-stroke neurological recovery after four weeks was significantly impaired in adult mice whilst CCL11 was present. On the contrary, CCL11 stimulated gliogenesis and neurogenesis in adolescent mice. Flow cytometry analysis of blood and brain samples revealed a modification of inflammation by CCL11 at subacute stages of the disease. In adolescent mice, CCL11 enhances microglial cell, B and T lymphocyte migration towards the brain, whereas only the number of B lymphocytes is increased in the adult brain. Finally, the CCL11 inhibitor SB297006 significantly reversed the aforementioned effects. Our study, for the first time, demonstrates CCL11 to be a key player in mediating secondary cell injury under stroke conditions. Interfering with this pathway, as shown for SB297006, might thus be an interesting approach for future stroke treatment paradigms.
