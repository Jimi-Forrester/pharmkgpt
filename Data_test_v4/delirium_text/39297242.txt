39297242|t|Bullous pemphigoid burden of disease, management and unmet therapeutic needs.
39297242|a|Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune blistering disease that can have a profound negative impact on quality of life. BP most often affects the elderly, a population with a high medical burden and special safety concerns. In this review, we outline the BP disease course, diagnosis, epidemiology and comorbidities, and describe tools commonly used to assess BP disease activity and severity and the impact of BP on health-related quality of life. We also outline biologic treatments currently under investigation for the treatment of BP and highlight the importance of considering safety when treating elderly patients.
