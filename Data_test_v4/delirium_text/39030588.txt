39030588|t|Mediation of depressive symptoms in the association between blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio and cognition among middle-aged and elderly adults: evidence from a national longitudinal cohort study.
39030588|a|BACKGROUND: The relationships between BUNCr (blood urea nitrogen and creatinine ratio) and cognitive function, as well as depressive symptoms, remain unclear. We aim to investigate the association between BUNCr and cognition, as well as depressive symptoms, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these relationships. METHODS: We utilized data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) from 2015 to 2020. Cognitive function was assessed using the Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status (TICS) scale, while depressive symptoms were assessed using the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10). We employed multivariate linear regression models to examine the association between BUNCr and cognitive function, as well as depressive symptoms. Additionally, causal mediation analysis was conducted to identify potential mediation effects of depressive symptoms between BUNCr and cognition. RESULTS: We observed a negative association between BUNCr and cognitive function (coefficient: -0.192; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.326 ~ -0.059) and a positive relationship between BUNCr and depressive symptoms (coefficient: 0.145; 95% CI: 0.006 ~ 0.285). In addition, the causal mediation analysis revealed that depressive symptoms (proportion mediated: 7.0%) significantly mediated the association between BUNCr and cognition. CONCLUSION: Our study has unveiled that BUNCr is inversely associated with cognitive function and positively linked to depressive symptoms. Moreover, we found that depressive symptoms significantly mediated the association between BUNCr and cognition. These findings provide new evidence and insights for the prevention and management of cognitive function and dementia.
