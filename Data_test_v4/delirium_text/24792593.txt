24792593|a|The aging society challenges anaesthesiologists with a growing number of patients with dementia. These and their relatives worry about an aggravation of an already existing dementia or even the postoperative evocation of one. Common volatile anaesthetics and propofol are suspected to increase dementia - associated protein tau and amyloid-betalevels in the brain. Perioperative complications such as cognitive dysfunction and delirium occur more frequently in dementia patients. For anaesthesiologists, it seems prudent toassess the grade of dementia in the elderly to adjust anaesthesia drug doses and monitoring intra- and postoperatively. Pharmacological interactions with antidementic andneuroleptic current medications affectanaesthetic and analgesic effects.In dementia, perioperative malfunction of cognition, memory, attention, information processing, communication and social interaction abilities is of profound influence on the perioperative management.This review mentions actual knowledge about dementia forms and symptoms in brief. Recommendations for the anaesthesia care are given in more detail.
