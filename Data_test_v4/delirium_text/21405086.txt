21405086|a|Poor blood-brain barrier penetration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been blamed for the failure of the selective amyloid lowering agent (SALA) R-flurbiprofen in phase 3 clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD). NO-donor NSAIDs (NO-NSAIDs) provide an alternative, gastric-sparing approach to NSAID SALAs, which may improve bioavailability. NSAID analogues were studied for anti-inflammatory activity and for SALA activity in N2a neuronal cells transfected with human amyloid precursor protein (APP). Flurbiprofen (1) analogues were obtained with enhanced anti-inflammatory and antiamyloidogenic properties compared to 1, however, esterification led to elevated Abeta(1-42) levels. Hybrid nitrate prodrugs possessed superior anti-inflammatory activity and reduced toxicity relative to the parent NSAIDs, including clinical candidate CHF5074. Although hybrid nitrates elevated Abeta(1-42) at higher concentration, SALA activity was observed at low concentrations (<=1 muM): both Abeta(1-42) and the ratio of Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40) were lowered. This biphasic SALA activity was attributed to the intact nitrate drug. For several compounds, the selective modulation of amyloidogenesis was tested using an immunoprecipitation MALDI-TOF approach. These data support the development of NO-NSAIDs as an alternative approach toward a clinically useful SALA.
