35029699|a|BACKGROUND: In orthogeriatric centers, postoperative, multiprofessional comprehensive treatment has proven to be an effective component in the convalescence of geriatric patients. The aim of the treatment is to minimize the perioperative risk and safely achieve individual rehabilitation goals in the acute inpatient stay. To meet the needs of geriatric patients, in addition to changes in the spatial division and design, primarily adjustments to the team composition and the procedural processes are required. THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES: An interdisciplinary and multiprofessional team (orthopedics/traumatology, geriatrics, nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, social services, psychology, speech therapy, ...) uses geriatric assessments in regular team meetings to collect and analyze the current rehabilitation status of patients; ICF-based goals are formulated and the therapy is adapted to individual needs. Here, too, the focus is on recording the individual risk (comorbidities, mental status, polypharmacy, malnutrition, fragility) and avoiding preventable complications. Multiprofessional strategies for avoiding or treating postoperative delirium are particularly important. In addition, maintaining patients' autonomy is the top priority, so that they can be released from the acute inpatient stay strengthened for follow-up treatment or their home environment. The establishment of orthogeriatric comanagement in acute inpatient facilities is an important component in the process chain, from which many geriatric patients benefit in the context of postoperative recovery.
