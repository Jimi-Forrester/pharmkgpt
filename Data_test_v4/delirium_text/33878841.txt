33878841|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) and radionuclide salivagram findings in chronic brain-injured patients with dysphagia. METHODS: Medical records of chronic brain-injured patients who underwent radionuclide salivagram and VFSS were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups according to salivagram findings. Differences in patient characteristics and clinical factors, including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Modified Barthel Index (MBI), Functional Ambulatory Category (FAC), feeding method, tracheostomy state, and VFSS findings between the two groups were investigated. RESULTS: A total of 124 patients were included in this study. There were no significant differences in MMSE, MBI, FAC, feeding method, and presence of tracheostomy between the two groups. However, the incidence of aspiration pneumonia history was significantly higher in the positive salivagram group. The Functional Dysphagia Scale (FDS) was significantly associated with positive salivagram findings, especially in the pharyngeal phase. A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that laryngeal elevation and epiglottic closure was statistically significant FDS parameter in predicting salivary aspiration on a salivagram (odds ratio=1.100; 95% confidence interval, 1.017-1.190; p=0.018). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of FDS in the pharyngeal phase showed that an optimum sensitivity and specificity of 55.1% and 65.4%, respectively, when the cut-off value was 39. CONCLUSION: In chronic brain-injured patients, inappropriate laryngeal elevation and epiglottic closure is predictive variable for salivary aspiration. Therefore, performing a radionuclide salivagram in patients with FDS of 39 or less in the pharyngeal phase for prevents aspiration pneumonia from salivary aspiration.
