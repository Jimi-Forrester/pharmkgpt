38501714|t|Mitochondrial Dysfunction of Peripheral Platelets as a Predictive Biomarker for Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Patients.
38501714|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between the preoperative Bioenergetic Health Index (BHI) of platelets and the occurrence of postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients. METHODS: Elderly patients scheduled for major abdominal surgery under general anesthesia were included. The presence of POD was assessed within the 3 days after surgery. Seahorse XF analysis and transmission electron microscopy were utilized to evaluate the mitochondrial metabolism and morphology of platelets. RESULTS: A total of 20 out of 162 participants developed POD. Participants with POD showed lower preoperative Mini-Mental State Examination scores and total protein levels, fewer educational years, longer surgery duration, higher mean platelet volume, and lower platelet BHI compared with those without POD. Damaged mitochondria with swollen appearance and distorted cristae was detected in platelets from participants with POD. Preoperative platelet BHI was independently associated with the occurrence of POD after adjusting for age, education, preoperative Mini-Mental State Examination score, preoperative mean platelet volume and total protein levels, surgical type and duration, and lymphocyte counts on the first postoperative day (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03-0.37, p < 0.001). The areas under the receiver operating curves for predicting POD were 0.83 (95% CI 0.76-0.88) for platelet BHI. It showed a sensitivity of 85.00% and specificity of 73.24%, with an optimal cutoff value of 1.61. Using a serial combination (mean platelet volume followed by BHI) yielded a sensitivity of 80.00% and specificity of 82.39%. INTERPRETATION: Preoperative platelet BHI was independently associated with the occurrence of POD in elderly patients and has the potential as a screening biomarker for POD risk. ANN NEUROL 2024.
