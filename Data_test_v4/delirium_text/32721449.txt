32721449|t|OUTBREAK of novel corona virus disease (COVID-19): Antecedence and aftermath.
32721449|a|Outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in mid of December 2019 and spread very rapidly across the globe within a month of its outbreak. Researchers all across the globe started working to find out its possible treatments. However, most of initiatives taken were based on various hypotheses and till date no successful treatments have been achieved. Some strategies adopted by China where existing antiviral therapy was initially used to treat COVID-19 have not given very successful results. Researchers from Thailand explored the use of combination of anti-influenza drugs such as Oseltamivir, Lopinavir and Ritonavir to treat it. In some cases, combination therapy of antiviral drugs with chloroquine showed better action against COVID-19. Some of the clinical studies showed very good effect of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19, however, they were not recommended due to serious clinical toxicity. In some cases, use of rho kinase inhibitor, fasudil was found very effective. In some of the countries, antibody-based therapies have proved fairly successful. The use of BCG vaccines came in light; however, they were not found successful due to lack of full-proof mechanistic studies. In Israel as well as in other developed countries, pluristems allogeneic placental expanded cell therapy has been found successful. Some phytochemicals and nutraceuticals have also been explored to treat it. In a recent report, the use of dexamethasone was found very effective in patients suffering from COVID-19. Its effect was most striking among patients on ventilator. The research for vaccines that can prevent the disease is still going on. In light of the dynamic trends, present review focuses on etiopathogenesis, factors associated with spreading of the virus, and possible strategies to treat this deadly infection. In addition, it attempts to compile the recent updates on development of drugs and vaccines for the dreaded disease.
