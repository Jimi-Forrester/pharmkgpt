33861892|t|Design, Synthesis, and Molecular Docking of Some Novel Tacrine Based Cyclopentapyranopyridine- and Tetrahydropyranoquinoline-Kojic Acid Derivatives as Anti-Acetylcholinesterase Agents.
33861892|a|A novel series of tacrine based cyclopentapyranopyridine- and tetrahydropyranoquinoline-kojic acid derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as anti-cholinesterase agents. The chemical structures of all target compounds were characterized by 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR, and elemental analyses. The synthesized compounds mostly inhibited acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE) with IC50 values of 4.18-48.71 muM rather than butyrylcholinesterase enzyme (BChE) with IC50 values of >100 muM. Among them, cyclopentapyranopyridine-kojic acid derivatives showed slightly better AChE inhibitory activity compared to tetrahydropyranoquinoline-kojic acid. The compound 10-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-11-(4-isopropylphenyl)-7,8,9,11-tetrahydro-4H-cyclopenta[b]pyrano[2',3' : 5,6]pyrano[3,2-e]pyridin-4-one (6f) bearing 4-isopropylphenyl moiety and cyclopentane ring exhibited the highest anti-AChE activity with IC50 value of 4.18 muM. The kinetic study indicated that the compound 6f acts as a mixed inhibitor and the molecular docking studies also illustrated that the compound 6f binds to both the catalytic site (CS) and peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE. The compound 6f showed moderate neuroprotective properties against H2 O2 -induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells. The theoretical ADME study also predicted good drug-likeness for the compound 6f. Based on these results, the compound 6f seems to be a very promising AChE inhibitor for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
