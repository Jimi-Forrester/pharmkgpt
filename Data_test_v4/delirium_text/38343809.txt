38343809|a|Defining the progression of blood biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for targeting treatments in patients most likely to benefit from early intervention. We delineated the temporal ordering of blood biomarkers a decade prior to the onset of AD symptoms in participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. We show that increased astrocyte reactivity, assessed by elevated glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels is an early event in the progression of blood biomarker changes in preclinical AD. In AD-converters who are initially cognitively unimpaired (N=158, 377 serial plasma samples), higher plasma GFAP levels are observed as early as 10-years prior to the onset of cognitive impairment due to incident AD compared to individuals who remain cognitively unimpaired (CU, N=160, 379 serial plasma samples). Plasma GFAP levels in AD-converters remain elevated 5-years prior to and coincident with the onset of cognitive impairment due to AD. In participants with neuropathologically confirmed AD, plasma GFAP levels are elevated relative to cognitively normal individuals and intermediate in those who remain cognitively unimpaired despite significant AD pathology (asymptomatic AD). Higher plasma GFAP levels at death are associated with greater severity of both neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In the 5XFAD transgenic model of AD, we observed greater GFAP levels in the cortex and hippocampus of transgenic mice relative to wild-type prior to the development of cognitive impairment. Reactive astrocytosis, an established biological response to neuronal injury, may be an early initiator of AD pathogenesis and a promising therapeutic target.
