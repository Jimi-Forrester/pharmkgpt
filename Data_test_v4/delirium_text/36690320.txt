36690320|t|Alterations in ether lipid metabolism and the consequences for the mouse lipidome.
36690320|a|Alkylglycerol monooxygenase (AGMO) and plasmanylethanolamine desaturase (PEDS1) are enzymes involved in ether lipid metabolism. While AGMO degrades plasmanyl lipids by oxidative cleavage of the ether bond, PEDS1 exclusively synthesizes a specific subclass of ether lipids, the plasmalogens, by introducing a vinyl ether double bond into plasmanylethanolamine phospholipids. Ether lipids are characterized by an ether linkage at the sn-1 position of the glycerol backbone and they are found in membranes of different cell types. Decreased plasmalogen levels have been associated with neurological diseases like Alzheimer's disease. Agmo-deficient mice do not present an obvious phenotype under unchallenged conditions. In contrast, Peds1 knockout mice display a growth phenotype. To investigate the molecular consequences of Agmo and Peds1 deficiency on the mouse lipidome, five tissues from each mouse model were isolated and subjected to high resolution mass spectrometry allowing the characterization of up to 2013 lipid species from 42 lipid subclasses. Agmo knockout mice moderately accumulated plasmanyl and plasmenyl lipid species. Peds1-deficient mice manifested striking changes characterized by a strong reduction of plasmenyl lipids and a concomitant massive accumulation of plasmanyl lipids resulting in increased total ether lipid levels in the analyzed tissues except for the class of phosphatidylethanolamines where total levels remained remarkably constant also in Peds1 knockout mice. The rate-limiting enzyme in ether lipid metabolism, FAR1, was not upregulated in Peds1-deficient mice, indicating that the selective loss of plasmalogens is not sufficient to activate the feedback mechanism observed in total ether lipid deficiency.
