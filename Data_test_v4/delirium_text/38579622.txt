38579622|a|Due to the putative role of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in regulation of acetylcholine levels and functions in the late stages of the Alzheimer's disease (AD), the potential of selective inhibitors (BChEIs) has been envisaged as an alternative to administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs). Starting from our recent findings, herein the synthesis and in vitro evaluation of cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition of a novel series of some twenty 3,4,5,6-tetrahydroazepino[4,3-b]indol-1(2H)-one derivatives, bearing at the indole nitrogen diverse alkyl-bridged 4-arylalkylpiperazin-1-yl chains, are reported. The length of the spacers, as well as the type of arylalkyl group affected the enzyme inhibition potency and BChE/AChE selectivity. Two compounds, namely 14c (IC50 = 163 nM) and 14d (IC50 = 65 nM), bearing at the nitrogen atom in position 6 a n-pentyl- or n-heptyl-bridged 4-phenethylpiperazin-1-yl chains, respectively, proved to be highly potent mixed-type inhibitors of both equine and human BChE isoforms, showing more than two order magnitude of selectivity over AChE. The study of binding kinetics through surface plasmon resonance (SPR) highlighted differences in their BChE residence times (8 and 47 s for 14c and 14d, respectively). Moreover, 14c and 14d proved to hit other mechanisms known to trigger neurodegeneration underlying AD and other CNS disorders. Unlike 14c, compound 14d proved also capable of inhibiting by more than 60% the in vitro self-induced aggregation of neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide at 100 muM concentration. On the other hand, 14c was slightly better than 14d in counteracting, at 1 and 10 muM concentration, glutamate excitotoxicity, due to over-excitation of NMDA receptors, and hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress assessed in neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. This paper is dedicated to Prof. Marcello Ferappi, former dean of the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Bari, in the occasion of his 90th birthday.
