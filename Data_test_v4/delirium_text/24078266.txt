24078266|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by Amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in senile plaques in specific areas of the brain and by intraneuronal p-tau accumulation in neurofibrillary tangles. Cumulative evidence supports that oxidative stress is an important factor in the pathogenesis of AD and contributes to Abeta generation. However, there is no effective treatment for AD. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HUMSCs) have potential therapeutic value for the treatment of neurological disease. However, the therapeutic impact of systemic administration of HUMSCs and their mechanism of action in AD have not yet been determined. Here, we found that intravenous infusion of HUMSCs significantly improved spatial learning and alleviated memory decline in an AbetaPP/PS1 mouse model of AD. HUMSC treatment also increased glutathione (GSH) activity and ratio of GSH to oxidative glutathione as well as superoxide dismutase activity, while decreasing malondialdehyde activity and protein carbonyl level, which suggests that HUMSC infusion alleviated oxidative stress in AbetaPP/PS1 mice. In addition, HUMSC infusion reduced beta-secretase 1 and CTFbeta, thus reducing Abeta deposition in mice. HUMSCs may have beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of AD.
