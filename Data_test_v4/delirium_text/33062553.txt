33062553|a|INTRODUCTION: Antipsychotics are commonly used to treat psychotic symptoms and severe mental illnesses. Treatment guidelines recommend antipsychotics be titrated quickly to therapeutic effect in the acute setting but acknowledge that determining the optimal dose is complicated by a delay between treatment initiation and therapeutic response. The purpose of this study was to evaluate antipsychotic titration patterns in an inpatient psychiatric hospital. METHODS: This study is a retrospective chart review of adult patients admitted to a teaching hospital and initiated on an antipsychotic for treatment of psychosis between January and December 2018. Patients were excluded if they had substance-induced psychosis, delirium, were prescribed >1 antipsychotic, or had no antipsychotic dose changes. The primary outcome was the average titration rate of the newly initiated antipsychotic. Secondary outcomes included differences in titration rate between involuntary and voluntary admissions and other antipsychotic characteristics. RESULTS: Of 149 patients included, the majority had a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia. Antipsychotics were titrated on average every 2 days regardless of admission type. Eighteen percent of patients were titrated to guideline-recommended maximum doses, and it took, on average, 3 days for patients to reach their final dose during hospitalization. Average length of stay was 9 days, and 43.6% of patients were readmitted within 1 year. DISCUSSION: Antipsychotics are titrated rapidly in the inpatient setting despite a lack of evidence regarding the impact of titration rate on clinical outcomes. Further studies comparing slow versus rapid titration strategies are needed to elucidate the impact of this on patient outcomes.
