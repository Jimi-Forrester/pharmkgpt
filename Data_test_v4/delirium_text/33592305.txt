33592305|a|BACKGROUND: India has the second largest COVID-19 epidemic in the world as per current estimates. Central and peripheral nervous system involvement in COVID-19 (Neuro COVID-19) has been increasingly identified and reported. This letter is the first report of the spectrum of neurological disorders observed in patients with severe COVID-19 from a resource limited setting like India. Till October 30th 2020, Noble hospital and research center, Pune, India has admitted 2631 patients of COVID-19. Out of these, 423 patients had severe COVID-19. NEUROLOGIC COMPLICATIONS IN SEVERE COVID-19 IN PUNE, INDIA: Of the 423 patients with severe COVID-19, 20 (4.7%) had pre-existing neurologic co-morbidities, with cerebrovascular disease (8 patients) being the most common. Poliomyelitis (4 patients) was also an important co-morbidity associated with severe COVID-19. Bodyache or myalgia (207/423, 49 %) and headache (59/423, 13.9 %) were the most common neurologic symptoms observed in patients. Encephalopathy (22/423, 5.2 %) and new onset large vessel ischemic stroke secondary to cerebral artery thrombosis (5/423, 1.1%) were the most common secondary neurologic complications noted in our cohort. Two cases of COVID-19/central nervous system tuberculosis co-infection were also identified. CHALLENGES IN MANAGEMENT OF NEURO COVID-19 IN INDIA: Various challenges like an overwhelmed health care system, inadequate workforce, lack of exhaustive reporting of symptoms and poor availability of neuroimaging in ventilated COVID-19 patients leads to underestimation of Neuro COVID-19 in resource limited settings like India.
