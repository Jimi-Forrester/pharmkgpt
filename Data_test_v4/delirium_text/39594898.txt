39594898|t|Unveiling Tumorigenesis Mechanisms and Drug Therapy in Neuroblastoma by Mass Spectrometry Based Proteomics.
39594898|a|Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common type of extracranial solid tumors in children. Despite the advancements in treatment strategies over the past years, the overall survival rate in patients within the high-risk NB group remains less than 50%. Therefore, new treatment options are urgently needed for this group of patients. Compared with genomic aberrations, proteomic alterations are more dynamic and complex, as well as more directly related to pathological phenotypes and external perturbations such as environmental changes and drug treatments. This review focuses on specific examples of proteomics application in various fundamental aspects of NB research, including tumorigenesis, drug treatment, drug resistance, and highlights potential protein signatures and related signaling pathways with translational values for clinical practice. Moreover, emerging cutting-edge proteomic techniques, such as single cell and spatial proteomics, as well as mass spectrometry imaging, are discussed for their potentials to probe intratumor heterogeneity of NB.
