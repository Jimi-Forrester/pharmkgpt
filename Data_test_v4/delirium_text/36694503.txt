36694503|t|ECG Changes Occurring During Chest Liposuction for Gynecomastia - Artifacts or a Cause for Concern?
36694503|a|Currently, liposuction alone or combined with various methods of gland excision has become the standard of care in the surgical management of gynecomastia. Although liposuction is considered a safe and straightforward method of body contouring, serious complications related to the procedure, including deaths, have been reported in the literature. We report the occurrence of ECG artifacts intra-operatively while performing chest liposuction under general anesthesia. Patients may receive unnecessary and potentially dangerous therapeutic interventions if these ECG artifacts are not identified correctly. A careful and rational evaluation of the patient and the ECG by the clinician can accurately identify these pseudo-abnormalities and avoid unnecessary therapies.
