17168095|a|The authors use a case study to illustrate the risks of delirium in older adult patients and discuss ways to prevent, identify and manage its occurrence. An estimated 60 to 80 per cent of hospitalized frail older adults experience at least one preventable episode of delirium, often leading to prolonged hospitalization, functional decline, increased morbidity and eventual nursing home placement or death. Delirium is a medical emergency, characterized by acute onset and a fluctuating course that is demonstrated by abrupt changes in mental status and function. It has three categories: hyperactive, hypoactive and mixed. Although delirium is amenable to expert nursing care, it is unrecognized or misdiagnosed in up to 70 per cent of older patients. Delirium results from the interplay of multiple forces associated with illness in the older adult, including drugs, substance abuse, metabolic disturbances, nutritional deficiencies, fluid disturbances, acute trauma or illness, infection and impaired physical or functional ability A proactive strategy for delirium prevention and treatment targets defined risk factors and the management of physiologic factors that precipitate delirium. It includes assessment, therapeutic environmental modification, standardized protocols for physiological interventions and staff education.
