21738321|t|Flavonoids lower Alzheimer's Abeta production via an NFkappaB dependent mechanism.
21738321|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the brain accumulation of Abeta peptides and by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles. Abeta is believed to play an important role in AD and it has been shown that certain flavonoids can affect Abeta production. Recently, it was suggested that the Abeta lowering properties of flavonoids are mediated by a direct inhibition the beta-secretase (BACE-1) activity, the rate limiting enzyme responsible for the production of Abeta peptides. Westernblots and ELISAs were employed to monitor the impact of flavonoids on amyloid precursor protein processing and Abeta production. A cell free chemoluminescent assay using human recombinant BACE-1 was used to assess the effect of flavonoids on BACE-1 activity. The effect of flavonoids on NFkappaB activation was determined by using a stable NFkappaB luciferase reporter cell line. Molecular docking simulations were performed to predict the binding of flavonoids to the BACE-1 catalytic site. Real time quantitative PCR was used to determine the effect of flavonoids on BACE-1 transcription. We show in a cell free assay that flavonoids are only weak inhibitors of BACE-1 activity. Docking simulation studies with different BACE-1 structures also suggest that flavonoids are poor BACE-1 inhibitors as they appear to adopt various docking poses in the active site pocket and have weak docking scores that differ as a function of the BACE-1 structures studied. Moreover, a weak correlation was observed between the effect of flavonoids on Abeta production in vitro and their ability to lower BACE-1 activity suggesting that the Abeta lowering properties of flavonoids in whole cells are not mediated via direct inhibition of BACE-1 activity. We found however a strong correlation between the inhibition of NFkappaB activation by flavonoids and their Abeta lowering properties suggesting that flavonoids inhibit Abeta production in whole cells via NFkappaB related mechanisms. As NFkappaB has been shown to regulate BACE-1 expression, we show that NFkappaB lowering flavonoids inhibit BACE-1 transcription in human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. Altogether, our data suggest that flavonoids inhibit Abeta and sAPPbeta production by regulating BACE-1 expression and not by directly inhibiting BACE-1 activity.
