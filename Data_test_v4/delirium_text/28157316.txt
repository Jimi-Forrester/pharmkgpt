28157316|t|A Shotgun Proteomics Approach Reveals a New Toxic Role for Alzheimer's Disease Abeta Peptide: Spliceosome Impairment.
28157316|a|Proteomic changes have been described in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the early events in the onset of the pathology are yet to be fully elucidated. A cell model system in which LAN5 neuroblastoma cells were incubated for a short time with a recombinant form of Abeta42 was utilized. Proteins extracted from these cells were subjected to shotgun proteomics analysis by LTQ-Orbitrap-MS followed by label-free quantitation. By bioinformatics tools we found that the most significant of those found to be up-regulated were related to cytoskeletal dynamics (Rho related) and membrane-related processes. The most significant of the down-regulated proteins were hnRNP-related. In particular, hnRNPs involved in ribosomal biogenesis and in splicing were down-regulated. The latter of these processes stood out as it was highlighted ubiquitously and with the highest significance in the results of every analysis. Furthermore, our findings revealed down-regulation at every stage of the splicing process through down-regulation of every subunit of the spliceosome. Dysregulation of the spliceosome was also confirmed using a Western blot. In conclusion, these data suggest dysregulation of the proteins and processes identified as early events in pathogenesis of AD following Abeta accumulation.
