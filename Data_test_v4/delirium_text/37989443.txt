37989443|a|Autoimmunity plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether autoantibodies in peripheral blood can be used as biomarkers for AD has been elusive. Serum samples were obtained from 1,686 participants, including 767 with AD, 146 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 255 with other neurodegenerative diseases, and 518 healthy controls. Specific autoantibodies were measured using a custom-made immunoassay. Multivariate support vector machine models were employed to investigate the correlation between serum autoantibody levels and disease states. As a result, seven candidate AD-specific autoantibodies were identified, including MAPT, DNAJC8, KDM4D, SERF1A, CDKN1A, AGER, and ASXL1. A classification model with high accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.94) was established. Importantly, these autoantibodies could distinguish AD from other neurodegenerative diseases and out-performed amyloid and tau protein concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid in predicting cognitive decline (P < 0.001). This study indicated that AD onset and progression are possibly accompanied by an unappreciated serum autoantibody response. Therefore, future studies could optimize its application as a convenient biomarker for the early detection of AD.
