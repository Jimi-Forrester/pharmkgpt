37770475|t|Extracellular high molecular weight alpha-synuclein oligomers induce cell death by disrupting the plasma membrane.
37770475|a|alpha-Synuclein (alphaS), the causative protein of Parkinson's disease and other alpha-synucleinopathies, aggregates from a low molecular weight form (LMW-alphaS) to a high molecular weight alphaS oligomer (HMW-alphaSo). Aggregated alphaS accumulates intracellularly, induces intrinsic apoptosis, is released extracellularly, and appears to propagate disease through prion-like spreading. Whether extracellular alphaS aggregates are cytotoxic, damage cell wall, or induce cell death is unclear. We investigated cytotoxicity and cell death caused by HMW-alphaSo or LMW-alphaS. Extracellular HMW-alphaSo was more cytotoxic than LMW-alphaS and was a crucial factor for inducing plasma membrane damage and cell death. HMW-alphaSo induced reactive oxygen species production and phospholipid peroxidation in the membrane, thereby impairing calcium homeostasis and disrupting plasma membrane integrity. HMW-alphaSo also induced extrinsic apoptosis and cell death by activating acidic sphingomyelinase. Thus, as extracellular HMW-alphaSo causes neuronal injury and death via cellular transmission and direct plasma membrane damage, we propose an additional disease progression pathway for alpha-synucleinopathies.
