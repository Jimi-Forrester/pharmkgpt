31632387|a|Recently, agonistic autoantibodies (agAAb) activating the beta2-adrenergic receptor were detected in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT) patients and were linked to intraocular pressure (IOP) (1). The aim of the present study was to quantify beta2-agAAb in the sera of glaucoma suspects and patients with primary and secondary glaucoma. Patients with OHT (n = 33), pre-perimetric POAG (pre-POAG; n = 11), POAG (n = 28), and 11 secondary OAG (SOAG) underwent ophthalmological examinations including examinations with Octopus G1 perimetry and morphometry. Twenty-five healthy individuals served as controls. Serum-derived IgG samples were analyzed for beta2-agAAb using a functional bioassay. The beat-rate-increase of spontaneously beating cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes was monitored with 1.6 beats/15 s as cut-off. None of the sera of normal subjects showed beta2-agAAb. In POAG or OHT patients increased beating rates of 4.1 +- 2.2 beats/15 s, and 3.7 +- 2.8 beats/15 s were detected (p > 0.05). Glaucoma patients with (POAG) and without perimetric (pre-POAG) defects did not differ (pre-POAG 4.4 +- 2.6 beats/15 s, POAG 4.1 +- 2.0 beats/15 s, p > 0.05). Patients with SOAG yielded mean beating rates of 4.7 +- 1.7 beats/15 s (p > 0.05). beta2-agAAb were seen in 73% of OHT, 82% of pre-POAG, 82% of POAG, and 91% SOAG patients (p < 0.001). Clinical data did not correlate with beating rate (p > 0.05). The robust beta2-agAAb seropositivity in patients with OHT, pre-POAG, POAG, and SOAG suggest a primary common role for beta2-agAAb starting early in glaucoma pathophysiology and turned out to be a novel marker identifying all patients with increased IOP independent of glaucoma stage and entity.
