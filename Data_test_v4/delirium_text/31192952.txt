31192952|t|Urinary retention as a postoperative complication associated with functional decline in elderly female patients with femoral neck and trochanteric fractures: A retrospective study of a patient cohort.
31192952|a|Urinary retention (UR) has been recognized as one of the most common postoperative complications after hip surgery in elderly. The objective of the present study was to evaluate risk for postoperative complications of UR in elderly female patients with femoral neck fractures.We recruited 221 female patients (age 85.3 +- 7.0 years) with a history of hip surgery carried out at Toyama Municipal Hospital. UR occurred in 34 out of 221 cases (15.4%). Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the risk factors for UR, including age, body mass index (BMI), serum albumin, cognitive impairment, and activities of daily living (ADL).The results showed significant association of UR with cognitive impairment (P = .005, odds ratio [OR] 4.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53-11.03), and ADL (P = .029, OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.11-6.18), under adjustment with age and BMI.This study demonstrated that cognitive function and ADL were the important risk factors for UR, suggested that the postoperative management of UR is important with taking account of neurofunctional assistance and nursing care in daily living, especially in elderly female patients receiving surgery of femoral neck and trochanteric fractures.
