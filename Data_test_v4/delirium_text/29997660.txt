29997660|t|Preventive Intervention to Prevent Delirium in Patients Hospitalized in Intensive Care Unit.
29997660|a|Objective: Delirium is a clinical syndrome associated with multiple short- and long-term complications; therefore, prevention is an essential part of its management. This study was conducted to review the effective non-pharmacological interventions that can reduce the incidence or duration of delirium in critically ill patients. Method: A search was made in PubMed, Scopus, Psych INFO and Google Scholar databases without any time constraints. The information available was collected and sorted, and a secondary study of narrative review was done. The views of specialists on this topic were received via email and included in the texts and recommendations. Discussion: Delirium is a common, costly and potentially damaging illness in patients who are staying in hospitals, especially older patients in ICU. Thus, preventing delirium could be one of the most effective methods in preventing the complications. The present study aimed at conducting a review-validity study to generate a general view on the activities which might be effective in preventing delirium in patients.
