37525115|t|Differential effects of two phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors against lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation in mice.
37525115|a|BACKGROUND: Several phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitors have emerged as potential therapeutics for central nervous system (CNS) diseases. This study investigated the pharmacological effects of two selective PDE4 inhibitors, roflumilast and zatolmilast, against lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation. RESULTS: In BV-2 cells, the PDE4 inhibitor roflumilast reduced the production of nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) by inhibiting NF-kappaB phosphorylation. Moreover, mice administered roflumilast had significantly reduced TNF-alpha, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and IL-6 levels in plasma and brain tissues. By contrast, zatolmilast, a PDE4D inhibitor, showed no anti-neuroinflammatory effects in vitro or in vivo. Next, in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies of these compounds in the brain were performed. The apparent permeability coefficients of 3 microM roflumilast and zatolmilast were high (> 23 x 10-6 cm/s) and moderate (3.72-7.18 x 10-6 cm/s), respectively, and increased in a concentration-dependent manner in the MDR1-MDCK monolayer. The efflux ratios were < 1.92, suggesting that these compounds are not P-glycoprotein substrates. Following oral administration, both roflumilast and zatolmilast were slowly absorbed and eliminated, with time-to-peak drug concentrations of 2-2.3 h and terminal half-lives of 7-20 h. Assessment of their brain dispositions revealed the unbound brain-to-plasma partition coefficients of roflumilast and zatolmilast to be 0.17 and 0.18, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that roflumilast, but not zatolmilast, has the potential for use as a therapeutic agent against neuroinflammatory diseases.
