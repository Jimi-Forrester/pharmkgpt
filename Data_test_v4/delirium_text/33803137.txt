33803137|t|Lysosomal Functions in Glia Associated with Neurodegeneration.
33803137|a|Lysosomes are cellular organelles that contain various acidic digestive enzymes. Despite their small size, they have multiple functions. Lysosomes remove or recycle unnecessary cell parts. They repair damaged cellular membranes by exocytosis. Lysosomes also sense cellular energy status and transmit signals to the nucleus. Glial cells are non-neuronal cells in the nervous system and have an active role in homeostatic support for neurons. In response to dynamic cues, glia use lysosomal pathways for the secretion and uptake of regulatory molecules, which affect the physiology of neighboring neurons. Therefore, functional aberration of glial lysosomes can trigger neuronal degeneration. Here, we review lysosomal functions in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia, with emphasis on neurodegeneration.
