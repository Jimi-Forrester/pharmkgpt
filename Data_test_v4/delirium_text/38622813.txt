38622813|t|Copper: From enigma to therapeutic target for neurological disorder.
38622813|a|Neurological disorders (NDs) have a negative impact on the lives of individuals. There could be two explanations for this: unclear aetiology and lack of effective therapy. However, research in the past few years has revealed the role of bio-metals dyshomeostasis in NDs. The imbalance in copper (Cu) concentration may be one of the main causative factors in NDs. In this review, we have discussed the role of Cu in NDs, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD), including the molecular mechanisms involved in Cu-associated NDs like oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and protein misfolding. We have also summarized the recent Cu-targeting approaches and highlighted the in vitro and in vivo studies recently being reported on the subject. Based on the earlier published reports, it could be speculated that the Cu targeting strategy might be an interesting and potential therapeutic approach for NDs. Various difficulties must be overcome to develop safe and efficient Cu-targeting medications for NDs.
