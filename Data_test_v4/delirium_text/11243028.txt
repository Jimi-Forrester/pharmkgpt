11243028|a|In a group of 137 patients with schizophrenia combined with delirium tremens we also observed alcoholic hallucinosis (9.5%) and alcoholic paranoid (0.7%). Delirium tremens was more often observed in patients with schizophrenia in the following age groups: under 19 and of 20-29 years. Meanwhile, the frequency of the onset of the delirium tremens in a group of 2417 patients was higher in the age groups of 35-39 and 60 and over. In the main group of schizophrenic patients the rate of the onset of this endogenous disease was higher in the age groups of 35-39, 40-44 and 50-54 years, as compared with a control group of schizophrenic patients (310 cases). The recurrent course of the disease was observed in these patients more often, whereas a continuous course was quite rare, as compared with a control group. Oneiroid states (9.5%) presented in some patients of the main group. Schizophrenic process was more favorable in combination with delirium tremens.
