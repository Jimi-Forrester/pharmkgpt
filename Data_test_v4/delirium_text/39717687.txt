39717687|t|Machine learning based algorithms for virtual early detection and screening of neurodegenerative and neurocognitive disorders: a systematic-review.
39717687|a|Background and aim: Neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's) lead to neuronal loss; neurocognitive disorders (e.g., delirium, dementia) show cognitive decline. Early detection is crucial for effective management. Machine learning aids in more precise disease identification, potentially transforming healthcare. This comprehensive systematic review discusses how machine learning (ML), can enhance early detection of these disorders, surpassing traditional diagnostics' constraints. Methods: In this review, databases were examined up to August 15th, 2023, for ML data on neurodegenerative and neurocognitive diseases using PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. Two investigators used the RAYYAN intelligence tool for systematic reviews to conduct the screening. Six blinded reviewers reviewed titles/abstracts. Cochrane risk of bias tool was used for quality assessment. Results: Our search found 7,069 research studies, of which 1,365 items were duplicates and thus removed. Four thousand three hundred and thirty four studies were screened, and 108 articles met the criteria for inclusion after preprocessing. Twelve ML algorithms were observed for dementia, showing promise in early detection. Eighteen ML algorithms were identified for Parkinson's, each effective in detection and diagnosis. Studies emphasized that ML algorithms are necessary for Alzheimer's to be successful. Fourteen ML algorithms were discovered for mild cognitive impairment, with LASSO logistic regression being the only one with unpromising results. Conclusion: This review emphasizes the pressing necessity of integrating verified digital health resources into conventional medical practice. This integration may signify a new era in the early detection of neurodegenerative and neurocognitive illnesses, potentially changing the course of these conditions for millions globally. This study showcases specific and statistically significant findings to illustrate the progress in the area and the prospective influence of these advancements on the global management of neurocognitive and neurodegenerative illnesses.
