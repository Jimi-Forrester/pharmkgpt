35685446|t|Evaluation of the Effect of Modafinil on Respiratory and Cerebral Outcomes after Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery.
35685446|a|BACKGROUND: Pulmonary complications following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) pump during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are relatively common and the incidence of cognitive dysfunction is reported as ranging in rate from 30% to 80% in the early postoperative period. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of modafinil administration on the prevention of pulmonary and cerebral complications and shortening the hospital stay after CABG surgery. METHODS: This randomized double-blind intervention-controlled clinical trial was performed on 74 patients (37 in the intervention group and 37 in the control group) undertaking CABG surgery. The intervention group was orally treated with doses of 200 mg of modafinil on the day of surgery, and on the morning of the day after surgery, the second dose of modafinil 200 mg was given to patients. The control group underwent a placebo with the same intervals. RESULTS: Administration of modafinil in intervention group significantly decreased the time to reach consciousness (P = 0.001), ventilator time in intensive care unit (ICU) (P < 0.001), length of stay in ICU (P = 0.009), duration of hospitalization (P = 0.008), and arterial blood carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2) (P = 0.047). In the intervention group, no patients with delirium, agitation, respiratory depression, non-invasive respiratory ventilation, and endotracheal re-intubation were observed. CONCLUSION: Modafinil tablet as a respiratory and brain stimulant through the central nervous system (CNS) can improve the quality of breathing and arterial blood gases (ABGs) and also can increase the level of consciousness and shorten the recovery time.
