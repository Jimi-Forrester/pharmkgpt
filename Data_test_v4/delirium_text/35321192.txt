35321192|t|Smoking and Risk of Urolithiasis: Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies.
35321192|a|Background: Earlier studies have warned about the effects of smoking on urolithiasis. Some studies have deemed that smoking has a promoting effect on urolithiasis, whereas others have considered that no inevitable association exists between the two. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to estimate whether smoking is associated with urolithiasis risk. Methods: To identify publications from related observational studies, we performed a search on PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases from inception until October 1, 2021. According to the heterogeneity, random-effect model was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Five articles were included in the meta-analysis, representing data for 20,402 subjects, of which 1,758 (8.62%) had urolithiasis as defined according to the criteria. Three articles are concerned with analysis between ex-smokers and non-smokers, in which a significant difference was observed (OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.48-2.01). Our comparison of current smokers with non-smokers in another meta-analysis of three articles revealed no significant difference between them (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.94-1.23). Finally, we separated subjects into ever-smokers and never-smokers and found a significant difference between the two groups in the analysis of three articles (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.17-1.47). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of the current results. Conclusion: Combined evidence from observational studies demonstrates a significant relation between smoking and urolithiasis. The trend of elevated urolithiasis risk from smoking was found in ever-smokers vs. never-smokers.
