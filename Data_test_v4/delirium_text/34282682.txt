34282682|t|Changes in Motor Behavior Predict Falls and Identify Acute Events.
34282682|a|This study aimed to examine how changes in motor behavior are associated with falls, delirium, and urinary tract infections (UTIs). Twenty-three (128 observations) skilled nursing residents were examined for up to 18 months. In multilevel models, motor behaviors (e.g., time and distance traveled, gait speed), measured by a real-time locating system, were used to predict falls, UTIs, and delirium. Falls were associated with decreased gait speed (OR = 0.01; p <= 0.001) and path distance (OR = 0.99; p <= 0.05); delirium was associated with increased distance traveled (OR = 1.01; p <= 0.001), path distance (OR = 1.02; p <= 0.001), and decreased time traveled (OR = 0.99; p <= 0.001) and path time (OR = 0.99; p <= 0.001); UTIs were associated with increased distance traveled (OR = 1.01; p <= 0.001), decreased time traveled (OR = 0.99; p <= 0.001), and the number of paths (OR = 0.91; p <= 0.01). Subtle changes in motor behavior may be an early warning sign of falls and acute events. Continuous monitoring may enable clinical staff to prevent, identify early, and/or delay these poor health outcomes.
