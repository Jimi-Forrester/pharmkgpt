38201212|t|Paralogue-Specific Roles of SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 in Protein Quality Control and Associated Diseases.
38201212|a|Small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMOs) function as post-translational protein modifications and regulate nearly every aspect of cellular function. While a single ubiquitin protein is expressed across eukaryotic organisms, multiple SUMO paralogues with distinct biomolecular properties have been identified in plants and vertebrates. Five SUMO paralogues have been characterized in humans, with SUMO1, SUMO2 and SUMO3 being the best studied. SUMO2 and SUMO3 share 97% protein sequence homology (and are thus referred to as SUMO2/3) but only 47% homology with SUMO1. To date, thousands of putative sumoylation substrates have been identified thanks to advanced proteomic techniques, but the identification of SUMO1- and SUMO2/3-specific modifications and their unique functions in physiology and pathology are not well understood. The SUMO2/3 paralogues play an important role in proteostasis, converging with ubiquitylation to mediate protein degradation. This function is achieved primarily through SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases (STUbLs), which preferentially bind and ubiquitylate poly-SUMO2/3 modified proteins. Effects of the SUMO1 paralogue on protein solubility and aggregation independent of STUbLs and proteasomal degradation have also been reported. Consistent with these functions, sumoylation is implicated in multiple human diseases associated with disturbed proteostasis, and a broad range of pathogenic proteins have been identified as SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 substrates. A better understanding of paralogue-specific functions of SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 in cellular protein quality control may therefore provide novel insights into disease pathogenesis and therapeutic innovation. This review summarizes current understandings of the roles of sumoylation in protein quality control and associated diseases, with a focus on the specific effects of SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 paralogues.
