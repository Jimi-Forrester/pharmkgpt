35453655|t|Aloperine: A Potent Modulator of Crucial Biological Mechanisms in Multiple Diseases.
35453655|a|Aloperine is an alkaloid found in the seeds and leaves of the medicinal plant Sophora alopecuroides L. It has been used as herbal medicine in China for centuries due to its potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. Recently, aloperine has been widely investigated for its therapeutic activities. Aloperine is proven to be an effective therapeutic agent against many human pathological conditions, including cancer, viral diseases, and cardiovascular and inflammatory disorders. Aloperine is reported to exert therapeutic effects through triggering various biological processes, including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, autophagy, suppressing cell migration, and invasion. It has also been found to be associated with the modulation of various signaling pathways in different diseases. In this review, we summarize the most recent knowledge on the modulatory effects of aloperine on various critical biological processes and signaling mechanisms, including the PI3K, Akt, NF-kappaB, Ras, and Nrf2 pathways. These data demonstrate that aloperine is a promising therapeutic candidate. Being a potent modulator of signaling mechanisms, aloperine can be employed in clinical settings to treat various human disorders in the future.
