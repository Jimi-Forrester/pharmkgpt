38398861|a|We previously demonstrated that orally supplemented Bifidobacterium breve MCC1274 (B. breve MCC1274) mitigated Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathologies in both 7-month-old AppNL-G-F mice and wild-type mice; thus, B. breve MCC1274 supplementation might potentially prevent the progression of AD. However, the possibility of using this probiotic as a treatment for AD remains unclear. Thus, we investigated the potential therapeutic effects of this probiotic on AD using 17-month-old AppNL-G-F mice with memory deficits and amyloid beta saturation in the brain. B. breve MCC1274 supplementation ameliorated memory impairment via an amyloid-cascade-independent pathway. It reduced hippocampal and cortical levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase as well as heat shock protein 90, which might have suppressed tau hyperphosphorylation and chronic stress. Moreover, B. breve MCC1274 supplementation increased hippocampal synaptic protein levels and upregulated neuronal activity. Thus, B. breve MCC1274 supplementation may alleviate cognitive dysfunction by reducing chronic stress and tau hyperphosphorylation, thereby enhancing both synaptic density and neuronal activity in 17-month-old AppNL-G-F mice. Overall, this study suggests that B. breve MCC1274 has anti-AD effects and can be used as a potential treatment for AD.
