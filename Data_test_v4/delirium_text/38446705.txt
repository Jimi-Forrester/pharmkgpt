38446705|t|Association of Intravenous Neostigmine and Anticholinergics or Sugammadex with Postoperative Delirium: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
38446705|a|BACKGROUND: Administration of cholinesterase inhibitors in combination with anticholinergic drugs for reversal of neuromuscular blocks may precipitate delirium through impairment of central cholinergic transmission, which could be avoided by using sugammadex. Therefore, we tested the primary hypothesis that postoperative delirium is less common when neuromuscular block is reversed with sugammadex than with neostigmine combined with glycopyrrolate or atropine. METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study, analyzing all adult patients having general anesthesia for noncardiac surgery who received neostigmine or sugammadex from January 2016 to March 2022. Inverse propensity score weighting and propensity score calibration were used to adjust for appropriate confounders. Our primary outcome was presence of delirium within the first 4 days after surgery, defined as at least 1 positive brief Confusion Assessment Method (bCAM) screening. The secondary outcome was the presence of early delirium within 24 hours of surgery. RESULTS: Among 49,468 cases in our analysis, 6881 received sugammadex and 42,587 received neostigmine. After propensity weighting, the incidence of delirium was 1.09% in the sugammadex group and 0.82% in the neostigmine group. The odds of postoperative delirium did not differ between the sugammadex and neostigmine groups, with an estimated odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.33 (0.91-1.95), P = .147. A sensitivity analysis restricted to only include cases with at least 6 bCAM measurements over postoperative day (POD) 1 to 4 had consistent results, as sugammadex compared with neostigmine was associated with an estimated odds ratio for postoperative delirium of 1.20 (0.82-1.77), P = .346. Sugammadex was significantly associated with an increased incidence of early postoperative delirium, with an estimated odds ratio of 1.71 (1.07-2.72), P = .025. Further analysis showed no treatment-by-age interaction for either postoperative delirium (P = .637) or postoperative early delirium (P = .904). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to neostigmine, use of sugammadex for reversal of neuromuscular block was not associated with an increased risk of postoperative delirium in this retrospective single-center study. Though sugammadex was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of postoperative early delirium, the difference was small and not clinically relevant, and may reflect the presence of unknown confounders.
