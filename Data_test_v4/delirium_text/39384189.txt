39384189|t|Implementation of music in the perioperative standard care of colorectal surgery (IMPROVE study).
39384189|a|AIM: Patients undergoing surgery experience perioperative anxiety and pain. Music has been shown to reduce perioperative anxiety, pain and medication requirement. This study assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing a perioperative music intervention. METHOD: A prospective pre- and post-implementation pilot study was conducted to assess adherence to the intervention and the initial effect of music on postoperative pain scores (Numerical Rating Scale, 0-10) compared to a control group. Secondary outcomes encompassed pain scores throughout hospital admission, anxiety levels, medication usage, complications and hospital stay length. RESULTS: Adherence to the music intervention was preoperative 95.2%, intraoperative 95.7%, postoperative 31.9% and overall 29.7%. The intervention did influence postoperative pain. Patient's willingness to receive music was high (73%), they appreciated the intervention (median 8.0, interquartile range 7.0-9.0) and healthcare professionals were willing to apply the intervention. Music significantly reduced postoperative anxiety (2.0 vs. 3.0, p = 0.02) and the consumption of benzodiazepines on the first postoperative day (number of patients: zero [0%] vs. five [10%], p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Implementation of music resulted in reduced postoperative anxiety and decreased consumption of benzodiazepines, and the strategy was feasible, but adjustments are needed to improve postoperative adherence. Both patients and healthcare professionals had a positive attitude towards the intervention.
