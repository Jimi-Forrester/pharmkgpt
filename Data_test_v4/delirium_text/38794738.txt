38794738|t|Dietary (Poly)phenols and the Gut-Brain Axis in Ageing.
38794738|a|As the population ages, the incidence of age-related neurodegenerative diseases is rapidly increasing, and novel approaches to mitigate this soaring prevalence are sorely needed. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of gut microbial homeostasis and its impact on brain functions, commonly referred to as the gut-brain axis, in maintaining overall health and wellbeing. Nonetheless, the mechanisms by which this system acts remains poorly defined. In this review, we will explore how (poly)phenols, a class of natural compounds found in many plant-based foods and beverages, can modulate the gut-brain axis, and thereby promote neural health. While evidence indicates a beneficial role of (poly)phenol consumption as part of a balanced diet, human studies are scarce and mechanistic insight is still lacking. In this regard, we make the case that dietary (poly)phenols should be further explored to establish their therapeutic efficacy on brain health through modulation of the gut-brain axis, with much greater emphasis on carefully designed human interventions.
