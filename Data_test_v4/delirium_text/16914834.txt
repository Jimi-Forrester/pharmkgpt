16914834|a|PSAPP mice expressing the "Swedish" amyloid precursor protein and M146L presenilin-1 mutations are a well-characterized model for spontaneous amyloid plaque formation. Bacopa monniera has a long history of use in India as an anti-aging and memory-enhancing ethnobotanical therapy. To evaluate the effect of Bacopa monniera extract (BME) on amyloid (Abeta) pathology in PSAPP mice, two doses of BME (40 or 160 mg/kg/day) were administered starting at 2 months of age for either 2 or 8 months. Our present data suggests that BME lowers Abeta 1-40 and 1-42 levels in cortex by as much as 60%, and reverses Y-maze performance and open field hyperlocomotion behavioral changes present in PSAPP mice. The areas encompassed by Congo Red-positive fibrillar amyloid deposits, however, were not altered by BME treatment. The data suggest that BME has potential application in Alzheimer's disease therapeutics.
