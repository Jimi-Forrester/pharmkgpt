37206564|t|Autophagy in the pharmacological activities of celastrol (Review).
37206564|a|Celastrol, a natural compound extracted from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, possesses broad-spectrum pharmacological properties. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process through which cytoplasmic cargo is delivered to the lysosomes for degradation. Autophagy dysregulation contributes to multiple pathological processes. Therefore, targeting autophagic activity is a promising therapy for various diseases, as well as a drug-development strategy. According to previous studies, autophagy is specifically targeted and may be altered in response to celastrol treatment, highlighting that autophagy modulation is an important mechanism underlying the therapeutic efficacy of celastrol for the treatment of various diseases. The present study summarizes the currently available information regarding the role of autophagy in the effect of celastrol to exert anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, anti-atherosclerosis, anti-pulmonary fibrosis and anti-macular degeneration activities. The diverse signaling pathways involved are also analyzed to provide insight into the mechanisms of action of celastrol and thereby pave the way for establishing celastrol as an efficacious autophagy modulator in clinical practice.
