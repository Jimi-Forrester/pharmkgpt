35889043|t|Oral Dysbiosis and Neurodegenerative Diseases: Correlations and Potential Causations.
35889043|a|Biofilms are a heterogenous complex community of vegetative cells and extracellular polymeric substances that can adhere to various surfaces and are responsible for a variety of chronic and acute diseases. The impact of bacterial biofilms on oral and intestinal health is well studied, but the correlation and causations of biofilms and neurodegenerative diseases are still in their infancy. However, the correlations between biofilms and diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and even Parkinson's Disease are starting to demonstrate the role bacterial biofilms have in promoting and exasperating various illnesses. The review article provides insight into the role bacterial biofilms may have on the development and progression of various neurodegenerative diseases and hopefully shine a light on this very important area of research.
