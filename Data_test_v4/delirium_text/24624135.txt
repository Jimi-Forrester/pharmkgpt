24624135|a|Long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have added an unexpected layer of complexity in the regulation of gene expression. Mounting evidence now links long ncRNAs to fundamental biological processes such as development and differentiation, and recent research shows important involvement of long ncRNAs in a variety of diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, spinocerebellar ataxia, and Huntington's diseases. Furthermore, long ncRNAs are speculated to be implicated in development of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. Long ncRNAs contribute to these disorders in diverse ways, from regulation of transcription to modulation of RNA processing and translation. In this review, we describe the diverse mechanisms reported for long ncRNAs, and discuss how they could mechanistically be involved in the development of neurological disorders.
