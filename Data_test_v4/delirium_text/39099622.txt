39099622|t|Mid-Atlantic primary care providers' perception of barriers and facilitators to end-of-life conversation.
39099622|a|Background: Among the chronically ill, end-of-life conversations are often delayed until emergently necessary and the quality of those conversations and subsequent decision-making become compromised by critical illness, uncertainty, and anxiety. Many patients receive treatment that they would have declined if they had a better understanding of benefits and risks. Primary care providers are ideal people to facilitate end-of-life conversations, but these conversations rarely occur in the out-patient setting. Objective: To investigate the self-reported experiences of physicians and advanced practice nurses with conversational barriers and facilitators while leading end-of-life discussions in the primary care setting. Design: A qualitative descriptive study. Methods: Six physicians and eight advanced practice nurses participated in singular semi-structured interviews. Results were analyzed using a qualitative descriptive design and content analysis approach to coding. Results: Reported barriers in descending order included resistance from patients and families, insufficient time, and insufficient understanding of prognosis and associated expectations. Reported facilitators in descending order included established trusting relationship with provider, physical and/or cognitive decline and poor prognosis; and discussion standardization per Medicare guidelines. Conclusion: Recommendations for improving the end-of-life conversational process in the primary care setting include further research regarding end-of-life conversational facilitators within families, the improvement of patient/family education about hospice/palliative care resources and examining the feasibility of longer appointment allotment.1.
