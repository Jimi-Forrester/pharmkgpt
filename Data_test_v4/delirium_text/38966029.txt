38966029|t|CHARACTERISTICS AND TREATMENT OUTCOMES OF UROLOGIC PATIENTS ADMITTED TO THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT, OSIJEK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL CENTER.
38966029|a|The postoperative care unit at the Department of Urology has significantly improved treatment of patients undergoing surgical procedures and reduced admission of urologic patients to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We examined the characteristics of urologic patients, time on mechanical ventilation, most common complications, and mortality in the period from January 2017 to March 2022. A total of 84 admissions to ICU were recorded, accounting for 1.5% of all patients having undergone surgical, therapeutic or diagnostic interventions under general or regional anesthesia at the Department of Urology. The most common reasons for admission to ICU were respiratory failure (79 patients), hemodynamic instability, and bleeding. The median time on mechanical ventilation was 9.7 [2.4-58.2] hours in urology patients vs. 6 [3-14.7] hours in the rest of surgical ICU patients (p=0.058). Hypertension and renal failure were more common in urologic than in the rest of surgical ICU patients (p<0.05). The overall mortality of urologic patients was lower than in the rest of surgical ICU patients (10.7% vs. 18.99%, p=0.08) but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Independently of the lower mortality, improvements in the outcome of urologic patients admitted to the ICU are feasible. Early identification of patients at risk of infections, postoperative respiratory failure, cardiovascular incidents, and bleeding may further reduce mortality and improve outcomes.
