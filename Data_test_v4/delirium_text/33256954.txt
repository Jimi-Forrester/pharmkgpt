33256954|t|The Winter Respiratory Viral Season During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
33256954|a|The winter respiratory virus season always poses challenges for long-term care settings; this winter, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 will compound the usual viral infection challenges. This special article discusses unique considerations that Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) brings to the health and well-being of residents and staff in nursing homes and other long-term care settings this winter. Specific topics include preventing the spread of respiratory viruses, promoting immunization, and the diagnosis and treatment of suspected respiratory infection. Policy-relevant issues are discussed, including whether to mandate influenza immunization for staff, the availability and use of personal protective equipment, supporting staff if they become ill, and the distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available. Research is applicable in all of these areas, including regarding the use of emerging electronic decision support tools. If there is a positive side to this year's winter respiratory virus season, it is that staff, residents, family members, and clinicians will be especially vigilant about potential infection.
