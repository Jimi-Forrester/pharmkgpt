29128930|a|Amyloid positron emission tomography ([18F] florbetaben (FBB) PET) can be used to determine concomitant Alzheimer's disease (AD) in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) patients. FBB PET scans and the tap test were performed in 31 patients with clinically suspected iNPH, and amyloid positive (iNPH/FBB+) and negative (iNPH/FBB-) groups were compared with respect to clinical characteristics. We evaluated prognostic value of FBB PET scans by analyzing the response to the tap test using a linear mixed model. We also performed a multivariable regression analysis to investigate whether amyloid PET positivity can predict the positive tap test response independent of other AD biomarkers. The results showed that the iNPH/FBB+ group (7/31, 22.6%) had a higher percentage of APOE4 carriers, lower Abeta42, higher CSF t-tau, and p-tau/Abeta42 ratio than the iNPH/FBB- group (24/31, 77.4%), while the two groups did not differ in imaging characteristics. The iNPH/FBB- group had a higher percentage of tap responders and showed a greater improvement in gait scores after the tap test than the iNPH/FBB+ group (group-tap test effect interaction, p = 0.035). A multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that amyloid positivity on PET scans (OR 0.03, p = 0.029) and CSF p-tau (OR 0.87, p = 0.044) were independently associated with the positive tap test response. Among 21 tap responders in the iNPH/FBB- group, 14 patients received shunt surgery and 12/14 (85.7%) patients showed symptom improvement. Our findings suggest that amyloid PET scans can help determine which iNPH patients will benefit from shunt surgery by discriminating concomitant AD.
