39103787|a|BACKGROUND: The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification is the most used system to assess patient health status before surgery, ranging from I to V levels. This study aims to explore the impact of different ASA risk classes (ASA II [mild risk] and ASA III [severe risk]) on clinical outcomes following hip fracture surgery, including all-cause mortality and postoperative complications. METHODS: A retrospective analysis from 2019 to 2021 across three Jordanian centers was conducted. The study included patients aged 65 and above who underwent hip fracture repair surgeries. Preoperative measures, intraoperative management protocols, and postoperative care were collected. Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records, including demographics, fracture type, intraoperative data, and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: The analysis included 1033 patients, with 501 (48.5%) in the mild anesthetic risk group (ASA I-II) and 532 (51.5%) in the severe anesthetic risk group (ASA III-V). The mean age was 73 years, with a higher prevalence of males in the severe risk group. Patients in the severe risk group had more comorbidities, higher ICU admissions (15.23% vs. 6.18%), longer hospital stays (median 7 vs. 6 days), and higher rates of postoperative thromboembolic complications (3.39% vs. 1.39%) compared to the mild risk group. Additionally, the severe risk group showed higher mortality rates both in-hospital mortality (3.38% vs. 1.39%) and all-cause mortality (16.92% vs. 10.36%). Multivariate analysis identified higher ASA score as independent risk factors for increased all-cause mortality (HR = 1.64 95%CI 1.51-2.34) and thromboembolic complications (OR = 2.85 95%CI 1.16-7). Length of hospital stay was significantly associated with higher ASA score (OR = 1.04 95%CI 0.96-1.11). CONCLUSION: The study underscores the significant impact of anesthetic risk on the outcomes of hip fracture surgeries. Patients with higher ASA scores associated with severe systemic diseases may have at increased risk of adverse outcomes.
