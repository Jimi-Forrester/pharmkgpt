39791605|t|Spinal Anesthesia in Elderly Patients With Femoral Neck Fractures on Apixaban Therapy: A Case Series.
39791605|a|This case series reviews surgeries involving elderly patients with femoral neck fractures on apixaban who underwent spinal anesthesia (SA) within 72 hours of their last dose. Despite patients being on anticoagulation, no neurological complications occurred, suggesting SA may be practical in cases where the benefits of timely surgery outweigh the potential risks, including apixaban discontinuation for a period of less than the recommended 72 hours with detectable levels of the drug remaining in the plasma. Quantitative apixaban measurements offered useful anticoagulation status insights, though safe thresholds remain undefined.
