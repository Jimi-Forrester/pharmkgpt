37108809|t|Leveraging Exosomes as the Next-Generation Bio-Shuttles: The Next Biggest Approach against Th17 Cell Catastrophe.
37108809|a|In recent years, the launch of clinical-grade exosomes is rising expeditiously, as they represent a new powerful approach for the delivery of advanced therapies and for diagnostic purposes for various diseases. Exosomes are membrane-bound extracellular vesicles that can act as biological messengers between cells, in the context of health and disease. In comparison to several lab-based drug carriers, exosome exhibits high stability, accommodates diverse cargo loads, elicits low immunogenicity and toxicity, and therefore manifests tremendous perspectives in the development of therapeutics. The efforts made to spur exosomes in drugging the untreatable targets are encouraging. Currently, T helper (Th) 17 cells are considered the most prominent factor in the establishment of autoimmunity and several genetic disorders. Current reports have indicated the importance of targeting the development of Th17 cells and the secretion of its paracrine molecule, interleukin (IL)-17. However, the present-day targeted approaches exhibit drawbacks, such as high cost of production, rapid transformation, poor bioavailability, and importantly, causing opportunistic infections that ultimately hamper their clinical applications. To overcome this hurdle, the potential use of exosomes as vectors seem to be a promising approach for Th17 cell-targeted therapies. With this standpoint, this review discusses this new concept by providing a snapshot of exosome biogenesis, summarizes the current clinical trials of exosomes in several diseases, analyzes the prospect of exosomes as an established drug carrier and delineates the present challenges, with an emphasis on their practical applications in targeting Th17 cells in diseases. We further decode the possible future scope of exosome bioengineering for targeted drug delivery against Th17 cells and its catastrophe.
