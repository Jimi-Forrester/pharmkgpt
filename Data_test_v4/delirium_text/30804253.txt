30804253|t|GPER agonist G1 suppresses neuronal apoptosis mediated by endoplasmic reticulum stress after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.
30804253|a|Studies have confirmed a strong association between activation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. In this study, three key proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway (glucose-regulated protein 78, caspase-12, and C/EBP homologous protein) were selected to examine the potential mechanism of endoplasmic reticulum stress in the neuroprotective effect of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor. Female Sprague-Dawley rats received ovariectomy (OVX), and then cerebral I/R rat models (OVX + I/R) were established by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Immediately after I/R, rat models were injected with 100 mug/kg E2 (OVX + I/R + E2), or 100 mug/kg G protein-coupled estrogen receptor agonist G1 (OVX + I/R + G1) in the lateral ventricle. Longa scoring was used to detect neurobehavioral changes in each group. Infarct volumes were measured by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Morphological changes in neurons were observed by Nissl staining. Terminal dexynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling staining revealed that compared with the OVX + I/R group, neurological function was remarkably improved, infarct volume was reduced, number of normal Nissl bodies was dramatically increased, and number of apoptotic neurons in the hippocampus was decreased after E2 and G1 intervention. To detect the expression and distribution of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, caspase-12 distribution and expression were detected by immunofluorescence, and mRNA and protein levels of glucose-regulated protein 78, caspase-12, and C/EBP homologous protein were determined by polymerase chain reaction and western blot assay. The results showed that compared with the OVX + I/R group, E2 and G1 treatment obviously decreased mRNA and protein expression levels of glucose-regulated protein 78, C/EBP homologous protein, and caspase-12. However, the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor antagonist G15 (OVX + I/R + E2 + G15) could eliminate the effect of E2 on cerebral I/R injury. These results confirm that E2 and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor can inhibit the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins and neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus, thereby improving dysfunction caused by cerebral I/R injury. Every experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Review Board at the First Affiliated Hospital of Shihezi University School of Medicine, China (approval No. SHZ A2017-171) on February 27, 2017.
