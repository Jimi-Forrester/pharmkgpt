36905760|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in the world. The aggregation of both amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides extracellularly and Tau proteins intracellularly plays key roles in the pathological consequences of AD, which lead to cholinergic neurodegeneration and eventually death. Currently, there are no effective methods to stop the progression of AD. Using ex vivo, in vivo and clinical approaches, we investigated the functional effects of plasminogen on the widely used FAD, Abeta42 oligomer or Tau intracranial injection-induced AD mouse model and explored its therapeutic effects on patients with AD. The results show that intravenously injected plasminogen rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB); increases plasmin activity in the brain; colocalizes with and effectively promotes the clearance of Abeta42 peptide and Tau protein deposits ex vivo and in vivo; increases the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) level and decreases the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity; and improves the memory functions. Clinically, when GMP-level plasminogen was administered to 6 AD patients for 1-2 weeks, their average scores on the Minimum Mental State Examination (MMSE), which is a standard scoring system used to measure the memory loss and cognitive deficits, were extremely significantly improved by 4.2 +- 2.23 points, e.g., an average increase from 15.5 +- 8.22 before treatment to 19.7 +- 7.09 after treatment. The preclinical study and pilot clinical study suggest that plasminogen is effective in treating AD and may be a promising drug candidate.
