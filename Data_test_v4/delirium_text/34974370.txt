34974370|a|With the increasing demand of new drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), screening acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors from traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) has been proved to be an effective strategy for drug discovery. In present study, a novel strategy was developed to fish out AChE inhibitors from Terminalia chebula fruits based on immobilized AChE coupled with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) and molecular docking. For AChE immobilization, cellulose filter paper (CFP) as the carrier was modified with chitosan to be introduced to amino groups, and then AChE was modified on the amino-modified CFP through a Schiff base reaction with glutaraldehyde as a cross-linking agent. The CPF-immobilized AChE possessed advantages of a wider range for pH and temperature endurance, better storage stability, excellent reproducibility and reusability. The CPF-immobilized AChE was incubated with the extract of T. chebula fruits, and then the active components would form complexes with immobilized AChE. The complexes were further conveniently separated with inactive components by virtue of the instantaneous separation characteristic of CFP. Eventually, 25 (1-11, 13-26) potential AChE inhibitors were fished out and their structures were further identified by UPLC-QTOF-MS. Moreover, molecular docking was performed to discriminate non-specific compounds to AChE and explore binding mechanisms between potential inhibitors and AChE, and 25 compounds could be well embedded into active sites of AChE with affinities ranging from -9.9 to -6.4 kcal/mol. Inhibitory activities of screened active components on AChE were evaluated in vitro, and punicalagin, 1,3,6-tri-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose (1,3,6-TGG), chebulinic acid and geraniin exhibited excellent AChE-inhibitory properties with IC50 values of 0.43 +- 0.03, 0.46 +- 0.02, 0.50 +- 0.03 and 0.51 +- 0.03 mM, respectively. The results indicated that the developed method was simple and efficient, and could be utilized to screen and identify potential AChE inhibitors from TCMs.
