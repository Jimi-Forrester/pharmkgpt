37570824|t|A Ratiometric Fluorescent Probe Based on RhB Functionalized Tb-MOFs for the Continuous Visual Detection of Fe3+ and AA.
37570824|a|In this study, a red-green dual-emitting fluorescent composite (RhB@MOFs) was constructed by introducing the red-emitting organic fluorescent dye rhodamine B (RhB) into metal-organic frameworks (Tb-MOFs). The sample can be used as a ratiometric fluorescent probe, which not only avoids errors caused by instrument and environmental instability but also has multiple applications in detection. The results indicated that the RhB@MOFs exhibited a turned-off response toward Fe3+ and a turned-on response for the continuous detection of ascorbic acid (AA). This ratiometric fluorescent probe possessed high sensitivity and excellent selectivity in the continuous determination of Fe3+ and AA. It is worth mentioning that remarkable fluorescence change could be clearly observed by the naked eye under a UV lamp, which is more convenient in applications. In addition, the mechanisms of Fe3+- and AA-induced fluorescence quench and recovery are discussed in detail. This ratiometric probe displayed outstanding recognition of heavy metal ions and biomolecules, providing potential applications for water quality monitoring and biomolecule determination.
