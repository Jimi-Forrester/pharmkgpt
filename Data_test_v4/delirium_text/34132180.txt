34132180|a|As the world manages the impact of a global pandemic caused by COVID-19, the discovery of new antiviral agents has become way more relevant and urgent. Viruses are submicroscopic infectious agents that replicate inside the living cells of different organisms. These viruses use nucleic acids (both DNA and RNA) for further replication and maturity inside the cells. Some of the viruses responsible for various human and plant diseases belong to the classes of Picornaviridae, Retroviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Flaviviridae, Pneumoviridae, Virgaviridae, and Hepadnaviridae, and their treatment options are limited or non-existent. The consistent reemergence and resistance development in the viral strains demand the discovery and development of new antiviral drugs possessing better efficacy. Bio-active compounds isolated from fungi can be the source of new compounds with enhanced potency and new mechanisms of action. Fungi are known to produce a diverse lot of secondary metabolites due to their existence in harsh and testing climates which are often inhabitable for many organisms. Because of these unique environments, fungi produce a variety of secondary metabolites of different chemical classes like alkaloids, quinones, furanone, pyrones, benzopyranoids, xanthones, terpenes, steroids, peptides, and many acyclic compounds. Fungal metabolites are known to display a wide range of bioactive attributes, i.e., anticancer, antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-Alzheimer's, along with antiviral properties. In this review article, we report over 300 antiviral compounds from fungal sources during the period of 2009 to 2019. The source of these compounds is marine and endophytic fungi and they are arranged based on their antiviral action against different viral families. These compounds offer promise for their use and development as future antiviral drugs.
