39835563|t|Auranofin-loaded PLGA Nanoparticles for Neuroprotection against Aluminium-induced Alzheimer's Disease.
39835563|a|AIM: The aim of the current study was to explore nano-formulation for effective neuroprotection by auranofin. BACKGROUND: Currently, the treatment options for various CNS disorders, particularly neurodegenerative disorders, are greatly constrained. A significant obstacle in this pursuit is the blood-brain barrier, a shielding covering that hinders the route of numerous biochemical treatments into the brain. To overcome this problem, nanoformulation- based approaches are gaining interest, increasing the compound's BBB penetrability. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether nanoparticles fabricated from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) encapsulated with auranofin could oppose aluminium chloride-induced Alzheimer's disease. METHOD: Auranofin-encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles were prepared, and their particle size, Entrapment Efficiency (EE), distribution of particles, morphological surface charge, and structural characteristics were characterized. During the in vivo study, rats were orally administered AlCl3 at 100 mg/kg for 21 days. Meanwhile, auranofin and auranofin nanoparticles were orally administered at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg and 2.5 and 5 mg/kg, respectively, within 2 weeks. After the course therapy, the rats were decapitated, and the hippocampus was collected for the estimated biochemical and neuroinflammatory markers. RESULTS: The auranofin nanoparticles were characterized, revealing % entrapment efficiency (98%) and % loading dose (76%). The nanoparticles exhibited a morphological surface charge of 27.5 +- 5.10 mV, a polydispersity index of 0.438 +- 0.12, and a mean particle size of 101.5 +- 10.3 nm. In the in vivo study, administering a gold compound (auranofin) and formulation (auranofin nanoparticles) resulted in a significant improvement in cognitive deficits, changes in biochemical parameters, and markers of neuroinflammation triggered with aluminium chloride. CONCLUSION: The results have suggested that auranofin nanoparticles demonstrate abilities to protect neurons compared to auranofin alone. The noticed therapeutic benefits of the auranofin-encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles can be attributed to modulation in particle size with antioxidative and anti-inflammatory impacts of auranofin. Consequently, the outcome of the research has revealed that gold compound nanoparticles hold the potential to be a promising option for altering the therapeutic course of Alzheimer's disease.
