23194475|a|Chronic exposure to glucocorticoids might result not only in insulin resistance or cognitive deficits, but it is also considered as a risk factor for pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease. Propranolol is a beta-adrenergic antagonist commonly used in the treatment of hypertension or acute anxiety. The effects of propranolol (5 mg/kg) have been tested in a model of chronic corticosterone administration (100 mug/ml, 4 wk) in drinking water. Corticosterone administration led to cognitive impairment in the novel object recognition test that was reversed by propranolol. Increased levels of Abeta in the hippocampus of corticosterone-treated mice were counteracted by propranolol treatment, purportedly through an increased IDE expression. Chronic corticosterone treatment induced responses characteristic of insulin resistance, as increased peripheral insulin levels, decreased activation of the insulin receptor (pIR) and decreased associated intracellular pathways (pAkt). These effects might be related to a decreased c-Jun N terminal kinase 1 expression. Again, propranolol was able to counteract all corticosterone-induced effects. One of the main kinases involved in tau phosphorylation, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), which is inactivated by phosphorylation by pAkt, was found to be decreased after corticosterone and increased after propranolol treatment. Concomitant changes in pTau expression were found. Overall, these data further strengthen the potential of propranolol as a therapeutic agent for pathologies associated with the interaction glucocorticoids-insulin resistance and the development of relevant cellular processes for Alzheimer's disease.
