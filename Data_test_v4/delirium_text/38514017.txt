38514017|t|Interplay of mitochondria associated membrane proteins and autophagy: Implications in neurodegeneration.
38514017|a|Since the discovery of membrane contact sites between ER and mitochondria called mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), several pieces of evidence identified their role in the regulation of different cellular processes such as Ca2+ signalling, mitochondrial transport, and dynamics, ER stress, inflammation, glucose homeostasis, and autophagy. The integrity of these membranes was found to be essential for the maintenance of these cellular functions. Accumulating pieces of evidence suggest that MAMs serve as a platform for autophagosome formation. However, the alteration within MAMs' structure is associated with the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated autophagy is a hallmark of neurodegeneration. Here, in this review, we highlight the present knowledge on MAMs, their structural composition, and their roles in different cellular functions. We also discuss the association of MAMs proteins with impaired autophagy and their involvement in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
