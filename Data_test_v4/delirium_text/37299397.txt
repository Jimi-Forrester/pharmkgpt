37299397|a|The active components of ginseng, such as ginsenosides and polysaccharides, have high therapeutic value in treating cancer, decreasing obesity, and enhancing immunity. However, simple primary ginseng treatment cannot maximize this medicinal potential. Therefore, in this study, Panax ginseng was co-fermented with multi-enzyme-coupling probiotics to obtain a fermentation broth with higher levels of ginsenosides, polysaccharides, and probiotics. When compared to other treatment methods for cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression in mice, the results reveal that the P. ginseng fermentation broth treated with multi-enzyme-coupling probiotics could significantly improve the immune function of immunosuppressive mice and restore intestinal flora stability. Overall, this processing method will provide a novel strategy for promoting the application of ginseng and the relief of immunosuppression.
