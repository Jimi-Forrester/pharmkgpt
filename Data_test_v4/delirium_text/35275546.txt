35275546|t|A Multi-Dimensional Comparison of Alzheimer's Disease Neurodegenerative Biomarkers.
35275546|a|BACKGROUND: In the 2018 AT(N) framework, neurodegenerative (N) biomarkers plays an essential role in the research and staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the different choice of N may result in discordances. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare different potential N biomarkers. METHODS: We examined these N biomarkers among 1,238 participants from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) in their 1) diagnostic utility, 2) cross-sectional and longitudinal correlations between different N biomarkers and clinical variables, and 3) the conversion risk of different N profiles. RESULTS: Six neurodegenerative biomarkers changed significantly from preclinical AD, through prodromal AD to AD dementia stage, thus they were chosen as the candidate N biomarkers: hippocampal volume (HV), 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), total tau (T-tau), plasma neurofilament light chain (NFL), CSF NFL, and CSF neurogranin (Ng). Results indicated that FDG-PET not only had the greatest diagnostic utility in differentiating AD from controls (area under the curve: FDG-PET, 0.922), but also had the strongest association with cognitive scores. Furthermore, FDG-PET positive group showed the fastest memory decline (hazard ratio: FDG-PET, 3.45), which was also true even in the presence of amyloid-beta pathology. Moreover, we observed great discordances between three valuable N biomarkers (FDG-PET, HV, and T-tau). CONCLUSION: These results underline the importance of using FDG-PET as N in terms of cognitive decline and AD conversion, followed by HV, and could be a great complement to the AT(N) framework.
