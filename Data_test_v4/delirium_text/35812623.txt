35812623|t|Delirium in COVID-19: An Atypical Case Managed With Quetiapine.
35812623|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can present without the typical symptoms of respiratory tract infection. Delirium has been reported as a prominent feature leading to an atypical presentation in older adults infected with COVID-19. Here, we present the case of a 65-year-old female who came to our hospital with confusion and altered mental status. The patient maintained an asymptomatic course of illness after testing positive for COVID-19 two weeks prior to the hospital visit. An appropriate workup was done to rule out other causes of the patient's symptoms. During the next couple of days, the patient developed classic symptoms suggestive of delirium. The patient was eventually treated based on the general guidelines for delirium management due to the absence of adequate medical literature specifying the management of delirium in the population of interest. Thus, the patient was given a trial of an atypical antipsychotic, quetiapine, to which she responded well and was subsequently discharged one week later.
