36030055|t|Neurocircuitry Hypothesis and Clinical Experience in Treating Neuropsychiatric Symptoms of Postacute Sequelae of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2.
36030055|a|Persistent symptoms following COVID-19 infection have been termed postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Many of these symptoms are neuropsychiatric, such as inattention, impaired memory, and executive dysfunction; these are often colloquially termed "brain fog". These symptoms are common and often persist long after the acute phase. The pattern of these deficits combined with laboratory, neuroimaging, electroencephalographic, and neuropsychological data suggest that these symptoms may be driven by direct and indirect damage to the frontal-subcortical neural networks. Here, we review this evidence, share our clinical experience at an academic medical center, and discuss potential treatment implications. While the exact etiology remains unknown, a neurocircuit-informed understanding of postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can help guide pharmacology, neuromodulation, and physical and psychological therapeutic approaches.
