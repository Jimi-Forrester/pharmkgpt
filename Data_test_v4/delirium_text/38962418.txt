38962418|a|The purpose of this study was to develop and test the reliability and validity of a brief and comprehensive instrument to assess self-management, decision-making, and coping by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. A web-based questionnaire was administered to 300 COPD patients and a retest was administered to 100 COPD patients. Cronbach's alpha was used to assess internal consistency, and an intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated to test the reliability of the retest. The convergent and discriminant validities were also examined. Valid responses were obtained from 279 participants in the first survey and 70 participants in the retest. From our analysis, a COPD self-care assessment scale (CSCS) was developed, consisting of seven subscales and 14 items. Cronbach's alpha for the total CSCS score, intraclass correlation coefficient, and scale success rate were 0.80, 0.79, and 100%, respectively. A multivariate analysis showed that CSCS was associated with current smoking (standardized partial regression coefficient [std beta] = -0.30; p < 0.001), long-term oxygen therapy (std beta = 0.23; p < 0.001), and social support (std beta = 0.24; p < 0.001), but not psychological symptoms or quality of life. The CSCS is also useful in assessing self-management, decision-making, and coping in Japanese COPD patients, and the scale has high reliability and validity.
