38971720|t|Relationship between oral hypofunction and salivary biomarkers in older adults: a cross-sectional study.
38971720|a|BACKGROUND: Oral health problems have increased among older adults. Oral hypofunction is characterized by seven signs and symptoms: oral uncleanness, oral dryness, decline in occlusal force, decline in the movement function of the tongue and lips, decline in tongue pressure, decline in masticatory function, and decline in swallowing function, the latter being a significant risk factors for oral frailty. Recent research has suggested that salivary biomarkers can be used to assess not only oral diseases, including dental caries and periodontitis, but also systemic diseases, such as cancer and diabetes mellitus. This cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between oral hypofunction and the levels of salivary biomarkers. METHODS: In total, 116 patients, aged 65 years or older, were included in this cross-sectional study. If three or more signs or symptoms in seven kinds of tests met the criteria of each test, oral hypofunction was diagnosed. The levels of biomarkers in the saliva collected from the patients were analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: In total, 63.8% of patients were diagnosed with oral hypofunction. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that calprotectin levels in the saliva were significantly related to oral moisture and masticatory function. Furthermore, 8-OHdG levels in saliva were associated with the movement function of the tongue and lips and oral hygiene level, and salivary AGE correlated only with the movement function of the tongue and lips. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that calprotectin levels in the saliva were significantly correlated with the prevalence of oral hypofunction, even after adjusting for age, sex, and periodontal status. However, none of the biomarker levels in the saliva had a significant relationship with the number of examinations outside the reference range. CONCLUSIONS: Calprotectin, 8-OHdG, and AGE levels are associated with oral hypofunction in older adults.
