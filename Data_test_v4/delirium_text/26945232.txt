26945232|a|BACKGROUND: Ethyl acetate extracts of Launaea procumbens is used for the treatment of liver dysfunction as an herbal medicine in Pakistan. In this study, the protective effects of ethyl acetate extracts were evaluated against CCl4-induced liver injuries in rat. METHODS: To examine the protective effects against oxidative stress of carbon tetrachloride in rats, 30 male rats were equally divided into 5 groups (6 rats). Among five groups, one was treated with CCl4 (3 ml/kg i.p. in olive oil b.w.) twice a week for 4 weeks. Others were orally fed with extracts (100, 200 mg/kg b.w.), with CCl4 twice a week for 4 weeks. RESULTS: Administration of CCl4 altered the serum marker enzymes, lipid profile, CYP 2E1, p53 expression, antioxidant enzymes, nuclear organizer regions (AgNORs), and DNA. Supplement of L. procumbens ameliorated the effects of CCl4, improved CYP 2E1, p53, and increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes while activity of liver marker enzymes (ALP, ALT, AST, g-GT) and contents of lipid per oxidation contents (TBARS), AgNORs, and DNA fragmentation were decreased. Similarly body weight was increased while liver and relative liver weight was decreased with co-administration of various extracts, suggesting that L. procumbens effectively protect liver against the CCl4-induced oxidative damage in rats. CONCLUSION: The hepatoprotective and free radical scavenging effects might be due to the presence of bioactive constituents in the extract.
