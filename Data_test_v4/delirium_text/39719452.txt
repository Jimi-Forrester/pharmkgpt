39719452|a|Artemisia argyi Levl. et Vant. (A. argyi) leaf possesses various health promoting functions contributed by its main bioactive flavonoids. In this study, the anti-aging effect and mechanism of Artemisia argyi leaf extract (AALE) were identified using Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) as a model. The results showed that the AALE promoted the lifespan and stress resistance of C. elegans. It was found that the AALE boosted the expression of oxidative stress-related proteins by regulating the insulin/ IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway, which then activated the transcription factors DAF-16/FOXO. The results of RNA-sequence analysis indicated that the changes of genes in nematodes treated with AALE were associated with the responses against oxidative stress, cell maturation, and immune reaction, and stress. The positive results suggest that Artemisia argyi leaf could have the robust benefits for improving healthy aging as well as preventing aging-related diseases in the human body.
