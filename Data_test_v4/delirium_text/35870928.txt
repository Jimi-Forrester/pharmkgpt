35870928|t|Knockdown of myorg leads to brain calcification in zebrafish.
35870928|a|Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is a neurogenetic disorder characterized by bilateral calcified deposits in the brain. We previously identified that MYORG as the first pathogenic gene for autosomal recessive PFBC, and established a Myorg-KO mouse model. However, Myorg-KO mice developed brain calcifications until nine months of age, which limits their utility as a facile PFBC model system. Hence, whether there is another typical animal model for mimicking PFBC phenotypes in an early stage still remained unknown. In this study, we profiled the mRNA expression pattern of myorg in zebrafish, and used a morpholino-mediated blocking strategy to knockdown myorg mRNA at splicing and translation initiation levels. We observed multiple calcifications throughout the brain by calcein staining at 2-4 days post-fertilization in myorg-deficient zebrafish, and rescued the calcification phenotype by replenishing myorg cDNA. Overall, we built a novel model for PFBC via knockdown of myorg by antisense oligonucleotides in zebrafish, which could shorten the observation period and replenish the Myorg-KO mouse model phenotype in mechanistic and therapeutic studies.
