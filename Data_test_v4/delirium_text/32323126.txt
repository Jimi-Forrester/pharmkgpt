32323126|t|Stability Test of PACAP in Eye Drops.
32323126|a|PACAP is a neuropeptide with widespread distribution and diverse biological functions. It has strong cytoprotective effects mediated mainly through specific PAC1 receptors. Experimental data show protective effects of PACAP in the retina and cornea in several pathological conditions. Although intravitreal injections are a common practice in some ocular diseases, delivery of therapeutic agents in the form of eye drops would be more convenient and would lead to fewer side effects. We have previously shown that PACAP, in the form of eye drops, is able to pass through the ocular barriers and can exert retinoprotective effects. As eye drops represent a promising form of administration of PACAP in ocular diseases, it is important to investigate the stability of PACAP in solutions used in eye drops. In this study, the stability of PACAP1-27 and PACAP1-38 in eye drops was measured in four common media and a commercially available artificial tear solution at both room temperature and +4  C. Mass spectrometry results show that the highest stability was gained with PACAP1-38 in water and 0.9% saline solution at +4  C, representing 80-90% drug persistence after 2 weeks. PACAP1-38 in the artificial tear showed very fast degradation at room temperature, but was stable at +4  C. In summary, PACAP1-38 has higher stability than PACAP1-27, with highest stability at +4  C in water solution, but both peptides in each medium can be stored for relatively longer periods without significant degradation. These data can provide reference for future therapeutic use of PACAP in eye drops.
