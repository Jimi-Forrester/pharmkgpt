38430131|t|Structure of cytotoxic amyloid oligomers generated during disaggregation.
38430131|a|Amyloidosis is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of amyloid proteins. The causative proteins aggregate from monomers to oligomers and fibrils, among which some intermediate oligomers considered as major toxins. Cytotoxic oligomers are generated not only by aggregation but also via fibril disaggregation. However, little is known about the structural characteristics and generation conditions of cytotoxic oligomers produced during disaggregation. Herein, we summarized the structural commonalities of cytotoxic oligomers formed under various disaggregation conditions, including the addition of heat shock proteins or small compounds. In vitro experimental data demonstrated the presence of high-molecular-weight oligomers (protofibrils or protofilaments) that exhibited a fibrous morphology and beta-sheet structure. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the distorted beta-sheet structure contributed to their metastability. The tendency of these cytotoxic oligomers to appear under mild disaggregation conditions, implied formation during the early stages of disaggregation. This review will aid researchers in exploring the characteristics of highly cytotoxic oligomers and developing drugs that target amyloid aggregates.
