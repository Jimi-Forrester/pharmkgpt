37517157|a|Our present work demonstrates the molecular hybridization-assisted design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of 22 benzylpiperazine-linked 1,2,4-triazole compounds (PD1-22) as AD modifying agents. All the compounds were tested for their in vitro hChEs, hBACE-1, and Abeta-aggregation inhibition properties. Among them, compound PD-08 and PD-22 demonstrated good hChE and hBACE-1 inhibition as compared to standards donepezil and rivastigmine. Both compounds displaced PI from PAS at 50 microM concentration which was comparable to donepezil and also demonstrated anti-Abeta aggregation properties in self- and AChE-induced thioflavin T assay. Both compounds have shown excellent BBB permeation via PAMPA-BBB assay and were found to be non-neurotoxic at 80 microM concentration against differentiated SH-SY5Y cell lines. Compound PD-22 demonstrated an increase in rescued eye phenotype in Abeta-phenotypic drosophila AD model and amelioration of behavioral deficits in the Abeta-induced rat model of AD. The in-silico docking studies of compound PD-22 revealed a good binding profile towards CAS and PAS residues of AChE and the catalytic dyad of the BACE-1. The 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation studies of compound PD-22 complexed with AChE and BACE-1 enzymes suggested stable ligand-protein complex throughout the simulation run. Based on our findings compound PD-22 could further be utilized as a lead to design a promising candidate for AD therapy.
