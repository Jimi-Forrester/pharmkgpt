39023234|t|Hospital falls clinical practice guidelines: a global analysis and systematic review.
39023234|a|BACKGROUND: Hospital falls continue to be a persistent global issue with serious harmful consequences for patients and health services. Many clinical practice guidelines now exist for hospital falls, and there is a need to appraise recommendations. METHOD: A systematic review and critical appraisal of the global literature was conducted, compliant with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Epistemonikos, Infobase of Clinical Practice Guidelines, Cochrane CENTRAL and PEDro databases were searched from 1 January 1993 to 1 February 2024. The quality of guidelines was assessed by two independent reviewers using Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Global Rating Scale and Appraisal of Guidelines of Research and Evaluation Recommendation Excellence (AGREE-REX). Certainty of findings was rated using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research. Data were analysed using thematic synthesis. RESULTS: 2404 records were screened, 77 assessed for eligibility, and 20 hospital falls guidelines were included. Ten had high AGREE-REX quality scores. Key analytic themes were as follows: (i) there was mixed support for falls risk screening at hospital admission, but scored screening tools were no longer recommended; (ii) comprehensive falls assessment was recommended for older or frail patients; (iii) single and multifactorial falls interventions were consistently recommended; (iv) a large gap existed in patient engagement in guideline development and implementation; (v) barriers to implementation included ambiguities in how staff and patient falls education should be conducted, how delirium and dementia are managed to prevent falls, and documentation of hospital falls. CONCLUSION: Evidence-based hospital falls guidelines are now available, yet systematic implementation across the hospital sector is more limited. There is a need to ensure an integrated and consistent approach to evidence-based falls prevention for a diverse range of hospital patients.
