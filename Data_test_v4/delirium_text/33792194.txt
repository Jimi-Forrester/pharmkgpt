METHODS: We consecutively recruited 37 controls and 77 patients with AD-related cognitive impairment (ADCI) and/or LBD-related cognitive impairment (LBCI). Diagnoses of ADCI and LBCI were supported by amyloid PET and dopamine transporter PET, respectively. There were 22 patients with ADCI, 19 patients with LBCI, and 36 patients with mixed ADCI/LBCI. We investigated the relationship between ADCI, LBCI, graph theory-based network measures on diffusion tensor images, and cognitive dysfunction using general linear models after controlling for age, sex, education, deep WM hyperintensities (WMH), periventricular WMH, and intracranial volume. RESULTS: LBCI, especially mixed with ADCI, was associated with increased normalized path length and decreased normalized global efficiency. LBCI was related to the decreased nodal degree of left caudate, which was further associated with broad cognitive dysfunction. Decreased left caudate nodal degree was associated with decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the brain regions vulnerable to LBD. Compared with the control group, the LBCI group had an increased betweenness centrality in the occipital nodes, which was associated with decreased FA in the WM adjacent to the striatum and visuospatial dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Concomitant ADCI and LBCI are associated with the accentuation of LBCI-related WM network disruption centered in the left caudate nucleus. The increase of occipital betweenness centrality could be a characteristic biologic change associated with visuospatial dysfunction in LBCI.
