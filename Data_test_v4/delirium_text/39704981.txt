39704981|a|BACKGROUND: The Italian Fund for Alzheimer's and other dementias approved in 2020 enabled the conducting of a survey in the Italian Centers for Cognitive Disorders and Dementias (CCDDs) to analyse the organization, the administrative features and the professionals' characteristics. AIMS: To investigate the current use of neuropsychological (NP) tests in Italian CCDDs and the association between the use of a basic set of tests for neuropsychological assessment (NPA) and organizational/structural characteristics of CCDDs. METHODS: A survey was conducted with an online questionnaire in all CCDDs between July 2022 and February 2023. To verify the use of a comprehensive NPA in the diagnosis of cognitive disorders and dementia, we identified a minimum core test (MCT). RESULTS: The CCDDs using a Minimum Core Test (MCT) significantly increased from 45.7% in 2015 to the current 57.1%. Territorial CCDDs using MCT significantly increased from 24.9% in 2015 to 37% in 2022 (p = 0.004). As multivariable results, the presence of psychologist/neuropsychologist in the staff and the University-based/IRCCS CCDDs increased the probability of using MCT (OR = 9.2; 95% CI 5.6-15.0; p < 0.001 and OR = 5.4; 95% CI 1.9-15.9; p = 0.002, respectively), while CCDDs in Southern Italy-Islands showed a lower probability than those in the North (OR = 0.4; 95% CI 0.2-0.7; p = 0.001). DISCUSSION: Almost half of CCDDs (43%) do not use MCT in their clinical practice. The presence of the psychologist/neuropsychologist on the staff has a key role in the adoption of MCT and regional differences have increased over the past years. NPA is crucial in the diagnostic process and in characterizing risk profiles in order to implement targeted interventions for risk reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Our results could help to identify good practices aimed at improving dementia diagnosis. An intervention by health policymakers is urgently needed with the aim of improving diagnostic appropriateness and overcoming regional differences.
