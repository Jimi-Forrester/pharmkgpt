38555420|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with complex pathogenesis and effective clinical treatment strategies for this disease remain elusive. Interestingly, nanomedicines are under extensive investigation for AD management. Currently, existing redox molecules show highly bioactive property but suffer from instability and high production costs, limiting clinical application for neurological diseases. Compared with natural enzymes, artificial enzymes show high stability, long-lasting catalytic activity, and versatile enzyme-like properties. Further, the selectivity and performance of artificial enzymes can be modulated for neuroinflammation treatments through external stimuli. In this review, we focus on the latest developments of metal, metal oxide, carbon-based and polymer based nanozymes and their catalytic mechanisms. Recent developments in nanozymes for diagnosing and treating AD are emphasized, especially focusing on their potential to regulate pathogenic factors and target sites. Various applications of nanozymes with different stimuli-responsive features were discussed, particularly focusing on nanozymes for treating oxidative stress-related neurological diseases. Noninvasiveness and focused application to deep body regions makes ultrasound (US) an attractive trigger mechanism for nanomedicine. Since a complete cure for AD remains distant, this review outlines the potential of US responsive nanozymes to develop future therapeutic approaches for this chronic neurodegenerative disease and its emergence in AD management.
