36640138|a|BACKGROUND: Comparisons of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) are confounded by age. METHODS: We compared biomarkers from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), magnetic resonance imaging, and amyloid imaging with Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) across four groups of 387 cognitively normal participants, 42 to 65 years of age, in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) and the Adult Children Study (ACS) of LOAD: DIAN mutation carriers (MCs) and non-carriers (NON-MCs), and ACS participants with a positive (FH+) and negative (FH-) family history of LOAD. RESULTS: At baseline, MCs had the lowest age-adjusted level of CSF Abeta42 and the highest levels of total and phosphorylated tau-181, and PiB uptake. Longitudinally, MC had similar increase in PiB uptake to FH+, but drastically faster decline in hippocampal volume than others, and was the only group showing cognitive decline. DISCUSSION: Preclinical ADAD and LOAD share many biomarker signatures, but cross-sectional and longitudinal differences may exist.
