33371377|t|The Effect of Intraoperative Magnesium Sulphate Infusion on Emergence Agitation after Ambulatory Ophthalmic Surgery in Children.
33371377|a|This study investigated whether intraoperative infusion of magnesium sulphate reduces the incidence of emergence agitation (EA) in paediatric patients who undergo ambulatory ophthalmic surgery using the Paediatric Anaesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale. Ninety-two paediatric patients who were scheduled for elective ophthalmic surgery were randomly allocated to two groups: control or magnesium. In the magnesium group, patients received an initial intravenous loading dose of 30 mg/kg of 10% solution of magnesium sulphate over 10 min and then a continuous infusion of 10 mg/kgxh during the surgery. In the control group, an equal volume of 0.9% isotonic saline was administered in the same way as in the magnesium group. The PAED scale was assessed at 15-min intervals until the PAED score reached below 10 at the postanaesthetic care unit. EA was defined as a PAED score of 10 or higher. Of the 86 patients recruited, 44 and 42 were allocated to the control and magnesium groups, respectively. The incidence of EA was 77.3% in the control group and 57.1% in the magnesium group (odds ratio, 0.392; 95% confidence interval, 0.154 to 0.997; p = 0.046). The intraoperative infusion of magnesium sulphate significantly reduced the incidence of EA.
