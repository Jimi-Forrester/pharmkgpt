8916107|a|Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) show considerable heterogeneity in the rate at which they decline cognitively. The biological basis for this heterogeneity is unknown. We genotyped 86 subjects with diagnoses of probable AD to determine if they carried the alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) A allele, which has been associated with AD, or the CYP2D6 B mutant, found at increased frequency in the Lewy body variant (LBV) of AD. We then examined longitudinally-collected cognitive data to determine if these genetic markers were associated with rate of cognitive decline. Our results indicate that neither the ACT A allele nor the CYP2D6 B allele have a significant association with rate of decline on the Folstein Mini Mental State examination. Further, subjects with both the ACT A allele and the apolipoprotein epsilon 4 allele showed no evidence of accelerated decline. These findings suggest that any increased risk of developing AD or LBV conferred by these markers is not necessarily accompanied by a more rapid rate of decline.
