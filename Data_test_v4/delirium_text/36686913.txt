36686913|t|Synthesis, characterization, and in vitro anti-cholinesterase screening of novel indole amines.
36686913|a|The present study involved the targeted synthesis and characterization of novel indole amines with anti-acetylcholinesterase profiling. A series of proposed indole amines was virtually screened against human acetylcholinesterase. A few indole amines (23, 24, and 25) showing strong enzyme binding in the in silico studies were synthesized in the laboratory and characterized using spectroscopic (IR, UV, NMR, single crystal XRD) and spectrometric (EIMS, HR-EIMS) methods. The indole amine 23 was crystallized from EtOH and analyzed with single crystal XRD. These ligands interacted with the PAS site in the enzyme, and their binding may disrupt the activity. The in vitro acetylcholinesterase inhibition studies revealed that the IC50 values for indole amines 25 and 24 (4.28 and 4.66 muM, respectively) were comparable to that of galantamine (4.15 muM) and may be studied further as cost-effective acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.
