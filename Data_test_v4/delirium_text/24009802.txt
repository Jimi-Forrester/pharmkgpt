24009802|t|Delirium followed by neuroleptic malignant syndrome in rehabilitation setting. Is it anger reaction before discharge?
24009802|a|Delirium and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) are two uncommon syndromes that are often unrecognized or misdiagnosed by the primary physicians as functional psychiatric disorders. The infrequency and the heterogeneity of clinical manifestation, progression and outcome with which those diagnoses are encountered (particularly in chronic rehabilitation settings) make them formidable diagnostic challenge. In this report, we present a case in which there was a misdiagnosis of delirium and NMS as functional psychiatric disorders. This report demonstrates the fact that early recognition and intervention in such cases are essential to prevent the grave outcome and potential fatality. The authors believe that there is a key role for the consulting psychiatrist in this area in providing diagnostic clarity and advice regarding management and ongoing staff education.
