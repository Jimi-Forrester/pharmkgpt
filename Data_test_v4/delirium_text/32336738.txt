32336738|a|Traditional Chinese and Japanese medicines have become prime sources of drug discovery and there is a pressing need to investigate the effectiveness of these traditional medicines for modern drug discovery. Recently, among various traditional formulations, studies on Kangen-karyu (Guan-Yuan-Ke-Li), a mixture of six medicinal herbs (Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix, Cnidii Rhizoma, Paeoniae Radix, Carthami Flos, Aucklandiae Radix, and Cyperi Rhizoma), have been growing to assess its neuroprotective role. This prompted us to undertake a thorough review of various targets of Kangen-karyu regarding its effectiveness against Alzheimer's disease, particularly focusing on cholinesterases, beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1, and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta. This review provides new insights into Kangen-karyu medication as a prospective anti-Alzheimer's medication and indicates the need for in-depth in vivo investigation in the future.
