37445910|t|Monocytes in the Characterization of Pain in Palliative Patients with Severe Dementia-A Pilot Study.
37445910|a|In assessing and managing pain, when obtaining a self-report is impossible, therapeutic decision-making becomes more challenging. This study aimed to investigate whether monocytes and some membrane monocyte proteins, identified as a cluster of differentiation (CD), could be potential non-invasive peripheral biomarkers in identifying and characterizing pain in patients with severe dementia. We used 53 blood samples from non-oncological palliative patients, 44 patients with pain (38 of whom had dementia) and 0 without pain or dementia (controls). We evaluated the levels of monocytes and their subtypes, including classic, intermediate, and non-classic, and characterized the levels of specific phenotypic markers, namely CD11c, CD86, CD163, and CD206. We found that the relative concentrations of monocytes, particularly the percentage of classic monocytes, may be a helpful pain biomarker. Furthermore, the CD11c expression levels were significantly higher in patients with mixed pain, while CD163 and CD206 expression levels were significantly higher in patients with nociceptive pain. These findings suggest that the levels of monocytes, particularly the classic subtype, and their phenotype markers CD11c, CD163, and CD206 could serve as pain biomarkers in patients with severe dementia.
