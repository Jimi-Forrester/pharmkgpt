22504719|t|Pulmonary drug delivery: Implication for new strategy for pharmacotherapy for neurodegenerative disorders.
22504719|a|Innovative drug delivery in the treatment of brain neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has the potential to avoid many unwanted side effects over current medications. Advances in understanding of these diseases and their treatments have led to the search for novel modes of drug delivery. In this review, we have highlighted new strategies and future prospects for pulmonary delivery of drugs for the management of these important neurological disorders. The advancement of knowledge on pulmonary drug delivery will provide novel therapeutic formulations for better management of the PD and AD patients throughout the world.
