38376922|a|Pathological opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is implicated in the pathogenesis of many disease processes such as myocardial ischemia, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes. While we have gained insight into mPTP biology over the last several decades, the lack of translation of this knowledge into successful clinical therapies underscores the need for continued investigation and use of different approaches to identify novel regulators of the mPTP with the hope of elucidating new therapeutic targets. Although the mPTP is known to be a voltage-gated channel, the identity of its voltage sensor remains unknown. Here we found decreased gating potential of the mPTP and increased expression and activity of sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR) in newborn Fragile X syndrome (FXS) mouse heart mitochondria, a model system of coenzyme Q excess and relatively decreased mPTP open probability. We further found that pharmacological inhibition and genetic silencing of SQOR increased mPTP open probability in vitro in adult murine cardiac mitochondria and in the isolated-perfused heart, likely by interfering with voltage sensing. Thus, SQOR is proposed to contribute to voltage sensing by the mPTP and may be a component of the voltage sensing apparatus that modulates the gating potential of the mPTP.
