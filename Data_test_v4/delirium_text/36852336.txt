36852336|a|The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) causes a severe acute illness with the development of respiratory distress syndrome in some cases. COVID-19 is a global problem of mankind to this day. Among its most important aspects that require in-depth study are pathogenesis and molecular changes in severe forms of the disease. A lot of literature data is devoted to the pathogenetic mechanisms of COVID-19. Without dwelling in detail on some paths of pathogenesis discussed, we note that at present there are many factors of development and progression. Among them, this is the direct role of both viral non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and host ncRNAs. One such class of ncRNAs that has been extensively studied in COVID-19 is microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Moreover, Initially, it was believed that this COVID-19 was limited to damage to the respiratory system. It has now become clear that COVID-19 affects not only the liver and kidneys, but also the nervous system. In this review, we summarized the current knowledge of mechanisms, risk factors, genetics and neurologic impairments in COVID-19. In addition, we discuss and evaluate evidence demonstrating the involvement of miRNAs and lnRNAs in COVID-19 and use this information to propose hypotheses for future research directions.
