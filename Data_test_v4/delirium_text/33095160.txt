33095160|t|SON and SRRM2 are essential for nuclear speckle formation.
33095160|a|Nuclear speckles (NS) are among the most prominent biomolecular condensates. Despite their prevalence, research on the function of NS is virtually restricted to colocalization analyses, since an organizing core, without which NS cannot form, remains unidentified. The monoclonal antibody SC35, raised against a spliceosomal extract, is frequently used to mark NS. Unexpectedly, we found that this antibody was mischaracterized and the main target of SC35 mAb is SRRM2, a spliceosome-associated protein that sharply localizes to NS. Here we show that, the core of NS is likely formed by SON and SRRM2, since depletion of SON leads only to a partial disassembly of NS, while co-depletion of SON and SRRM2 or depletion of SON in a cell-line where intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of SRRM2 are genetically deleted, leads to a near-complete dissolution of NS. This work, therefore, paves the way to study the role of NS under diverse physiological and stress conditions.
