25705326|t|Targeting Metal-Abeta Aggregates with Bifunctional Radioligand [11C]L2-b and a Fluorine-18 Analogue [18F]FL2-b.
25705326|a|Interest in quantifying metal-Abeta species in vivo led to the synthesis and evaluation of [11C]L2-b and [18F]FL2-b as radiopharmaceuticals for studying the metallobiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. [11C]L2-b was synthesized in 3.6% radiochemical yield (nondecay corrected, n = 3), >95% radiochemical purity, from the corresponding desmethyl precursor. [18F]FL2-b was synthesized in 1.0% radiochemical yield (nondecay corrected, n = 3), >99% radiochemical purity, from a 6-chloro pyridine precursor. Autoradiography experiments with AD positive and healthy control brain samples were used to determine the specificity of binding for the radioligands compared to [11C]PiB, a known imaging agent for beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregates. The Kd for [11C]L2-b and [18F]FL2-b were found to be 3.5 and 9.4 nM, respectively, from those tissue studies. Displacement studies of [11C]L2-b and [18F]FL2-b with PiB and AV-45 determined that L2-b binds to Abeta aggregates differently from known radiopharmaceuticals. Finally, brain uptake of [11C]L2-b was examined through microPET imaging in healthy rhesus macaque, which revealed a maximum uptake at 2.5 min (peak SUV = 2.0) followed by rapid egress (n = 2).
