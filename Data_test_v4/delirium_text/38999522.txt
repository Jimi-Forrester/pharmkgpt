38999522|t|Effects of Remimazolam versus Sevoflurane on Hemodynamics in Patients Undergoing Coil Embolization of Cerebral Aneurysm: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial.
38999522|a|Background: Cerebral aneurysm coil embolization is often performed under general anesthesia to prevent patient movement and sudden high blood pressure. However, the optimal anesthetic agent remains uncertain. This study aimed to determine whether maintaining anesthesia with remimazolam in patients undergoing coil embolization could avoid hypotension or hypertension compared to sevoflurane. Methods: Thirty-three adult patients participated in this single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Patients in Group R were induced and maintained with remimazolam, whereas those in Group S received propofol and sevoflurane. Results: The use of remimazolam significantly reduced the incidence of intraoperative hypotension events (33.3% vs. 80.0%; p = 0.010) but did not change the incidence of hypertension events (66.7% vs. 73.3%; p = 0.690). Patients in Group R maintained a significantly higher range of maximal (100.2 +- 16.6 vs. 88.1 +- 13.5 mmHg; p = 0.037) and minimal (69.4 +- 6.6 vs. 63.4 +- 4.8 mmHg; p = 0.008) mean arterial blood pressure than those in Group S during the intervention. Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate the feasibility of maintaining general anesthesia with remimazolam in patients undergoing cerebral aneurysm coil embolization. The findings suggest that remimazolam may maintains better hemodynamic stability, reducing the incidence of hypotensive events without compromising patient safety.
