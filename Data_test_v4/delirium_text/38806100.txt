38806100|a|The alterations in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are the complex outputs of functional factors, such as normal physiological aging, pathological process, which results in further cognitive decline. It is not clear that when brain aging initiates, but elderly people are vulnerable to be incipient of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. The EEG signals were recorded from 20 healthy middle age and 20 healthy elderly subjects while performing a working memory task. Higuchi's fractal dimension (HFD), Katz's fractal dimension (KFD), sample entropy and three Hjorth parameters were extracted to analyse the complexity of EEG signals. Four machine learning classifiers, multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbour (KNN), and logistic model tree (LMT) were employed to distinguish the EEG signals of middle age and elderly age groups. HFD, KFD and Hjorth complexity were found significantly correlated with age. MLP achieved the highest overall accuracy of 93.75%. For posterior region, the maximum accuracy of 92.50% was achieved using MLP. Since fractal dimension associated with the complexity of EEG signals, HFD, KFD and Hjorth complexity demonstrated the decreased complexity from middle age to elderly groups. The complexity features appear to be more appropriate indicators of monitoring EEG signal complexity in healthy aging.
