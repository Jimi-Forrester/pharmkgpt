36448971|a|ABSTRACT: The increased presence of senescent cells in different neurological diseases suggests the contribution of senescence in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders. Microglia can adapt to any type of disturbance of the homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS) and its altered activity can lead to permanent and unresolvable damage. The aim of this work was to characterize the behavioural phenotype of spared nerve injury (SNI) mice and then associate it to senescence-related mechanisms. In this work we investigated the timing of the onset of anxiety, depression, or memory decline associated with peripheral neuropathic pain, and their correlation with the presence of microglial cellular senescence. SNI mice showed a persistent pain hypersensitivity from 3 days after surgery. 28 days after nerve injury they also developed anxiety, depression, and cognitive impairment. The appearance of these symptoms was coincident to a significant increase of senescence markers, such as beta-galactosidase and senescent-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), at microglial level in the spinal cord and hippocampus of SNI animals. These markers were unaltered at previous time points. In murine immortalized microglial cells (BV2) stimulated with LPS 500 ng/mL for 10 days (4h/day) every other day, we observed an increase of beta-galactosidase, SASP appearance, a reduction of cell viability and an increase of Senescence-Associated Heterochromatic Foci (SAHF). Therefore, present findings could represent an important step to a better understanding of the pathophysiological cellular mechanisms in comorbidities related to neuropathic pain states.
