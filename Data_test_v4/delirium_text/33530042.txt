33530042|a|OBJECTIVES: To investigate changes in sUA in patients with TBI or patients after cerebral tumor surgery and the possible mechanism of these changes. METHODS: This prospective cohort study enrolled patients with TBI or underwent cerebral tumor surgery at West China Hospital, China, from November 2014 to May 2018. Serum UA (sUA) levels, urine excretion, UA oxidant product allantoin and other clinical parameters were assessed. RESULTS: 100 patients were enrolled for analysis. sUA in patients with TBI or underwent cerebral tumor surgery started to decline from day 1 after injury or surgery compared to control. This decreasing trend continued from day 3 (143.2+-59.3 mumol/L, 188.8+-49.4 mumol/L vs 287.3+-80.2 mumol/L, p<0.0001) until day 7. No difference in urinary UA excretion was found in the TBI group or cerebral tumor surgery group. Urine allantoin and the allantoin to sUA ratio of the TBI group decreased on day 3 compared with the control group. The structural equation model showed that the sUA level was related to the Glasgow coma score (GCS) (r=0.5383, p<0.0001), suggesting the potential association of UA with consciousness level, as well as serum protein and electrolytes including albumin, calcium and phosphate. CONCLUSION: The sUA was decreased in patients with TBI or underwent cerebral tumor surgery.
