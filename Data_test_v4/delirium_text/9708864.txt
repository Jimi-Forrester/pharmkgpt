9708864|t|Absence of association between Alzheimer disease and the -491 regulatory region polymorphism of APOE.
9708864|a|A novel polymorphism (-491 A/T) within the regulatory region on the apolipoprotein E gene has recently been reported to be associated with risk for Alzheimer disease (AD). To test this association in an independent data set, we have examined this polymorphism in a sample of 88 well-characterized AD cases and compared the allele frequency and genotype frequencies for this polymorphism with those observed in 112 cognitively normal subjects drawn from the same ethnic group. These results suggest that in the current data set at least, the -491 A/T polymorphism is not associated with risk for AD, but may be in partial linkage disequilibrium with the APOE epsilon2/epsilon3/epsilon4 polymorphism.
