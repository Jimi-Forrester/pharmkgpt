37495606|t|A radiological cadaveric study of obturator nerve involvement and cranial injectate spread after different approaches to the fascia iliaca compartment block.
37495606|a|Whether the fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) involves the obturator nerve (ON) remains controversial. Involvement may require that the injectate spreads deep in the cranial direction, and might thus depend on the site of injection. Therefore, the effect of suprainguinal needle insertion with five centimeters of hydrodissection-mediated needle advancement (S-FICB-H) on ON involvement and cranial injectate spread was studied in this radiological cadaveric study. Results were compared with suprainguinal FICB without additional hydrodissection-mediated needle advancement (S-FICB), infrainguinal FICB (I-FICB), and femoral nerve block (FNB). Seventeen human cadavers were randomized to receive ultrasound-guided nerve block with a 40 mL solution of local anesthetic and contrast medium, on both sides. Injectate spread was objectified using computed tomography. The femoral and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves were consistently covered when S-FICB-H, S-FICB or FNB was applied, while the ON was involved in only one of the 34 nerve blocks. I-FICB failed to provide the same consistency of nerve involvement as S-FICB-H, S-FICB or FNB. Injectate reached most cranial in specimens treated with S-FICB-H. Our results demonstrate that even the technique with the most extensive cranial spread (S-FICB-H) does not lead to ON involvement and as such, the ON seems unrelated to FICB. Separate ON block should be considered when clinically indicated.
