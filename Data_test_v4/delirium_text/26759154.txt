26759154|t|Noteworthy Articles in 2015 for Cardiothoracic Critical Care.
26759154|a|In 2015, the demand for the presence of cardiothoracic anesthesiologists outside of the cardiac operating rooms continues to expand. Most notably, cardiothoracic anesthesiologists now find themselves called on to care for patients postoperatively in the cardiothoracic surgical intensive care unit. This article is the first in this annual series to review relevant contributions in postoperative cardiac critical care that may influence the cardiac anesthesiologist. We explore the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, management of postoperative atrial fibrillation and coagulopathy, metabolic support of the critically ill cardiothoracic surgical patient, and new insights into delirium and acute kidney injury.
