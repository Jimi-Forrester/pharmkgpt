34883265|t|Fe3O4@polydopamine nanoparticle-loaded human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells improve the cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease mice by promoting hippocampal neurogenesis.
34883265|a|One of the most promising treatments for neurodegenerative diseases is the stem cell therapy; however, there are still some limitations in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, superparamagnetic nanoparticles composed of magnetic Fe3O4 and polydopamine shells were used to label human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) in order to increase the targeting of hUC-MSCs. Our data suggested that Fe3O4@PDA labeling increase the efficiency of hUC-MSCs entering the brain. Moreover, the water maze test showed that compared with hUC-MSCs only, Fe3O4@PDA-labeled hUC-MSCs improved the cognitive ability of APP/PS1 transgenic mice more significantly. Other experimental data showed that the expression of essential proteins in the hippocampus, such as Abeta, synaptophysin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, are affected by Fe3O4@PDA coated-hUC-MSCs. The regulation of Fe3O4@PDA coated-hUC-MSCs could improve the memory and cognitive ability of AD mice by excessive generation of neuroprotective factors, which might be considered a viable therapy to treat AD.
