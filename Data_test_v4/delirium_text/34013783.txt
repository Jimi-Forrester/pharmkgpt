34013783|a|Aim: Galantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor frequently used in Alzheimer's disease management. Its cholinergic adverse effects and rapid elimination limit its therapeutic outcomes. We investigated the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of 2-week intranasal galantamine-bound chitosan nanoparticles (G-NP) treatment in scopolamine-induced Alzheimer's disease rat model. Materials & methods: Behavioral, neurobiochemical and histopathological changes were assessed and compared with oral and nasal solutions. Brain uptake and pharmacokinetics were determined using a novel validated LC/MS assay. Results: G-NP enhanced spatial memory, exploring behavior and cholinergic transmission in rats. Beta-amyloid deposition and Notch signaling were suppressed and the histopathological degeneration was restored. G-NP potentiated galantamine brain delivery and delayed its elimination. Conclusion: G-NP hold promising therapeutic potentials and brain targeting, outperforming conventional galantamine therapy.
