34873049|a|OBJECTIVE: Advancement in healthcare provision has led to increasing octogenarian ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) presentation to hospital for early revascularisation therapies. Limited literature to date exists to suggest octogenarian STEMI population; with majority of trials excluding these age group patients. Due to an ageing population, we expect increasing rates of STEMI in the octogenarian and nonagenarian population in the future. This study seeks to identify the outcomes of patients over the age of 80 presenting with STEMI and determine the factors associated with better or worse outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study is a single-centre retrospective observational study involving patients' age 80 or older presenting with STEMI between January 2014 and December 2019. Patient data were collected by chart review and analysis of the local STEMI database. Standard Bayesian statistics were employed for analysis. RESULTS: 1301 patients presented with STEMI during this period. 159/1301 (12.2%) were 80 years or older that fulfilled STEMI criteria, 35/159 (22.1%) were medically managed. 107/124 (86.29%) had angiographic evidence of acute total or partial thrombotic occlusion, and 97/107 were treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). The activation ECG most commonly exhibited an anterior STEMI, while inferior STEMI ECGs had the strongest positive predictive value. PPCI group had a 30-day mortality rate of 20% (p=0.07) and 1-year mortality was 22.4%. Highest mortality was observed with cardiogenic shock, low ejection fraction, higher high sensitivity cardiac troponin T and creatinine at presentation. Conservatively managed patients had significant higher mortality rate (48% vs 22.4%, p=0.005) at 1 year. CONCLUSION: Patients over the age of 80 who present with STEMI and undergo PPCI have a significantly lower mortality rate at 1 year. These patients have a 77.6% survival at 1 year, with 92.4% likelihood of discharge to home (without need for long-term nursing home care). Cardiogenic shock in this group was associated with a 1-year mortality of 87.5%. Despite the advanced age, we suggest favourable outcomes described in the absence of patients presenting with cardiogenic shock.
