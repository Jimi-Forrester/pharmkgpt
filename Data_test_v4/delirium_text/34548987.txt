34548987|t|Cannabis-Induced Malignant Catatonia: A Medical Emergency and Review of Prior Case Series.
34548987|a|Few case reports of catatonia associated with cannabis use are reported. Here, we describe a case of a 35-year-old African American male who developed malignant catatonia following heavy cannabis use. The patient was brought to the emergency department (ED) for altered mental status, hypertension, and erratic behavior. Before his ED presentation, he was smoking cannabis in heavy amounts, confirmed by positive urine toxicology in ED. Initial lab results showed leukocytosis, elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels. Head CT scans without contrast, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, were nonsignificant. In ED, the patient was agitated, combative, mute, and rigid. He was sedated using 2 mg of intramuscular (IM) midazolam. Psychiatric consultation services suspected catatonia, and the patient scored 12 points on Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS). Although the patient's symptoms responded to 2 mg of IM lorazepam, the patient later relapsed, became tachycardic with blood pressure fluctuations, and his repeat BFCRS score was 18. At this point, the patient was diagnosed as having malignant catatonia, and his lorazepam dosage was increased up to 6 mg IM per day. After a few days of waxing and waning of his symptoms, he finally started to show constant improvement and gradually reduced his symptoms. Our case highlights the first-ever reported case of malignant catatonia associated with cannabis use.
