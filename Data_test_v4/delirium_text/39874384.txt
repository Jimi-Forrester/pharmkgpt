39874384|t|CT scan-derived pectoralis muscle parameters are closely associated with COVID-19 outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
39874384|a|BACKGROUND: The relationships between pectoralis muscle parameters and outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain uncertain. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library from 1 January 2019 to 1 May 2024 to identify non-overlapping studies evaluating pectoralis muscle-associated index on chest CT scan with clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients. Random-effects and fixed-effects meta-analyses were performed, and heterogeneity between studies was quantified using the I2 statistic. The risk of study bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Funnel plots for detecting small-study effects. RESULTS: A total of 9 studies with 4109 COVID-19 patients were included. The meta-analysis findings revealed a correlation between pectoralis muscle parameters and COVID-19 prognosis. Specifically, patients with higher pectoralis muscle density (PMD) exhibited a lower mortality risk, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.92-0.99). The rate of intubation was lower in COVID-19 patients with a high pectoralis muscle index (PMI) (OR =  0.96, 95% CI: 0.92-1.00). CONCLUSION: In summary, a low PMD is associated with a marginally elevated risk of mortality, whereas a decreased PMI represents a risk factor for intubation in COVID-19 patients. These findings suggest that pectoralis muscle parameters on chest CT may be a useful prognostic tool for COVID-19 patients.
