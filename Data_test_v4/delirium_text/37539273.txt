37539273|a|Objectives: Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) with severe stenosis or occlusion of the true lumen of aortic arch branch vessels often leads to an increased incidence of severe postsurgical neurological complications and mortality rate. In this study, we aimed to introduce our institutional extra-anatomic revascularization and cannulation strategy with improved postoperative outcomes for better management of patients with cerebral malperfusion in the setting of ATAAD. Methods: Twenty-eight patients with ATAAD complicated by severe stenosis or occlusion of the aortic arch branch vessels, as noted on combined computed tomography angiography of the aorta and craniocervical artery, between January 2021 and June 2022 were included in this study. Basic patient characteristics, surgical procedures, hospitalization stays, and early follow-up results were analyzed. Results: The median follow-up duration was 16.5 months (interquartile range: 11.5-20.5), with a 100% completion rate. The 30-day mortality rates was 7.1% (2/28 patients); two patients had multiple cerebral infarctions on preoperative computed tomography and persistent coma. Postoperative transient neurological dysfunction occurred in 10.7% (3/28) of the patients, and no new permanent neurological dysfunction occurred. Of all the patients, 3.6% (1/28) had novel acute renal failure. No other deaths, secondary surgeries, or serious complications occurred during the early follow-up period. Conclusions: Use of extra-anatomic revascularization and a new cannulation strategy before cardiopulmonary bypass is safe and feasible and may reduce the high incidence of postoperative neurological complications in patients with ATAAD and cerebral malperfusion.
