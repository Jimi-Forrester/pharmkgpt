37372869|t|The Relationship between Nursing Practice Environment and Pressure Ulcer Care Quality in Portugal's Long-Term Care Units.
37372869|a|BACKGROUND: The morbidity associated with ageing has contributed to an increase in the prevalence of Pressure Ulcers (PUs) in all care settings. The impact of these on people's quality of life and the extent of the associated economic and social burden constitutes today, by their importance, a serious public health problem. This study aims to describe the nursing work environment in Portuguese long-term care (LTC) units and to assess how this environment relates to the quality of PU care. METHODS: A longitudinal study among inpatients with PUs was conducted in LTC units. The Nursing Work Index-Revised Scale (NWI-R) was sent to all nurses in these units. Cox proportional hazard models were used to relate the satisfaction degree with the service (measured by the NWI-R-PT items) to the healing time of the PUs, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: A total of 165 of 451 invited nurses completed the NWI-R-PT. Most were women (74.6%) and had 1 to 5 years of professional experience. Less than half (38.4%) had education in wound care. Of the 88 patients identified with PUs, only 63 had their PU documented, highlighting the difficulties in updating electronic records. The results showed that the level of concordance with Q28 "Floating so that staffing is equalised among units" is strongly associated with a shorter PU healing time. CONCLUSION: A good distribution of nursing staff over the units will likely improve the quality of wound care. We found no evidence for possible associations with the questions on participation in policy decisions, salary level, or staffing educational development and their relationship with PUs healing times.
