36611911|a|Characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and neuroinflammation, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no known treatment or cure. Global disease projections warrant an urgent and rapid therapeutic for the treatment of this devastating disease. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a widely accepted and safely used treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection and other metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus. FMT has also been demonstrated to be a possible AD therapeutic. We examined the potential of FMT for the treatment of AD in a robust, mouse model of the disease and report that a brief, 7-day treatment regimen demonstrated 'plaque-busting' and behavior-modifying effects in treated 5xFAD mice. Importantly, we show that donor age plays an important role in the efficacy of the treatment and these findings warrant further investigation in human trials.
