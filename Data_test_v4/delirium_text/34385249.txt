34385249|t|Opioid analgesic use after ambulatory surgery: a descriptive prospective cohort study of factors associated with quantities prescribed and consumed.
34385249|a|OBJECTIVES: To prospectively characterise: (1) postoperative opioid analgesic prescribing practices; (2) experience of patients undergoing elective ambulatory surgeries and (3) impact of patient risk for medication misuse on postoperative pain management. DESIGN: Longitudinal survey of patients 7 days before and 7-14 days after surgery. SETTING: Academic urban safety-net hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 181 participants recruited, 18 surgeons, follow-up data from 149 participants (82% retention); 54% women; mean age: 49 years. INTERVENTIONS: None. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Total morphine equivalent dose (MED) prescribed and consumed, percentage of unused opioids. RESULTS: Surgeons postoperatively prescribed a mean of 242 total MED per patient, equivalent to 32 oxycodone (5 mg) pills. Participants used a mean of 116 MEDs (48%), equivalent to 18 oxycodone (5 mg) pills (~145 mg of oxycodone remaining per patient). A 10-year increase in patient age was associated with 12 (95% CI (-2.05 to -0.35)) total MED fewer prescribed opioids. Each one-point increase in the preoperative Graded Chronic Pain Scale was associated with an 18 (6.84 to 29.60) total MED increase in opioid consumption, and 5% (-0.09% to -0.005%) fewer unused opioids. Prior opioid prescription was associated with a 55 (5.38 to -104.82) total MED increase in opioid consumption, and 19% (-0.35% to -0.02%) fewer unused opioids. High-risk drug use was associated with 9% (-0.19% to 0.002%) fewer unused opioids. Pain severity in previous 3 months, high-risk alcohol, use and prior opioid prescription were not associated with postoperative prescribing practices. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with a preoperative history of chronic pain, prior opioid prescription, and high-risk drug use were more likely to consume higher amounts of opioid medications postoperatively. Additionally, surgeons did not incorporate key patient-level factors (eg, substance use, preoperative pain) into opioid prescribing practices. Opportunities to improve postoperative opioid prescribing include system changes among surgical specialties, and patient education and monitoring.
