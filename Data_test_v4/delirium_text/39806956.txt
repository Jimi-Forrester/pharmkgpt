39806956|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a major challenge in developing effective treatments due to its complex pathophysiology, including the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology offers promise for targeted gene silencing, but effective delivery to the central nervous system remains a significant obstacle. Viral vectors have emerged as potent delivery vehicles for transporting siRNA to neural tissues. This review explores the utilization of viral vectors for siRNA delivery in AD, focusing on delivery strategies and challenges. We discuss the design and optimization of viral vectors, targeting strategies, and safety considerations. Additionally, we examine recent advancements and prospects for enhancing viral vector-mediated siRNA delivery in AD.
