34558510|a|At present, treatments for Alzheimer's disease can temporarily relieve symptoms but cannot prevent the decline of cognitive ability and other neurodegenerative changes. Dendrobium nobile Lindl alkaloid is the main active component of Dendrobium nobile Lindl. Dendrobium nobile Lindl alkaloid has been shown to resist aging, prolong life span, and exhibit immunomodulatory effects in animals. This review summarizes the mechanisms behind the neuroprotective effects reported in Alzheimer's disease animal models. The neuroprotective effects of Dendrobium nobile Lindl alkaloid have not been studied in patients. The mechanisms by which Dendrobium nobile Lindl alkaloid has been reported to improve cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease animal models may be associated with extracellular amyloid plaque production, regulation of tau protein hyperphosphorylation, inhibition of neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, activation of autophagy, and enhanced synaptic connections.
