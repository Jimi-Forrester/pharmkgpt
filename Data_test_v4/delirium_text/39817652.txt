39817652|a|Catatonia may manifest as an independent entity or as a feature of a neuropsychiatric or medical illness. While electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the gold standard treatment for catatonia, it is typically administered if the patient's symptoms fail to respond to benzodiazepines. We describe the case of a 22-year-old male with Budd Chiari induced cirrhosis and no prior psychiatric history, who presented with symptoms of psychosis and hepatic encephalopathy, was treated in the ICU for multi-factorial delirium, developed symptoms of catatonia that failed to respond to lorazepam, ultimately requiring ECT with a favorable response. This report hopes to add to the literature by discussing potential etiologies of catatonia and by providing an illustrative example of the treatment of catatonia and its considerations in patients with hepatic impairment.
