32107424|t|Mechanistic insights into the deleterious roles of Nasu-Hakola disease associated TREM2 variants.
32107424|a|Recently, the critical roles played by genetic variants of TREM2 (Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2) in Alzheimer's disease have been aggressively highlighted. However, few studies have focused on the deleterious roles of Nasu-Hakola disease (NHD) associated TREM2 variants. In order to get insights into the contributions made by these variants to neurodegeneration, we investigated the influences of four NHD associated TREM2 mutations (Y38C, W50C, T66M, and V126G) on loss-of-function, and followed this with in silico prediction and conventional molecular dynamics simulation. NHD mutations were predicted to be highly deleterious by eight different in silico bioinformatics tools and found to induce conformational changes by molecular dynamics simulation. As compared with the wild-type, the four variants produced substantial differences in the collective motions of loop regions, which not only promoted structural remodeling in the CDR2 (complementarity-determining region 2) loop but also in the CDR1 loop, by changing inter- and intra-loop hydrogen bonding networks. In addition, structural studies in a free energy landscape analysis showed that Y38, T66, and V126 are crucial for maintaining the structural features of CDR1 and CDR2 loops, and that mutations in these positions produced steric clashes and loss of ligand binding. These results showed the presence of mutations in the TREM2 ectodomain induced flexibility and caused structural alterations. Dynamical scenarios, as provided by the present study, may be critical to our understanding of the roles of these TREM2 mutations in neurodegenerative diseases.
