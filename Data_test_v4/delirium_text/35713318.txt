35713318|t|Does propofol definitely improve postoperative cognitive dysfunction?-a review of propofol-related cognitive impairment.
35713318|a|Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common brain function-related complication after surgery. In addition to old age being an independent risk factor, anesthetics are also important predisposing factors. Among them, propofol is the most commonly used intravenous anesthetic in clinical practice. It has a rapid onset, short half-life, and high recovery quality. Many studies report that propofol can attenuate surgery-induced cognitive impairment, however, some other studies reveal that propofol also induces cognitive dysfunction. Therefore, this review summarizes the effects of propofol on the cognition, and discusses possible related mechanisms, which aims to provide some evidence for the follow-up studies.
