In addition, the utility of short versions of WAIS-III for estimating IQ scores and index scores were examined. METHODS: The subjects were 83 patients with probable AD, 33 patients with probable DLB, and 83 cognitively normal individuals. RESULTS: Patients with DLB showed significantly lower scores in Performance IQ and Processing Speed compared with those with AD. The short versions of WAIS-III with Information, Similarities, Arithmetic, Digit Span, Picture Completion, Digit Symbol-Coding, and Block Design demonstrated relatively small amount of error, high correlations, and reliabilities with the full version. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that Performance IQ and Processing Speed in WAIS-III can be an indicator for differentiating AD and DLB in WAIS-III, and a short version obtained by the Similarities, Information, Picture Completion, Block Design, Arithmetic, Digit Span, and Digit-Symbol Coding yields high accuracy and can be used to estimate full-scale IQ scores on the WAIS-III.
