26260627|t|Region-Specific Alterations of Matrix Metalloproteinase Activity in Multiple System Atrophy.
26260627|a|BACKGROUND: MSA is a sporadic progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a variable combination of parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and autonomic dysfunction. The pathological hallmark of MSA is the accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates in the cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes along with neuronal loss and neuroinflammation, as well as blood-brain barrier dysfunction and myelin deterioration. Matrix metalloproteinases are zinc-dependent endopeptidases involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix, demyelination, and blood-brain barrier permeability. Several lines of evidence indicate a role for these enzymes in various pathological processes, including stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: This study aimed to assess potential alterations of matrix metalloproteinase-1, -2, -3, and -9 expression or activity in MSA postmortem brain tissue. RESULTS: Gelatin zymography revealed increased matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity in the putamen, but not in the frontal cortex, of MSA patients relative to controls. Immunohistochemistry revealed increased number of glial cells positive for matrix metalloproteinase-1, -2, and -3 in the putamen and frontal cortex of MSA patients. Double immunofluorescence revealed that matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -3 were expressed in astrocytes and microglia. Only matrix metalloproteinase-2 colocalized with alpha-synuclein in oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate widespread alterations of matrix metalloproteinase expression in MSA and a pattern of increased matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression and activity affecting preferentially a brain region severely affected (putamen) over a relatively spared region (frontal cortex). Elevated matrix metalloproteinase expression may thus contribute to the disease process in MSA by promoting blood-brain barrier dysfunction and/or myelin degradation.
