35223217|t|Management of Complex Pelvic Ring and Acetabular Fracture Associated With Open Tibia Fracture in Severe Polytrauma Patient: A Case Report.
35223217|a|With the increase of high energy injuries, acetabular and pelvic ring fractures tend to be a more common part of polytrauma patients. Despite growing incidence, management of these injuries remains one of the most difficult challenges in orthopedic surgery. As these patients are usually multiply injured, it is not only life-threatening trauma in acute settings but also crippling in long time. We present a case of a 40-year-old male who suffered from a dreadful traffic accident following the fractures of pelvic ring and both acetabulum, open fracture of tibia, urinary bladder rupture, and crush syndrome. We discuss the factors which dictated the timing of definitive management of pelvic and associated injuries and compare it with this study. Furthermore, we present patients' final outcomes and management of long-term complications.
