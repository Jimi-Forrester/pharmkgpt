37657964|a|COVID-19 is associated with a range of neurological, cognitive, and mental health symptoms both acutely and chronically that can persist for many months after infection in people with long-COVID syndrome. Investigations of cognitive function and neuroimaging have begun to elucidate the nature of some of these symptoms. They reveal that, although cognitive deficits may be related to brain imaging abnormalities in some people, symptoms can also occur in the absence of objective cognitive deficits or neuroimaging changes. Furthermore, cognitive impairment may be detected even in asymptomatic individuals. We consider the evidence regarding symptoms, cognitive deficits, and neuroimaging, as well as their possible underlying mechanisms.
