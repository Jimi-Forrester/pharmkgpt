34573252|a|A substantial amount of amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulates in the occipital cortices; however, it draws less attention. We investigated the clinical implications of Abeta accumulation in the occipital lobes in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum. [18F]-Florbetaben amyloid PET scans were performed in a total of 121 AD or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients. Of the 121 patients, 74 Abeta positive patients were divided into occipital Abeta positive (OCC+) and occipital Abeta negative (OCC-) groups based on Abeta accumulation in the bilateral occipital lobes. The OCC+ group (41/74, 55.4%) was younger and had a younger age at onset than the OCC- group. The OCC+ group also had an increased standard uptake value ratio in the occipital lobes and greater cortical thinning in relevant areas. The OCC+ group had a higher global deterioration scale, lower performance for the copy, immediate recall, delayed recall, and recognition in Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure tests than the OCC- group, although both groups had similar disease durations. AD or aMCI patients in the OCC+ group exhibited features noted in early onset AD with relevant neuropsychological and image findings. Occipital Abeta positivity in amyloid PET scans need to be considered as an underestimated marker of early onset AD continuum.
