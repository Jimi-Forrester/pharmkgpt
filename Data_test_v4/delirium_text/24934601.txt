24934601|a|Amyloidogenesis is associated with more than 30 human diseases, including Alzheimer's which is related to aggregation of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta). Here, consecutive stages of Abeta42 aggregation and amyloid fibril formation were followed electrochemically via oxidation of tyrosines in Abeta42 adsorbed on the basal plane graphite electrode and directly correlated with Abeta42 morphological changes observed by atomic force microscopy of the same substrate. The results offer new tools for analysis of mechanisms of Abeta aggregation.
