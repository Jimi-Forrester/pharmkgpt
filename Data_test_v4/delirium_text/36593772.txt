36593772|t|A Network Pharmacology-Based Study on the Mechanism of Dibutyl Phthalate of Ocimum basilicum L. against Alzheimer's Disease through the AKT/GSK-3beta Pathway.
36593772|a|Background: Ocimum basilicum L. (OBL) is mainly used to treat neurological diseases in China. The preliminary work of this group showed that OBL improves cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying pharmacological mechanism remains unclear. Methods: The components of OBL were compiled by literature search, and their active ingredients were screened by online database. The drug targets of OBL in the treatment of AD were predicted and analyzed using information derived from sources such as the SwissTargetPrediction tool. And through the network visual analysis function of Cytoscape software and protein-protein interaction analysis (PPI), the core targets of OBL treatment of AD are predicted. Furthermore, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were employed to analyze the related signaling pathways affected by OBL. Moreover, AutoDock software was used to assess the potential binding affinity between the core targets and the active compounds. Subsequently, in vivo experiment was conducted to verify the findings of network pharmacology. Results: A total of 35 active compounds and 188 targets of OBL were screened, of which 43 common targets were related to AD. The active compounds of 35 OBLs induced 118 GO and 78 KEGG. The results of PPI and network topology parameter analysis show that targets such as MAPK1, GSK3B, NR3C2, ESR1, and EGFR are known as the core targets for the treatment of AD by OBL and are docked with the active ingredients of OBL. Molecular docking results suggest that diterbutyl phthalate (DBP) may be the main active component of OBL for the treatment of AD. Flow cytometry analysis results showed that apoptosis decreased with increasing DBP dose. In addition, DBP significantly decreased the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the supernatant of Abeta 25-35-induced injury HT22 cell cultures, and it can be speculated that DBP has the ability to protect the stability of injured neuronal cells and improve the permeability of cell membranes, thus stabilizing the intracellular environment. Mechanistically, DBP may increase the mRNA levels of AKT, GSK-3beta, etc. in AD cell models and regulate the phosphorylation of AKT/GSK-3beta pathway-related. Conclusions: Conclusively, our study suggests that DBP, the main active component of OBL, has potential in the prevention or treatment of AD.
