37058882|a|Patients with dementia are in themselves more vulnerable, and have been especially affected by the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, both directly due to the disease itself, and indirectly due to the deprivation of cognitive stimulation due to isolation social due to confinement. SARS-CoV-2 virus infection has given rise to a wide variety of symptoms, including neurological symptoms and especially delirium in the elderly with dementia. The virus has affected the central nervous system, both directly due to the neurotropism of the virus, and indirectly due to inflammation and tissue hypoxia of vascular origin. The different causes that have been able to lead, in the different waves prior to the omicron variant, to the significant increase in morbidity and mortality in patients with dementia, especially the elderly, are analyzed.
