37696587|t|Delirium in patients with musculoskeletal tumours: incidence and risk factors - single-centre prospective study.
37696587|a|OBJECTIVES: Delirium, a neurocognitive disorder, typically occurs in older patients and those with advanced cancer. Although there have been numerous reports on delirium in patients with cancer in various conditions, there are no reports that specifically focus on patients with musculoskeletal tumours. This prospective study aimed to investigate the incidence, risk factors and prognostic implications of delirium in patients with musculoskeletal tumours. METHODS: In this single institutional study, 148 patients with musculoskeletal oncology were enrolled. The estimated risk factors included age, sex, alcohol abuse, performance status (PS), dietary status, admission route, tumour malignancy, oncological stage and blood test results. The significance of delirium in survival was also examined. RESULTS: Only 18 patients with malignant tumours had delirium (12.2%). Based on univariate analysis, older age, poor PS, dietary status, admission from another hospital, malignant tumour, carcinoma rather than sarcoma, anaemia and some laboratory abnormalities were found to be significant risk factors for delirium. Multivariate analysis showed that poor PS was significantly correlated with delirium. Additionally, delirium was significantly correlated with poor survival. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of delirium among patients with musculoskeletal tumours was 12.2% and was observed only in patients with malignant tumours. PS is a significant risk factor for delirium. Delirium is correlated with poor prognosis.
