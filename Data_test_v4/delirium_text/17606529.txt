17606529|a|Associations between A Quick Test of Cognitive Speed (AQT) perceptual and cognitive speed and neuropsychological tests, including the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Trail Making Test (TMT), were evaluated in 41 neuropsychiatric patients. Neuropsychological and neurological tests, including CT scan, were administered to all of the patients. AQT was also administered to 75 controls. All AQT means differed significantly for patients and controls. Dual-dimension naming time means in the patient group were in the atypical range and indicated generally reduced cognitive speed, whereas controls performed in the normal range. In the patient group, WAIS-III verbal, performance, and full-scale IQ means were in the normal range. AQT perceptual and cognitive speed correlated negatively with WAIS-III P IQ and MMSE scores, and the relationships were nonlinear. The findings support that AQT dual-dimension naming evaluates cognitive speed (i.e., attention, set shifting, working memory) and can be used for first-line or complementary screening for mild or progressive cognitive impairments.
