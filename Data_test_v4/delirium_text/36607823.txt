36607823|t|Delirium in trauma ICUs: a review of incidence, risk factors, outcomes, and management.
36607823|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews the impact and importance of delirium on patients admitted to the ICU after trauma, including the latest work on prevention and treatment of this condition. As the population ages, the incidence of geriatric trauma will continue to increase with a concomitant rise in the patient and healthcare costs of delirium in this population. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have further defined the risk factors for delirium in the trauma ICU patient population, as well as better demonstrated the poor outcomes associated with the diagnosis of delirium in these patients. Recent trials and meta-analysis offer some new evidence for the use of dexmedetomidine and quetiapine as preferred agents for prevention and treatment of delirium and add music interventions as a promising part of nonpharmacologic bundles. SUMMARY: Trauma patients requiring admission to the ICU are at significant risk of developing delirium, an acute neuropsychiatric disorder associated with increased healthcare costs and worse outcomes including increased mortality. Ideal methods for prevention and treatment of delirium are not well established, especially in this population, but recent research helps to clarify optimal prevention and treatment strategies.
