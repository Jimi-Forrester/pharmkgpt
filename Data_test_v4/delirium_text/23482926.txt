23482926|t|Establishing the role of tyrosine kinase 2 in cancer.
23482926|a|Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) is a member of the Janus family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases involved in cytokine signaling. TYK2 deficiency is associated with increased susceptibility to mycobacterial and viral infections, hyper IgE syndrome as well as with allergic asthma. However the precise role of TYK2 in oncogenesis and tumor progression is not clear yet. Tyk2-deficient mice are prone to develop tumors because they lack efficient cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell antitumor responses as a result of deficient Type I interferon signaling. However, as TYK2 functions downstream of growth factor receptors that are often hyperactivated in cancer, inhibiting TYK2 might also have beneficial effects for cancer treatment.
