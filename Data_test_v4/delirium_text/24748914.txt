24748914|t|T-type Ca(2+) channels: New players in the aging brain.
24748914|a|Perhaps one of the most remarkable features of T-type calcium channels is their low-threshold of activation that makes these channels important candidates for calcium entry near the resting membrane potential of neurons. Hence, they mediate low-threshold burst discharges that occur during different forms of neuronal rhythmogenesis, but play also important roles in sensory transmission, as well as hormone and neurotransmitter release. Additionally, they have been implicated in an increasing number of neuronal pathologies including neuropathy, autism spectrum disorders and some forms of epilepsy. More recently, an implication of T-type calcium channel in the processing of Amyloid Precursor Protein was documented, with possible implication in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
