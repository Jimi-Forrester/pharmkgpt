26643357|t|Relationship between cardiac autonomic function and cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease.
26643357|a|AIM: Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects many central nervous structures and neurotransmitter systems. These changes affect not only cognitive function, but also cardiac autonomic function. However, the functional relationship between cardiac autonomic function and cognition in AD has not yet been investigated. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the association between cardiac autonomic function measured by heart rate variability and cognitive function in AD. METHODS: A total of 78 AD patients were recruited for this study. Cardiac autonomic function was evaluated using heart rate variability analysis. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to model the association between heart rate variability and cognitive function (global cognitive function, memory, executive function and processing speed), after adjustment for covariates. RESULTS: Global cognitive function was negatively associated with sympathetic modulation (low-to-high frequency power ratio). Memory performance was positively associated with parasympathetic modulation (high frequency power) and negatively associated with sympathetic modulation (low-to-high frequency power ratio). These associations were independent of age, sex, educational years, diabetes, hypertension and cholinesterase inhibitor use. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive function, especially in the areas of memory, is associated with cardiac autonomic function in AD. Specifically, lower cognitive performance was found to be associated with significantly higher cardiac sympathetic and lower parasympathetic function in AD. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2017; 17: 92-98.
