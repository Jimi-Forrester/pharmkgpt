29110102|t|Pediatric Delirium: Recognition, Management, and Outcome.
29110102|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review seeks to provide an update on the diagnosis, management, and outcome of pediatric delirium. RECENT FINDINGS: Care of patients with delirium depends on correct diagnosis and treatment of its underlying cause. A variety of instruments are available to aid diagnosis. Management of delirium currently depends on atypical antipsychotics, while avoiding agents that may precipitate or exacerbate it. While most critically ill children survive delirium, many children die or have worsening function after their illness. The longer the duration of delirium, the more severe its subsequent problems including postintensive care syndrome and posttraumatic stress disorder. Possible serious long-term consequences emphasize the importance of efforts to improve diagnosis and outcome in critically ill children suffering from delirium.
