28486432|t|Apolipoprotein C-I Polymorphism and Its Association with Serum Lipid Levels and Longevity in the Bama Population.
28486432|a|This study aims to determine the association between the apolipoprotein C-I polymorphism and the longevity and genetic variants in ApoC-I that can influence the serum lipid levels in Bama. ApoC-I genotypes were determined by Taqman single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping assays in 178 long-lived inhabitants (longevity group aged from 90 to 110 years), 147 healthy controls (Control 1 group aged from 40 to 79 years old) from Bama County, and 190 healthy controls (Control 2 group aged from 40 to 79 years old) from Nandan County without a family history of longevity. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 16.0. All genotype distributions of rs584007 and rs4420638 were consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p > 0.05). Significant differences were observed in the frequencies of the three genotypes (GG, AG, and AA) among the longevity and the two control groups (chi2 = 11.238, p = 0.024) for rs584007. No significant differences were observed in the frequencies of the three genotypes (GG, AG, and AA) among the longevity and the two control groups (chi2 = 4.587, p = 0.318) for rs4420638. The levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c) were not different among the three genotypes of rs584007 in the three groups. The levels of HDL-c for GG, AG, and AA were significantly different (the highest being in the longevity group), while the levels of TG for AA and AG genotypes (the lowest being in the longevity group) and the levels of LDL-c for AG were significantly different (p < 0.05) among the three groups for rs584007. The levels of TG and HDL-c were significantly different among the three rs4420638 genotypes in the longevity group. The levels of TC for GG, AG, and AA were significantly different in the Control 2 group, while the levels of TG and HDL-c for AA and AG genotypes were significantly different (p < 0.05) among the three groups for rs4420638. The level of HDL-c was highest in the longevity group for AA and AG genotypes, and the level of TG was highest in the Control 2 group for rs4420638. Serum lipid parameters were related to environmental factors, including age, gender, BMI, DBP, SBP, rs4420638, and rs584007. The ApoC-I polymorphism might be one of the genetic factors of longevity in Bama. The ApoC-I rs4420638 and rs584007 SNPs are associated with serum TG and HDL-c levels in the longevous population.
