37899849|a|Objectives: Review of the current and relevant literature to develop a list of evidence-based recommendations that can be implemented in head and neck surgical practices. To provide rationale for the multiple aspects of comprehensive care for head and neck surgical patients. To improve postsurgical outcomes for head and neck surgical patients. Methods: Extensive review of the medical literature was performed and relevant studies in both the head and neck surgery and other surgical specialties were considered for inclusion. Results: A total of 18 aspects of perioperative care were included in this review. The literature search included 276 publications considered to be the most relevant and up to date evidence. Each topic is concluded with recommendation grade and quality of evidence for the recommendation. Conclusion: Since it's conception, enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols have continued to push for comprehensive and evidence based postsurgical care to improve patient outcomes. Head and neck oncology is one of the newest fields to develop a protocol. Due to the complexity of this patient population and their postsurgical needs, a multidisciplinary approach is needed to facilitate recovery while minimizing complications. Current and future advances in head and neck cancer research will serve to strengthen and add new principles to a comprehensive ERAS protocol. Level of Evidence: 2a.
