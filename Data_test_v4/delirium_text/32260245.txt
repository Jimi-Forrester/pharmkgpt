32260245|a|Microorganisms that create mixed-species biofilms in the human oral cavity include, among others, the opportunistic fungus Candida albicans and the key bacterial pathogen in periodontitis, Porphyromonas gingivalis. Both species use arsenals of virulence factors to invade the host organism and evade its immune system including peptidylarginine deiminase that citrullinates microbial and host proteins, altering their function. We assessed the effects of this modification on the interactions between the C. albicans cell surface and human plasminogen and kininogen, key components of plasma proteolytic cascades related to the maintenance of hemostasis and innate immunity. Mass spectrometry was used to identify protein citrullination, and microplate tests to quantify the binding of modified plasminogen and kininogen to C. albicans cells. Competitive radioreceptor assays tested the affinity of citrullinated kinins to their specific cellular receptors. The citrullination of surface-exposed fungal proteins reduced the level of unmodified plasminogen binding but did not affect unmodified kininogen binding. However, the modification of human proteins did not disrupt their adsorption to the unmodified fungal cells. In contrast, the citrullination of kinins exerted a significant impact on their interactions with cellular receptors reducing their affinity and thus affecting the role of kinin peptides in the development of inflammation.
