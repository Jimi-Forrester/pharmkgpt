12116268|t|Lack of association of the two polymorphisms in alpha-2 macroglobulin with Alzheimer disease.
12116268|a|Alzheimer disease is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by cognitive decline and distinct neuropathology. The gene for alpha-2 macroglobulin (A2M) on chromosome 12 has two polymorphisms that, in some cases, are associated with Alzheimer disease. We examined these two polymorphisms in our families in the DNA Bank (a collection of DNA samples from families with Alzheimer disease in Texas). Using both association studies and sib transmission/disequilibrium tests, we found no association of the two polymorphisms with the disease in our collection. In addition, we did not find an association of the disease with the two polymorphisms in A2M in a small subset of National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) families. Thus, our studies do not support the A2M polymorphisms as a risk factor for Alzheimer disease.
