32648369|a|The age-associated decline of adult stem cell function is closely related to the decline in tissue function and age-related diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms that ultimately lead to the observed functional decline of stem cells still remain largely unexplored. This study investigated Drosophila midguts and found a continuous downregulation of lipoic acid synthase, which encodes the key enzyme for the endogenous synthesis of alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), upon aging. Importantly, orally administration of ALA significantly reversed the age-associated hyperproliferation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and the observed decline of intestinal function, thus extending the lifespan of Drosophila. This study reports that ALA reverses age-associated ISC dysfunction by promoting the activation of the endocytosis-autophagy network, which decreases in aged ISCs. Moreover, this study suggests that ALA may be used as a safe and effective anti-aging compound for the treatment of ISC-dysfunction-related diseases and for the promotion of healthy aging in humans.
