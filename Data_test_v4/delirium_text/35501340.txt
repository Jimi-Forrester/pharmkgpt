35501340|t|Types of necroinflammation, the effect of cell death modalities on sterile inflammation.
35501340|a|Distinct types of immune responses are activated by infections, which cause the development of type I, II, or III inflammation, regulated by Th1, Th2, Th17 helper T cells and ILC1, ILC2 and ILC3 cells, respectively. While the classification of immune responses to different groups of pathogens is widely accepted, subtypes of the immune response elicited by sterile inflammation have not yet been detailed. Necroinflammation is associated with the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) from dying cells. In this review, we present that the distinct molecular mechanisms activated during apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis lead to the release of different patterns of DAMPs and their suppressors, SAMPs. We summarize the currently available data on how regulated cell death pathways and released DAMPs and SAMPs direct the differentiation of T helper and ILC cells. Understanding the subtypes of necroinflammation can be crucial in developing strategies for the treatment of sterile inflammatory diseases caused by cell death processes.
