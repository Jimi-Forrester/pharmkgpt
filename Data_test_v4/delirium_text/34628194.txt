34628194|t|A multiparametric MRI study of structural brain damage in dementia with lewy bodies: A comparison with Alzheimer's disease.
34628194|a|INTRODUCTION: Differential diagnosis between dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for an adequate patients' management but might be challenging. We investigated with advanced MRI techniques gray (GM) and white matter (WM) damage in DLB patients compared to those with AD. METHODS: 24 DLB patients, 26 age- and disease severity-matched AD patients, and 20 age and sex-matched controls performed clinical and neuropsychological assessment, and brain structural and diffusion-tensor MRI. We measured GM atrophy using voxel-based morphometry, WM hyperintensities (WMH) using a local thresholding segmentation technique, and normal-appearing WM (NAWM) damage using tract-based spatial statistic. RESULTS: DLB and AD patients exhibited mild-to-moderate-stage dementia. Compared to controls, GM damage was diffuse in AD, while limited to bilateral thalamus and temporal regions in DLB. Compared to DLB, AD patients exhibited GM atrophy in bilateral fronto-temporal and occipital regions. DLB and AD patients showed higher WMH load than controls, with no differences among each other. WMH in DLB were diffuse with relative prevalence in posterior parietal-occipital regions. Compared to controls, both DLB and AD patients showed reduced microstructural integrity of the main supratentorial and infratentorial NAWM tracts. AD patients exhibited greater posterior NAWM damage than DLB. CONCLUSIONS: DLB showed prominent WM degeneration compared to the limited GM atrophy, while in AD both tissue compartments were severely involved. In DLB, NAWM microstructural degeneration was independent of WMH, thus revealing two possible underlying processes. Different pathophysiological mechanisms are likely to drive GM and WM damage distribution in DLB and AD.
