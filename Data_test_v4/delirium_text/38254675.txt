38254675|t|Serum Brevican as a Biomarker of Cerebrovascular Disease in an Elderly Cognitively Impaired Cohort.
38254675|a|In the brain, the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition shapes the neuronal microenvironment and can undergo substantial changes with cerebral pathology. Brevican is integral to the formation of the ECM's neuroprotective perineuronal nets (PNNs). Decreased brevican levels were reported in vascular dementia (VaD) but not in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the status of brevican in clinical cohorts with high concomitance of AD pathological burden and cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) is unclear. In this study, 32 non-cognitively impaired (NCI), 97 cognitively impaired no dementia (CIND), 46 AD, and 23 VaD participants recruited from memory clinics based in Singapore underwent neuropsychological and neuroimaging assessments, together with measurements of serum brevican. Association analyses were performed between serum brevican and neuroimaging measures of CeVDs, including white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), lacunes, cortical infarcts, and cerebral microbleeds. Using an aggregated score for CeVD burden, only CIND participants showed lower brevican levels with higher CeVD compared to those with lower CeVD burden (p = 0.006). Among the CeVD subtypes assessed, only elevated WMH burden was associated with lower brevican levels (OR = 2.7; 95% CI = 1.3-5.5). Our findings suggest that brevican deficits may play a role in early cerebrovascular damage in participants at risk of developing dementia.
