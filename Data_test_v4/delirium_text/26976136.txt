26976136|t|False Memories in Alzheimer's Disease: Intact Semantic Priming But Impaired Production of Critical Lures.
26976136|a|OBJECTIVES: This study explores the activation of the critical lure (CL) and its production in Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) tasks in Alzheimer's disease and aging. In a previous lexical decision task including DRM lists, we showed that the activation of the CL occurs normally in Alzheimer's patients. Here, we reproduce this study and add a production (DRM) task in order to compare both processes in the same groups of participants. METHOD: Eighteen older adults and 20 Alzheimer's patients performed a conventional DRM task, followed by a lexical decision task with DRM lists intermixed with neutral words and nonwords. RESULTS: Analyses indicated that Alzheimer's patients produced significantly fewer CLs than older participants in the DRM task, but that they showed, like older adults, shorter lexical decision latencies for CLs than for other types of words. DISCUSSION: This study provides evidence that the low production of CLs regularly documented in Alzheimer's patients in the DRM paradigm is not necessarily explained by their nonactivation. The results are discussed in the light of the hypothesis of a rapid disappearance of the episodic mnemonic trace of the CLs in Alzheimer's patients.
