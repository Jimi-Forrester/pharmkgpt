DESIGN: Prospective interventional (pilot group) and retrospective (control group). SETTING: University teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Thirty-two internal medicine patients identified as being at risk for AWS and treated according to the AWS practice guideline who were compared with 49 internal medicine patients managed with nonstandardized approaches. INTERVENTION: Patients in the pilot group were assessed using the AWS type indicator. They received lorazepam, clonidine, or haloperidol, based on AWS type indicator assessment and adult AWS practice guideline criteria. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data collected and analyzed were drugs administered to control AWS symptoms, use of sitters and physical restraints, length of hospital stay, and discharge from hospital receiving tapered drug therapy. Pilot patients received 46.6% less benzodiazepine (p=0.001), 20% more clonidine (p=0.01), and 18.2% more haloperidol (p=0.002) than control patients. No drug therapy was required in 19% of pilot patients compared with 2% of controls (p=0.01). Significantly more control (71.4%) than pilot patients (18.8%) were discharged with tapered benzodiazepine therapy (p<or=0.01). No significant differences were found between groups for sitters, restraints, or hospital length of stay. CONCLUSION: This pilot project suggests that internal medicine patients at risk for AWS can be managed with a standardized, symptom-triggered approach using decreased amounts of benzodiazepine in combination with adjunctive agents to treat adrenergic hyperactivity and delirium. Further data are necessary to determine the impact of the practice guideline on patient outcome measurements.
