33182605|t|Exploring the Role of Contactins across Psychological, Psychiatric and Cardiometabolic Traits within UK Biobank.
33182605|a|Individuals with severe mental illness have an increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases compared to the general population. Shared risk factors and medication effects explain part of this excess risk; however, there is growing evidence to suggest that shared biology (including genetic variation) is likely to contribute to comorbidity between mental and physical illness. Contactins are a family of genes involved in development of the nervous system and implicated, though genome-wide association studies, in a wide range of psychological, psychiatric and cardiometabolic conditions. Contactins are plausible candidates for shared pathology between mental and physical health. We used data from UK Biobank to systematically assess how genetic variation in contactin genes was associated with a wide range of psychological, psychiatric and cardiometabolic conditions. We also investigated whether associations for cardiometabolic and psychological traits represented the same or distinct signals and how the genetic variation might influence the measured traits. We identified: A novel genetic association between variation in CNTN1 and current smoking; two independent signals in CNTN4 for BMI; and demonstrated that associations between CNTN5 and neuroticism were distinct from those between CNTN5 and blood pressure/HbA1c. There was no evidence that the contactin genes contributed to shared aetiology between physical and mental illness.
