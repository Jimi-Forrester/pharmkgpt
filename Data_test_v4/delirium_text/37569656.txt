37569656|t|Mechanisms of NURR1 Regulation: Consequences for Its Biological Activity and Involvement in Pathology.
37569656|a|NURR1 (Nuclear receptor-related 1 protein or NR4A2) is a nuclear protein receptor transcription factor with an essential role in the development, regulation, and maintenance of dopaminergic neurons and mediates the response to stressful stimuli during the perinatal period in mammalian brain development. The dysregulation of NURR1 activity may play a role in various diseases, including the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, and several other pathologies. NURR1 is regulated by multiple mechanisms, among which phosphorylation by kinases or SUMOylation are the best characterized. Both post-translational modifications can regulate the activity of NURR1, affecting its stability and transcriptional activity. Other non-post-translational regulatory mechanisms include changes in its subcellular distribution or interaction with other protein partners by heterodimerization, also affecting its transcription activity. Here, we summarize the currently known regulatory mechanisms of NURR1 and provide a brief overview of its participation in pathological alterations.
