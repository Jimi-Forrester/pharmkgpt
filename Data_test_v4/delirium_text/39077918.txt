39077918|a|Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is used in early-stage Alzheimer's disease to slow progression, but heterogeneity in response results in different treatment outcomes. The mechanisms underlying this heterogeneity are unclear. This study used resting-state neuroimaging to investigate the variability in episodic memory improvement from angular gyrus repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and tracked the neural circuits involved. Thirty-four amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients underwent angular gyrus repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (4 weeks, 20 Hz, 100% resting motor threshold) and were divided into high-response and low-response groups based on minimal clinically important differences in auditory verbal learning test scores. Baseline and pre/post-treatment neural circuit activities were compared. Results indicated that the orbital middle frontal gyrus in the orbitofrontal cortex network and the precuneus in the default mode network had higher local activity in the low-response group. After treatment, changes in local and remote connectivity within brain regions of the orbitofrontal cortex, default mode network, visual network, and sensorimotor network showed opposite trends and were related to treatment effects. This suggests that the activity states of brain regions within the orbitofrontal cortex and default mode network could serve as imaging markers for early cognitive compensation in amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients and predict the aftereffects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation response.
