38848181|t|Machine Learning Approaches for Dementia Detection Through Speech and Gait Analysis: A Systematic Literature Review.
38848181|a|Background: Dementia is a general term for several progressive neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Timely and accurate detection is crucial for early intervention. Advancements in artificial intelligence present significant potential for using machine learning to aid in early detection. Objective: Summarize the state-of-the-art machine learning-based approaches for dementia prediction, focusing on non-invasive methods, as the burden on the patients is lower. Specifically, the analysis of gait and speech performance can offer insights into cognitive health through clinically cost-effective screening methods. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA protocol (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). The search was performed on three electronic databases (Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed) to identify the relevant studies published between 2017 to 2022. A total of 40 papers were selected for review. Results: The most common machine learning methods employed were support vector machine followed by deep learning. Studies suggested the use of multimodal approaches as they can provide comprehensive and better prediction performance. Deep learning application in gait studies is still in the early stages as few studies have applied it. Moreover, including features of whole body movement contribute to better classification accuracy. Regarding speech studies, the combination of different parameters (acoustic, linguistic, cognitive testing) produced better results. Conclusions: The review highlights the potential of machine learning, particularly non-invasive approaches, in the early prediction of dementia. The comparable prediction accuracies of manual and automatic speech analysis indicate an imminent fully automated approach for dementia detection.
