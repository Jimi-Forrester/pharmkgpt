31440934|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the quest for understanding the pathophysiological processes underlying degeneration of nervous systems, synapses are emerging as sites of great interest as synaptic dysfunction is thought to play a role in the initiation and progression of neuronal loss. In particular, the synapse is an interesting target for the effects of epigenetic mechanisms in neurodegeneration. Here, we review the recent advances on epigenetic mechanisms driving synaptic compromise in major neurodegenerative disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Major developments in sequencing technologies enabled the mapping of transcriptomic patterns in human postmortem brain tissues in various neurodegenerative diseases, and also in cell and animal models. These studies helped identify changes in classical neurodegeneration pathways and discover novel targets related to synaptic degeneration. Identifying epigenetic patterns indicative of synaptic defects prior to neuronal degeneration may provide the basis for future breakthroughs in the field of neurodegeneration.
