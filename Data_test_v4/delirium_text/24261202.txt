24261202|a|Visual hallucinations are common among the elderly's psychiatric symptoms. Delirium, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Charles Bonnet syndrome should be considered to induce visual hallucinations in the elderly as differential diagnoses. In this paper, Charles Bonnet syndrome was mainly reviewed and dementia with Lewy bodies was also briefly introduced. It should be emphasized that a part of patients with Charles Bonnet syndrome may develop dementia with Lewy bodies in the near future.
