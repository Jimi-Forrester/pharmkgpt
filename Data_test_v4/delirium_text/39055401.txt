39055401|t|Evolving Epidemiology and Antibiotic Resistance in Enteric Fever: A Comprehensive Review.
39055401|a|Enteric fever, predominantly caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi, remains a significant global health challenge. This comprehensive review examines the evolving epidemiology and antibiotic resistance associated with enteric fever. We provide an overview of the disease's definition and historical context, highlighting the substantial impact of antibiotic resistance on treatment efficacy. The review details the global burden, incidence trends, and risk factors of enteric fever while elucidating the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of the disease. A critical analysis of antibiotic resistance mechanisms reveals the alarming rise of multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains, complicating treatment regimens and underscoring the need for novel therapeutic strategies. Current treatment protocols, the role of empirical therapy, and the rational use of antibiotics are discussed in depth. Additionally, we explore prevention and control strategies, emphasizing the importance of vaccination programs, sanitation improvements, and effective public health interventions. The review concludes with recommendations for future actions, including enhanced surveillance, research and development of new antibiotics, expansion of vaccination efforts, and improved public health infrastructure. The findings highlight the necessity for updated clinical guidelines and sustained global efforts to address the challenges of enteric fever and its evolving antibiotic resistance patterns. Through coordinated action and continued innovation, it is possible to mitigate the impact of this enduring public health threat.
