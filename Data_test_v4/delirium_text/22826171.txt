22826171|t|COX-2 in the neurodegenerative process of Parkinson's disease.
22826171|a|The enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), responsible for the first committed step in the synthesis of several important mediators which are involved in both initiation and resolution of inflammation, and the subsequent generation of prostaglandins (PGs) upon activation has been shown to participate in the neurodegenerative processes of a variety of diseases. This review looks particular at the role of COX-2 in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, involving the generation of PGs and the role of the two different parts of the cyclooxygenase-cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activity.
