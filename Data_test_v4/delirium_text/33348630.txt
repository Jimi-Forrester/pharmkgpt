33348630|t|Neutrophils and Macrophages as Targets for Development of Nanotherapeutics in Inflammatory Diseases.
33348630|a|Neutrophils and macrophages are major components of innate systems, playing central roles in inflammation responses to infections and tissue injury. If they are out of control, inflammation responses can cause the pathogenesis of a wide range of diseases, such as inflammatory disorders and autoimmune diseases. Precisely regulating the functions of neutrophils and macrophages in vivo is a potential strategy to develop immunotherapies to treat inflammatory diseases. Advances in nanotechnology have enabled us to design nanoparticles capable of targeting neutrophils or macrophages in vivo. This review discusses the current status of how nanoparticles specifically target neutrophils or macrophages and how they manipulate leukocyte functions to inhibit their activation for inflammation resolution or to restore their defense ability for pathogen clearance. Finally, we present a novel concept of hijacking leukocytes to deliver nanotherapeutics across the blood vessel barrier. This review highlights the challenges and opportunities in developing nanotherapeutics to target leukocytes for improved treatment of inflammatory diseases.
