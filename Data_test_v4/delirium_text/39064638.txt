39064638|t|The "Sunshine Vitamin" and Its Antioxidant Benefits for Enhancing Muscle Function.
39064638|a|Pathological states marked by oxidative stress and systemic inflammation frequently compromise the functional capacity of muscular cells. This progressive decline in muscle mass and tone can significantly hamper the patient's motor abilities, impeding even the most basic physical tasks. Muscle dysfunction can lead to metabolic disorders and severe muscle wasting, which, in turn, can potentially progress to sarcopenia. The functionality of skeletal muscle is profoundly influenced by factors such as environmental, nutritional, physical, and genetic components. A well-balanced diet, rich in proteins and vitamins, alongside an active lifestyle, plays a crucial role in fortifying tissues and mitigating general weakness and pathological conditions. Vitamin D, exerting antioxidant effects, is essential for skeletal muscle. Epidemiological evidence underscores a global prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, which induces oxidative harm, mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced adenosine triphosphate production, and impaired muscle function. This review explores the intricate molecular mechanisms through which vitamin D modulates oxidative stress and its consequent effects on muscle function. The aim is to evaluate if vitamin D supplementation in conditions involving oxidative stress and inflammation could prevent decline and promote or maintain muscle function effectively.
