33497417|a|Periodontal diseases, including gingivitis and periodontitis, are a global oral health problem. Porphyromonas gingivalis, a key pathogen involved in the onset of periodontitis, is able to colonize the subgingival epithelium and invade the underlying connective tissue due to the contribution of cysteine proteases known as gingipains. In this study, we investigated the effects of a phenolic extract prepared from tart cherry (Prunus cerasus L.) juice on the growth, adherence, and protease activity of P. gingivalis. We also assessed the protective effect of the tart cherry extract on the disruption of the oral epithelial barrier induced by P. gingivalis. The tart cherry extract that contains procyanidins and quercetin and its derivatives (rutinoside, glucoside) as the most important phenolic compounds attenuated P. gingivalis growth, reduced adherence to an experimental basement membrane matrix model, and decreased the protease activities of P. gingivalis. The tart cherry extract also exerted a protective effect on the integrity of the oral epithelial barrier in an in vitro model infected with P. gingivalis. More specifically, the extract prevented a decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance as well as the destruction of tight junction proteins (zonula occludens-1 and occludin). These results suggest that the tart cherry phenolic extract may be a promising natural product for the treatment of periodontitis through its ability to attenuate the virulence properties of P. gingivalis and curtail the ability of this pathogen to impair the oral epithelial barrier.
