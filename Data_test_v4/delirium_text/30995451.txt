30995451|a|Aerobic exercise induces neuroprotection, but few studies investigated whether strength training has similar potential. Here we examine whether effects of strength training differ from those of running training concerning cognitive symptomatology, oxidative stress and cholinergic status in a model of AD-like cognitive impairment induced by intrahippocampal infusion of a mix of beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) in rats. Male Wistar rats were submitted to 8 weeks of running exercise (RunEx; 40 min sessions at 70% of indirect VO2 max, 3 times/week) or strength exercise (StrEx; 3 sessions/week, 12 repetitions in 8 sets, 2 sets with repetitions at 50%, 2 at 75%, 2 at 90% and 2 at 100% of the maximum load), followed by Abeta infusion in the dorsal hippocampus. Short-term (STM) and long-term (LTM) object recognition (OR) and social recognition (SR) memories were evaluated. Hippocampal oxidative status was determined by quantification of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation by thiobarbituric acid reactive substance test, total antioxidant capacity by ferric reducing/antioxidant power, and acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity (AChE). Abeta infusion impaired STM and LTM and resulted in higher hippocampal oxidative damage and impaired AChE activity. StrEx results in better neuroprotection than RunEx by preventing deficits in OR and SR memories, prevents increases in lipid peroxidation, and decreases in AChE activity. RunEx elicits neuroprotection only for SR memory deficits, prevents increase in ROS and lipid peroxidation, and preserves the total antioxidant capacity. While RunEx effects are related to oxidative status, only StrEx shows potential to also influence the cholinergic system.
