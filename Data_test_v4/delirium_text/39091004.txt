39091004|t|Holistic and Personalized Strategies for Managing in Elderly Type 2 Diabetes Patients.
39091004|a|Due to increased life expectancy and lifestyle changes, the prevalence of diabetes among the elderly in Korea is continuously rising, as is the associated public health burden. Diabetes management in elderly patients is complicated by age-related physiological changes, sarcopenia characterized by loss of muscle mass and function, comorbidities, and varying levels of functional, cognitive, and mobility abilities that lead to frailty. Moreover, elderly patients with diabetes frequently face multiple chronic conditions that elevate their risk of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and mortality; they are also prone to complications such as hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state, diabetic ketoacidosis, and severe hypoglycemia. This review examines the characteristics of and management approaches for diabetes in the elderly, and advocates for a comprehensive yet personalized strategy.
