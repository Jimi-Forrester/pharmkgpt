38024702|a|Low-temperature-induced fatty acid desaturation is highly conserved in animals, plants, and bacteria. Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) is an agonist of the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), which is activated by various chemophysiological stimuli, including low temperature. However, whether AITC induces fatty acid desaturation remains unknown. We showed here that AITC increased levels of glycerophospholipids (GP) esterified with unsaturated fatty acids, especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in TRPA1-expressing HEK cells. Additionally, GP-DHA including phosphatidylcholine (18:0/22:6) and phosphatidylethanolamine (18:0/22:6) was increased in the brain and liver of AITC-administered mice. Moreover, intragastrical injection of AITC in ovariectomized (OVX) female C57BL/6J mice dose-dependently shortened the Deltalatency time determined by the Morris water maze test, indicating AITC ameliorated the cognitive function decline in these mice. Thus, the oral administration of AITC maintains GP-DHA in the liver and brain, proving to be a potential strategy for preventing cognitive decline.
