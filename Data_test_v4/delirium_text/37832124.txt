37832124|a|The effects of cholesterol variability on cataracts, dementia, and osteoporosis remain controversial. Using a common data model, we investigated the effects of variations in cholesterol levels on the development of cataracts, dementia, and osteoporosis. Patients who received statin therapy between 2011 and 2020 and those with 3 or more tests for total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) levels were included. The patients were divided into those with a coefficient of variation (CV) of TC higher than the mean (high-CV group) and those with a lower CV of TC (low-CV group). Moreover, 1:1 propensity score matching was conducted based on demographic variables. Cataract, dementia, or osteoporosis was defined as having a diagnostic, drug, or surgical code based on the cohort definition. Of the 12,882 patients, cataracts, dementia, and osteoporosis were developed in 525 (4.1%), 198 (1.5%), and 438 (3.4%) patients, respectively. The stratified Cox proportional hazards model showed that the incidences of cataracts and osteoporosis were 1.38 and 1.45 times greater in the high-CV group than in the low-CV group, respectively. Our study revealed that TC variability is associated with developing cataracts and osteoporosis.
