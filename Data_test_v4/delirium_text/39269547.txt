39269547|t|Role of Mitochondrial Dysfunctions in Neurodegenerative Disorders: Advances in Mitochondrial Biology.
39269547|a|Mitochondria, essential organelles responsible for cellular energy production, emerge as a key factor in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. This review explores advancements in mitochondrial biology studies that highlight the pivotal connection between mitochondrial dysfunctions and neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, ischemic stroke, and vascular dementia. Mitochondrial DNA mutations, impaired dynamics, and disruptions in the ETC contribute to compromised energy production and heightened oxidative stress. These factors, in turn, lead to neuronal damage and cell death. Recent research has unveiled potential therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction, including mitochondria targeted therapies and antioxidants. Furthermore, the identification of reliable biomarkers for assessing mitochondrial dysfunction opens new avenues for early diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. By delving into these advancements, this review underscores the significance of understanding mitochondrial biology in unraveling the mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders. It lays the groundwork for developing targeted treatments to combat these devastating neurological conditions.
