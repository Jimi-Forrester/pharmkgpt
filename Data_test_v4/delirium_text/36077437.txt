36077437|t|Ultrasound Neuromodulation Reduces Demyelination in a Rat Model of Multiple Sclerosis.
36077437|a|Microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) may serve as targets for remyelination-enhancing therapy. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has been demonstrated to ameliorate myelin loss and inhibit neuroinflammation in animal models of brain disorders; however, the underlying mechanisms through which LIPUS stimulates remyelination and glial activation are not well-understood. This study explored the impacts of LIPUS on remyelination and resident cells following lysolecithin (LPC)-induced local demyelination in the hippocampus. Demyelination was induced by the micro-injection of 1.5 muL of 1% LPC into the rat hippocampus, and the treatment groups received daily LIPUS stimulation for 5 days. The therapeutic effects of LIPUS on LPC-induced demyelination were assessed through immunohistochemistry staining. The staining was performed to evaluate remyelination and Iba-1 staining as a microglia marker. Our data revealed that LIPUS significantly increased myelin basic protein (MBP) expression. Moreover, the IHC results showed that LIPUS significantly inhibited glial cell activation, enhanced mature oligodendrocyte density, and promoted brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression at the lesion site. In addition, a heterologous population of microglia with various morphologies can be found in the demyelination lesion after LIPUS treatment. These data show that LIPUS stimulation may serve as a potential treatment for accelerating remyelination through the attenuation of glial activation and the enhancement of mature oligodendrocyte density and BDNF production.
