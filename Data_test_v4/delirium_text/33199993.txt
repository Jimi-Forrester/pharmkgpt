33199993|a|Although acute myocardial infarction is one of the most common fatal diseases worldwide, the understanding of its underlying pathogenesis continues to develop. Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) can restore myocardial oxygen and nutrient supply. However, a large number of studies have demonstrated that recovery of blood perfusion after acute ischemia causes reperfusion injury to the heart. With progress made in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of myocardial I/R and oxidative stress, a novel area of research that merits greater study has been identified, that of I/R-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (ERS). Cardiac I/R can alter the function of the ER, leading to the accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins. The resulting ERS then induces the activation of signal transduction pathways, which in turn contribute to the development of I/R injury. The mechanism of I/R injury, and the causal relationship between I/R and ERS are reviewed in the present article.
