39113801|a|Background: The impediment to beta-amyloid (Abeta) clearance caused by the invalid intracranial lymphatic drainage in Alzheimer's disease is pivotal to its pathogenesis, and finding reliable clinical available solutions to address this challenge remains elusive. Methods: The potential role and underlying mechanisms of intranasal oxytocin administration, an approved clinical intervention, in improving intracranial lymphatic drainage in middle-old-aged APP/PS1 mice were investigated by live mouse imaging, ASL/CEST-MRI scanning, in vivo two-photon imaging, immunofluorescence staining, ELISA, RT-qPCR, Western blotting, RNA-seq analysis, and cognitive behavioral tests. Results: Benefiting from multifaceted modulation of cerebral hemodynamics, aquaporin-4 polarization, meningeal lymphangiogenesis and transcriptional profiles, oxytocin administration normalized the structure and function of both the glymphatic and meningeal lymphatic systems severely impaired in middle-old-aged APP/PS1 mice. Consequently, this intervention facilitated the efficient drainage of Abeta from the brain parenchyma to the cerebrospinal fluid and then to the deep cervical lymph nodes for efficient clearance, as well as improvements in cognitive deficits. Conclusion: This work broadens the underlying neuroprotective mechanisms and clinical applications of oxytocin medication, showcasing its promising therapeutic prospects in central nervous system diseases with intracranial lymphatic dysfunction.
