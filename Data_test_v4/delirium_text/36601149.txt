36601149|t|Isolation of Patients With Bacterial Pneumonia Suspected of COVID-19 Leads to Prolonged Hospitalization.
36601149|a|Objective The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the inpatient treatment practice for bacterial pneumonia. Upon hospitalization, isolation is required while waiting for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result, which may lead to limited access to medical resources and fewer room visits by medical staff. However, little is known about the relationship between isolation and the clinical outcomes of bacterial pneumonia. We hypothesized that isolation of suspected COVID-19 patients who are eventually diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia is associated with a prolonged length of hospitalization as compared with non-isolation. Patients This is a single-center, retrospective observational study of hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia from January 2018 to September 2021. The patients were divided into a non-isolated (patients hospitalized between January 2018 and December 2019, who were not isolated at all) and an isolated group (patients hospitalized between January 2020 and September 2021, who were initially isolated because COVID-19 was suspected). The primary outcome was a prolonged length of hospitalization (>=14 days), and its relationship with isolation was analyzed using logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, CURB-65, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Results Among 917 eligible patients, 214 (23%) underwent isolation. In the logistic regression analysis, the isolated group independently had a prolonged length of hospitalization as compared with the non-isolated group (odds ratio 1.49; 95% confidence interval 1.08-2.07, p=0.015). There was no significant difference in antibiotic use duration between the groups. Conclusion The isolation of bacterial pneumonia patients suspected of COVID-19 was associated with prolonged length of hospitalization.
