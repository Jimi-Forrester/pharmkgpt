38598115|t|Palmatine Alleviates Particulate Matter-Induced Acute Lung Injury by Inhibiting Pyroptosis via Activating the Nrf2-Related Pathway.
38598115|a|Particulate matter (PM) induces and enhances oxidative stress and inflammation, leading to a variety of respiratory diseases, including acute lung injury. Exploring new treatments for PM-induced lung injury has long been of interest to researchers. Palmatine (PAL) is a natural extract derived from plants that has been reported in many studies to alleviate inflammatory diseases. Our study was designed to explore whether PAL can alleviate acute lung injury caused by PM. The acute lung injury model was established by instilling PM (4 mg/kg) into the airway of mice, and PAL (50 mg/kg and 100 m/kg) was administrated orally as the treatment groups. The effect and mechanism of PAL treatment were examined by immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, Western Blotting, ELISA, and other experiments. The results showed that oral administration of PAL (50 mg/kg and 100 m/kg) could significantly alleviate lung inflammation and acute lung injury caused by PM. In terms of mechanism, we found that PAL (50 mg/kg) exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-damage effects mainly by enhancing the activation of the Nrf2-related antioxidant pathway and inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3-related pyroptosis pathway in mice. These mechanisms have also been verified in our cell experiments. Further cell experiments showed that PAL may reduce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activating Nrf2-related pathways, thereby inhibiting the activation of NLRP3-related pyroptosis pathway induced by PM in Beas-2B cell. Our study suggests that PAL can be a new option for PM-induced acute lung injury.
