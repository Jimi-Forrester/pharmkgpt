20061231|a|Alzheimer's disease or related diseases patients are particularly vulnerable to fragmentation of the French system of care and support. The government has decided to implement a national plan from which two key steps are the implementation of integration and case management. We report results of a review of the literature on both the definition of these concepts and their impacts as reported in randomized controlled studies. Important differences are noticeable between studies concerning the spectrum of integration (acute and long-term care, social and health sectors, institutional and liberal sectors and financing mode notably). Case-management has multiple sense, and it must be paid attention to intensity and context of the intervention. According to available evidence, case management is likely to improve, for the person with Alzheimer's, quality of care, quality of life and quality of life of caregivers at least. Conditions for a program to be successful are adequate targeting of the target population, sufficient level of integration and adequate intensity of case management. The programs most successful and most intensive relate an effect on prevention of loss of autonomy, even death, and no extra cost. The effects on hospitalization or entry into the institution are currently hypothetical and should be further studied.
