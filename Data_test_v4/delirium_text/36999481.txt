36999481|a|INTRODUCTION: Presence of apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 has shown greater predisposition to medial temporal involvement in posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). Little is known about its influence on memory network connectivity, a network comprised of medial temporal structures. METHODS: Fifty-eight PCA and 82 LPA patients underwent structural and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Bayesian hierarchical linear models assessed the influence of APOE epsilon4 on within and between-network connectivity for five networks. RESULTS: APOE epsilon4 carriers showed reduced memory and language within-network connectivity in LPA and increased salience within-network connectivity in PCA compared to non-carriers. Between-network analysis showed evidence of reduced DMN connectivity in APOE epsilon4 carriers, with reduced DMN-to-salience and DMN-to-language network connectivity in PCA, and reduced DMN-to-visual network connectivity in LPA. DISCUSSION: The APOE genotype influences brain connectivity, both within and between-networks, in atypical Alzheimer's disease. However, there was evidence that the modulatory effects of APOE differ across phenotype. HIGHLIGHTS: APOE genotype is associated with reductions in within-network connectivity for the memory and language networks in LPA APOE genotype is associated with reductions in language-to-visual connectivity in LPA and PCA APOE genotype has no effect on the memory network in PCA.
