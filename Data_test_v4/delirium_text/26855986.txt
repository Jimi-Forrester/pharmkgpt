26855986|a|BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to assess the incidence, course, and duration of delirium in patients admitted in the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) and to outline risk factors associated with the occurrence of delirium. METHOD: Fifty consecutive patients admitted to a cardiac ICU were screened for the presence of delirium using Confusion Assessment Method prospectively. The risk factors associated with delirium were studied using a semi-structured form. RESULTS: Eight (16%) patients developed delirium during their stay in the cardiac ICU. The mean duration of delirium was 1.5 (SD 0.53) days. The mean days for onset of delirium were 1.63 (SD 0.74), and mean days until delirium resolved were 3.12 (SD 0.83). Fewer years of formal education and electrolyte derangement were associated with the risk of delirium (P < .05); electrolyte abnormalities accounted for 16.5% of the variance in delirium in our sample. CONCLUSIONS: One-sixth of the patients admitted to the cardiac ICU had delirium; lower education and disturbed electrolytes were risk factors for delirium.
