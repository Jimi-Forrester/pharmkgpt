32295310|t|Identification of Abies sibirica L. Polyprenols and Characterisation of Polyprenol-Containing Liposomes.
32295310|a|The needles of conifer trees are one of the richest sources of natural polyprenols. Polyprenol homologs from Abies sibirica L. lipophilic 80% purified extract were analyzed and quantified. In total, 10 peaks (Prenol-11 to Prenol-20) were observed in the ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (UHPLC-DAD) chromatogram of Siberian fir with the most abundant compound being Prenol-15 (relative amount 37.23 + 0.56% of the total polyprenol yield). Abies sibirica L. polyprenol solubility and incorporation efficiency into liposomes were studied in various commercially available lecithin mixtures (Phosal IP40, Phosal 75SA, and Lipoid P45). The resulting multilamellar polyprenol liposomes were morphologically characterized by Light and Transmission Electron Microscopy, and the liposome size was discovered to be polymodal with the main peak at 1360 nm (90% of the volume). As polyprenols are fully soluble only in lipids, a liposomal formulation based upon co-solubilization and a modified ethanol injection method of polyprenols into the ethanol-phospholipid system was developed for the entrapment and delivery of polyprenols for potential commercial applications in food supplement and cosmetic industries.
