36049381|a|STUDY OBJECTIVE: Postoperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) are common complications after surgery under general anesthesia. In our aging society the incidence of PND will increase. Hence, interdisciplinary efforts should be taken to minimize the occurrence of PND. Electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring of brain activity during anesthesia or emergence from anesthesia is a promising tool to identify patients at risk. We therefore investigated whether we could identify specific EEG signatures during emergence of anesthesia that are associated with the occurrence of PND. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: We performed a prospective observational investigation on 116 patients to evaluate the EEG features during emergence from general anesthesia dominated by slow delta waves in patients with and without delirium in the postoperative care unit (PACU-D) as assessed by the CAM-ICU and the RASS. MAIN RESULTS: During emergence both the frontal and global EEG of patients with PACU-D were significantly different from patients without PACU-D. PACU-D patients had lower relative alpha power and reduced fronto-parietal alpha coherence. CONCLUSIONS: With our analysis we show differences in EEG features associated with anesthesia emergence in patients with and without PACU-D. Frontal and global EEG alpha-band features could help to identify patients with PACU-D. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT03287401.
