37301889|t|Synthesis of new hybrid pyridines catalyzed by Fe3O4@SiO2@urea-riched ligand/Ch-Cl.
37301889|a|Herein, a new heterogeneous catalytic system through modification of urea functionalized magnetic nanoparticles with choline chloride [Fe3O4@SiO2@urea-riched ligand/Ch-Cl] was designed and synthesized. Then, the synthesized Fe3O4@SiO2@urea-riched ligand/Ch-Cl was characterized by using FT-IR spectroscopy, FESEM, TEM, EDS-Mapping, TGA/DTG and VSM techniques. After that, the catalytic usage of Fe3O4@SiO2@urea-riched ligand/Ch-Cl was investigated for the synthesis of hybrid pyridines with sulfonate and/or indole moieties. Delightfully, the outcome was satisfactory and the applied strategy represents several advantages such as short reaction times, convenience of operation and relatively good yields of obtained products. Moreover, the catalytic behavior of several formal homogeneous DESs was investigated for the synthesis of target product. In addition, a cooperative vinylogous anomeric-based oxidation pathway was suggested as rational mechanism for the synthesis of new hybrid pyridines.
