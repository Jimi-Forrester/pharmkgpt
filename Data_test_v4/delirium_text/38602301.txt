38602301|a|Bedside-teaching on dementia and delirium: Development, implementation, and evaluation in an acute care hospital Abstract: Background: Demographic change and the accompanying increase in people with dementia and delirium in acute care hospitals pose growing challenges for nurses in acute care wards. Objective: Pilot implementation and evaluation of knowledge gain and implementation of previously defined critical behaviors. Method: Implementation of the training by APNs. Parallel evaluation of the training along the New World Kirkpatrick model using questionnaires and non-participant observation. Analysis of the data using descriptive statistics. Results: The training itself was well evaluated by the participants. It showed an increase in knowledge of the participants in the main topic categories. The targeted critical behaviors were implemented for the most part. There are deficiencies in the mapping of interventions in the nursing care process. Conclusion: The training concept is suitable to give nurses confidence in dealing with people with dementia and delirium. Continuous support in practice is needed to maintain the interventions in the long term and sustainably in everyday life.
