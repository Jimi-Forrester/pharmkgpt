27215525|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric stump cancer. METHODS: Clinical and follow-up data of 7 patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric stump cancer in our department from January 2008 to July 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: There were 5 male and 2 female patients, with a mean age of (62.1+-10.7) years. Initial gastrectomy was performed for gastric cancer in 3 patients and peptic ulceration in 4. The initial surgery was B-II( gastrojejunostomy in 6 patients and Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy in 1. Duration between primary gastrectomy and occurrence of gastric stump cancer was ranged from 6-30 years for peptic ulceration, and from 11-15 years for gastric cancer. During the operation, adhesiolysis and exploration to locate the tumor were performed. Following total remnant gastrectomy and lymphadenectomy, intracorporeal anastomosis was accomplished by Roux-en-Y reconstruction. The methods of intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy were end-to-side approach using a circular stapler in 1 patient, side-to-side approach using an endoscopic linear staple in 2 patients, and hand-sewn technique in 4 patients. The operation time was (247.1+-17.5) minutes and the intraoperative blood loss was (100.0+-30.8) ml without transfusion. The number of retrieved lymph node was 19.1+-4.8. The first flatus time, diet resumption time, postoperative hospital stay were (3.3+-1.5) days, (3.7+-0.8) days, (9.4+-2.6) days, respectively. One patient experienced gastrointestinal bleeding that was managed conservatively and ultimately cured. Seven patients were followed up till January 2016. After follow-up from 6 to 38 months, 1 patient died of peritoneal metastasis 17 months after surgery, and 1 patient died of Alzheimer's disease 19 months after surgery. The other 5 patients were still alive without metastasis or recurrence. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric stump cancer is feasible and safe.
