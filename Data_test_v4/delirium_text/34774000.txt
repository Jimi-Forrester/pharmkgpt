34774000|t|Identification of risk factors associated with oral 5-aminolevulinic acid-induced hypotension in photodynamic diagnosis for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer: a multicenter retrospective study.
34774000|a|BACKGROUND: To investigate risk factors for orally administered 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-induced hypotension for bladder cancer patients receiving photodynamic diagnosis (PDD)-assisted transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). METHODS: Patients were categorized into two groups intraoperatively: a hypotensive group (minimum systolic blood pressure (SBP) <=80 mmHg) and a non-hypotensive group (minimum SBP > 80 mmHg). We examined differences between the hypotensive group and non-hypotensive groups to identify clinical risk of ALA-induced hypotension using multivariate logistic regression analysis and decision tree analysis. RESULTS: Among 282 cases with ALA-PDD-assisted TURBT from three institutions who were screened, 245 patients were included in the final analysis. In total, 156 patients (63.7%) showed any grade of hypotension during ALA-PDD-assisted TURBT. General anesthesia and spinal anesthesia were induced intraoperatively in 113 patients (46.1%) and 132 patients (53.9%), respectively. Median SBP at baseline (before taking ALA) and at the beginning of anesthesia was 127 mmHg (range, 69-186 mmHg) and 124 mmHg (range, 69-186 mmHg), respectively. Median minimum SBP during ALA-PDD-assisted TURBT was 75 mmHg (range, 43-140 mmHg). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that history of hypertension (odds ratio (OR) 7.568, p < 0.05) and general anesthesia (OR 14.435, p < 0.05) as significantly associated with an increased risk of hypotension incidence. Use of calcium antagonist showed significant negative associations with hypotension (OR 0.183, p < 0.05). Decision tree analysis showed presence of general anesthesia, age >= 74 years and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (ASA-PS) >=2 as the most important discriminators. CONCLUSIONS: General anesthesia and hypertension were independent risk factors related to ALA-induced hypotension. In contrast, use of calcium antagonists was identified as a factor associated with reduced risk of ALA-induced hypotension.
