33494539|a|The objective of this review was to analyze the process of wear of implants leading to the shedding of titanium particles into the peri-implant hard and soft tissues. Titanium is considered highly biocompatible with low corrosion and toxicity, but recent studies indicate that this understanding may be misleading as the properties of the material change drastically when titanium nanoparticles (NPs) are shed from implant surfaces. These NPs are immunogenic and are associated with a macrophage-mediated inflammatory response by the host. The literature discussed in this review indicates that titanium NPs may be shed from implant surfaces at the time of implant placement, under loading conditions, and during implant maintenance procedures. We also discuss the significance of the micro-gap at the implant-abutment interface and the effect of size of the titanium particles on their toxicology. These findings are significant as the titanium particles can have adverse effects on local soft and hard tissues surrounding implants, implant health and prognosis, and even the health of systemic tissues and organs.
