37123775|a|Introduction Survivors of an acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) may suffer from a long-term neurological disability, cognitive impairment, anxiety, and depression, which can also be related to post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of PICS symptoms in post-intensive care (ICU) aftercare aSAH patients. Methods We conducted an observational cohort study in aSAH patients from a post-ICU aftercare clinic (ICU-AC). PICS symptoms were evaluated using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and a medical questionnaire for physical and cognitive functioning. Results A total of 110 patients were included. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms was 23.6% and 19.1%, respectively. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was seen in 26.4%. Cognitive complaints were lack of concentration (63.6%), short-term memory loss (45.8%), and reduced speed of thinking (60.9%). The most reported physical complaints were fatigue (73.6%), limitations in daily activity (72.7%), muscle weakness (41.8%), pain (36.4%), and weight loss (30.9%). PICS symptoms related to all three domains were present in 30% of patients. Conclusion The prevalence of PICS in patients after aSAH is high. Even in patients without aSAH-related neurological impairment who were discharged home, a high prevalence of PICS symptoms was reported. Early screening for PICS should comprise all three domains and is important to facilitate a better tailored rehabilitation of these patients.
