36738696|a|Mung bean seeds were treated by a combination of ultrasound and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Effect of these treatments on the free polyphenols content, antioxidant activity, and digestibility of mung bean sprouts was evaluated. Additionally, phenolic compounds were analyzed and identified using a metabolomics approach. The combined ultrasound and GABA treatments significantly enhanced the free polyphenols and flavonoids content (P < 0.05) of mung bean sprouts depending on sprouting duration. Besides, a positive correlation (P < 0.05) was found between the polyphenols content and in vitro antioxidant activity of mung bean sprouts. Moreover, a total number of 608 metabolites were detected, and 55 polyphenol compounds were identified, including flavonoids, isoflavones, phenols, and coumarins. Also, the KEGG metabolic pathway analysis revealed 10 metabolic pathways of phenols, including flavonoid, isoflavone, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Powder of 48 h sprouted mung bean released polyphenols during simulated gastric digestion and possessed antioxidant activity.
