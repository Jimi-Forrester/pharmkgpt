14704392|t|Evaluating a practice-oriented service model to increase the use of respite services among minorities and rural caregivers.
14704392|a|PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the practice-oriented model of service use (Yeatts, Crow, & Folts, 1992) relative to the more widely used behavioral model ( Andersen, 1968) in its ability to explain the use of respite services by caregivers of Alzheimer's patients. Unlike the behavioral model, which focuses primarily on characteristics of the service user, the practice-oriented model focuses primarily on characteristics of the service. DESIGN AND METHODS: Interview data from 1,158 caregivers participating in the Alzheimer's Disease Demonstration Grants to States program ( Montgomery, Kosloski, Karner, & Schaefer, 2002) were analyzed. Separate regression models were estimated for adult day care and in-home respite, using the full information maximum likelihood procedure described by Arbuckle (1996), and ordinary least squares regression with listwise deletion of missing data. RESULTS: The findings indicate that the factors related to respite use tapped by the practice-oriented model add significantly to explanatory models of service use over models that use only the factors typically represented by the behavioral model. Additional analyses, including a set of interactions with ethnicity, indicated that this improvement occurs primarily for White and Hispanic caregivers, and less so for African Americans. IMPLICATIONS: The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for enhancing the timely use of respite services and directions for future research.
