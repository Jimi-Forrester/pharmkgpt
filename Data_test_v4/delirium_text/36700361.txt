36700361|a|BACKGROUND: There is a high incidence of perioperative anxiety in the pediatric population, with adverse side effects, such as emergency delirium and maladaptive postoperative behaviors. AIMS: The study's objective was to compare the level of preoperative anxiety in children after standard preparation plus a virtual tour of the operating room vs. standard preparation alone. PATIENTS/METHODS: This was a prospective single-center, randomized, controlled, blinded trial with parallel assignment, registered as NCT04043663. Eligible subjects were healthy children (ASA I-II) aged 4-12, scheduled for outpatient surgery. Five visits were conducted during the study, two at the hospital and three over the phone. Variables assessed were child's anxiety through the modified Yale Perioperative Anxiety Scale, demographic data, cooperation with induction through the Induction Compliance Checklist, preoperative parental anxiety through the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Anxiety Visual Analog Scale, the postoperative delirium degree through the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scale, the presence of behavioral changes through the Post Hospitalization Behavior Questionnaire for Ambulatory Surgery, and the overall parental satisfaction. RESULTS: A total of 125 participants were included; 61 (48.8%) of them were randomized to the Virtual Tour Group (VT+) and 64 (51.2%) to the Non-virtual Tour Group (VT-). Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale results in VT+ vs. VT- were mean 27.26 vs. 32.57, and median 23.4 (CI 95% 23.4-23.4) vs. 23.4 (CI 95% 23.4-33.4), (p = .0086). In the VT+ group, satisfaction was higher for questions one (p = .0213), three (p = <.0001), and four (p = .0130). Throughout the study, we observed a significant reduction in perioperative anxiety in the VT+ group, facilitating anesthetic induction in perfect (p = .018) and moderate compliance (p = .0428). The other variables did not show statistically significant differences. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms previous studies that found virtual tours for perioperative patients may reduce perioperative anxiety and improve satisfaction. We found no impact on longer-term outcomes.
