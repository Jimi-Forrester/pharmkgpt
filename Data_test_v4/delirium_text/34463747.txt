34463747|t|Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities Among Children With the Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer Disease Presenilin 1 E280A Variant From a Colombian Cohort.
34463747|a|Importance: We previously reported that children with the autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) presenilin 1 (PSEN1) E280A variant had early life plasma biomarker findings consistent with amyloid beta overproduction. However, the cognitive functioning of children with this variant has not been characterized vs those without the variant. Objective: To test whether cognitive functioning of children with and without the PSEN1 E280A variant in the same ADAD cohort differed by genetic status (ie, PSEN1 variant) and sex. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was conducted among 1354 children (including 265 children with the variant) aged 6 to 16 years recruited from the Alzheimer Prevention Initiative Colombia Registry. Participants from the city of Medellin and surrounding suburban areas traveled to the University of Antioquia to undergo all procedures. Participants were administered a Spanish version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) to measure general cognitive functioning. Data were analyzed from July through November 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Univariate general linear models were used to characterize differences on WISC-IV cognitive performance by genetic status, sex, and the interaction of genetic status with sex. Urbanity, socioeconomic status, and education were entered as covariates. Results: Among 1354 children with ADAD (695 [51.3%] girls; mean [SD] age, 11.64 [2.64] years), there were 265 children with the variant (19.6%) and 1089 children without the variant (80.4%). Children with and without the variant did not differ by demographic variables or performance on WISC-IV indices. Irrespective of genetic status, boys had statistically significantly decreased mean scores on indices for working memory (90.27 [95% CI, 89.21-91.34] vs 92.99 [95% CI, 91.98-93.99]; mean difference = -2.72; P < .001), perceptual reasoning (91.56 [95% CI, 90.47-92.65] vs. 93.27 [95% CI, 91.23-94.30]; mean difference = -1.71; P = .03), and verbal comprehension (88.69 [95% CI, 87.54-89.84] vs. 90.81 [95% CI, 89.73-91.90]; mean difference = -2.12; P = .009) compared with girls. In the interaction between sex and genetic status, boys with the variant had worse mean working memory index performance (88.78 [95% CI, 86.86-90.70]) than girls with the variant (93.75 [95% CI, 91.95-95.55]; mean difference = -4.97; P = .001), as well as boys (91.77 [95% CI, 90.85-92.70]; mean difference = -2.99; P = .04) and girls (92.22 [95% CI, 91.32-93.13]; mean difference = -3.44; P = .009) without the variant. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that boys with the PSEN1 variant had decreased working memory abilities compared with girls with the variant and boys and girls without the variant, suggesting a sex-specific genetic risk in early life cognitive performance among individuals with the PSEN1 variant. This increased risk of future cognitive difficulties among boys with the variant may have important downstream implications for learning and academic achievement and could be associated with sex differences seen in adulthood on episodic memory measures.
