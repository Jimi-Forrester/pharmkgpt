39859339|t|Mitochondrial microRNAs: Key Drivers in Unraveling Neurodegenerative Diseases.
39859339|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) crucial for regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Recent evidence has shown that miRNAs are also found in mitochondria, organelles that produce energy in the cell. These mitochondrial miRNAs, also known as mitomiRs, are essential for regulating mitochondrial function and metabolism. MitomiRs can originate from the nucleus, following traditional miRNA biogenesis pathways, or potentially from mitochondrial DNA, allowing them to directly affect gene expression and cellular energy dynamics within the mitochondrion. While miRNAs have been extensively investigated, the function and involvement of mitomiRs in the development of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis remain to be elucidated. This review aims to discuss findings on the role of mitomiRs in such diseases and their potential as therapeutic targets, as well as to highlight future research directions.
