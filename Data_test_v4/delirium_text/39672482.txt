39672482|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a debilitating neurocognitive disorder with an unclear underlying mechanism. Recent studies have implicated gut microbiota dysbiosis with the onset and progression of AD. The connection between gut microbiota and AD can significantly affect the prevention and treatment of AD patients. This systematic review summarizes primary outcomes of human and mouse AD models concerning gut microbiota alterations. A systematic literature search in February through March 2023 was conducted on PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. We identified 711 as potential manuscripts of which 672 were excluded because of irrelevance to the identified search criteria. Primary outcomes include microbiota compositions of control and AD models in humans and mice. In total, 39 studies were included (19 mouse and 20 human studies), published between 2017 and 2023. We included studies involving well-established mice models of AD (5xFAD, 3xTg-AD, APP/PS1, Tg2576, and APPPS2) which harbor mutations and genes that drive the formation of Ass plaques. All human studies were included on those with AD or mild cognitive impairment. Among alterations in gut microbiota, most studies found a decreased abundance of the phyla Firmicutes and Bifidobacteria, a genus of the phylum Actinomycetota. An increased abundance of the phyla Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were identified in animal and human studies. Studies indicated that gut microbiota alter the pathogenesis of AD through its impact on neuroinflammation and permeability of the gastrointestinal tract. The ensuing increase in blood-brain barrier permeability may accelerate Abeta penetrance and formation of neuritic plaques that align with the amyloid hypothesis of AD pathogenesis. Further studies should assess the relationship between gut microbiota and AD progression and therapy preserving beneficial gut microbiota.
