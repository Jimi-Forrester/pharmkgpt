37924089|a|Lacticaseibacillus is one of the predominant microorganisms in gut from human and animal, and the lacticaseibacillus have effective applications against the viral diarrhea of piglets in the farm. However, the function and the concrete cell single pathways of the active ingredient from lacticaseibacillus was not clear within anti-infection in the postbiotics research. Here, we compared the biological function of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) purified from lacticaseibacillus casei (L. casei) and gene editing lacticaseibacillus casei with the CRISPER-Cas9 technology, which were with the ability of antioxidation and anti-inflammation, and the EPS could also inhibit the ROS production within the Porcine Small Intestinal Epithelial Cells-J2 (IPEC-J2). Interestingly, we found that both of EPS and genome editing lacticaseibacillus casei could specifically target the IFN-lambda expression in the IPEC-J2, which was beneficial against the PEDV infection in the virus replication and production with the qRT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence methods. Finally, the STAT3 cell single pathway was stimulated to transcribe IFN-lambda with the EPS to elucidate the detailed mechanism of activating type III IFN signals receptor of IL-10R2, which play the function between anti-inflammation and anti-virus in the PEDV infection. Taken together, our research linked a postbiotics of EPS with the antiviral infection of PEDV, which suggest that the lacticaseibacillus itself still have displayed the potential immunomodulatory activities, and highlight the immunomodulatory potential of EPS-producing microbes.
