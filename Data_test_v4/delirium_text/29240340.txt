29240340|t|Update on Current Care guideline: Memory Disorders.
29240340|a|Any complaint about memory should be examined. Diagnosis is based on international criteria. Basic evaluation consists of medical history, clinical evaluation, cognitive tests and brain imaging. When a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), AD with cerebrovascular disease or with Lewy Body disease (LBD), or Dementia associated with Parkinson's disease or LBD is made, evidence-based medical therapy (acetylcholine esterase inhibitor or memantine) is indicated as a part of comprehensive care. In frontotemporal degenerations, these drugs are ineffective. For severe behavioural disorders, other psychoactive medications can be applied if non-pharmacological treatments are not sufficient.
