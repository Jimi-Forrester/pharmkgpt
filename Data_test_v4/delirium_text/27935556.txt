27935556|a|Epigenetic aberrations have been identified as biomarkers to predict the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to evaluate whether altered DNA methylation status of BDNF promoter could be used as potential epigenetic biomarkers for predicting the progression from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) to AD. A total of 506 aMCI patients and 728 cognitively normal controls were recruited in the cross-sectional analyses. Patients (n = 458) from aMCI cohort were classified into two groups after 5-year follow-up: aMCI-stable group (n = 330) and AD-conversion group (n = 128). DNA methylation of BDNF promoter was detected by bisulfite-PCR amplification and pyrosequencing. The DNA methylation levels of CpG1 and CpG2 in promoter I and CpG5 and CpG6 in promoter IV of BDNF gene were significantly higher in the aMCI group than in the control group at baseline and also were increased in the conversion group compared with the non-conversion group at 5-year follow up time point. CpG5 in BDNF promoter IV had the highest AUC of 0.910 (95% CI: 0.817-0.983, p < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant AD conversion propensity for aMCI patients with high methylation levels of CpG5 (HR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.07-2.98, p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed elevated methylation status of CpG5 was a significant independent predictor for AD conversion (HR = 3.51, p = 0.013). These results suggest that elevation of peripheral BDNF promoter methylation might be used as potential epigenetic biomarkers for predicting the conversion from aMCI to AD.
