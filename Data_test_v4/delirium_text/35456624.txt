35456624|t|Advantageous Reactivity of Unstable Metal Complexes: Potential Applications of Metal-Based Anticancer Drugs for Intratumoral Injections.
35456624|a|Injections of highly cytotoxic or immunomodulating drugs directly into the inoperable tumor is a procedure that is increasingly applied in the clinic and uses established Pt-based drugs. It is advantageous for less stable anticancer metal complexes that fail administration by the standard intravenous route. Such hydrophobic metal-containing complexes are rapidly taken up into cancer cells and cause cell death, while the release of their relatively non-toxic decomposition products into the blood has low systemic toxicity and, in some cases, may even be beneficial. This concept was recently proposed for V(V) complexes with hydrophobic organic ligands, but it can potentially be applied to other metal complexes, such as Ti(IV), Ga(III) and Ru(III) complexes, some of which were previously unsuccessful in human clinical trials when administered via intravenous injections. The potential beneficial effects include antidiabetic, neuroprotective and tissue-regenerating activities for V(V/IV); antimicrobial activities for Ga(III); and antimetastatic and potentially immunogenic activities for Ru(III). Utilizing organic ligands with limited stability under biological conditions, such as Schiff bases, further enhances the tuning of the reactivities of the metal complexes under the conditions of intratumoral injections. However, nanocarrier formulations are likely to be required for the delivery of unstable metal complexes into the tumor.
