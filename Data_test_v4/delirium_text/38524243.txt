38524243|t|Profile of Caregiving Activities and Association With Physical Health Among Dementia Spousal Caregivers.
38524243|a|Background and Objectives: This study aims to identify patterns of caregiving intensity and assess associations between caregiving intensity and multidimensional physical health indicators and health behaviors among spousal caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. Research Design and Methods: Using data from 152 spousal caregivers aged 65 and older, the intensity of their caregiving experience was measured as the number and frequency of health- and medical-related helping activities for their care recipient. Multidimensional health indicators included self-reported fatigue, sleep disturbance, physical functioning, pain interference, general health, and the number of chronic conditions from the electronic health records. Self-reported health promotion behaviors were assessed as health responsibility, physical activity, nutrition, interpersonal relations, and stress management. Results: Two distinct caregiving intensity patterns, high-intensity (37.5%) and low-intensity (62.5%) caregiving, were identified with cluster analysis. Caregivers in the high-intensity caregiving cluster reported feeling more tired (t = 2.25, p < .05), experiencing more sleep disturbance (t = 3.06, p < .01), and performing less physical activity (t = 2.05, p < .05) compared with caregivers in the low-intensity group. Discussion and Implications: Future studies are needed to develop effective interventions to address caregiving intensity and its consequences on the health of spousal caregivers of persons with dementia.
