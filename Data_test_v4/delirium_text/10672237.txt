10672237|a|There is substantial evidence of mitochondrial defects in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (AD and PD). We have probed the molecular implications of mitochondrial dysfunction in these diseases by transferring mitochondria from platelets obtained from disease and control donors into mitochondrial DNA-depleted recipient neuron-based cells (rho 0 cells). This process creates cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) cells where the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from the donor is expressed in the nuclear and cellular background of the host rho 0 cell. Differences in phenotype between disease and control groups can thus be attributed to the exogenous mitochondria and mtDNA. Key methodological issues relating to this approach were addressed by demonstrating that recipient rho 0 cells have < 1 mtDNA copy/cell, and that exclusive repopulation with donor mtDNA occurs in cybrid cells. Further, we describe that sampling of heterogeneous cell populations is a valid approach for cybrid analysis. Our studies show that the focal respiratory chain defects reported in platelets of AD and PD cybrids can be recapitulated in AD and PD cybrids. In addition, both AD and PD cybrids display increased oxidative stress and perturbations in calcium homeostasis. These data suggest that the transfer of a mtDNA defect from disease donor platelets is the likely cause of the cybrid biochemical phenotype, and highlight the potential value of these cell lines as cellular disease models.
