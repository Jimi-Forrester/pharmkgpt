26738344|t|A comparison of hair and serum trace elements in patients with Alzheimer disease and healthy participants.
26738344|a|BACKGROUND/AIM: To determine whether there was a difference between serum and hair trace elements' concentrations in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and healthy participants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hair and serum copper, selenium, zinc, magnesium, manganese, and iron levels were measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry in patients with AD and healthy participants, and the obtained results were statistically compared. RESULTS: The mean hair selenium and zinc levels of patients with AD were significantly lower than the levels found for control participants (P < 0.05). Patients with AD had significantly higher mean hair copper and manganese levels than the controls. There were no significant differences between AD patients and controls with respect to the hair iron and magnesium levels (P > 0.05). Hair and serum trace element (copper, selenium, zinc, magnesium, manganese, and iron) levels in patients with AD showed no significant difference according to mini mental test scores or sex (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Some trace element levels may change in patients with AD. Due to the more permanent status, the analysis of these element levels in hair might be superior to blood analysis.
