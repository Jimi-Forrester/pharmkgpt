38069333|t|The Effect of Fat Intake with Increased Omega-6-to-Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Ratio in Animal Models of Early and Late Alzheimer's Disease-like Pathogenesis.
38069333|a|This work aims to clarify the effect of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake on the adult brain affected by amyloid pathology. McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic (Tg) rat and 5xFAD Tg mouse models that represent earlier or later disease stages were employed. The animals were exposed to a control diet (CD) or an HFD based on corn oil, from young (rats) or adult (mice) ages for 24 or 10 weeks, respectively. In rats and mice, the HFD impaired reference memory in wild-type (WT) animals but did not worsen it in Tg, did not cause obesity, and did not increase triglycerides or glucose levels. Conversely, the HFD promoted stronger microglial activation in Tg vs. WT rats but had no effect on cerebral amyloid deposition. IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, and IL-6 plasma levels were increased in Tg rats, regardless of diet, while CXCL1 chemokine levels were increased in HFD-fed mice, regardless of genotype. Hippocampal 3-nitrotyrosine levels tended to increase in HFD-fed Tg rats but not in mice. Overall, an HFD with an elevated omega-6-to-omega-3 ratio as compared to the CD (25:1 vs. 8.4:1) did not aggravate the outcome of AD regardless of the stage of amyloid pathology, suggesting that many neurobiological processes relevant to AD are not directly dependent on PUFA intake.
