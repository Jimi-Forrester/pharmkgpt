32141445|a|Xanthoceras sorbifolia Bunge is an edible oil tree species peculiar to China and it has long been used as a traditional medicine for enuresis in children. In this study, we investigated the active components in X. sorbifolia and eight barrigenol-type triterpenoids were isolated and identified. All the isolated compounds were tested first for H2O2-induced oxidative stress on human SH-SY5Y cells. Then Y-maze, Morris water maze, novel object recognition and passive avoidance tests were conducted to evaluate the improved effect of selected compounds with neuroprotective activity on ICV Abeta1-42 mice. Among all the tested compounds, XS-8 exhibited significant protective effects against learning and memory impairments induced by ICV-Abeta1-42. The XS-8 treatment significantly altered Abeta-induced hippocampal oxidative defense (increased MDA, nitrite and decreased SOD, glutathione) and pro-inflammatory levels (increased IL-1beta and IL-18). The present study strongly suggests that X. sorbifolia is a promising plant resource for AD use and other neurodegenerative diseases.
