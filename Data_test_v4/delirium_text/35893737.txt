35893737|t|Immunomodulatory and Antiaging Mechanisms of Resveratrol, Rapamycin, and Metformin: Focus on mTOR and AMPK Signaling Networks.
35893737|a|Aging results from the progressive dysregulation of several molecular pathways and mTOR and AMPK signaling have been suggested to play a role in the complex changes in key biological networks involved in cellular senescence. Moreover, multiple factors, including poor nutritional balance, drive immunosenescence progression, one of the meaningful aspects of aging. Unsurprisingly, nutraceutical and pharmacological interventions could help maintain an optimal biological response by providing essential bioactive micronutrients required for the development, maintenance, and the expression of the immune response at all stages of life. In this regard, many studies have provided evidence of potential antiaging properties of resveratrol, as well as rapamycin and metformin. Indeed, in vitro and in vivo models have demonstrated for these molecules a number of positive effects associated with healthy aging. The current review focuses on the mechanisms of action of these three important compounds and their suggested use for the clinical treatment of immunosenescence and aging.
