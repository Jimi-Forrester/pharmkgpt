36860819|t|Peripheral Nerve Block Practice in Portugal: A National Survey.
36860819|a|Regional anesthesia (RA) has several benefits and its use has increased with the advent of ultrasound-guided techniques. Opioid-sparing anesthesia and reduced use of general anesthesia are some of the mainstay advantages of RA. Although anesthetic practices differ deeply between countries, RA has assumed a crucial role in the daily practice of anesthesiologists, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic period. This cross-sectional study provides an overview of peripheral nerve block (PNB) techniques performed in Portuguese hospitals. An online survey was reviewed by members of Clube de Anestesia Regional (CAR/ESRA Portugal) and then sent to a national mailing list of anesthesiologists. The survey focused on specific topics related to RA techniques such as the importance of training and experience, and the relevance of logistical limitations during the execution of RA. All data were collected anonymously and included in a Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) database, for further analysis. A total of 335 valid answers were obtained. All participants considered RA as a key competence in their daily practice. Half of those inquired performed PNB techniques once to twice per week. The main limitations identified for performing RA in Portuguese hospitals were the absence of block rooms and insufficiently trained personnel for the appropriate and safe execution of these techniques. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of RA in the Portuguese setting and could serve as a baseline for further studies.
