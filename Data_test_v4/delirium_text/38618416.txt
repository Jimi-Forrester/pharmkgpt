38618416|t|Periodontal and Systemic Diseases: A Descriptive Analysis of Awareness Among the General Saudi Population.
38618416|a|Background Taking into account the limited availability of research data, this study aimed to determine the general Saudi population's awareness of the link between periodontal diseases and systemic diseases. Methodology A structured online questionnaire with eight awareness items, apart from demographic variables, was distributed through email, WhatsApp, and Telegram to a sample of 500 individuals. The data were analyzed using a simple descriptive statistical approach and interpreted as ratios for comparison. The awareness regarding systemic diseases associated with periodontal diseases was classified into the following four categories based on the Bloom cutoff points: high (>80%), average (60-79%), low (40-59%), and extremely low (<40%). Results A response rate of 68% was reached with the participation of 340 Saudi citizens residing in the Al Qassim region. Overall, 61.22% of research participants had an average awareness of the link between periodontal and systemic diseases. Almost two-thirds (>60%) of participants were aware that periodontal diseases and systemic diseases have an association and that individuals with systemic diseases need a periodontal checkup. A majority (85%) of participants opined that periodontal treatment has the potential to enhance overall health. Nonetheless, only a few participants (60%) were aware of the association between diabetes mellitus and periodontal diseases, and they had a limited awareness of the association with other systemic diseases. Conclusions Although the Saudi general population possesses average awareness about the relationship between periodontal diseases and systemic diseases, their awareness about different systemic diseases and conditions is extremely low, particularly regarding infertility, stroke, and metabolic diseases. The present research indicates a deficiency in the efforts by healthcare professionals, community service providers, and community administrators to educate the general public regarding the association between periodontal diseases and systemic diseases. This awareness is crucial for individuals to control these intricate, interconnected diseases.
