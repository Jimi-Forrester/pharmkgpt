38445074|t|The profile of people undergoing lower limb amputations at Groote Schuur Hospital.
38445074|a|Background: The annual incidence of lower limb amputations (LLA) at Groote Schuur Hospital is rising gradually. However, little is known about the sociodemographic and clinical profiles of people undergoing these limb amputations. Objectives: To collect and analyse data to describe the sociodemographic, health and amputation profiles of people who have undergone LLA at Groote Schuur Hospital. Method: A descriptive retrospective chart review was conducted using a sample of 107 participants who had undergone LLA at Groote Schuur Hospital between January 2019 and July 2020. A customised assessment tool was used to extract data on the sociodemographic, health and amputation profiles of patients who had LLA. Data were analysed descriptively. Results: Sixty per cent of the patients who had undergone LLA at Groote Schuur Hospital were women. Most of the patients were over the age of 60 years and had not completed school and were pensioners or unemployed, with very low income and multiple co-morbidities including poorly controlled diabetes. Conclusions: Complications because of uncontrolled diabetes were the primary indication for LLAs at Groote Schuur Hospital. Therefore, health literacy projects are indicated to address chronic diseases of lifestyle, which, in turn, may reduce the overall burden of LLA, particularly on the South African under-resourced healthcare system. Contribution: The results of this study may help us identify key factors that predispose patients to LLAs. Consequently, this may help us identify key areas for prevention and better management of diseases that can result in complications that indicate the need for amputation.
