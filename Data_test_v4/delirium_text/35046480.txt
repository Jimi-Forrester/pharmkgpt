35046480|a|Understanding molecular mechanisms of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) and providing a novel target for the treatment of IDD have important implications. We sought to explore a new promising gene target for the treatment of IDD. This study integrated 19,678 genes of 38 IDD patients from two gene datasets. Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) of annulus fibrosus were analyzed in groups with mild disc degeneration (MDD) and severe disc degeneration (SDD). We screened the hub gene through biological information technology (bioinformatic) methods. Then, we further validated the hub gene using annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus tissues from 12 patients with qRT-PCR. In addition, we explored its underlying molecular mechanism with GO, KEGG and GSEA. Through multiple screening bioinformatics methods, the hub gene CD63 was identified. The qRT-PCR explored that CD63 decreased significantly in SDD group compared to that in MDD group (P < 0.001). The GO, KEGG and GSEA of CD63 explored significant enrichment of the molecular features (P < 0.001), including the cellular component (Extracellular matrix, P < 0.001), the molecular function (collagen binding, P < 0.001), the biological processes (protein targeting, collagen fibril organization and platelet degranulation, P < 0.001) and the signaling pathways. Our research explored and validated a new regulatory gene, CD63 for different degrees of IDD. A new novel form of therapeutic target for IDD may be developed.
