34553108|a|Immunosenescence, also known as immune aging, refers to the degeneration, compensation, and reconstruction of the immune system with aging. Immune aging is an important factor in the increased susceptibility of the elderly to infectious diseases, malignant tumors, and a variety of chronic diseases and has long been a hotspot in geriatrics and immunology research. In this paper, the characteristics and progression of immune aging are briefly reviewed for clinicians' reference.
