38106299|t|The image quality, amyloid-beta detectability, and acquisition time of clinical florbetapir positron emission tomography in Alzheimer's disease and healthy adults.
38106299|a|Background: Florbetapir positron emission tomography (AV45 PET) is a widely employed modality for detecting cerebral amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition. However, in clinical settings, patients with cognitive impairment are frequently unable to sustain adequate stillness during the scanning procedure. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of a short acquisition time on the image quality and Abeta detectability of AV45 PET. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 29 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 13 healthy participants underwent 15-minute AV45 PET/magnetic resonance imaging scanning. The PET data were subsequently reconstructed into 15-, 10-, 8-, 6-, 4-, 2-, and 1-minute duration groups (G15, G10, G8, G6, G4, G2, and G1). Subjective PET image quality was scored based on a 5-point Likert scale (poor-excellent: 1-5), and objective image quality was evaluated by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the 1 cm3 region of interest (ROI) inside the cerebellum. Abeta detectability was assessed by the calculation of regional standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) values in all groups. The Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test and paired t-test were performed to compare the subjective scores, SNR, and SUVR values. The visual inspection was also performed by 2 nuclear physicians to give a binary diagnosis to each case. Results: The subjective scores were decreased in the groups with shortened scanning time relative to the G15 group (4.67+-0.48, all P<0.05). Notably, a good image quality score was also given to the G10 group (4.40+-0.63), and sufficient image quality could be achieved with the G8 (3.86+-0.68) and G6 (3.14+-0.52) groups. The SNR values were decreased by 10.33%, 17.74%, and 23.26% in the G10, G8, and G6 group, respectively (all P<0.05). Compared with the G15 group (1.48+-0.16), the composite SUVR values were increased in the G10 (1.50+-0.16), G8 (1.50+-0.17), and G6 groups (1.51+-0.18, all P<0.05). By visual inspection, the diagnoses of each case in the G10, G8, and G6 group were identical with those in the G15 group. Conclusions: The acquisition time of AV45 PET is required to reach at least 6 minutes to achieve acceptable image quality and maintained Abeta detectability.
