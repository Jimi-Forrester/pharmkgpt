17416103|t|A brief history of tau: the evolving view of the microtubule-associated protein tau in neurodegenerative diseases.
17416103|a|The major historical milestones in tau-research are reviewed, with their implications for changing perspectives about the significance of tau-pathology in neurodegeneration. Abnormalities of tau-protein characterize the pathology of numerous neurodegenerative disorders, both sporadic and inherited. Over the years, opinions regarding the significance of tau in disease pathogenesis, particularly in Alzheimer's disease, have fluctuated. Early caution about the role of tau as a significant factor in neurodegenerative disease, especially Alzheimer's disease, has been superseded by acceptance of its key involvement in pathways which led to cell dysfunction and death. The discovery of familial "tauopathies", associated with tau-gene mutations, has confirmed that tau-dysmetabolism can independently lead to neurodegeneration. Debate about the centrality of its role remains, but current evidence makes it difficult to ignore the importance of tau in many neurodegenerative diseases. By examining the evolution of research on tau, related to advances in technology and the emergence of new diseases, the future developments needed to resolve remaining issues in the tau-story may be discerned.
