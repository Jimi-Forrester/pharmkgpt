21250820|a|Protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) in the endoplasmic reticulum catalyzes the rearrangement of disulphide bridges during folding of secreted proteins. It binds various molecules that inhibit its activity. But here, we looked for molecules that would potentiate its activity. PDI reductase activity was measured in vitro using di-eosin-oxidized glutathione as substrate. Its classical inhibitor bacitracin was found to exert a biphasic effect: stimulatory at low concentrations (~10(-6) M) and inhibitory only at higher concentrations (~10(-4)-10(-3) M). The weak oestrogenic molecule bisphenol A was found to exert a weak inhibitory effect on PDI reductase activity relative to the strong oestrogens, ethynylestradiol, and diethylstilbestrol. Like 19-nortestosterone, fluoxetine was found to exert a potentiating effect on PDI reductase activity and their potentiating effects could be reversed by increasing concentrations of oestrogens. In conclusion, this paper provides the first identification of potentiators of PDI activity that are potential pharmaceuticals against pathologies affecting protein folding such as Alzheimer's disease.
