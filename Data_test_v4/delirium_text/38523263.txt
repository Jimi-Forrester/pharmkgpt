38523263|t|Thiophene-Based Ligands for Specific Assignment of Distinct Abeta Pathologies in Alzheimer's Disease.
38523263|a|Aggregated species of amyloid-beta (Abeta) are one of the pathological hallmarks in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and ligands that selectively target different Abeta deposits are of great interest. In this study, fluorescent thiophene-based ligands have been used to illustrate the features of different types of Abeta deposits found in AD brain tissue. A dual-staining protocol based on two ligands, HS-276 and LL-1, with different photophysical and binding properties, was developed and applied on brain tissue sections from patients affected by sporadic AD or familial AD associated with the PSEN1 A431E mutation. When binding to Abeta deposits, the ligands could easily be distinguished for their different fluorescence, and distinct staining patterns were revealed for these two types of AD. In sporadic AD, HS-276 consistently labeled all immunopositive Abeta plaques, whereas LL-1 mainly stained cored and neuritic Abeta deposits. In the PSEN1 A431E cases, each ligand was binding to specific types of Abeta plaques. The ligand-labeled Abeta deposits were localized in distinct cortical layers, and a laminar staining pattern could be seen. Biochemical characterization of the Abeta aggregates in the individual layers also showed that the variation of ligand binding properties was associated with certain Abeta peptide signatures. For the PSEN1 A431E cases, it was concluded that LL-1 was binding to cotton wool plaques, whereas HS-276 mainly stained diffuse Abeta deposits. Overall, our findings showed that a combination of ligands was essential to identify distinct aggregated Abeta species associated with different forms of AD.
