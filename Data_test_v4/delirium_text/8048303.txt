8048303|a|The content of brain isoenzyme of creatine kinase (CPK BB) was studied in cytosolic fraction of brain extracts of normal and mental patients. The CPK BB content was determined using immunoblotting technique in 10 different brain structures, including some cortex areas, hippocampus, cerebellum cortex, n. caudatus, putamen and inferior oliva. The present work demonstrates a severe decline of CPK BB concentration in all mental brain structures studied, especially in occipital cortex, hippocampus and oliva. The decrease of CPK BB level was more pronounced in Alzheimer's disease patients.
