30308786|t|Delirium in the hospitalised elderly: An audit of NCHD prescribing practice.
30308786|a|OBJECTIVES: This study was carried out to determine the prescribing of psychotropic medication of non-consultant hospital doctors in the management of delirium and to compare this with best practice guidelines. METHOD: A structured questionnaire was forwarded to all non-consultant hospital doctors (n = 95) working at St Vincent's University Hospital and data was collected over a six month period. The questionnaire addressed type, dose and route of psychotropic medication use in delirium as well as adjunctive measures used to manage delirium. RESULTS: There was a 55% response rate (n = 52). Haloperidol and lorazepam were the two most frequently prescribed psychotropic agents used and over one third of respondents (n = 20) reported the use of risperidone. There was wide variation in doses used and a substantial proportion of NCHDs used higher than recommended starting doses for elderly patients with delirium. In addition, the intramuscular route was reported as the commonest route of administration with a majority of respondents reporting infrequent intravenous route of administration. CONCLUSIONS: The drug choice reported by respondents followed best practice guidelines. However, the wide variation in drug doses used and frequency of parenteral route of administration (particularly intramuscular) indicate the need for increasing awareness of best practice international guidelines. Guidance and clarification regarding the use of atypical antipsychotic medication is required following concerns about their use in dementia.
