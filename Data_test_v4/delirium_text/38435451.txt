38435451|t|Cardiovascular Disease in the Older Adult: Where Are We 4 Decades Later?
38435451|a|The 1986 Bethesda Conference on Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) in the Elderly, co-chaired by Drs. Nanette Wenger, Frank Marcus, and Robert O'Rourke, delineated the anticipated social, political, ethical, economic and technological impact of an aging population on the incidence, prevalence, and management of CVD in the US and worldwide. In the ensuing 4 decades, older patients have come to comprise an increasingly large proportion of the CVD population, and there has been an explosion of research in all aspects of CVD affecting older adults. Correspondingly, Geriatric Cardiology is now an established field within cardiovascular medicine. In this communication, we provide a focused update on intersections between CVD and geriatrics from basic science to clinical practice, a review of major advances in diagnosis and treatment of older adults with CVD, and a preview of future research directions in the still evolving field of geriatric cardiology.
