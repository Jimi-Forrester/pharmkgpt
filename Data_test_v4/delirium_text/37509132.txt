37509132|a|BACKGROUND: A large number of individual potentially modifiable factors are associated with risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, less is known about the interactions between the individual factors. METHODS: In order to begin to examine the relationship between a pair of factors, we performed a pilot study, surveying patients with AD and controls for stress exposure and dietary omega-3 fatty acid intake to explore their relationship for risk of AD. RESULTS: For individuals with the greatest stress exposure, omega-3 fatty acid intake was significantly greater in healthy controls than in AD patients. There was no difference among those with low stress exposure. CONCLUSIONS: These initial results begin to suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may mitigate AD risk in the setting of greater stress exposure. This will need to be examined with larger populations and other pairs of risk factors to better understand these important relationships. Examining how individual risk factors interact will ultimately be important for learning how to optimally decrease the risk of AD.
