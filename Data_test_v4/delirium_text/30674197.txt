30674197|t|ED-PALS: A Comprehensive Palliative Care Service for Oncology Patients in the Emergency Department.
30674197|a|BACKGROUND: The American College of Emergency Physicians has identified early palliative care referral for patients with advanced cancer as a key competent of the Choosing Wisely campaign. OBJECTIVES: To study the feasibility of a new 3-way model of care between emergency department (ED), hospital palliative care department, and inpatient/home hospice. METHODS: This was a prospective, descriptive study that included oncology patients who attended the hospital ED over a 3-year period from January 2015 to December 2017. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) presence of metastatic cancer with either; (2) any 1 of the following symptoms: pain, dyspnea, nausea and vomiting, delirium, or swelling; or (3) potential care difficulties (requiring home hospice care or inpatient hospice). RESULTS: A total of 340 patients were referred from the ED. Mean age was 72 years, 59% were males and 41% females, and the majority (88%) were Chinese. The most common cancers were lung 89 (26%), colorectal 71 (21%), and hepatobiliary cancer 49 (14%). The most common symptoms on Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale scoring were pain (34%), poor appetite (31%), and dyspnea (26%). CONCLUSIONS: This tripartite model of palliative care, hospice, and ED collaboration allows earlier access to palliative care in the ED and direct admissions to the palliative care unit and comfort care rooms. The ED patients who did not need admission were also attended to in the palliative care "Hot Clinics" within a week with home hospice help. Patients who required inpatient hospice care were directly admitted there from the ED.
