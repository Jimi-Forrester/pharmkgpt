29017172|t|The Emerging Roles of CIB1 in Cancer.
29017172|a|Calcium and integrin-binding protein 1 (CIB1) is an EF-hand calcium binding protein, which is involved in many cellular processes, including calcium signaling, cell survival and proliferation, cell migration, cell adhesion and apoptosis. A number of studies have found that CIB1 is ubiquitously expressed and is related to various human diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease (AD), cardiac hypertrophy and male infertility. The mechanism of CIB1 in human diseases is still not clear, although multiple functions of CIB1 are modulated by interacting with numerous interacting partners. As a calcium binding protein, the roles of CIB1 in calcium signaling by binding calcium or modulating some key modulators, such as calcineurin, integrin, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and taste 1 receptor member 2 (TAS1R2). The tumor promoting mechanisms of CIB1 have been described in different aspects, including promoting tumor cell cycle and proliferation, inhibiting tumor cell apoptosis, and mediating tumor cell migration and angiogenesis. In addition, multiple functions of CIB1, such as neural development, taste or gustation functions, and virus infection are also elucidated. These recent advances have significantly expanded our understanding of the knowledge of CIB1 and highlighted the potential mechanisms of CIB1 in tumor progression.
