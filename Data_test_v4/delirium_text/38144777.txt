38144777|a|Muscle fiber type is a major factor in pork meat quality, however, the role of post-translational protein modifications, especially succinylation, in the regulation of muscle fiber type is not fully understood. Here we performed protein succinylation profiles of fast-type biceps femoris (BF) and slow-type soleus (SOL) muscles. A total of 4,221 succinylation sites were identified from these samples, of which 294 sites were differentially expressed. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses showed that these succinylated proteins were mainly involved in glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and fatty acid metabolism. Succinylation modification of the CRAT and RAB10 proteins was verified by co-immunoprecipitation. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis unveiled the interactions of these succinylated proteins that regulate pig myofiber type conversion. This investigation offers fresh perspectives into the molecular roles of protein succinylation in the regulation of pig myofiber type transformation and meat quality.
