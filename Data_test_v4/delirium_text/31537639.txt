31537639|a|How individual genes are regulated from a mitochondrial polycistronic transcript to have variable expression remains an enigma. Here, through bisulfite sequencing and strand-specific mapping, we show mitochondrial genomes in humans and other animals are strongly biased to light (L)-strand non-CpG methylation with conserved peak loci preferentially located at gene-gene boundaries, which was also independently validated by MeDIP and FspEI digestion. Such mtDNA methylation patterns are conserved across different species and developmental stages but display dynamic local or global changes during development and aging. Knockout of DNMT3A alone perturbed mtDNA regional methylation patterns, but not global levels, and altered mitochondrial gene expression, copy number, and oxygen respiration. Overexpression of DNMT3A strongly increased mtDNA methylation and strand bias. Overall, methylation at gene bodies and boundaries was negatively associated with mitochondrial transcript abundance and also polycistronic transcript processing. Furthermore, HPLC-MS confirmed the methylation signals on mitochondria DNA. Together, these data provide high-resolution mtDNA methylation maps that revealed a strand-specific non-CpG methylation, its dynamic regulation, and its impact on the polycistronic mitochondrial transcript processing.
