36909609|a|Background: APOE is the largest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), but there is a substantial polygenic component as well. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) can summarize small effects across the genome but may obscure differential risk associated with different molecular processes and pathways. Variability at the genetic level may contribute to the extensive phenotypic heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we examine polygenic risk impacting specific pathways associated with AD and examined its relationship with clinical status and AD biomarkers of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration (A/T/N). Methods: A total of 1,411 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with genotyping data were included. Sets of variants identified from a pathway analysis of AD GWAS summary statistics were combined into clusters based on their assigned pathway. We constructed pathway-specific PRSs for each participant and tested their associations with diagnostic status (AD vs cognitively normal), abnormal levels of amyloid and ptau (positive vs negative), and hippocampal volume. The APOE region was excluded from all PRSs, and analyses controlled for APOE -epsilon4 carrier status. Results: Thirteen pathway clusters were identified relating to categories such as immune response, amyloid precursor processing, protein localization, lipid transport and binding, tyrosine kinase, and endocytosis. Eight pathway-specific PRSs were significantly associated with AD dementia diagnosis. Amyloid-positivity was associated with endocytosis and fibril formation, response misfolded protein, and regulation protein tyrosine PRSs. Ptau positivity and hippocampal volume were both related to protein localization and mitophagy PRS, and ptau positivity was additionally associated with an immune signaling PRS. A global AD PRS showed stronger associations with diagnosis and all biomarkers compared to pathway PRSs, suggesting a strong synergistic effect of all loci contributing to the global AD PRS. Conclusions: Pathway PRS may contribute to understanding separable disease processes, but do not appear to add significant power for predictive purposes. These findings demonstrate that, although genetic risk for AD is widely distributed, AD-phenotypes may be preferentially associated with risk in specific pathways. Defining genetic risk along multiple dimensions at the individual level may help clarify the etiological heterogeneity in AD.
