32156551|t|Activation of Tyrosine Phosphorylation Signaling in Erythrocytes of Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.
32156551|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia affecting older people. The identification of biomarkers is increasingly important and would be crucial for future therapy. Here, we demonstrated that in AD erythrocytes: (i) the anion transporter band3 is highly phosphorylated; (ii) the lyn kinase is phosphorylated and activated; (iii) the tyrosine phosphatase activity is downregulated, with a significant inverse correlation between band3 phosphorylation and disease progression, as revealed by Mini Mental State Examination score. Finally, we showed that in normal erythrocytes, treated in vitro with Abeta1-42 peptide, both band3 phosphorylation and lyn activation occurs. These results suggest that modulation of tyrosine phosphorylation signaling may be evaluated as a potential peripheral marker in AD.
