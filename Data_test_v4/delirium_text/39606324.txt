39606324|a|Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRDs) pose a significant global public health challenge, underscored by the intricate interplay of genetic and environmental factors that differ across ancestries. To effectively implement equitable, personalized therapeutic interventions on a global scale, it is essential to identify disease-causing mutations and genetic risk and resilience factors across diverse ancestral backgrounds. Exploring genetic-phenotypic correlations across the globe enhances the generalizability of research findings, contributing to a more inclusive and universal understanding of disease. This study leveraged biobank-scale data to conduct the largest multi-ancestry whole-genome sequencing characterization of AD/ADRDs. We aimed to build a valuable catalog of potential disease-causing, genetic risk and resilience variants impacting the etiology of these conditions. We thoroughly characterized genetic variants from key genes associated with AD/ADRDs across 11 genetic ancestries, utilizing data from All of Us, UK Biobank, 100,000 Genomes Project, Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project, and the Accelerating Medicines Partnership in Parkinson's Disease, including a total of 25,001 cases and 93,542 controls. We prioritized 116 variants possibly linked to disease, including 18 known pathogenic and 98 novel variants. We detected previously described disease-causing variants among controls, leading us to question their pathogenicity. Notably, we showed a higher frequency of APOE epsilon4/epsilon4 carriers among individuals of African and African Admixed ancestry compared to other ancestries, confirming ancestry-driven modulation of APOE -associated AD/ADRDs. A thorough assessment of APOE revealed a disease-modifying effect conferred by the TOMM40 :rs11556505, APOE :rs449647, 19q13.31 :rs10423769, NOCT :rs13116075, CASS4 :rs6024870, and LRRC37A :rs2732703 variants among APOE epsilon4 carriers across different ancestries. In summary, we compiled the most extensive catalog of established and novel genetic variants in known genes increasing risk or conferring resistance to AD/ADRDs across diverse ancestries, providing clinical insights into their genetic-phenotypic correlations. The findings from this investigation hold significant implications for potential clinical trials and therapeutic interventions on a global scale. Finally, we present an accessible and user-friendly platform for the AD/ADRDs research community to help inform and support basic, translational, and clinical research on these debilitating conditions ( https://niacard.shinyapps.io/MAMBARD_browser/ ).
