33803380|t|A Review of the Pharmacological Activities and Recent Synthetic Advances of gamma-Butyrolactones.
33803380|a|gamma-Butyrolactone, a five-membered lactone moiety, is one of the privileged structures of diverse natural products and biologically active small molecules. Because of their broad spectrum of biological and pharmacological activities, synthetic methods for gamma-butyrolactones have received significant attention from synthetic and medicinal chemists for decades. Recently, new developments and improvements in traditional methods have been reported by considering synthetic efficiency, feasibility, and green chemistry. In this review, the pharmacological activities of natural and synthetic gamma-butyrolactones are described, including their structures and bioassay methods. Mainly, we summarize recent advances, occurring during the past decade, in the construction of gamma-butyrolactone classified based on the bond formation in gamma-butyrolactone between (i) C5-O1 bond, (ii) C4-C5 and C2-O1 bonds, (iii) C3-C4 and C2-O1 bonds, (iv) C3-C4 and C5-O1 bonds, (v) C2-C3 and C2-O1 bonds, (vi) C3-C4 bond, and (vii) C2-O1 bond. In addition, the application to the total synthesis of natural products bearing gamma-butyrolactone scaffolds is described.
