35508106|a|Recent work from Bonvento and colleagues indicated that synaptic and memory deficits in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) are related to a shortage in L-serine production in astrocytes. Here, the authors, responding to correspondence from Chen and colleagues, discuss how this deficiency does not necessarily require a decrease in PHGDH expression and conclude that the primary event leading to lower serine production is more likely related to altered glycolytic flux in early AD than to PHGDH expression.
