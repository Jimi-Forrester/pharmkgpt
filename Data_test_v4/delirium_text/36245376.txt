36245376|a|BACKGROUND: Touchscreen cognitive tools opened new promising opportunities for the early detection of cognitive impairment; however, most research studies are conducted in English-speaking populations and high-income countries, with a gap in knowledge about their use in populations with cultural, linguistic, and educational diversity. OBJECTIVE: To review the touchscreen tools used in primary care settings for the cognitive assessment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, with a focus on populations of different cultures, languages, and literacy. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Studies were identified by searching across MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBSCO, OVID, SCOPUS, SCIELO, LILACS, and by cross-referencing. All studies that provide a first-level cognitive assessment for MCI and dementia with any touchscreen tools suitable to be used in the context of primary care were included. RESULTS: Forty-two studies reporting on 30 tools and batteries were identified. Substantial differences among the tools emerged, in terms of theoretical framework, clinical validity, and features related to the application in clinical practice. A small proportion of the tools are available in multiple languages. Only 7 out of the 30 tools have a multiple languages validation. Only two tools are validated in low-educated samples, e.g., IDEA and mSTS-MCI. CONCLUSION: General practitioners can benefit from touchscreen cognitive tools. However, easy requirements of the device, low dependence on the examiner, fast administration, and adaptation to different cultures and languages are some of the main features that we need to take into consideration when implementing touchscreen cognitive tools in the culture and language of underrepresented populations.
