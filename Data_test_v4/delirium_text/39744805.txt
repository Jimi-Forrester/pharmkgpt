39744805|a|INTRODUCTION: The relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) plasma biomarkers, and physical functioning (PF) across diverse races and ethnicities remains unclear. This study aims to explore this association in an ethno-racially diverse sample of cognitively unimpaired community-dwelling adults. METHODS: Data clinical examinations, neuropsychological tests, blood draws, and PF exams (Timed Up and Go [TUG] and Short Physical Performance Battery [SPPB]) were analyzed. Multivariable linear regressions assessed the association between PF and AD plasma biomarkers (amyloid beta [Abeta]40, Abeta42, total tau [t-tau], neurofiliament light chain [NfL]). RESULTS: The sample (n = 2358; mean age 64.7 years; 65.9% female), was 20% African American, 41.9% non-Hispanic White, and 38.1% Hispanic. Findings indicate that worse PF is linked to higher biomarker levels (p < 0.05). Associations differed by race and ethnicity group. TUG time was associated (p < 0.05) with Abeta40, Abeta42, and tau among non-Hispanic Whites, whereas SPPB scores were associated (p < 0.05) with t-tau and NfL among African Americans. DISCUSSION: PF, ethnic/racial, and plasma AD biomarker data should be used to aid in developing risk profiles for neurodegenerative diseases. HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers are associated with physical functioning (PF) Ethno-racial variation exists in AD biomarker and PF associations Race and ethnicity should considered when assessing neurodegenerative disease risk.
