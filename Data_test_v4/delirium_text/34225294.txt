34225294|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate postoperative functional connectivity (FC) alterations across impaired cognitive domains and their causal relationships with systemic inflammation. BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction commonly occurs after cardiac surgery, and both systemic and neuroinflammation may trigger its development. Whether FC alterations underlying deficits in specific cognitive domains after cardiac surgery are affected by inflammation remains unclear. METHODS: Seventeen patients, who underwent cardiac valve replacement, completed a neuropsychological test battery and brain MRI scan before surgery and on days 7 and 30 after surgery compared to age-matched healthy controls. Blood samples were taken for tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin-6 measurements. Seed-to-voxel FC of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was examined. Bivariate correlation and linear regression models were used to determine the relationships among cognitive function, FC alterations, and cytokines. RESULTS: Executive function was significantly impaired after cardiac surgery. At day 7 follow-up, the surgical patients, compared to the controls, demonstrated significantly decreased DLPFC FC with the superior parietal lobe and attenuated negative connectivity in the default mode network, including the angular gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex. The left DLPFC enhanced the connectivity in the right DLPFC and posterior cingulate cortex, all of which were related to the increased tumor necrosis factor-a and decreased executive function up to day 7 after cardiac surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The decreased FC of executive control network and its anticorrelation with the default mode network may contribute to executive function deficits after cardiac surgery. Systemic inflammation may trigger these transient FC changes and executive function impairments.
