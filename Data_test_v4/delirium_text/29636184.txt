29636184|t|Pre-injury depression and anxiety in patients with orthopedic trauma and their treatment.
29636184|a|PURPOSE: Depressive symptoms have a known negative impact on outcomes following musculoskeletal injury. This study determined the pre-injury prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses of depression and anxiety, medication lapses and psychiatric consult services among patients admitted for orthopaedic trauma. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of data from our Level-1 trauma center. Patients admitted to the orthopaedic trauma service during 2010-2015 were included (N = 4053). Demographics, Injury Severity Scores (ISS), mental health diagnoses, psychotropic medications, medication type and delay, psychiatric consultation use, intensive care unit (ICU) stay and total hospital length of stay (LOS) were abstracted from medical records and the institutional trauma registry. RESULTS: The 12-month prevalence of a major depressive episode is 6.6%-8.6% in adults in the United States. In our database, only 152/4053 (3.8%) of the patients had documented medical history of depression (80%) or anxiety (30%), and these patients had a 32% longer LOS (p < 0.016). Nearly two-thirds of patients who used psychotropic medications prior to injury experienced a delay in receiving these medications in the hospital (median = 1.0 day, range 0-14 days). Sixteen percent of patients also received a new psychotropic medication while hospitalized: an antipsychotic (8/16 patients, to treat delirium), an anxiolytic (3/16 patients for acute anxiety), or an antidepressant (1/16). Among patients with depression or anxiety, 16.7% received a psychiatric consult. Patients with psychiatric consults had higher ISS, were more likely to have longer ICU LOS and had longer hospital LOS than those without consults (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of depression and anxiety is grossly under-reported in our registry compared to national prevalence data. Patients with pre-existing disease had longer LOS and a higher rate of extended ICU care. Further studies are needed to characterize the true prevalence of disease in this patient population and its effect on patient outcomes after traumatic orthopaedic injury.
