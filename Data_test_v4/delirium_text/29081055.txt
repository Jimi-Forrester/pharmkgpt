29081055|t|Peptide Lipidation - A Synthetic Strategy to Afford Peptide Based Therapeutics.
29081055|a|Peptide and protein aberrant lipidation patterns are often involved in many diseases including cancer and neurological disorders. Peptide lipidation is also a promising strategy to improve pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of peptide-based drugs. Self-adjuvanting peptide-based vaccines commonly utilise the powerful TLR2 agonist PamnCys lipid to stimulate adjuvant activity. The chemical synthesis of lipidated peptides can be challenging hence efficient, flexible and straightforward synthetic routes to access homogeneous lipid-tagged peptides are in high demand. A new technique coined Cysteine Lipidation on a Peptide or Amino acid (CLipPA) uses a 'thiol-ene' reaction between a cysteine and a vinyl ester and offers great promise due to its simplicity, functional group compatibility and selectivity. Herein a brief review of various synthetic strategies to access lipidated peptides, focusing on synthetic methods to incorporate a PamnCys motif into peptides, is provided.
