18781072|a|AIMS: To investigate whether subjects with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) have reduced entorhinal cortex (EC) volumes compared to controls and cognitively intact Parkinson's disease (PD) subjects. METHODS: Volumes of the EC were measured on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 144 individuals (aged over 65 years): 20 with DLB, 26 with AD, 30 with PDD, 31 with PD and 37 normal age-matched controls. RESULTS: Total normalised EC volumes were significantly smaller in DLB, AD and PDD patients compared to controls, and in DLB and AD patients compared to PD patients (p < 0.001). The percentage volume reduction in EC volume in the dementia groups relative to controls was 19.9% in DLB, 21.9% in AD and 14.7% in PDD. CONCLUSIONS: MRI measurements of the EC have shown that volumes are smaller in dementia subjects compared to controls and patients with non-dementia disorders. Further research is required to recognise those at risk of dementia and to differentiate between the dementias.
