39542519|t|Clinical Experiences Using CyberKnife for Large-Volume Meningiomas: A Preliminary Study.
39542519|a|BACKGROUND: This preliminary study evaluates the safety and efficacy of CyberKnife radiosurgery (CKRS) for large-volume meningiomas (>=10 cm3), where surgical options may be limited due to tumor location or patient health conditions. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 18 patients with meningiomas treated with CKRS at Gyeongsang National University Hospital between 2010 and 2020. Tumor control and survival rates were evaluated, with follow-up imaging performed regularly. RESULTS: CKRS achieved a 5-year overall survival rate of 92.3% and a 5-year tumor control rate of 93.8%. Symptomatic peritumoral edema occurred in 61.1% of patients, with 16.7% requiring surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: CKRS appears to be a promising option for patients with large meningiomas, showing good tumor control and manageable complications. Further studies with larger cohorts are necessary to confirm these findings.
