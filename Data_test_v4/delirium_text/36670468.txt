36670468|t|Brain nuclear receptors and cardiovascular function.
36670468|a|Brain-heart interaction has raised up increasing attentions. Nuclear receptors (NRs) are abundantly expressed in the brain, and emerging evidence indicates that a number of these brain NRs regulate multiple aspects of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including hypertension, heart failure, atherosclerosis, etc. In this review, we will elaborate recent findings that have established the physiological relevance of brain NRs in the context of cardiovascular function. In addition, we will discuss the currently available evidence regarding the distinct neuronal populations that respond to brain NRs in the cardiovascular control. These findings suggest connections between cardiac control and brain dynamics through NR signaling, which may lead to novel tools for the treatment of pathological changes in the CVDs.
