37581861|t|Neurofilament-light chains (NF-L), a biomarker of neuronal damage, is increased in patients with severe sarcopenia: results of the SarcoPhAge study.
37581861|a|BACKGROUND: As clinical tests, such as gait speed, require nervous system integrity to be performed properly, sarcopenia shares features with neurological diseases. Neurofilament light chains (NF-L) are now used as a blood-biomarker of neuronal damage, and its expression might be altered in sarcopenia. We aimed to assess NF-L concentrations in a large cohort of older individuals screened for sarcopenia. METHODS: The SarcoPhAge cohort is a Belgian cohort of 534 community-dwelling older adults with an ongoing 10-year follow-up. Sarcopenia diagnosis was established at inclusion according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2) criteria. Muscle strength was evaluated with a hydraulic hand dynamometer, appendicular lean mass by Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and physical performance by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). NF-L was measured on all available sera collected at the time of inclusion (n = 409) using SiMoA technology (Quanterix ). RESULTS: In the multivariate model, NF-L was associated with performance tests such as gait speed (p < 0.0001) and SPPB scores (p = 0.0004). An association was also observed with muscle strength (p = 0.0123) and lean mass (p = 0.0279). In the logistic regression model, NF-L was an independent predictor of severe sarcopenia (p = 0.0338; OR = 20.0; 95% CI 1.39-287.7) with satisfactory diagnostic accuracy (AUC: 0.828) and subjects with an SPPB score <= 8 had higher odds of having increased NF-L (p < 0.0001; OR = 23.9; 95% CI 5.5-104). CONCLUSIONS: These data highlight the potential for using NF-L to investigate the pathophysiology of sarcopenia severity and the neurological features associated with performance tests. However, these results need to be confirmed with other cohorts in different settings.
