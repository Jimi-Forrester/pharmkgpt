39873863|a|The detection of cysteine (Cys) and homocysteine (Hcy) in biological fluids has great significance for early diagnosis, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The simultaneous determination of Cys and Hcy with a single probe is still a huge challenge. To enlarge the differences in space structure (line and ring) and energy (-721.78 and -761.08 Hartree) between Cys and Hcy, and to cause a difference of aggregation kinetics, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are capped with hydrophilic and low-toxic polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (named AuNPs@PVP) and some surface-active sites of AuNPs are masked, the active area for the binding between AuNPs and the detection object is confined, meanwhile, the stability of AuNPs is improved. A novel nanosensor based on confined active area and aggregation kinetics of AuNPs@PVP, is designed for the identification and determination of Cys and Hcy in 1 and 3 min, respectively, with sufficiently low detection limit (4.12 and 4.35 muM) and linear range (4.12-100 muM) for health evaluation. This single colorimetric sensor was applied successfully to the determination of urine and serum, evidencing high anti-interference ability.
