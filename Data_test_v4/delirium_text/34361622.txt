34361622|a|Jaboticaba is a Brazilian native berry described as a rich source of phenolic compounds (PC) with health promoting effects. PC from jaboticaba peel powder (JPP) have low intestinal bio-accessibility and are catabolized by gut microbiota. However, the biological implication of PC-derived metabolites produced during JPP digestion remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the antiproliferative effects of colonic fermented JPP (FJPP) in a 3D model of colorectal cancer (CRC) composed by HT29 spheroids. JPP samples fermented with human feces during 0, 2, 8, 24 or 48 h were incubated (10,000 microg mL-1) with spheroids, and cell viability was assessed after 72 h. Chemometric analyses (cluster and principal component analyses) were used to identify the main compounds responsible for the bioactive effect. The antiproliferative effect of FJPP in the CRC 3D model was increased between 8 h and 24 h of incubation, and this effect was associated with HHDP-digalloylglucose isomer and dihydroxyphenyl-gamma-valerolactone. At 48 h of fermentation, the antiproliferative effect of FJPP was negligible, indicating that the presence of urolithins did not improve the bioactivity of JPP. These findings provide relevant knowledge on the role of colonic microbiota fermentation to generate active phenolic metabolites from JPP with positive impact on CRC.
