20562784|t|How do we treat people with dementia in Croatia.
20562784|a|The current clinical view on pharmacological treatment and the Croatian reality regarding approved antidementia drugs is presented. Dementia is a syndrome of high incidence and Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. New data show that dementia prevalence will nearly double every 20 years, and we believe that current estimated number of persons with dementia (PWD) for Croatia is more than 80,000. The standard treatment with antidementia drugs is unavailable in Croatia, for the majority of PWD, because antidementia drugs are not on the reimbursement list, although Croatian algorithm for psychopharmacological treatment and Alzheimer Disease Societies Croatia recommend early and adequate treatment. Alzheimer's dementia is becoming a world's health priority in 21st century, so we strongly believe that antidementia drugs should be reimbursed in Croatia.
