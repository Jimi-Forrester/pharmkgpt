This study aims to explore the cultural practice and policy influence around caring for People Living with Dementia (PLWD) in Nepal. METHODS: An exploratory qualitative study was designed to investigate dementia care in Nepal. The study comprised four in-depth interviews and four focus group discussions with 29 participants, including family members, health care professionals, and other stakeholders. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULT: Four major themes (each with several sub-themes) were identified: (1) Cultural practice in dementia care; (2) Impact of policy on the dementia care; (3) Service provision; and (4) Education and training. CONCLUSION: There is a need for community-based awareness raising on dementia and its care, to sensitise all relevant stakeholders to meet the needs of PLWD. In addition, capacity building of health workforce is needed to enhance their knowledge of and skills in providing culturally appropriate dementia care.
