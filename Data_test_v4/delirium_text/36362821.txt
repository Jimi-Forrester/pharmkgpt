36362821|t|Decline in Walking Independence and Related Factors in Hospitalization for Dialysis Initiation: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
36362821|a|Patients with chronic kidney disease require intervention planning because their physical function declines with worsening disease. Providers can work closely with patients during the induction phase of dialysis. This single-center, retrospective observational study aimed to investigate the rate of decline in walking independence during the induction phase of dialysis and the factors that influence this decline, and to provide information on prevention and treatment during this period. Of the 354 patients who were newly initiated on hemodialysis between April 2018 and January 2022, 285 were included in the analysis. The functional independence measure-walking score was used to sort patients into decreased walking independence (DWI; n = 46) and maintained walking independence (no DWI; n = 239) groups, and patient characteristics were compared. After adjusting for various factors by logistic regression analysis, we observed that age, high Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), C-reactive protein, and emergency dialysis start (EDS) were significant predictors of DWI. Even during the very short period of dialysis induction, as many as 16.1% of patients had DWI, which was associated with older age, higher CCI, higher inflammation, and EDS. Therefore, we recommend the early identification of patients with these characteristics and early rehabilitation.
