35163673|t|Exploring the Structural Rearrangements of the Human Insulin-Degrading Enzyme through Molecular Dynamics Simulations.
35163673|a|Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is a ubiquitously expressed metallopeptidase that degrades insulin and a large panel of amyloidogenic peptides. IDE is thought to be a potential therapeutic target for type-2 diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. IDE catalytic chamber, known as a crypt, is formed, so that peptides can be enclosed and degraded. However, the molecular mechanism of the IDE function and peptide recognition, as well as its conformation changes, remains elusive. Our study elucidates IDE structural changes and explains how IDE conformational dynamics is important to modulate the catalytic cycle of IDE. In this aim, a free-substrate IDE crystallographic structure (PDB ID: 2JG4) was used to model a complete structure of IDE. IDE stability and flexibility were studied through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to witness IDE conformational dynamics switching from a closed to an open state. The description of IDE structural changes was achieved by analysis of the cavity and its expansion over time. Moreover, the quasi-harmonic analysis of the hinge connecting IDE domains and the angles formed over the simulations gave more insights into IDE shifts. Overall, our results could guide toward the use of different approaches to study IDE with different substrates and inhibitors, while taking into account the conformational states resolved in our study.
