34589765|a|The biological mechanisms responsible for depression symptoms are not yet understood. For this reason, it is important to reveal the etiopathogenetic mechanisms in this disease. This study aims to compare the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), and telomerase activity in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls. Plasma BDNF, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1beta, and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels, and telomerase activity were measured in 39 patients with major depression and 39 healthy controls matched with patients in terms of age, gender, and education year. Plasma concentration of BDNF, IL-6 levels, and telomerase activity was significantly different between patients with MDD and healthy controls. Correlation analysis showed a positive trend between plasma BDNF levels and plasma IL-6 levels in patients with MDD with melancholic features. Furthermore, the path analysis results showed that the telomerase activity was indirectly affected by gender, IL-1beta, IL-6, BDNF, and BMI, via the severity of depression and anxiety and MDD status as the mediators. Further studies are needed to examine the molecular mechanism of the telomerase activity and the role of BDNF and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the telomerase activation in MDD.
