28703646|t|Clinical features of patients who died within 24 h after admission to a stroke care center.
28703646|a|Objective In Japan, stroke care is provided through medical cooperation and standardized treatment. However, various factors affect mortality in the hyperacute phase. The present study investigated factors associated with death within 24 h after admission for acute stroke. Methods Among 2335 patients admitted within 24 h after stroke onset from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2012, a total of 139 deaths occurred. Forty-eight deaths occurred within 24 h after admission. We retrospectively examined the clinical features of these 48 patients. Results The overall mortality rate was 6.0%. When the initial 72-h period was divided into <=24 h (Period I), >24 to 48 h (Period II), and >48 to 72 h (Period III), deaths were significantly more frequent in Period I than in the other two periods. The frequency of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) was also significantly higher in Period I than in the other two periods. Factors significantly associated with death from ICH were systolic blood pressure, hematoma volume, and surgery. Conclusion The mortality rate was low among patients with stroke transported to the authors' medical center within 24 h of onset. Blood pressure management and the timing of determining indications for surgery are important factors in acute haemorrhagic stroke care.
