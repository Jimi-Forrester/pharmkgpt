32057828|a|Intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of streptozotocin (STZ) has been used as a metabolic model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Erythropoietin (EPO) possesses neuroprotective and memory-improving effects, which might be advantageous in treating different characteristics of AD. Nevertheless, the hematopoietic effect of EPO has hindered its application as a neuroprotective agent. Previous studies have shown that a new Epo derivative called carbamylated Erythropoietin-Fc (CEPO-Fc), yield noticeable neuroprotective effects without affecting hematopoiesis. In this study, the neuroprotective effects of CEPO-Fc on icv-STZ induced memory impairment and hippocampal apoptosis were examined. Adult male Wistar rats weighing 250-300 g were used. STZ was administered on days 1 and 3 (3 mg/kg in divided doses/icv), and CEPO-Fc was administered at the dose of 5000 IU/ip/daily during days 4-14. The animals were trained in Morris water maze during days 15-17, and the memory retention test was performed on the 18th day. Following behavioral studies, the animals were sacrificed and their hippocampi isolated to determine the amounts of cleaved caspase-3 (the landmark of apoptosis). The results showed that CEPO-Fc treatment at the dose of 5000 IU/kg/ip was able to prevent the learning and memory deficit induced by icv-STZ. Western blot analysis revealed that STZ prompted the cleavage of caspase-3 in the hippocampus while pretreatment with CEPO-Fc significantly reduced the cleavage of this protein. Collectively, our findings suggest that CEPO-Fc could restore STZ-induced learning and memory impairment as well as apoptosis in the hippocampal region in a rat model of sporadic AD induced by icv-STZ.
