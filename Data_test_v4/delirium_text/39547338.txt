39547338|a|A growing number of studies show that the diabetes drug Semaglutide is neuroprotective in Alzheimer's disease (AD) animal models, but its mode of action is not fully understood. In order to explore the mechanism of Semaglutide, 7-month-old APP/PS1/tau transgenic (3xTg) mice and wild-type (WT) mice were randomly divided into four groups: control group (WT + PBS), AD model group (3xTg + PBS), Semaglutide control group (WT + Semaglutide) and Semaglutide treatment group (3xTg + Semaglutide). Semaglutide (25 nmol/kg) or PBS was administered intraperitoneally once every two days for 30 days, followed by behavioral and molecular experiments. The results show that Semaglutide can improve working memory and spatial reference memory of 3xTg-AD mice, promote the release of anti-inflammatory factors and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory factors in the cortex and hippocampus, and reduce Abeta deposition in the hippocampal CA1 region of 3xTg mice. Semaglutide can inhibit the apoptosis of BV2 cells induced by Abeta1-42 in a dose-dependent manner and promote the transformation of microglia from M1 to M2, thereby exerting anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Therefore, we speculate that Semaglutide shows an anti-inflammatory effect by promoting the transformation of microglia from M1 to M2 type in the brain of 3xTg mice, and thus exerts a neuroprotective effect.
