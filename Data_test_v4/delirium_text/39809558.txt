39809558|a|INTRODUCTION: Stress hyperglycaemia at hospital presentation is associated with poorer outcomes. Less is known about the risk of poorer outcomes according to achieved glycaemia early in the admission. RESEARCH DESIGN/METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study of patients admitted to non-critical care wards. The aim was to determine the relationship between the day 2 peak blood glucose and the occurrence of hospital-acquired complications (HACs) or in-hospital mortality. A Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for relevant covariates, was used to evaluate the impact of day 2 peak glucose on HACs and in-hospital mortality, and we identified peak glucose thresholds correlating with an increase in risk. RESULTS: For the whole cohort, day 2 peak glucose was associated with an increased risk of any HAC, aHR=1.06, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.07; but not in-hospital mortality, aHR=0.98, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.01. The risk of HAC infection increased by 4.6% for every mmol/L rise in day 2 peak glucose (aHR=1.05, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.08) in the diabetes cohort compared with 5.5% (aHR=1.06, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.11) in the non-diabetes cohort. The risk of HAC cardiac in the diabetes cohort increased by 5.3% (aHR=1.05, CI: 1.01, 1.10) per mmol/L increase in day 2 peak glucose; no association was found in the non-diabetes cohort (aHR=1.03, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.13). The risk for in-hospital mortality was associated with day 2 peak glucose, aHR=1.11, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.20, in patients without diabetes, but not in patients with diabetes, aHR=1.00, 95% CI: 0.95, 1.06. There was an increase in the risk of HAC once day 2 peak blood glucose exceeded 19.0 mmol/L (whole cohort), with thresholds of 13.6 mmol/L in the non-diabetes group and 19.5 mmol/L in the diabetes group. CONCLUSION: The peak glucose on day 2 was a predictor of HAC in the entire cohort and in-hospital mortality in patients without diabetes.
