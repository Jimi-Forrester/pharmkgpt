10700601|t|T-588, a novel neuroprotective agent, delays progression of neuromuscular dysfunction in wobbler mouse motoneuron disease.
10700601|a|R(-)-1-(benzo[b]thiophen-5-yl)-2-[2-(N,N-diethylamino) ethoxy]ethanol hydrochloride (T-588) enhances acetylcholine release from the frontal cortex and hippocampus in rats, and can ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in various amnesia models of rodents. T-588 protects rat cerebellar granule cells from glutamate neurotoxicity in culture. This agent also inhibits facilitation in the crayfish neuromuscular junction and mammalian cerebellum. Clinical trials of T-588 are underway in patients with Alzheimer's disease. We attempted to determine whether T-588 treatment ameliorates neuromuscular dysfunction in the wobbler mouse, an animal model of motoneuron disease (MND). After the initial diagnosis of MND at the age of 3-4 weeks, wobbler mice were orally administered T-588 (3, 10, 30 mg/kg) or vehicle daily for 4 weeks in a blinded fashion. We compared symptomatic, pathological and biochemical changes among the groups. In comparison with vehicle, T-588 administration potentiated grip strength, attenuated forelimb contracture and increased the weight of the biceps muscles. T-588-treated mice had retarded denervation muscle atrophy and elevated activities of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) or lactate dehydrogenase in the biceps muscles. T-588 treatment also enhanced ChAT activities and promoted formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the cervical cord. Pharmacokinetic study also showed that T-588 was transported efficiently into the cerebrum and spinal cord following oral administration. Thus, T-588 treatment delayed the progression of wobbler murine MND. Our findings suggest that this agent has therapeutic potential in human motor neuropathy or MND.
