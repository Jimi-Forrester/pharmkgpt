38424470|t|Immune Activation in Alzheimer Disease.
38424470|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, and with no efficient curative treatment available, its medical, social, and economic burdens are expected to dramatically increase. AD is historically characterized by amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, but over the last 25 years chronic immune activation has been identified as an important factor contributing to AD pathogenesis. In this article, we review recent and important advances in our understanding of the significance of immune activation in the development of AD. We describe how brain-resident macrophages, the microglia, are able to detect Abeta species and be activated, as well as the consequences of activated microglia in AD pathogenesis. We discuss transcriptional changes of microglia in AD, their unique heterogeneity in humans, and emerging strategies to study human microglia. Finally, we expose, beyond Abeta and microglia, the role of peripheral signals and different cell types in immune activation. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Immunology, Volume 42 is April 2024. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.
