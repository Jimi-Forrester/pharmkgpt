36326669|t|ESR1 dysfunction triggers neuroinflammation as a critical upstream causative factor of the Alzheimer's disease process.
36326669|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for approximately 60% of dementia cases worldwide. Advanced age is the most significant risk factor for AD and approximately two-thirds of cases relate to women. While the previous meta-analysis suggests that estrogen receptor (ESR) genetic polymorphisms are closely associated with dementia, the implications of this observation on a molecular level are not entirely understood. Our study explores this intricate molecular puzzle through the use of a variety of bioinformatics tools. Initially, we attempted to elucidate mechanisms underlying breast cancer development by identifying the high-throughput dataset of ESR1-knockdown breast cancer tissue samples. Surprisingly, KEGG pathway enrichment showed that the most frequently occurring proteins were related to axonal guidance and inflammation-related gene markers. These observations were supported by an external high throughput dataset of AD inflammatory samples in vivo. Our results suggest that ESR1 is modulated by apolipoprotein E (APOE) through CEBPB/ATF4, mir-155-5p, or mir-1-3p. Moreover, sea hare-hydrolysates (SHH), as one of the axonal guidance molecules, could regulate the STAT3/PRDM1/CEBPB pathway and consequently induce cell death through pyroptosis signaling pathways, trigger the secretion of IL1beta, leading to neuroinflammation and worsening AD pathogenesis. Molecular docking verification demonstrated that the predicted natural products scoulerine and genistein displayed strong binding affinities for BACE1 and ESR1, respectively. This strategy can be used to design novel, personalized therapeutic approaches to treatment and a first-in-class clinical lead for the personalised treatment of AD.
