15118554|a|An increasing number of studies have demonstrated the efficiency of various neuropsychological interventions on individuals with early Alzheimer's disease. There are also some encouraging findings suggesting that the interventions can be successfully applied in less controlled real-world contexts and largely provided into caregiving systems. The interventions have to be directly focused on daily life situations and they should include the perspective of the patients by allowing them to retain a capacity to maximize their cognitive abilities, to state specific preferences and needs, and to make intervention-related decisions.
