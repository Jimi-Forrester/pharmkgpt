32283762|a|Dietary supplementation with curcumin has been previously reported to have beneficial effects in people with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with curcumin on key peptides implicated in insulin resistance in individuals with high risk of developing T2D. Plasma samples from participants recruited for a randomised controlled trial with curcumin (180 mg/day) for 12 weeks were analysed for circulating glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3beta) and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). Outcome measures were determined using ELISA kits. The homeostasis model for assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was measured as parameters of glycaemic control. Curcumin supplementation significantly reduced circulating GSK-3beta (-2.4 +- 0.4 ng/mL vs. -0.3 +- 0.6, p = 0.0068) and IAPP (-2.0 +- 0.7 ng/mL vs. 0.4 +- 0.6, p = 0.0163) levels compared with the placebo group. Curcumin supplementation significantly reduced insulin resistance (-0.3 +- 0.1 vs. 0.01 +- 0.05, p = 0.0142) compared with placebo group. Dietary supplementation with curcumin reduced circulating levels of IAPP and GSK-3beta, thus suggesting a novel mechanism through which curcumin could potentially be used for alleviating insulin resistance related markers for reducing the risk of T2D and AD.
