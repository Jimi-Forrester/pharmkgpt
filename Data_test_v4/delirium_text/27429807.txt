27429807|t|Potential Properties of Plant Sprout Extracts on Amyloid beta.
27429807|a|The aim of this study is to examine the amyloid beta (Abeta) inhibition mechanism of plant sprouts' aqueous extracts (PSAE). In this study, we screened the effects of five plant sprouts' extracts on Abeta (1-42) structure modification using gel electrophoresis. In PSAE, no band of Abeta monomer was recognized in Japanese butterbur. Similarly, the Abeta monomer band became light in buckwheat, red cabbage, broccoli, and brussels. The neuroprotective effects of PSAE were evaluated by measuring levels of Abeta in mixtures (Abeta  and PSAE) with Abeta ELISA assay. The treatment with PSAE decreased Abeta levels. The results indicated that the levels of red cabbage, Japanese butterbur, and broccoli were 9.6, 28.0, and 44.0%, respectively. The lowest value was observed with buckwheat. Furthermore, we carried out a Congo Red (CR) and Abeta binding experiment of PSAE to confirm the modification mechanism of PSAE. The correlation coefficient for the absorption spectrum peak of CR was found to be bigger than 0.8 (r = 0.882) which proved that the Abeta levels could be attributed to the peak of CR. In conclusion, we demonstrated that treatment with PSAE effectively decreases Abeta concentration. Thus, the mechanism that decreased the Abeta levels may be modification by PSAE.
