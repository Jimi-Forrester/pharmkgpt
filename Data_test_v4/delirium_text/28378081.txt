28378081|a|BACKGROUND: Elderly patients usually have concurrent ailments, and the safety and effectiveness of laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) for these patients have been controversial. This study aimed to evaluate whether laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy is safe and effective for elderly patients aged 80 years and over, as well as to clarify their long-term prognosis. METHODS: A total of 31 patients aged 80 years and over who underwent LADG in our hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Peri- and postoperative data were compared with those of 38 patients aged 65 years and younger. The median follow-up period of the elderly and younger group was 56.0 and 63.0 months, respectively, and their prognosis was examined. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the two groups in preoperative respiratory and renal functions, hemoglobin, and nutritional index. Significant differences in postoperative complications were seen only in pneumonia and delirium. There were no hospital deaths, but the 3-year and 5-year overall survival rates were significantly lower in the elderly group than in the non-elderly group. However, in the elderly group, only one patient died of gastric cancer recurrence, whereas four died of cardiovascular disease and three died of pneumonia during follow-up. Therefore, the recurrence-free survival rate was not significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: LADG seems to be safe and effective even for elderly patients, and their prognosis was satisfactory. However, careful monitoring for cardiovascular and pulmonary disease should be observed during the follow-up period.
