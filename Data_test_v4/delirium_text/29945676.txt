29945676|t|Reversible splenial lesion syndrome associated with dengue fever: a case report.
29945676|a|BACKGROUND: Dengue virus infection in humans can lead to a wide range of clinical manifestations, from mild fever to potentially fatal dengue shock syndrome. The incidence of dengue fever is on the rise in tropical countries. Due to the increasing incidence of dengue fever worldwide, atypical manifestations of the disease are increasingly reported. In this article we report a patient with dengue haemorrhagic fever who presented with reversible splenial lesion syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old Sri Lankan man who presented with fever and confusion was eventually diagnosed to have reversible splenial lesion syndrome based on brain imaging. Clinical, serological and haematological parameters confirmed a diagnosis of dengue haemorrhagic fever. His presentation, assessment, and management are described in this case report. CONCLUSION: Reversible splenial lesion syndrome is a condition which is radiologically characterized by reversible lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum. It is associated with infectious and non-infectious aetiologies. This case report highlights the occurrence of reversible splenial lesion syndrome as a presenting feature of the expanding list of unusual neurological manifestations of dengue infection.
