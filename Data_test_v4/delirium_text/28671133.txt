28671133|t|Chinese Medicine: A Hope for Neurodegenerative Diseases?
28671133|a|With the increase in the proportion of aged population due to the rapid increase of life expectancy, the worldwide prevalence rate of multiple neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease has been increased dramatically. The demographic trend toward an older population has drawn the attention to new drug discovery and treatment on age-related diseases. Although a panel of drugs and/or therapies are currently available for treating the neurodegenerative diseases, side effects or insufficient drug efficacy have been reported. With the long history in prescription of Chinese medicine or natural compounds for modulating aged-related diseases, emerging evidence was reported to support the pharmacological role of Chinese medicine in ameliorating the symptoms, or interfering with the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. This review brings evidence about today's trends and development of a list of potential neuroprotective herbal compounds from both the traditional and modern pharmacological point of view. With future projections, the potential hope and implication of using Chinese medicine as an alternative source for novel drug discovery for neurodegenerative diseases is proposed.
