36470876|a|Motor reserve (MR) may explain why individuals with similar pathological changes show marked differences in motor deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we investigated whether estimated individual MR was linked to local striatal volume (LSV) in PD. We analyzed data obtained from 333 patients with drug naive PD who underwent dopamine transporter scans and high-resolution 3-tesla T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance images. Using a residual model, we estimated individual MRs on the basis of initial UPDRS-III score and striatal dopamine depletion. We performed a correlation analysis between MR estimates and LSV. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of LSV, which is correlated with MR estimates, on the longitudinal increase in the levodopa-equivalent dose (LED) during the 4-year follow-up period using a linear mixed model. After controlling for intracranial volume, there was a significant positive correlation between LSV and MR estimates in the bilateral caudate, anterior putamen, and ventro-posterior putamen. The linear mixed model showed that the large local volume of anterior and ventro-posterior putamen was associated with the low requirement of LED initially and accelerated LED increment thereafter. The present study demonstrated that LSV is crucial to MR in early-stage PD, suggesting LSV as a neural correlate of MR in PD.
