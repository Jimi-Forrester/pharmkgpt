35841771|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal stage of memory impairment that may precede dementia. MCI is classified by the presence or absence of memory impairment into amnestic or non-amnestic MCI, respectively. More than 90% of patients with amnestic MCI who progress towards dementia meet criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD). A combination of mechanisms promotes MCI, including intracellular neurofibrillary tangle formation, extracellular amyloid deposition, oxidative stress, neuronal loss, synaptodegeneration, cholinergic dysfunction, cerebrovascular disease, and neuroinflammation. However, emerging evidence indicates that neuroinflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment. Unfortunately, there are currently no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs for MCI. Copolymer-1 (Cop-1), also known as glatiramer acetate, is a synthetic polypeptide of four amino acids approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Cop-1 therapeutic effect is attributed to immunomodulation, promoting a switch from proinflammatory to anti-inflammatory phenotype. In addition to its anti-inflammatory properties, it stimulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) secretion, a neurotrophin involved in neurogenesis and the generation of hippocampal long-term potentials. Moreover, BDNF levels are significantly decreased in patients with cognitive impairment. Therefore, Cop-1 immunization might promote synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation by increasing BDNF production in patients with MCI.
