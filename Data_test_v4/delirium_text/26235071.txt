26235071|t|Chronic Mild Stress Assay Leading to Early Onset and Propagation of Alzheimer's Disease Phenotype in Mouse Models.
26235071|a|A comprehensive chronic mild stress (CMS) procedure is presented, which consists in the application of unpredictable mild stressors to animal models in a random order for several weeks. This assay can be applied to Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models, leading to accelerated onset and increased severity of AD phenotypes and signs, including memory deficits and the accumulation of amyloid-beta and phospho-tau. These assays open the way towards advanced studies on the influence of sustained mild stress, stress responses and pathways on the onset and propagation of Alzheimer's disease.
