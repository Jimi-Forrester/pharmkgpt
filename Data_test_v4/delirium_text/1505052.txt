1505052|a|The submitted paper demonstrates the differential diagnostic value of automatic quantitative analysis of electroencephalograms in the diagnosis of dementia and functional mental disorders in old age. By quantitative autoregression analysis of electric activity of the brain in a group of 53 hospitalized patients (incl. 33 cases of dementia) the conclusions of visual analysis were confirmed as well as the comparability of results obtained by other methods of automatic analysis. Signs characterizing the electroencephalogram in dementia (reduced ratio of alpha activity and increase of slow activity, low value of A/T index, shift of the peak frequency towards slow activity) make differential diagnosis of dementia in organic diseases from pseudodementia possible. Analysis of the results indicates that automatic analysis can be very successful in the detection of Alzheimer's disease.
