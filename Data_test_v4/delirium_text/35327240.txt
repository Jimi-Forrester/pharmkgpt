35327240|t|Possibility for Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Dementia Using Three Kinds of Brown Rice Blends after High-Pressure Treatment.
35327240|a|As it has been reported that type 2 diabetes mellitus increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease, we investigated how to prevent type 2 diabetes and dementia using biofunctional boiled rice. We adopted unpolished super-hard rice (SHBR) for diabetes and wax-free unpolished black rice (WFBBR) for dementia and blended those with ordinary non-polished rice (KBR) (blending ratio 4:4:2), adding 2.5% waxy black rice bran (WBB) and 0.3% rice oil after high-pressure treatment (HPT) (WFBSK) to improve its palatability. This boiled rice is rich in dietary fiber, anthocyanin, free ferulic acid and beta-secretase inhibitory activity. A randomized, parallel-group comparison study was conducted for 12 weeks with 24 subjects, using Cognitrax to evaluate their cognitive function primarily. Furthermore, as the secondary purpose, we performed a single-dose test for postprandial blood glucose and insulin secretion at the end of the human intervention test. After 12 weeks, consumers of the WFBSK rice exhibited significant improvement in language memory by cognitive test battery compared with those who consumed the control white rice (p < 0.05). Moreover, subjects who consumed the WFBSK rice had lower insulin secretion levels than those who consumed the control polished rice (p < 0.05).
