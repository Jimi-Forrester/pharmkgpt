36583424|t|Preoperative Factors Predict Memory Decline After Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting or Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in an Epidemiological Cohort of Older Adults.
36583424|a|Background Durable memory decline may occur in older adults after surgical (coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) or nonsurgical (percutaneous coronary intervention) coronary revascularization. However, it is unknown whether individual memory risk can be predicted. We reanalyzed an epidemiological cohort of older adults to predict memory decline at  1 year after revascularization. Methods and Results We studied Health and Retirement Study participants who underwent CABG or percutaneous coronary intervention at age >=65 years between 1998 and 2015 and participated in >=1 biennial postprocedure assessment. Using a memory score based on direct and proxy cognitive tests, we identified participants whose actual postprocedure memory score was 1-2 ("mild") or >2 ("major") SDs below expected postprocedure performance. We modeled probability of memory decline using logistic regression on preoperatively known factors and evaluated model discrimination and calibration. A total of 1390 participants (551 CABG, 839 percutaneous coronary intervention) underwent CABG/percutaneous coronary intervention at 75+-6 years old; 40% were women. The cohort was 83% non-Hispanic White, 8.4% non-Hispanic Black, 6.4% Hispanic ethnicity, and 1.7% from other groups masked by the HRS (Health and Retirement Study) to preserve participant confidentiality. At a median of 1.1 (interquartile range, 0.6-1.6) years after procedure, 267 (19%) had mild memory decline and 88 (6.3%) had major memory decline. Factors predicting memory decline included older age, frailty, and off-pump CABG; obesity was protective. The optimism-corrected area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.71-0.77). A cutoff of 50% probability of memory decline identified 14% of the cohort as high risk, and was 94% specific and 30% sensitive for late memory decline. Conclusions Preoperative factors can be used to predict late memory decline after coronary revascularization in an epidemiological cohort with high specificity.
