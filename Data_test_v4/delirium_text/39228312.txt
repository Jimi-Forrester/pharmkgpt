39228312|a|Purpose: Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after cardiac surgery are at high risk of delirium due to a variety of factors. This study aimed to identify the incidence of postoperative delirium in adult patients with cardiac surgery and its risk factors, such as characteristics of subjects, disease and treatment-related, as well as nursing-related characteristics. Methods: The study was performed on adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery at Y University Hospital in D city; a total of 195 patients met the inclusion criteria. Results: The results of this study determined that 67 of 195 adult cardiac surgery patients had postoperative delirium, 53.7% of which occurred in the ICU and 46.3% in the general ward. Risk factors of postoperative delirium were postoperative symptoms of inflammation (odds ratio [OR] = 10.18, p = 0.002), continuous renal replacement therapy application after surgery (OR = 9.05, p = 0.006), postoperative sleep disorder (OR = 8.98, p < 0.001), age (OR = 6.23, p = 0.006), length of stay in the ICU (OR = 3.83, p = 0.031), history of stroke (OR = 3.71, p = 0.033), the number of postoperative catheter retention (OR = 1.53, p = 0.065), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (OR = 1.12, p = 0.006), and time of operation (OR = 1.01, p = 0.042). Conclusion: This study confirmed that after cardiac surgery, postoperative delirium occurred in patients during their ICU stay and after their transfer to a general ward. Considering that after cardiac surgery ICU-related factors affect the incidence of delirium in the general ward, there is a need for continuous monitoring of ICU-related factors after the patient gets transferred to a general ward.
