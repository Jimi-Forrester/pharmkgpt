37100436|a|Geriatric Patients with Hip Fractures: Mortality rates after hip fractures increase by up to 30% with age. This study investigated the contribution of various parameters to prognosis and mortality.</br>. Materials and Methods: Our study prospectively examined patients with hip fracture aged 65 years and over who applied to the Ataturk University Medical Faculty Hospital Orthopedics Service in 2020-2021. Results: The 120 patients included in the study had a mean age of 79.71+-7.27 years, and 51.7% were female. Twenty patients (16.7%) died within the first 30 days after a hip fracture. These patients had a significantly lower median Lawton-Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale score (p=0.045) and a higher rate of malnutrition according to the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) score (p=0.016). Additionally, these patients with 30-day mortality had a significantly lower rate of surgical treatment (p=0.027) and a longer time from injury to surgery (p=0.014). The time to surgery was a significant independent risk factor for 30-day mortality, with each 1-hour delay increasing the odds of mortality by 1.066 (odds ratio: 1.066, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.001-1.013, p=0.013). In addition, the presence of malnutrition was another independent risk factor that increased the odds of mortality by 4.166 times (odds ratio: 4.166; 95% CI: 1.285-13.427, p=0.017). Conclusion: We recommend placing more importance on supportive treatment in patients presenting with hip fractures, especially in those with malnutrition; performing surgical intervention as early as possible; and more closely following up with patients with the aforementioned risk factors.
