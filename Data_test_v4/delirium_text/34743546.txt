34743546|t|Ultrasensitive detection of blood biomarkers of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases: a systematic review.
34743546|a|Purpose: Neurodegenerative disorders are a global health burden with costly and invasive diagnoses relying on brain imaging technology or CSF-based biomarkers. Therefore, considerable efforts to identify blood-biomarkers for Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD) are ongoing. Objectives: This review evaluates the blood biomarkers for AD and PD for their diagnostic value. Methods: This study systematically reviewed articles published between July 1984 and February 2021. Among 1266 papers, we selected 42 studies for a systematic review and 23 studies for meta-analysis. Results & conclusion: Our analysis highlights P-tau181, T-tau and Nfl as promising blood biomarkers for AD diagnosis. Nfl levels were consistently raised in 16 AD and three PD cohorts. P-tau181 and T-tau were also significantly increased in 12 and eight AD cohorts, respectively.
