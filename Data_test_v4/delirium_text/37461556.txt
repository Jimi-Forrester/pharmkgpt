37461556|t|Mass Spectrometry in Cerebrospinal Fluid Uncovers Association of Glycolysis Biomarkers with Alzheimer's Disease in a Large Clinical Sample.
37461556|a|Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex heterogenous neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by multiple pathophysiologies, including disruptions in brain metabolism. Defining markers for patient stratification across these pathophysiologies is an important step towards personalized treatment of AD. Efficient brain glucose metabolism is essential to sustain neuronal activity, but hypometabolism is consistently observed in AD. The molecular changes underlying these observations remain unclear. Recent studies have indicated dysregulation of several glycolysis markers in AD cerebrospinal fluid and tissue. Methods In this study, unbiased mass spectrometry was used to perform a deep proteomic survey of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from a large-scale clinically complex cohort to uncover changes related to impaired glucose metabolism. Results Two glycolytic enzymes, Pyruvate kinase (PKM) and Aldolase A (ALDOA) were found to be specifically upregulated in AD CSF compared to other non-AD groups. Presence of full-length protein of these enzymes in CSF was confirmed through immunoblotting. Levels of tryptic peptides of these enzymes correlated significantly with CSF glucose and CSF lactate in matching CSF samples. Conclusions The results presented here indicate a general dysregulation of glucose metabolism in the brain in AD. We highlight two markers ALDOA and PKM that may act as potential functionally-relevant biomarkers of glucose metabolism dysregulation in AD.
