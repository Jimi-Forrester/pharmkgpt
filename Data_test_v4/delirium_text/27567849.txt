27567849|t|Characterization of Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults in Panama.
27567849|a|Research on age-related cognitive impairment is scarce in Central America. We report factors associated with cognitive impairment among a sample of older adults in Panama diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 31), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 43), or no cognitive impairment (controls, n = 185). Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype was assessed in a subset of cases (n = 135). Age (OR = 2.53, 95% CI = 1.03-6.17) and ApoE e4 (OR = 5.14, 95% CI = 2.11-12.52) were significantly related to cognitive impairment (AD/MCI combined). Results underscore the potential of genetic screening in Panama for identifying those at risk of dementia.
