34591270|a|PURPOSE: Diabetes is a growing health problem. The aim of this study was to capture time trends in mortality associated with diabetes. METHODS: The mortality database of the Veneto region (Italy) includes both the underlying causes of death, and all the diseases mentioned in the death certificate. The annual percent change (APC) in age-standardized rates from 2008 to 2017 was computed by the Joinpoint Regression Program. RESULTS: Overall 453,972 deaths (56,074 with mention of diabetes) were observed among subjects aged >= 40 years. Mortality rates declined for diabetes as the underlying cause of death and from diabetes-related circulatory diseases. The latter declined especially in females - 4.4 (CI 95% - 5.3/- 3.4), while in males the APC was - 2.8 (CI 95% - 4.0/- 1.6). CONCLUSION: We observed a significant reduction in mortality during the period 2008-2017 in diabetes either as underlying cause of death or when all mentions of diabetes in the death certificate were considered.
