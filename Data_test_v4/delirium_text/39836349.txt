39836349|t|Cardiotoxic Effects Following CAR-T Cell Therapy: A Literature Review.
39836349|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This paper reviewed the current literature on incidence, clinical manifestations, and risk factors of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) cardiotoxicity. RECENT FINDINGS: CAR-T therapy has emerged as a groundbreaking treatment for hematological malignancies since FDA approval in 2017. CAR-T therapy is however associated with a few side effects, among which cardiotoxicity is of significant concern. There were only a few studies on CAR-T cardiotoxicity published to date with limited sample sizes, and their findings were heterogeneous. It was difficult to reach generalizable conclusions. CAR-T therapy was associated with significant risks for acute and subacute cardiotoxicity, as measured by echocardiograms, EKG, and blood biomarkers. Patients with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) grade 2 or higher were more likely to exhibit cardiotoxicity. The most prevalent cardiac events included hypotension-requiring inotropic or vasopressor support, tachycardia, heart failure/decompensation, atrial fibrillation, new or worsening cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, myocarditis, cardiac arrest, and cardiovascular death. The most prevalent echocardiographic changes were systolic dysfunction and diastolic dysfunction, and abnormal echocardiogram findings. There were differences in findings between adult and pediatric patients. The long-term effects beyond a year post treatment remain largely unknown and long-term follow-up studies are warranted.
