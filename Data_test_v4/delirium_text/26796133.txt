26796133|t|Hypoxia-inducible miR-210 contributes to preeclampsia via targeting thrombospondin type I domain containing 7A.
26796133|a|Preeclampsia, a relatively common pregnancy disorder, is a major contributor to maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. An elevation in microRNA-210 (miR-210) expression in the placenta has been reported to be associated with preeclampsia. Our bioinformatic analysis showed that thrombospondin type I domain containing 7A (THSD7A) is a predicted target for miR-210. The aim of this study was to determine whether miR-210 is involved in preeclampsia through its targeting of THSD7A in human placental trophoblasts. In preeclamptic placental tissues, THSD7A levels were significantly downregulated, and were inversely correlated with the levels of miR-210. THSD7A was validated as a direct target of miR-210 using quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and dual luciferase assays in HTR8/SVneo cells. Transwell insert invasion assays showed that THSD7A mediated the invasion-inhibitory effect of miR-210 in HTR8/SVneo cells. Interestingly, hypoxia markedly increased miR-210 expression while suppressing THSD7A expression in a time-dependent manner in HTR8/SVneo cells. This study provides novel data on the function of THSD7A in human placental cells, and extends our knowledge of how miR-210 is involved in the development of the preeclampsia.
