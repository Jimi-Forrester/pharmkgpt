36061149|t|Human Brain Organoid: A Versatile Tool for Modeling Neurodegeneration Diseases and for Drug Screening.
36061149|a|Clinical trials serve as the fundamental prerequisite for clinical therapy of human disease, which is primarily based on biomedical studies in animal models. Undoubtedly, animal models have made a significant contribution to gaining insight into the developmental and pathophysiological understanding of human diseases. However, none of the existing animal models could efficiently simulate the development of human organs and systems due to a lack of spatial information; the discrepancy in genetic, anatomic, and physiological basis between animals and humans limits detailed investigation. Therefore, the translational efficiency of the research outcomes in clinical applications was significantly weakened, especially for some complex, chronic, and intractable diseases. For example, the clinical trials for human fragile X syndrome (FXS) solely based on animal models have failed such as mGluR5 antagonists. To mimic the development of human organs more faithfully and efficiently translate in vitro biomedical studies to clinical trials, extensive attention to organoids derived from stem cells contributes to a deeper understanding of this research. The organoids are a miniaturized version of an organ generated in vitro, partially recapitulating key features of human organ development. As such, the organoids open a novel avenue for in vitro models of human disease, advantageous over the existing animal models. The invention of organoids has brought an innovative breakthrough in regeneration medicine. The organoid-derived human tissues or organs could potentially function as invaluable platforms for biomedical studies, pathological investigation of human diseases, and drug screening. Importantly, the study of regeneration medicine and the development of therapeutic strategies for human diseases could be conducted in a dish, facilitating in vitro analysis and experimentation. Thus far, the pilot breakthrough has been made in the generation of numerous types of organoids representing different human organs. Most of these human organoids have been employed for in vitro biomedical study and drug screening. However, the efficiency and quality of the organoids in recapitulating the development of human organs have been hindered by engineering and conceptual challenges. The efficiency and quality of the organoids are essential for downstream applications. In this article, we highlight the application in the modeling of human neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as FXS, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), and organoid-based drug screening. Additionally, challenges and weaknesses especially for limits of the brain organoid models in modeling late onset NDDs such as AD and PD., and future perspectives regarding human brain organoids are addressed.
