38256472|t|Retrospective Analysis of Ultrasound-Guided Serial-Injection Triple Nerve Block Efficacy in Cementless Bipolar Hemiarthroplasty for Femoral Neck Fracture.
38256472|a|BACKGROUND: Femoral neck fractures are effectively treated with bipolar hemiarthroplasty (BHA) surgery, yet postoperative pain management remains a challenge. This study explores the efficacy of multimodal pain management in minimizing opioid use and enhancing recovery. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 87 patients who underwent BHA between September 2016 and September 2020 was conducted. Patients were analyzed in two groups: Group I (n = 42), receiving serial-injection nerve blocks (SINBs) before and after surgery, and Group II (n = 41), with no SINB. Notably, all nerve blocks for Group I were performed after November 2017, following the implementation of this technique in our protocol. Pain and analgesic medication usage were assessed over 72 h post-surgery, along with hospitalization duration and perioperative complications. RESULTS: Group I patients exhibited significantly lower pain scores at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h post-surgery, alongside reduced incidences of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and delirium compared with Group II (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing sequential lower limb nerve blocks under ultrasound guidance in BHA surgeries effectively reduces early postoperative pain and associated adverse effects. This approach demonstrates potential benefits in pain management, leading to diminished narcotic usage and lower risks of PONV and delirium.
