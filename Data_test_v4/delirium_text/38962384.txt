38962384|a|Established drug therapies for Alzheimer disease (cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine) do not modify the disease course and provide only modest clinical benefit. Biomarker measures of amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration have been integral to Alzheimer disease clinical trials for biologic drugs, for patient selection and efficacy monitoring. At the time of writing, two monoclonal antibodies targeting the amyloid-beta protein (aducanumab and lecanemab) have been approved in the USA, and two agents (lecanemab and donanemab) are under evaluation by the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia. Clinical trials have demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies are effective at removing amyloid from the brain in people with early Alzheimer disease. Cognitive benefits are statistically significant, but do not achieve the minimal clinically important difference. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities of vasogenic oedema and microhaemorrhages occur more frequently on treatment; although these are usually asymptomatic or transient, in some people they are serious or fatal. Targeting amyloid as a unimodal strategy is unlikely to be sufficient and future therapies may need to be multimodal, targeting multiple pathogenic pathways. The burden of dementia is greatest in the older population where mixed dementia pathology dominates; the relationship between biomarkers, clinical phenotype and pathology attenuates; and frailty and comorbidity impact cognition. This creates challenges in identifying effective therapies for the group where dementia is most prevalent.
