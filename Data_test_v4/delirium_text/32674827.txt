32674827|a|The COVID-19 pandemic's greatest impact is among older adults. Management of the situation requires a systemic response, and post-acute care (PAC) can provide an adequate mix of active treatment, management of associated geriatric syndromes and palliative care, both in the acute phase, and in post-COVID-19 recovery. In the region of Catalonia, Spain, selected PAC centers have become sites to treat older patients with COVID-19. Referrals come from the emergency department or COVID-19 wards of the acute reference hospitals, nursing homes, or private homes. We critically review the actions taken by Parc Sanitari Pere Virgili, a PAC facility in Barcelona, to manage the pandemic, including its administration, health care, communication, psychological support, and ethical frameworks. We believe that the strategies we used and the lessons we learned can be useful for other sites and countries where similar adaptation of existing facilities may be implemented.
