36646994|t|Muscle strength trajectories and their association with postoperative health-related quality of life in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: a prospective cohort study.
36646994|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with sarcopenia have a higher risk of poor recovery after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Little is known about the impact of changes in muscle strength (the primary indicator for sarcopenia) on health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). This study aimed to (1) identify subgroups with different muscle strength trajectories, (2) identify differences in preoperative risk factors among trajectory group membership, and (3) explore their prognostic value on postoperative HR-QoL in patients undergoing CABG. METHODS: In this prospective observational study 131 patients undergoing elective CABG completed grip strength tests and HR-QoL questionnaires. Latent Class Growth Mixture Modelling (LCGMM) was used to identify clinically relevant trajectories (> 5% of study population) for weight-normalised grip strength, measured at admission, 3 days, and 6 months after surgery. Differences between trajectory group membership at baseline were evaluated. The impact of trajectory group membership on postoperative HR-QoL was evaluated with multiple linear regression models. RESULTS: Due to low numbers (n = 15), female patients were excluded from LCGMM and subsequent statistical analyses. In males (n = 116), we identified two main weight-normalised grip strength trajectories: a "stable average" trajectory with a slight decline immediately post-surgery and recovery to preoperative levels (n = 85) and a "high" trajectory with a considerable immediate decline after surgery but followed towards a higher level of recovery compared to preoperative level (n = 27). The "stable average" patients were older (68 vs. 57 years; P = 0.003), had more diabetes (27% vs. 4%; P = 0.01) and had a higher BMI (27.8 vs. 24.8; P = 0.005) compared to the "high" group. After correction for age, diabetes, and baseline HR-QoL, group trajectory membership was not associated with postoperative HR-QoL, yet an increase in individual change scores of weight-normalised grip strength was associated with a better postoperative HR-QoL. We also identified one small trajectory group (n = 4, <= 5%). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed two relevant weight-normalised grip strength trajectories in male patients undergoing CABG, varying in important preoperative risk factors. While change scores of grip strength per weight did predict postoperative HR-QoL, the trajectory subgroups could not predict postoperative HR-QoL. Future research should focus on female patients, reacting potentially different on CABG and/or rehabilitation treatment. Trial registration NCT03774342, 12-12-2018.
