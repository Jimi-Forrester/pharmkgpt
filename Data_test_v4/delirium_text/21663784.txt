21663784|t|Treating the periphery to ameliorate neurodegenerative diseases.
21663784|a|Abnormalities in the kynurenine pathway are associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Zwilling et al. (2011) show that inhibition of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase in the body's periphery leads to an increase in kyneuric acid, a neuroprotective compound, in the brain. This intervention ameliorates neurodegeneration in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease.
