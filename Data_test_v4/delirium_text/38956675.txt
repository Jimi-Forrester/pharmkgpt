38956675|t|Prospective validation of a mobile health application for blood pressure management in patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
38956675|a|BACKGROUND: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) pose significant risks to both maternal and fetal health, contributing to global morbidity and mortality. Management of HDP is complex, particularly because of concerns regarding potential negative effects on utero-placental circulation and limited therapeutic options due to fetal safety. Our study investigates whether blood pressure monitoring through a mobile health (mHealth) application can aid in addressing the challenges of blood pressure management in pregnant individuals with HDP. Additionally, we aim to assess whether this intervention can improve short-term maternal and fetal outcomes and potentially mitigate long-term cardiovascular consequences. METHODS: This prospective, randomized, single-center trial will include 580 pregnant participants who meet the HDP criteria or who have a heightened risk of pregnancy-related hypertension due to factors such as multiple pregnancies, obesity, diabetes, or a history of HDP in prior pregnancies leading to preterm birth. Participants will be randomized to either the mHealth intervention group or the standard care group. The primary endpoint is the difference in systolic blood pressure from enrollment to 1 month after childbirth. The secondary endpoints include various blood pressure parameters, obstetric outcomes, body mass index trajectory, step counts, mood assessment, and drug adherence. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the potential of mHealth interventions, such as the Heart4U application, to improve blood pressure management in pregnant individuals with HDP. By leveraging technology to enhance engagement, communication, and monitoring, this study aims to positively impact maternal, fetal, and postpartum outcomes associated with HDP. This innovative approach demonstrates the potential of personalized technology-driven solutions for managing complex health conditions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05995106.
