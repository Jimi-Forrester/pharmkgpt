34652763|t|Methylprednisolone and inflammatory stress response in older people undergoing surgery for hip fracture: a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial.
34652763|a|PURPOSE: The inflammatory response to surgery can cause organ dysfunction that results in postoperative complications, including delirium. Methylprednisolone is an anti-inflammatory drug and could mitigate stress responses. This purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of a single high-dose methylprednisolone on various biomarkers in older people undergoing surgery for hip fractures. METHODS: In the primary study, 117 patients were included. The biomarkers investigated in this secondary analysis were interleukin (IL) -6, IL-10, troponin-T (TnT), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), S100 calcium-binding protein B, and soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor. Blood samples were collected at four time points: (1) before the study intervention (Tbefore); (2) at time of surgery (Tsurgery); on the (3) 1st and (4) 3rd postoperative day (TP1 and TP3, respectively). RESULTS: Patients in the methylprednisolone group had significantly lower adjusted mean IL-6 at Tsurgery and TP1 than the placebo group [15.60 (1.13 pg/mL) vs 47.86 (1.12 pg/mL), p < 0.000 and 111.01 (31.64 pg/mL) vs 198.57 (24.00 pg/mL), p = 0.005]. Furthermore, adjusted mean TnT levels at Tsurgery were lower in the methylprednisolone group [20.61 (1.14 ng/mL) vs 24.28 (1.12 ng/mL), p = 0.024) as well as adjusted mean TNF-alpha levels TP1 (14.31 (1.08 pg/mL) vs 17.64 (1.04 pg/mL), p = 0.025]. CONCLUSIONS: In this secondary analysis, methylprednisolone had a significant effect on three biomarkers (IL-6, TnT, and TNF-alpha). The potential beneficial effects of methylprednisolone on inflammatory biomarkers reflecting surgical stress response in patients with hip fractures need to be investigated further.
