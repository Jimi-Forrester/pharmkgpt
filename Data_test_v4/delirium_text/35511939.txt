35511939|a|Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen are among the most-frequently used medications. Although these medications have different mechanisms of action, they have similar indications and treatment duration has been positively correlated with cardiovascular risk although the degree of risk varies by medication. Our objective was to study treatment effects of chronic use of individual NSAID medications and acetaminophen on all-cause mortality among patients who tested positive for COVID-19 while accounting for adherence. We used the VA national datasets in this retrospective cohort study to differentiate between sporadic and chronic medication use: sporadic users filled an NSAID within the last year, but not recently or regularly. Using established and possible risk factors for severe COVID-19, we used propensity scores analysis to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics between treatment groups. Then, we used multivariate logistic regression incorporating inverse propensity score weighting to assess mortality. The cohort consisted of 28,856 patients. Chronic use of aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, meloxicam, celecoxib, diclofenac or acetaminophen was not associated with significant differences in mortality at 30 days (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.95-1.00; OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.98-1.00; OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.98-1.01; OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.98-1.00; OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.98-1.01; OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97-1.01; and OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.99-1.02, respectively) nor at 60 days (OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-1.00; OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.99-1.01; OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.98-1.01; OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97-1.00; OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97-1.01; OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97-1.01; and OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.99-1.02, respectively). Although the study design cannot determine causality, the study should assure patients as it finds no association between mortality and chronic use of these medications compared with sporadic NSAID use among those infected with COVID-19.
