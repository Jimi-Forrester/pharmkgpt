39606384|t|Pilot: Salivary Lactoferrin as a Biomarker of Alzheimer's Disease.
39606384|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) research has focused on developing accessible biomarkers that accurately detect disease pathology and progression before symptoms present. Lactoferrin (Lf) is an iron-binding antimicrobial glycoprotein found in all biological fluids, and its concentration in saliva has been correlated with AD symptoms. This pilot project aimed to determine whether salivary lactoferrin (sLF) has potential as a biomarker for AD. Methods: Participants were middle to older-aged non-Hispanic white (NHW) and Black Americans (BA) at risk for AD due to parental history. We collected saliva samples after an 8-hour fast and administered a cognitive battery assessing executive function, memory, visuospatial ability, attention, and verbal fluency. We examined the relationship between sLF and cognitive performance and evaluated protein concentration across races. Results: Seventeen middle-to-older-aged (age = 60.29 +- 9.7 years) BA and NHWs were enrolled. After controlling for age, sex, race, and years of education, we found a significant r between sLF and Digit Span Memory Test (DSMT) scores ( P = 0.013) and a modest correlation with Mental Rotation Test scores ( P = 0.194). We found no difference in average concentration across races. Conclusions: Memory concerns and a worsening in visuospatial ability are early signs of cognitive decline in AD patients, and this pilot suggests a correlation of these symptoms with sLF. Bigger-scale longitudinal studies to examine the relationship between sLF and established AD biomarkers in diverse populations are needed to assess its clinical usefulness as an early biomarker for AD.
