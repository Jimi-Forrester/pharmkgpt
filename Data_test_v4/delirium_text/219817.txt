219817|t|Lewy bodies in the presence of Alzheimer's disease.
219817|a|Large numbers of Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra were found in a case of Alzheimer's disease. Parkinsonian symptoms were not recognized. The patient appears to be an example of an association recognized by Woodard but not yet understood. The case is discussed in the context of reported relationships between Parkinson's disease or "Lewy body disease" and dementia, on the one hand, and reports linking various forms of psychoses with an unusually high incidence of Lewy bodies, on the other.
