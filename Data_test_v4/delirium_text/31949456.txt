31949456|t|Naming error in multiple sclerosis patients: A pilot study in Isfahan, Iran.
31949456|a|BACKGROUND: Although cognitive impairment is common in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, language difficulties are controversy and little information is available on nonEnglish languages. Therefore, the present cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the naming accuracy in Persian relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty RRMS patients were recruited from Kashani Comprehensive MS Center, Isfahan, Iran. Their performance on measures of mini mental state examination (MMSE), Expanded Disability Status Scale, and Naming Test was compared with control participants. RESULTS: MS patients were found to have much more naming errors than the control group (2.1 +- 1.8 vs. 0.54 +- 1.1 P = 0.02). Average MMSE score of MS patients was 27.23 (range = 18-30, standard deviation [SD] = 2) versus 28.96 (range = 19-30, SD = 3.2) in controls. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that naming ability can be impaired in RRMS regardless of disability score. Specific language function tests including naming should be considered in the process of evaluating and rehabilitating patients with MS.
