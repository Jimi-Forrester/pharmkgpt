39903847|t|In Silico Study, Synthesis, and In Vitro Evaluation of Acetylcholinesterase and Butyrylcholinesterase Inhibitory Activity of Novel N-Thiazole Substituted Acetamide Coumarin Derivatives.
39903847|a|In this study, a structurally directed pharmacophore hybridization technique is used to combine the two essential structural scaffolds coumarin and thiazoles in search of a new class of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). A library of 120 compounds was designed in two series 5a(1-15), 5b(16-30), 5c(31-45), 5d(46-60), and 6a(61-75), 6b(76-90), 6c(91-105), 6d(106-120) using various substituted phenol, beta-ketoesters, and thiazole derivatives. Eleven compounds were identified as potential hybrids using molecular property filter analysis and molecular docking studies, and they comprise N-substituted thiazole coumarin derivatives. The docking results indicated that compounds 5b16 and 5c35 exhibited strong binding interactions with GLY116, GLY117, TYR332, and HIS438 (ranging from -27.42 to -24.18 kcal/mol) and GLY119, ASP72, and PHE288 (ranging from -32.21 to -25.92 kcal/mol) when tested against AChE (1EVE) and BuChE (1P0I) inhibitors. These compounds were synthesized via conventional methods and characterized by different spectroscopic methods. In vitro anti-cholinesterase activity results indicated that two compounds, for example, 5b16 and 5c35 showed potent to moderate activity against AChE and BuChE with IC50 (2.00 +- 0.09-29.63 +- 0.48) microM and (34.93 +- 0.62-17.92 +- 0.42) microM, respectively. Our study demonstrated the development of a novel class of hybrid coumarin thiazole derivatives as AChE and BuChE inhibitors, and these compounds could be utilized against ADs.
