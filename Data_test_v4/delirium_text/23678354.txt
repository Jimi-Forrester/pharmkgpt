23678354|t|Prolonged Delirium Secondary to Hypoxic-ischemic Encephalopathy Following Cardiac Arrest.
23678354|a|Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury encompasses a complex constellation of pathophysiological and cellular brain injury induced by hypoxia, ischemia, cytotoxicity, or combinations of these mechanisms and can result in poor outcomes including significant changes in personality and cognitive impairments in memory, cognition, and attention. We report a case of a male patient with normal premorbid functioning who developed prolonged delirium following hypoxic-ischemic brain insults subsequent to cardiac arrest. The case highlights the importance of adopting a multidisciplinary treatment approach involving the coordinated care of medical and nursing teams to optimise management of patients suffering from such a debilitating organic brain syndrome.
