30637698|t|Soluble Amyloid Precursor Protein alpha: Friend or Foe?
30637698|a|The "amyloidogenic" proteolytic processing of the cell surface amyloid precursor protein (APP) produces amyloid-beta, which causes a range of detrimental effects in the neuron, such as synaptic loss, and plays a key role in Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, "non-amyloidogenic" proteolytic processing, which involves the cleavage of APP by alpha-secretase, produces soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha (sAPPalpha) and is the most predominant proteolytic processing of APP in the healthy brain. Current research suggests that sAPPalpha plays a role in synaptic growth and plasticity, but whether this role is protective or detrimental is age-dependent. This review looks at the effects of increasing sAPPalpha during three time-points in life (in development, young adult, ageing/neurodegeneration) when synaptic plasticity plays an important role.
