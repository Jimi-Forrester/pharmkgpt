38341100|t|Longitudinal MRI analysis using a hybrid DenseNet-BiLSTM method for Alzheimer's disease prediction.
38341100|a|Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by brain atrophy and cell death, leading to cognitive decline and impaired functioning. Previous research has primarily focused on using cross-sectional data for Alzheimer's disease identification, but analyzing longitudinal sequential MR images is crucial for improved diagnostic accuracy and understanding disease progression. However, existing deep learning models face challenges in learning spatial and temporal features from such data. To address these challenges, this study presents a novel hybrid DenseNet-BiLSTM method for Alzheimer's disease prediction using longitudinal MRI analysis. The proposed framework combines Convolutional DenseNet for spatial information extraction and joined BiLSTM layers for capturing temporal characteristics and relationships between longitudinal images at different time points. This approach overcomes issues like overfitting, vanishing gradients, and incomplete patient data. We evaluated the model on 684 longitudinal MRI images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, including normal controls, individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease patients. The results demonstrate high classification accuracy, with 95.28% for AD/CN, 88.19% for NC/MCI, 83.51% for sMCI/pMCI, and 92.14% for MCI/AD. These findings highlight the substantial improvement in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis achieved through the utilization of longitudinal MRI images. The contributions of this study lie in both the deep learning and medical domains. In the deep learning domain, our hybrid framework effectively learns spatial and temporal features from longitudinal data, addressing the challenges associated with multi-dimensional and sequential time series data. In the medical domain, our study emphasizes the importance of analyzing baseline and longitudinal MR images for accurate diagnosis and understanding disease progression.
