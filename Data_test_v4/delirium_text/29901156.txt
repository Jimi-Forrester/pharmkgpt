29901156|a|The present study aimed to investigate the expression of microRNA (miR)-125b in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to determine its potential role in AD. Mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a APPSwe/Delta9 cells were used to generate an in vitro AD model. The results demonstrated that the expression levels of miR-125b were markedly increased in patients with AD compared with in the normal group. In addition, overexpression of miR-125b significantly inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and enhanced inflammation and oxidative stress in an in vitro model of AD model. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-125b significantly promoted amyloid precursor protein and beta-secretase 1 expression and beta-amyloid peptide production, and suppressed sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) protein expression in vitro. These findings suggested that miR-125b may regulate AD, and neuronal cell growth and apoptosis, via the regulation of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress by SphK1; therefore, miR-125b may be involved in the development of AD.
