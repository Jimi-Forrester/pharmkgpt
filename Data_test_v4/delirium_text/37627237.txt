37627237|t|Membrane Transporters Involved in Iron Trafficking: Physiological and Pathological Aspects.
37627237|a|Iron is an essential transition metal for its involvement in several crucial biological functions, the most notable being oxygen storage and transport. Due to its high reactivity and potential toxicity, intracellular and extracellular iron levels must be tightly regulated. This is achieved through transport systems that mediate cellular uptake and efflux both at the level of the plasma membrane and on the membranes of lysosomes, endosomes and mitochondria. Among these transport systems, the key players are ferroportin, the only known transporter mediating iron efflux from cells; DMT1, ZIP8 and ZIP14, which on the contrary, mediate iron influx into the cytoplasm, acting on the plasma membrane and on the membranes of lysosomes and endosomes; and mitoferrin, involved in iron transport into the mitochondria for heme synthesis and Fe-S cluster assembly. The focus of this review is to provide an updated view of the physiological role of these membrane proteins and of the pathologies that arise from defects of these transport systems.
