39554327|a|Garlic (Alliaceae), an annual herb, is renowned not only for its distinctive flavor but also for its extensive therapeutic applications in managing various ailments and health conditions. In this study, garlic products identified as the best-selling items in Turkish pharmacies for various purposes were compared with garlic grown under standard conditions in terms of chemical composition and antidiabetic, anticholinesterase, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties. Three of garlic samples were prepared by researchers. According to survey results, the most commonly sold garlic-related products in pharmacies are black garlic extract tablets (4), capsules (5), garlic oil (6), garlic oil pearls (7), and fermented garlic (8). Diallyl disulfide (DADS) was identified as a predominant compound in sampled oils, ranging from 4.9% to 48.6%. Another noteworthy finding is the identification of allyl methyl disulfide and allyl methyl trisulfide as major components in sampled oils, with concentrations spanning from 2.9% to 9.8% and 0.4% to 17.5%, respectively. In both 2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic) acid (ABTS +) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH ) tests, Sample 1 (fermented) exhibited the highest antioxidant activity. Sample 3 (cultivated) was richer in total phenol-total tannin content. Sample 6 exhibited the highest alpha-glucosidase inhibition among antidiabetic activities, reaching 28.93%. Sample 5 capsules demonstrated the highest alpha-amylase inhibition at 51.50%. Sample 7 exhibited the most notable inhibition against both acetylcholinesterase (22.92%) and butyrylcholinesterase (13.37%). Samples 3, 6, and 8 were found to be more effective against Candida tropicalis with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 625 mug/mL. A comprehensive study on garlic products, including popular items from Turkish pharmacies and those grown under standard conditions, revealed diverse chemical compositions and multifaceted health properties.
