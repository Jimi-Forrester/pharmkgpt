19145559|a|INTRODUCTION: Apathy is the most common behavioral symptom in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of apathy in patients with mild AD and at 12 months. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Longitudinal study in patients with AD assessed with Cambridge-Cognitive Revised (CAMCOG-R), Disability Assessment in Dementia (DAD) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Sociodemographic variables were collected using a structured interview. The apathy NPI score was taken in to account in the study when it was equal or more than 4. RESULTS: The sample size consisted of 155 subjects with a mean age of 77.1 +/- 6.7 years, and there were more women than men (67.7% vs. 32.3%). The prevalence of apathy was 18.7%. After 12 months persistence was 51.7% and remission was 48.3%. The emergence was 21.4%. Significant differences were seen in CAMCOG-R (p = 0,001), DAD (p < 0,001) and NPI (p < 0,001) between patients with or without apathy. The presence of apathy symptoms was not associated with age or gender but it affects to the course of initiative and executive functions and the NPI total scores. CONCLUSION: The apathy increases with the severity of the AD, and it has been associated with a poorer initiative and executive function ability. With respect to the baseline visit, an increased of NPI total score was observed when an increased apathy NPI score is observed.
