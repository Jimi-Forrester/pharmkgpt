The factors responsible for biochemical changes at the cellular level and the different therapies available for the treatment of cognitive disorders are described. Recent advances, including the elucidation of biochemical changes at the molecular level and different approaches to treat the disease, are also briefly reviewed. (c) 2001 Prous Science.
