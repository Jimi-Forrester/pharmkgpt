36508580|a|Leveraging biased signaling of G protein-coupled receptors has been proposed as a promising strategy for the development of drugs with higher specificity. However, the consequences of selectively targeting G protein- or beta-arrestin-mediated signaling on cellular functions are not comprehensively understood. In this study, we utilized phosphoproteomics to gain a systematic overview of signaling induced by the four biased and balanced dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) ligands MS308, BM138, quinpirole, and sulpiride in an in vitro D2R transfection model. Quantification of 14,160 phosphosites revealed a low impact of the partial G protein agonist MS308 on cellular protein phosphorylation, as well as surprising similarities between the balanced agonist quinpirole and the inverse agonist sulpiride. Analysis of the temporal profiles of ligand-induced phosphorylation events showed a transient impact of the G protein-selective agonist MS308, whereas the beta-arrestin-preferring agonist BM138 elicited a delayed, but more pronounced response. Functional enrichment analysis of ligand-impacted phosphoproteins and treatment-linked kinases confirmed multiple known functions of D2R signaling while also revealing novel effects, for example of MS308 on sterol regulatory element-binding protein-related gene expression. All raw data were deposited in MassIVE (MSV000089457).
