16784798|a|Using a case-control sample we evaluated a possible involvement of the Vacuolar protein sorting 26 (VPS26) gene in the pathogenesis of AD. VPS26 located at 10q22.1 denotes a retromer subunit functionally involved in the cellular trafficking of Memapsin 2 (BACE). Genotyping of eight single nucleotide polymorphisms covering the complete VPS26 gene and haplotypic analysis revealed no association with AD. Thus, we conclude that VPS26 can be excluded as a major positional and functional candidate gene conferring risk to AD.
