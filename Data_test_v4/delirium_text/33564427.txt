33564427|a|INTRODUCTION: Severe complications after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are rare due to increasing procedural safety. However, TAVI procedure-related haemodynamic instability and increased risk of infection may affect renal functional reserve with subsequent renal acidosis and hyperkalaemia. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated incidence, modifiable risk factors and prognosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) and AKI complicated by hyperkalaemia, pulmonary oedema or metabolic acidosis after TAVI. METHODS: In a retrospective single-centre study, 804 consecutive patients hospitalized during 2017 and 2018 for elective TAVI were included. AKI was defined according to the 'Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome' (KDIGO) initiative. Variables on co-morbidities, intra-/post-interventional complications and course of renal function up to 6 months after index-hospitalization were assessed. In multivariate regression analyses, risk factors for the development of AKI, complicated AKI, renal non-recovery from AKI and in-hospital mortality were determined. RESULTS: Incidence of AKI was 13.8% (111/804); in-hospital mortality after TAVI was 2.3%. AKI was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality, odds ratio (OR) 10.3 (3.4-31.6), P < 0.001, further increasing to OR = 21.8 (6.6-71.5), P < 0.001 in patients with AKI complicated by hyperkalaemia, pulmonary oedema or metabolic acidosis, n = 57/111 (51.4%). Potentially modifiable, interventional factors independently associated with complicated AKI were infection [OR = 3.20 (1.61-6.33), P = 0.001] and red blood cell transfusion [OR = 5.04 (2.67-9.52), P < 0.001]. Valve type and size, contrast volume and other intra-interventional characteristics, such as the need for tachycardial pacing, did not influence the development of AKI. Eleven of 111 (9.9%) patients did not recover from AKI, mostly affecting patients with cardiac decompensation. In 18/111 (16.2%) patients, information concerning AKI was provided in discharge letter. Within 6 months after TAVI, higher proportion of patients with AKI showed progression of pre-existing chronic kidney disease compared with patients without AKI [14/29, 48.3% versus 54/187, 28.9%, OR = 2.3 (95% confidence interval 1.0-5.1), P = 0.036]. CONCLUSIONS: AKI is common and may impede patient outcome after TAVI with acute complications such as hyperkalaemia or metabolic acidosis and adverse renal function until 6 months after intervention. Our study findings may contribute to refinement of allocation of appropriate level of care in and out of hospital after TAVI.
