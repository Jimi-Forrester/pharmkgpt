24836573|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe the spectrum of central nervous system (CNS) disorders and the contribution of neurological immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in hospitalized HIV/AIDS patients in You'an Hospital, Beijing China. STUDY DESIGN & METHODS: A retrospective observational study conducted over a 24-month period in You'an Hospial, a public sector referral hospital in Beijing, China. This study enrolled HIV seropositive patients who were admitted for developing new or recurrent neurological and (or) psychiatric symptoms from September 2009 to August 2011. Medical records were reviewed, demographic and clinical data were collected. Patients with peripheral neuropathy and those in delirium were excluded from this study. RESULTS: Of the total 620 HIV/AIDS hospital admissions from September 2009 to August 2011, 60 patients (9.7%) were hospitalized for CNS complications. The diagnosis of HIV infection was made after hospital admission in 16 of the 60 patients (26.7%), and 34 of them (56.7%) were already on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at the point of admission. The median CD4 cell count in these subjects was 39 (21-133) cells/mm(3), and 93.3% (56/60) of these patients belonged to stage IV HIV disease according to World Health Organization (WHO) classification. The most frequent diagnosis in these subjects included cryptococcal meningitis (CM, n=13, 22%), cerebral toxoplasmosis (n=10, 17%), and CNS tuberculosis (n=7, 11.7%). The overall mortality was 13% (8/60) and the case-fatality rates were: cryptococcal meningitis 7.7% (1/13), cerebral toxoplasmosis 20% (2/10) and tuberculous meningitis 28.6% (2/7). Of the 34 patients who were on ART, paradoxical neurological IRIS (the conditions of their existing CNS disorders get paradoxically worse after ART because of an exuberant inflammatory response directed towards opportunistic pathogens) was diagnosed in 4 patients (11.8%), 2 of whom related to TB infection (out of 5 TB patients, 40%), and the other 2 related to CM (out of 8 patients, 25%). CONCLUSION: Opportunistic infections, such as cryptococcal meningitis, cerebral toxoplasmosis and CNS tuberculosis were the most frequent diagnosis of CNS disease in hospitalized HIV/AIDS patients in You'an Hospital, Beijing, China. About 10% patients on ART were diagnosed as neurological IRIS in such a group of patients.
