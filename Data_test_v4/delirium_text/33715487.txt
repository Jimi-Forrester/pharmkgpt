33715487|t|Comparing Combined Anterior and Posterior to Posterior-Only Decompression and Fusion Crossing the Cervico-Thoracic Junction in Octogenarians.
33715487|a|STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to compare early complication, morbidity and mortality risks associated with fusion surgery crossing the cervico-thoracic junction in patients aged over 80 years undergoing combined anterior and posterior approach versus a posterior-only approach. METHODS: We retrospectively identified octogenarian patients with myelopathy who underwent fusion crossing the cervico-thoracic junction. Patient demographics, Nurick score, surgical characteristics, complications, hospital course, early outcome and 90-day mortality were collected. Comorbidities were classified using the age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (AACCI). Radiographic measurements for deformity correction included the C2-C7 sagittal Cobb angle, C2-7 sagittal vertical axis and T1 slope pre- and postoperatively. RESULTS: Out of 8,521 surgically treated patients, 12 octogenarian patients had a combined anterior and posterior approach (AP group) and 14 were treated from posterior-only (P group). Mean age was 81.4 +- 1.2 and 82.5 +- 2.7 years, respectively. There was no significant difference in Nurick scores between the groups (P > 0.05). The major complication risk in the AP group was significantly higher, requiring PEG tube placement due to severe dysphagia in 4 patients (33%) compared to none in the P group. A greater improvement in cervical lordosis could be achieved through a combined approach. The 90-day mortality risk was 8% for the AP group and 0% for the P group. CONCLUSIONS: A combined anterior and posterior approach is associated with a significantly higher major complication rate and can result in severe dysphagia requiring PEG tube placement in one-third of patients over 80 years of age.
