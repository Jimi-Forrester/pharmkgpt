36592693|t|Co-Occurring Catatonia and COVID-19 Diagnoses Among Hospitalized Individuals in 2020: A National Inpatient Sample Analysis.
36592693|a|BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is associated with a range of neuropsychiatric manifestations. While case reports and case series have reported catatonia in the setting of COVID-19 infection, its rate has been poorly characterized. OBJECTIVE: This study reports the co-occurrence of catatonia and COVID-19 diagnoses among acute care hospital discharges in the United States in 2020. METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample, an all-payors database of acute care hospital discharges, was queried for patients of any age discharged with a diagnosis of catatonia and COVID-19 in 2020. RESULTS: Among 32,355,827 hospitalizations in the 2020 National Inpatient Sample, an estimated 15,965 (95% confidence interval: 14,992-16,938) involved a diagnosis of catatonia without COVID-19 infection, 1,678,385 (95% confidence interval: 1,644,738-1,712,022) involved a diagnosis of COVID-19 without a co-occurring catatonia diagnosis, and 610 (95% confidence interval: 578-642) involved both catatonia and COVID-19 infection. In an adjusted model, a diagnosis of COVID-19, but not a diagnosis of catatonia or the combination of catatonia and COVID-19, was associated with increased mortality. Patients with catatonia and COVID-19 were frequently diagnosed with encephalopathy and delirium codes. CONCLUSIONS: Catatonia and COVID-19 were rarely co-diagnosed in 2020, and catatonia diagnosis was not associated with increased mortality in patients with COVID-19. Further research is needed to better characterize the phenomenology of catatonia in the setting of COVID-19 infection and its optimal treatment.
