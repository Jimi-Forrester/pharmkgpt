39201616|t|A Cationic Zn-Phthalocyanine Turns Alzheimer's Amyloid beta Aggregates into Non-Toxic Oligomers and Inhibits Neurotoxicity in Culture.
39201616|a|Amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) aggregation and deposition are considered the main causes of Alzheimer's disease. In a previous study, we demonstrated that anionic Zn-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) can interact with the Abeta peptide and inhibit the fibril-formation process. However, due to the inability of anionic ZnPc to cross the intact blood-brain barrier, we decided to explore the interaction of cationic methylated Zn-phthalocyanine (cZnPc) with the peptide. Using a ThT fluorescence assay, we observed that cZnPc dose-dependently and time-dependently inhibited Abeta1-42 fibril levels under in vitro fibril-formation conditions. Electron microscopy revealed that it caused Abeta1-42 peptides to form small aggregates. Western blotting and dot immunoblot oligomer experiments demonstrated that cZnPc increased rather than decreased the levels of oligomers from the very early stages of incubation. A binding assay confirmed that cZnPc could bind with the peptide. Docking simulations indicated that the oligomer species of Abeta1-42 had a higher ability to interact with cZnPc. ANS fluorescence assay results indicated that cZnPc did not affect the hydrophobicity of the peptide. However, cZnPc significantly increased intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence of the peptide after 8 h of incubation in fibril-formation conditions. Importantly, cell culture experiments demonstrated that cZnPc did not exhibit any toxicity up to a concentration of 10 microM. Instead, it protected a neuronal cell line from Abeta1-42-induced toxicity. Thus, our results suggest that cZnPc can affect the aggregation process of Abeta1-42, rendering it non-toxic, which could be crucial for the therapy of Alzheimer's disease.
