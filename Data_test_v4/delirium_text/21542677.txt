21542677|a|Research demonstrates that people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) do have limitations in instrumental activities of daily living, social and other complex activities, but there is still a lack of knowledge on how such functional limitations are best detected and evaluated in the heterogeneous MCI population. In general, existing functional assessments lack sufficient sensitivity to detect subtle changes or differences in this population. Therefore, further development of valid, up-to-date, sensitive assessments is needed. Interestingly, activities that involve the use of everyday technology (e.g., using telephone or household equipment, managing finances and transportation) have demonstrated the best sensitivity to detect differences between people with MCI, people with early-stage dementia and controls. This article introduces the development of assessments of the ability to use everyday technology, and presents empirical material describing the procedures of developing the Short-form Everyday Technology Use Questionnaire (S-ETUQ), a screening tool that distinguishes MCI from controls and Alzheimer's disease, intended to complement other functional assessments.
