26554771|t|Correlation of GLUT9 Polymorphisms With Gout Risk.
26554771|a|Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the glucose transporter 9 (GLUT9) locus are clearly related to uric acid concentrations previously identified as a major cause of gout. Due to the important function of various SNPs, we hypothesized that the common GLUT9 polymorphisms (rs16890979, rs6855911, and rs7442295) are associated with gout risk. The purpose of this investigation was to test the hypothesis.Gout risk was estimated by calculating odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (ORs and 95% CIs). Either the fixed- or the random-effect model was used for OR calculations. Subgroup analyses were carried out by ethnicity for rs16890979 and by gender for all SNPs.We analyzed a total of 8 studies involving 2525 subjects for rs16890979, 2654 for rs6855911, and 2637 for rs7442295. A significantly declined risk was suggested in the meta-analyses of rs16890979 under dominant model (OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.34-0.58) and heterozygote model (OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.33-0.59). The OR was 0.41 under allele frequency model (OR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.33-0.53). Significantly declined risk in relation to rs16890979 was also found among Asians. Similarly decreased risk was revealed for rs7442295, both in total samples and in males. However, the meta-analysis of rs6855911 revealed no significant associations.These data seem to support the hypothesis that the risk of gout may be associated with GLUT9 rs16890979 and rs7442295.
