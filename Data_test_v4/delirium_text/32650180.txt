32650180|a|The interaction of the coordination compounds with biological molecules resulted in the investigation of the drug potential of these molecules. In this study, enzyme inhibition of DSA (1-3) coordination compounds that were previously investigated for their anticancer and antibacterial properties was investigated. Also, DSA (1-3) had Ki values of 635.30 + 152.62, 184.01 + 90.05, and 163.03 +- 60.01 microM against human carbonic anhydrase I, 352.23 +- 143.09, 46.2 +- 15.47, and 54.117 +- 18.80 microM against AChE, 310.64 +- 97.35, 35.54 +- 7.01, and 101.51 +- 15.314 microM against BChE, respectively. The biological activity values of these compounds against enzymes whose name are AChE, BChE, and hCAI were compared. Ellman and Verporte methods were used for the study of these enzymes. Cholinesterase inhibitors, also known as anti-cholinesterase and cholinesterase blocking drugs, are chemicals that prevent the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine or butyrylcholine. They may be used as drugs for Alzheimer's and myasthenia gravis. It is a common method for comparing biological activity values of nickel complexes with molecular docking calculations. Nickel complexes were studied against enzymes that are human carbonic anhydrase isozyme I for ID 2CAB (hCA I), butyrylcholinesterase for ID 1P0I (BChE), and acetylcholinesterase for ID 1EEA (AChE), respectively.
