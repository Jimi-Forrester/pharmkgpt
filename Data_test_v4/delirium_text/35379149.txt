35379149|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a sort of disarrangement in psychological, biological, or developmental mechanisms basic to mental functions. AD is generally affiliated with marked discomfort and impaired social, professional, or other crucial aspects of life. AD is predominant throughout the globe, but the disparity in prevalence is seen amongst nations. Around 3/4th of people suffering from AD are from developing countries, which seldom get the aid of 1/10th of assets of global mental health. Residents of each community and age category share their presence to the overall load of AD. AD is a multifactorial disease impacted by numerous environmental, genetic, and endogenous elements. Heteromorphic interactive downstream cascades, networks, and molecular mechanisms (inflammation and immune network, cholinergic deficit, lipid transit, endocytosis, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, amyloid and tau pathology, energy metabolism, neuron and synapse loss, and cell death) have been isolated that imparts a non-dissociative contribution in pathogenesis of AD. Cholinergic structural organization in CNS is employed in the procurement and renaissance of insight obtained at new learning. The alleviation of central cholinergic transposal following destruction in the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons precipitates a decline in neurocognitive symptoms visible in AD patients. The brain of patients suffering from AD exhibits plaques of aggregated amyloid-beta and neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Amyloid-beta triggers cholinergic loss by modulation of calcium and generation of cell-damaging molecules such as nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species intermediates. The present review focuses on the pathogenic mechanisms related to stages, diagnosis, and therapeutic approaches involved in AD.
