34574881|t|The Feasibility of Using Machine Learning to Classify Calls to South African Emergency Dispatch Centres According to Prehospital Diagnosis, by Utilising Caller Descriptions of the Incident.
34574881|a|This paper presents the application of machine learning for classifying time-critical conditions namely sepsis, myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest, based off transcriptions of emergency calls from emergency services dispatch centers in South Africa. In this study we present results from the application of four multi-class classification algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN). The application of machine learning for classifying time-critical diseases may allow for earlier identification, adequate telephonic triage, and quicker response times of the appropriate cadre of emergency care personnel. The data set consisted of an original data set of 93 examples which was further expanded through the use of data augmentation. Two feature extraction techniques were investigated namely; TF-IDF and handcrafted features. The results were further improved using hyper-parameter tuning and feature selection. In our work, within the limitations of a limited data set, classification results yielded an accuracy of up to 100% when training with 10-fold cross validation, and 95% accuracy when predicted on unseen data. The results are encouraging and show that automated diagnosis based on emergency dispatch centre transcriptions is feasible. When implemented in real time, this can have multiple utilities, e.g. enabling the call-takers to take the right action with the right priority.
