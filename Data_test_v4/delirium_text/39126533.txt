39126533|t|Comparison of postoperative pulmonary complications and intraoperative safety in thoracoscopic surgery under non-intubated versus intubated anesthesia: a randomized, controlled, double-blind non-inferiority trial.
39126533|a|PURPOSE: Traditional anesthesia for video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) such as double-lumen tracheal intubation (DLT) and one-lung ventilation (OLV), may lead to post-operative pulmonary complications (PPCs). Non-intubation VATS (NIVATS) is an anesthetic technique that avoided DLT and OLV, maybe avoiding the PPCs. So we hypothesized that NIVATS would non-inferiority to intubation VATS (IVATS) in the risk of developing PPCs and some safety indicators. METHODS: This study is a randomised, controlled, double-blind, non-inferiority trial, 120 patients were randomly assigned to the NIVATS group and IVATS group according to 1:1. The primary outcome was the incidence of PPCs with a pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 10%. The second outcome was the safety indicators, including the incidence of cough/body movement, hypoxemia, malignant arrhythmia, regurgitation and aspiration, and transferring to endobronchial intubation intraoperatively (The malignant arrhythmia was defined as an arrhythmia that caused hemodynamic disturbances in a short period of time, resulting in persistent hypotension or even cardiac arrest in the patient). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in demographic indicators such as gender and age between the two groups. The incidence of PPCs in the NIVATS group was non-inferior to that in the IVATS group (1.67% vs. 3.33%, absolute difference: - 1.67%; 95%CI - 7.25 to 3.91). In additionan, no significant differences were found between the two groups for the incidence of cough/body movement (10.00% vs. 11.67%, p = 0.77), the incidence of hypoxemia (25% vs. 18.33%, p = 0.38), the incidence of malignant arrhythmia (1.67% vs. 6.67%, p = 0.36), the incidence of regurgitation and aspiration (0% vs. 0%, p > 0.999) and the incidence of transferring to endobronchial intubation intraoperatively (0% vs. 0%, p > 0.999). CONCLUSION: We conclude that when using the non-intubation anesthesia for VATS, the incidence of PPCs was not inferior to intubation anesthesia. Furthermore, NIVATS had little effect on perioperative safety.
