35179511|t|Asynchronous Remote Assessment for Cognitive Impairment: Reliability Verification of the Neurotrack Cognitive Battery.
35179511|a|BACKGROUND: As evidenced by the further reduction in access to testing during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent, growing need for remote cognitive assessment for individuals with cognitive impairment. The Neurotrack Cognitive Battery (NCB), our response to this need, was evaluated for its temporal reliability and stability as part of ongoing validation testing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the temporal reliability of the NCB tests (5 total) across a 1-week period and to determine the temporal stability of these measures across 3 consecutive administrations in a single day. METHODS: For test-retest reliability, a range of 29-66 cognitively healthy participants (ages 18-68 years) completed each cognitive assessment twice, 1 week apart. In a separate study, temporal stability was assessed using data collected from 31 different cognitively healthy participants at 3 consecutive timepoints in a single day. RESULTS: Correlations for the assessments were between 0.72 and 0.83, exceeding the standard acceptable threshold of 0.70 for temporal reliability. Intraclass correlations ranged from 0.60 to 0.84, indicating moderate to good temporal stability. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the NCB as a brief, easy-to-administer, and reliable assessment for remote cognitive testing. Additional validation research is underway to determine the full magnitude of the clinical utility of the NCB.
