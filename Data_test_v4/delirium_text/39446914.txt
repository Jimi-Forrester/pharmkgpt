39446914|a|INTRODUCTION: Patients experience high symptom burden during critical care hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. Medications are of limited effectiveness and are associated with increased morbidity such as delirium and long-term cognitive and psychological impairments. Music-based interventions have been used for pain and anxiety management in critical care but remain understudied in terms of music selection and range of symptoms. This study aimed to describe the ways in which a diverse sample of critically ill adults used personalized music listening and their perceptions of the effects of music listening on symptom experience after critical injury. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews (N = 14) of adult patients, families and friends who were provided with personalized music in an urban, academic, neurotrauma intensive care unit were collected and analyzed with grounded theory methodology. Open coding of transcripts, field notes and memos was performed using Atlas.ti.9.1. Recruitment and data collection were deemed complete once thematic saturation was achieved. RESULTS: We identified 6 uses of personalized music listening in critical care: 1) Restoring consciousness; 2) Maintaining cognition; 3) Humanizing the hospital experience; 4) Providing a source of connection; 5) Improving psychological wellbeing; and 6) Resolving the problems of silence. Patients used music to address psychological experiences of loneliness, fear, confusion, and loss of control. Personalized music helped patients maintain their identity and process their trauma. Additional benefits of music included experiencing pleasure, hope, resilience, and feelings of normalcy. Patients disliked being sedated and used music to wake up. Findings also highlighted the problem of the lack of meaningful stimulation in critical care. CONCLUSION: Critically injured adults used personalized music to achieve psychological and cognitive homeostasis during critical care hospitalization. These results can inform future studies designed to explore the use of music-based interventions to prevent and treat the cognitive and emotional morbidity of critical care.
