39856526|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the application effectiveness of multidisciplinary team (MDT) in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic refractory wounds, and to provide new ideas for optimizing the clinical diagnosis and treatment of such diseases. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of patients with chronic refractory wounds who underwent surgery at Peking University Third Hospital from January 2015 to October 2023, and a total of 456 patients, including 290 males and 166 females, with an average age of (49.4+-16.9) years. According to whether preoperative MDT discussion was conducted, the patients were divided into MDT discussion group and non-MDT discussion group. The overall implementation process of MDT included: Starting and recording with the medical office, collecting data and discussing the initial MDT, informing the patient of the treatment plan and strictly implementing it, and the change of the condition needs to be discussed again by MDT. The general clinical data, anesthesia risk grade, complications (hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease), and the etiology and location of chronic refractory wounds between the two groups were compared. The main observational measurements and outcome indicators of treatment effectiveness included the number of surgeries required to achieve wound healing after admission, the recurrence rate after wound healing, the incidence of perioperative complications (pulmonary infection, severe cardiovascular event, vein thrombus embo-lism, cerebral stroke and delirium, etc.), and patient satisfaction score. RESULTS: There were 189 patients in the MDT discussion group and 267 patients in the non-MDT discussion group. There was no significant statistical difference in the clinical data, such as age, gender, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists, comorbidities, etiology, and location of chronic refractory wounds between the two groups (P>0.05). The average number of surgeries required for wound healing in MDT discussion group and non-MDT discussion group was 2.1+-1.1 and 2.8+-1.6, respectively, with a statistically significant difference (P < 0.001). This difference was also significant in chronic refractory wounds caused by three etiologies: Diabetic ulcer, infection after trauma or surgery, and non-union after radiotherapy (P < 0.05). The recurrence rate of the patients in the non-MDT discussion group after wound healing was 18.0%, slightly higher than that in the MDT discussion group of 14.3% (P>0.05). In terms of perioperative complications, the non-MDT discussion group also had a higher incidence (3.7% vs. 2.6%), but the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). In terms of patient satisfaction, the MDT discussion group scored significantly higher (96.5 vs. 91.1, P=0.028). CONCLUSION: The MDT mode can significantly reduce the number of surgeries for patients with chronic refractory wounds, improve the effectiveness of therapy and increase patient satisfaction. It is a recommended model for optimizing the clinical diagnosis and treatment effectiveness of chronic refractory wounds.
