33786219|t|Autoscopic Hallucinations in an African American Female Patient With Schizophrenia.
33786219|a|Autoscopic hallucinations are rare phenomena, with a handful of cases reported in patients with comorbidities and only one in a patient with schizophrenia. This case report discusses a 25-year-old African American female with schizophrenia and auditory hallucinations who presented with autoscopic hallucinations. The patient was interviewed on three separate occasions, her medical chart was consulted, a head computed tomography (CT) was performed, and her serum and urine laboratory values were monitored. Her head CT was normal, and her laboratory values were unremarkable. This case report contributes to the literature on autoscopic hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia.
