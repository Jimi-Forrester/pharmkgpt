32154990|t|Isolation, Characterization, and Possible Anti-Alzheimer's Disease Activities of Bisabolane-Type Sesquiterpenoid Derivatives and Phenolics from the Rhizomes of Curcuma longa.
32154990|a|One new bisabolane-type sesquiterpenoid, together with four known bisabolane-type sesquiterpenoid derivatives and seven phenolics, was isolated from the rhizomes of Curcuma longa. Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic (IR, HR-ESI-MS, and NMR) data analysis. The possible anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) activities of the isolated compounds were also evaluated using Caenorhabditis elegans AD pathological model, and 1beta-hydroxybisabola-2,10-dien-4-one had the highest possible anti-AD activity.
