35660461|a|Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is vital to reduce the burden of dementia and for developing effective treatments. Neuroimaging can detect early brain changes, such as hippocampal atrophy in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a prodromal state of AD. However, selecting the most informative imaging features by machine-learning requires many cases. While large publically-available datasets of people with dementia or prodromal disease exist for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), comparable datasets are missing for Magnetoencephalography (MEG). MEG offers advantages in its millisecond resolution, revealing physiological changes in brain oscillations or connectivity before structural changes are evident with MRI. We introduce a MEG dataset with 324 individuals: patients with MCI and healthy controls. Their brain activity was recorded while resting with eyes closed, using a 306-channel MEG scanner at one of two sites (Madrid or Cambridge), enabling tests of generalization across sites. A T1-weighted MRI is provided to assist source localisation. The MEG and MRI data are formatted according to international BIDS standards and analysed freely on the DPUK platform (https://portal.dementiasplatform.uk/Apply). Here, we describe this dataset in detail, report some example (benchmark) analyses, and consider its limitations and future directions.
