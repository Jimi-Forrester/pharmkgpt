37525779|t|Erector Spinae Plane Block as the Phrenic Nerve Sparing Anaesthetic Technique for Shoulder Arthroplasty.
37525779|a|The utilization of the brachial plexus block has become commonplace in shoulder replacement surgery and the management of postoperative pain. Nonetheless, this technique carries risks, including the occurrence of phrenic nerve palsy and subsequent postoperative dyspnea. In light of these concerns, the erector spinae plane block emerges as a safe, simple, and effective alternative for shoulder surgery with reduced risk of phrenic nerve palsy and potential motor sparing in the affected limb. This research endeavors to elucidate the analgesic application of erector spinae plane block (ESPB) through the presentation and analysis of two cases involving reverse shoulder arthroplasty.
