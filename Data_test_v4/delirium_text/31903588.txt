31903588|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is common in elderly patients after surgery and is associated with poor outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the impact of intraoperative dexmedetomidine on the incidence of delirium in elderly patients undergoing major surgery. METHODS: This was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Elderly patients (aged 60 years or more) scheduled to undergo major non-cardiac surgery were randomized into two groups. Patients in the intervention group received a loading dose of dexmedetomidine 0 6 mug/kg 10 min before induction of anaesthesia followed by a continuous infusion (0 5 mug per kg per h) until 1 h before the end of surgery. Patients in the control group received volume-matched normal saline in the same schedule. The primary outcome was the incidence of delirium during the first 5 days after surgery. Delirium was assessed with the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) for non-ventilated patients and CAM for the Intensive Care Unit for ventilated patients. RESULTS: In total, 309 patients who received dexmedetomidine and 310 control patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The incidence of delirium within 5 days of surgery was lower with dexmedetomidine treatment: 5 5 per cent (17 of 309) versus 10 3 per cent (32 of 310) in the control group (relative risk (RR) 0 53, 95 per cent c.i. 0 30 to 0 94; P = 0 026). The overall incidence of complications at 30 days was also lower after dexmedetomidine (19 4 per cent (60 of 309) versus 26 1 per cent (81 of 310) for controls; RR 0 74, 0 55 to 0 99, P = 0 047). CONCLUSION: Intraoperative dexmedetomidine halved the risk of delirium in the elderly after major non-cardiac surgery. Registration number: ChiCTR-IPR-15007654 ( www.chictr.org.cn).
