32056753|a|BACKGROUND: Magnetic Seizure therapy (MST) is an emerging treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) that is associated with fewer cognitive side effects compared to electroconvulsive therapy. The present pilot study sought to investigate whether daily MST treatments were associated to antidepressant effect and assess cognitive side effects associated with an accelerated MST (aMST) treatment schedule. METHODS: Fifteen MDD patients underwent a six-day course of MST treatment to the vertex following assessment of symptom severity and neuropsychological testing. The primary outcome was severity on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression 17-item (HRSD-17). Patient also underwent neuropsychological assessment with the RBANS and Stroop Colour-Word test. RESULTS: There were no instances of delirium or disturbance of consciousness following aMST sessions. Patients showed significant decreases on indices of depression and anxiety symptoms, with 9 (60%) patients showing a clinical response and 7 (47%) patients experiencing remission. Significant improvements were reported in RBANS total score, as well as indices of immediate memory and delayed memory. No changes at follow-up were reported for visuospatial/constructional, language, and attention RBANS indices, nor for Stroop Colour/Word performance. LIMITATIONS: The results should be interpreted with caution as they are part of a non-randomized, open-label pilot study. Further, the short duration of the study does not provide longitudinal follow-up to determine whether treatment response lasts a meaningful duration of time. CONCLUSIONS: aMST well tolerated without significant evidence of cognitive side effects and rapid improvement in symptoms. Further research is required to fully characterize these changes and replicate them in independent samples.
