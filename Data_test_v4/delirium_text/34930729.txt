34930729|t|Prospective, observational, single-centre cohort study with an independent control group matched for age and sex aimed at investigating the significance of cholinergic activity in patients with schizophrenia: study protocol of the CLASH-study.
34930729|a|INTRODUCTION: Alterations in the cholinergic metabolism may cause various clinical symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition to the 'monoamine hypothesis,' neuroinflammation is also discussed as a cause of schizophrenia. To date, there has been no evidence of alterations in the central cholinergic transmitter balance in patients with schizophrenia under clinical conditions. By contrast, studies in critically ill patients have established the measurement of acetylcholinesterase activity as a suitable surrogate parameter of central cholinergic transmitter balance/possible pathophysiological changes. Butyrylcholinesterase activity has been established as a parameter indicating possible (neuro)inflammatory processes. Both parameters can now be measured using a point-of-care approach. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to investigate whether acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activity differs in patients with various forms of schizophrenia. Secondary objectives address the possible association between acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activity and (1) schizophrenic symptoms using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, (2) the quantity of antipsychotics taken and (3) the duration of illness. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is designed as a prospective, observational cohort study with one independent control group. It is being carried out at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy III, Ulm University Hospital, Germany. Patient enrolment started in October 2020, and the anticipated end of the study is in January 2022. The enrolment period was set from October 2020 to December 2021 (extension required due to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic). The sample size is calculated at 50 patients in each group. Esterase activity is measured on hospital admission (acute symptomatology) and after referral to a postacute ward over a period of three consecutive days. The matched control group will be created after reaching 50 patients with schizophrenia. This will be followed by a comprehensive statistical analysis of the data set. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was registered prospectively in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS-ID: DRKS00023143,URL: https://www.drks.de/drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00023143) after approval by the ethics committee of the University of Ulm, Germany Trial Code No. 280/20. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: DRKS00023143; Pre-results.
