25130558|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common and devastating neurodegenerative disease. The etiology of AD has yet to be fully understood, and common treatments remain largely non-efficacious. The amyloid hypothesis posits that extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits are the fundamental etiological factor of the disease. The present study tested the organoselenium compound diphenyl-diselenide (PhSe)2, which is characterized by its antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties and has shown efficacy in several neurodegenerative disease models. We employed a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans AD model to analyze the effects of (PhSe)2 treatment on Abeta peptide-induced toxicity. Chronic exposure to (PhSe)2 attenuated oxidative stress induced by Abeta1-42, with concomitant recovery of associative learning memory in C. elegans. Additionally, (PhSe)2 decreased Abeta1-42 transgene expression, suppressed Abeta1-42 peptide, and downregulated hsp-16.2 by reducing the need for this chaperone under Abeta1-42-induced toxicity. These observations suggest that (PhSe)2 plays an important role in protecting against oxidative stress-induced toxicity, thus representing a promising pharmaceutical modality that attenuates Abeta1-42 expression.
