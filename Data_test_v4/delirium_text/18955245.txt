18955245|a|We observed the effect of modified Wendan decoction (modified Wen-Dan-Tang) on a cellular model of Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid beta (Abeta) 25-35 segment neurotoxin was employed to induce a PC12 cellular model of Alzheimer's disease. After modified Wendan decoction was fed to rats, the serum containing medicine was prepared and changes in cell morphology observed. Cell mortality and survival rate was examined by trypan blue stain assay and MTT method and caspase-3 expression was detected by western blot, while cell apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. Cell morphology of prepared serum group was better than that of controls, and cell survival rate in prepared serum group was higher than that in control (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). Cell mortality, caspase-3 expression and apoptosis rate in prepared serum group were lower than that in control (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). We conclude that Modified Wendan Decoction can attenuate the neurotoxicity of Abeta 25-35 and rescue neurons via suppressing apoptotic process.
