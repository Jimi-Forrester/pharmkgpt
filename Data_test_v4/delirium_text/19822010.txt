19822010|t|Prevention of complications in neck dissection.
19822010|a|BACKGROUND: The neck dissection has remained a pivotal aspect of head and neck cancer management for over a century. During this time its role has expanded from a purely therapeutic option into an elective setting, in part promoted by efforts to reduce its morbidity. OBJECTIVES: This review will consider the potential complications of neck dissection and on the basis of the available evidence describe both their management and prevention. CONCLUSION: Although the neck dissection continues to provide clinicians with a method of addressing cervical disease, its reliability and safety can only be assured if surgeons remain cognisant of the potential complications and aim to minimise such morbidity by appropriate management in the peri-operative period.
