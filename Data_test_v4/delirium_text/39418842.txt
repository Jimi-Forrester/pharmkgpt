39418842|a|OBJECTIVE: Unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) following open thoracic aortic surgery increases pulmonary complications and hospital stays. An intervention protocol with early injection laryngoplasty (IL) and swallowing maneuvers was developed for acute UVFP following thoracic aortic surgery. This study aimed to compare the incidence of complications and length of medical care between the non-VFP and the IL-UVFP group managed under this protocol. METHODS: Patients who underwent open thoracic aortic surgery from March 2020 to February 2023 were included, excluding those with preoperative VFP or postoperative bilateral VFP. Under the protocol, patients with UVFP and incomplete glottic closure received IL and swallowing maneuvers within one week after diagnosis, while those without a glottic gap started a soft diet along with swallowing maneuvers. Postoperative complications, including reintubation, ICU re-transfer, pneumonia, stroke, delirium, wound infection, and bleeding, as well as hospital and ICU stay, were assessed. RESULTS: Of the 355 patients included in the study, 51 (14.4%) developed postoperative UVFP, while 304 (85.6%) had normal VF function. In the UVFP group, 42 patients underwent IL, while 9 patients without a glottic gap did not undergo IL. The incidence of complications and length of medical care were analyzed in the non-VFP and the IL-UVFP groups. The IL-UVFP group had a longer median hospital stay compared to the non-VFP group (20.5 vs. 16.0 days), though this difference was not statistically significant (P = .0681). ICU stay (P = .5396) and ICU re-transfer rates (P = 1.00) were also comparable between the groups. There was no significant difference in the incidence of pneumonia between the IL-UVFP group (4.8%) and the non-VFP group (9.5%) (P = .4003). Additionally, no significant differences were observed in the incidence of stroke, delirium, wound infection, or bleeding between the groups. No IL-related complications were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The protocol with early IL appears to help reduce complication rates in acute UVFP patients following thoracic aortic surgery to levels comparable to those in patients without VFP. This protocol could serve as a guideline for otolaryngologists in managing UVFP patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2b/Individual cohort study.
