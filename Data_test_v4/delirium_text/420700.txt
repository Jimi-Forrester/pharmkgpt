420700|t|The teaching of liaison psychiatry in the hemodialysis center.
420700|a|The hemodialysis unit is usually a uniquely desirable place for liaison teaching because of the importance and variety of behavioral problems seen there. The trainee may be educated at these units about the syndrome of delirium because of the potential for his seeing in a given patient the presentation and resolution of the syndrome before and after each run. Because of the abject dependency of these patients, issues surrounding patient dependency "needs" and frustration of their independence are common with patient "uncooperativeness", an important area in which the professional staff need education and patients need intervention. Depression, common among these patients because of their many losses, is among the host of psychological problems to be potentially diagnosed and treated by the liaison trainee and/or teacher. The theme of life setting conductive to medical illness and the setting of realistic rehabiliation goals are also important areas of liaison training, particularly suitable for demonstration there. Therefore, hemodialysis centers offer usual wide variety and often untapped resources for liaison education.
