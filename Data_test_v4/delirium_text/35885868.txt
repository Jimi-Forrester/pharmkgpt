35885868|t|Trends and Geographic Variabilities in Benzodiazepines Prescription in Primary Care to Older Adults: A 3-Year Population-Based Ecological Study in Portugal.
35885868|a|(1) Background: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), benzodiazepines (BZD) are considered essential medicines for the treatment of several mental disorders in older adults over 65 years old. However, the long-term use of BZD could present a harmful impact on this population, leading to cognitive deficits, drug dependence, falls, and fractures. This study aims to analyze trends of BZD prescription to Portuguese older adults in the primary care setting, and to analyze the change in the prescription rate of BZD over time, assessing the geographical variability in mainland Portugal. (2) Methods: A nationwide, retrospective ecological study was performed between January 2019 and December 2021 for BZD prescribing data reported in a national public database for all persons aged 65 and older in mainland Portugal (about 2.4 million). Trends of BZD by defined daily doses (DDD) and per 1000 older adults' inhabitants per day (DID) were analyzed. (3) Results: A total of 19 BZD were included in this study and more than 1 million BZD prescriptions were recorded in each year of this study period. BZD prescriptions were three times higher in females than in males. Alprazolam, lorazepam, diazepam, ethyl loflazepate, and bromazepam were the most prescribed BZD over the years, presenting the higher DDD and DID values. (4) Conclusions: Despite the DID value growth of several BZD, Portugal is now showing stable BZD prescriptions in older adults, between the years 2019 to 2021. More studies are needed to access if these results are a consequence of successful health programs or just a consequence of the pandemic context that we are facing, which limited older adults' clinical appointments.
