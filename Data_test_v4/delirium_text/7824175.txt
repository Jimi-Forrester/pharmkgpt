7824175|t|Demonstration of CRP immunoreactivity in brains of Alzheimer's disease: immunohistochemical study using formic acid pretreatment of tissue sections.
7824175|a|C-reactive protein (CRP) is a well-known serum protein which increases during inflammation and deposits in damaged tissues. To establish whether CRP appears in brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we immunohistochemically investigated tissue sections which were pretreated with formic acid. Positive immunostaining by anti-CRP antibodies was clearly recognized in senile plaques (SP) in the pretreated tissue sections, with very weak immunostaining in non-treated sections. These findings may suggest that the formation process of SP includes an acute-phase inflammatory state.
