37895298|t|Identification of Intron Retention in the Slc16a3 Gene Transcript Encoding the Transporter MCT4 in the Brain of Aged and Alzheimer-Disease Model (APPswePS1dE9) Mice.
37895298|a|The monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4; Slc16a3) is expressed in the central nervous system, notably by astrocytes. It is implicated in lactate release and the regulation of glycolytic flux. Whether its expression varies during normal and/or pathological aging is unclear. As the presence of its mature transcript in the brain of young and old mice was determined, an unexpectedly longer RT-PCR fragment was detected in the mouse frontal cortex and hippocampus at 12 vs. 3 months of age. Cultured astrocytes expressed the expected 516 base pair (bp) fragment but treatment with IL-1beta to mimic inflammation as can occur during aging led to the additional expression of a 928 bp fragment like that seen in aged mice. In contrast, cultured pericytes (a component of the blood-brain barrier) only exhibited the 516 bp fragment. Intriguingly, cultured endothelial cells constitutively expressed both fragments. When RT-PCR was performed on brain subregions of an Alzheimer mouse model (APPswePS1dE9), no fragment was detected at 3 months, while only the 928 bp fragment was present at 12 months. Sequencing of MCT4 RT-PCR products revealed the presence of a remaining intron between exon 2 and 3, giving rise to the longer fragment detected by RT-PCR. These results unravel the existence of intron retention for the MCT4 gene in the central nervous system. Such alternative splicing appears to increase with age in the brain and might be prominent in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Hence, further studies in vitro and in vivo of intron 2 retention in the Slc16a3 gene transcript are required for adequate characterization concerning the biological roles of Slc16a3 isoforms in the context of aging and Alzheimer's disease pathology.
