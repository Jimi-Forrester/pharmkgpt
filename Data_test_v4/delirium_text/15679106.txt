15679106|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) was initially detected in cells of the central nervous system where it is considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. However, APP is also found in peripheral organs with exceptionally strong expression in the mammalian epidermis where it fulfils a variety of distinct biological roles. Full length APP appears to facilitate keratinocyte adhesion due to its ability to interact with the extracellular matrix. The C-terminus of APP also serves as adapter protein for binding the motor protein kinesin thereby mediating the centripetal transport of melanosomes in epidermal melanocytes. By the action of alpha-secretase sAPPalpha, the soluble N-terminal portion of APP, is released. sAPPalpha has been shown to be a potent epidermal growth factor thus stimulating proliferation and migration of keratinocytes as well as the exocytic release of melanin by melanocytes. The release of sAPPalpha can be almost completely blocked by inhibiting alpha-secretase with hydroxamic acid-based zinc metalloproteinase inhibitors. In hyperproliferative keratinocytes from psoriatic skin this inhibition results in normalized growth.
