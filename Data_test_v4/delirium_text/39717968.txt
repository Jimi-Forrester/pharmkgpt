39717968|t|"A patent review on arachidonic acid lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitors for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (2018-present)".
39717968|a|INTRODUCTION: Neuroinflammation is correlated to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Huntington Disease (HD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). A lot of recent research and patents are focused on the design and synthesis of arachidonic acid Lipoxygenase (ALOX) inhibitors for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. AREAS COVERED: The survey covers natural products, synthesis, hybrids, and assessments of biological effects in biological studies as ALOX inhibitors. A survey of patent publications from 2018 to present, taken from Google Scholar, Espanet, Web of Science, Drugbank, Scopus, or PubMed is analyzed. EXPERT OPINION: The authors suggest that (i) numerous areas of biology-pharmacology need to be considered: selectivity, in vivo studies, toxicity, bioavailability and drug-likeness, the mechanism of action in different animals and humans, evaluation of more efficient and selective biological tests; (ii) synthetic methods outbalance in the discovery and production of ALOX inhibitors with greater selectivity. Several ALOX inhibitors show promising results for the treatment of neurological disorders. Their clinical evaluation will be critical to assess therapeutic utility. The compounds for which the mechanism of action and their bioavailability are well defined can be used as lead compounds for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
