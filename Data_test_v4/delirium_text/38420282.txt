38420282|a|Objective: Patients with leukemia suffer from significant psychological, spiritual, and social symptoms. Therefore, the current research aimed to study the impact of spiritual end-of-life support on the quality of life for leukemia patients. Method : To this end, the present quasi-experimental research with a pre-test and post-test design was performed. The sample included 60 cancer patients randomly assigned to intervention and control groups through the method of permutation block. The experimental group received spiritual support intervention for eight sessions of 60 minutes, while the control group received no intervention. Patients filled out the questionnaire of World Health Organization Quality of Life. The World Health Organization conducts a three-phase assessment to measure the quality of life. These phases include a pre-test, which is conducted before any intervention takes place. Then comes the post-test, which occurs after the intervention. Finally, there is a follow-up assessment conducted two months after the post-test. The obtained results were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis and independent samples t-test using SPSS software. Results: The findings from the repeated measures analysis revealed that there was a statistically significant interaction between time and group (P = 0.01). In other words, being compared to the control group, the spiritual support significantly increased the life quality of the patients in the experimental group. The experimental group witnessed a sustained enhancement in the quality of life for a period of two months following the intervention (follow-up, P = 0.01). Conclusion: Ultimately, the provision of spiritual support has the potential to enhance the overall well-being of individuals approaching the end of their lives, offering solace and aiding them in comprehending the true essence and purpose of their existence.
