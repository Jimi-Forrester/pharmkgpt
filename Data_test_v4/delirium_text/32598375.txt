32598375|a|BACKGROUND: The optimum risk score determining perioperative mortality and morbidity in cardiac surgery remains debated. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) derived from glycaemic and oxidative stress accumulate to a comparable amount in skin and the cardiovascular system leading to a decline in organ function. We aimed to study the association between AGE accumulation measured as skin autofluorescence (sAF) and the outcome of cardiac surgery patients. METHODS: Between April 2008 and November 2016, data from 758 consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, aortic valve replacement or a combined procedure were analyzed. Skin autofluorescence was measured using an autofluorescence reader. Beside mortality, for the combined categorical morbidity outcome of each patient failure of the cardiac-, pulmonary-, renal- and cerebral system, as well as reoperation and wound healing disorders were counted. Patients without or with only one of the outcomes were assigned zero points whereas more than one outcome failure resulted in one point. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated in multivariable logistic regression analysis with other preoperative parameters and the established cardiac surgery risk score systems EuroSCORE II and STS score. RESULTS: Skin autofluorescence as non-invasive marker of tissue glycation provided the best prognostic value in identifying patients with major morbidity risks after cardiac surgery (OR = 3.13; 95%CI 2.16-4.54). With respect to mortality prediction the STS score (OR = 1.24; 95%CI 1.03-1.5) was superior compared to the EuroSCORE II (OR = 1.17: 95%CI 0.96-1.43), but not superior when compared to sAF (OR = 6.04; 95%CI 2.44-14.95). CONCLUSION: This finding suggests that skin autofluorescence is a good biomarker candidate to assess the perioperative risk of patients in cardiac surgery. Since the EuroSCORE does not contain a morbidity component, in our view further sAF measurement is an option.
