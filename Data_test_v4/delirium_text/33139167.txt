33139167|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate high-priority training needs by analysing the perceived importance and self-reported performance of nurses' delirium care competency. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey with a convenience sample of 255 Korean intensive care units nurses. SETTING: Intensive care units in the Republic of Korea. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intensive care unit nurses' delirium care competency. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis of the Nurse Delirium Care Competency Scale showed a six-factor structure, which accounted for 67.51% of the variance in nurses' delirium care competency: management algorithm, prevention, communication, nursing management, assessment, and collaboration. The self-reported performance scores of all six factors were significantly lower than their perceived importance scores. The delirium assessment factor was identified as a high training priority on the importance-performance matrix for new graduate nurses. CONCLUSION: Training programmes should be developed considering the six delirium care competency factors identified in this study. Further, nurse educators must adopt active educational modalities such as case-based small group learning and simulation-based learning to improve nurse competency in recognising and managing delirium.
