34225517|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Sleep disturbances are a severe problem among patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). By evaluating sleep quality in mild-to-moderate AD patients, this study aimed to assess the effects of multi-disciplinary team (MDT) in reducing the incidence of adverse reactions of AD patients. The reduction in the incidence of adverse reactions to predict multi-disciplinary team (MDT) treatment effects. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 60 mild-to-moderate AD patients with sleep problems when hospitalized in Huzhou Third Municipal Hospital. The patients were randomly distributed into two groups, routine and MDT treatments. The cognitive functions, sleep conditions, and psycho-behavioral symptoms were compared between both the groups. Cognitive function declined significantly between pretherapy and follow-up in the routine treatment group (MMSE: t = -7.961, P < 0.001; MoCA: t = -4.672, P < 0.001). There was a significant decline in drowsiness in the MDT group compared to that in the routine treatment group (chi2 = 4.320, P = 0.038). Sleep quality improved significantly during the follow-up in the MDT treatment group (t = 6.098, P < 0.001). The results of the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) among family caregivers (FCGs) demonstrated that MDT treatment could alleviate caregivers' depression (t = -2.867, P = 0.042), and routine treatment can worsen their anxiety (t = 3.258, P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The MDT treatment method as an effective and meaningful therapy can help mitigate the suffering of patients with AD and FCGs.
