2141386|a|In a controlled retrospective study of 27 Down patients the occurrence of the neuropathological signs of Alzheimer's disease was investigated. The patients were divided into two groups: group I with neuropathologically proven Alzheimer and group II without Alzheimer's disease. All patients of group I had been older than 54 years at death, while all patients of group II were younger. All patients of group I suffered from severe dementia, none of group II did. The early clinical symptoms, changes in social competence and EEG alterations were combined in a dementia detection method suitable for mentally deficient patients.
