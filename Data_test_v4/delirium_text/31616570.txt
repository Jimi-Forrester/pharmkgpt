31616570|t|The ethics of psychedelic research in disorders of consciousness.
31616570|a|This article provides an ethical analysis of psychedelic research involving disorders of consciousness patients. We apply two internationally accepted approaches for analyzing the ethics of human research, the Value-Validity Framework and Component Analysis, to a research program recently proposed by Scott and Carhart-Harris. We focus on Scott and Carhart-Harris's proposal, but the ethical frameworks outlined are applicable to other novel research protocols in the science of consciousness.
