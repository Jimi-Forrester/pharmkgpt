36404026|t|Treatment of Vascular and Neurodegenerative Forms of Cognitive Impairment and Dementias.
36404026|a|Ideally, dementia care should be provided by a collaborative team. Eligible patients should be treated with the cognitive-enhancing medications, the cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. For most of the common causes of dementia, there are no disease-modifying medications, with the exception that vascular dementia can be prevented by treating vascular risk factors to prevent stroke. There is hope that Alzheimer disease can be treated by using monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid beta, although more trials are needed. Holistic, patient-centered care can enhance quality and extend the time that the patient can live safely in the community.
