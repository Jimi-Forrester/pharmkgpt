37070734|a|INTRODUCTION: It remains unclear whether functional brain networks are consistently altered in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds and whether the network alterations are associated with an amyloid burden. METHODS: Cross-sectional resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity (FC) and amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET) data from the Chinese Sino Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Decline and German DZNE Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia cohorts were analyzed. RESULTS: Limbic FC, particularly hippocampal connectivity with right insula, was consistently higher in SCD than in controls, and correlated with SCD-plus features. Smaller SCD subcohorts with PET showed inconsistent amyloid positivity rates and FC-amyloid associations across cohorts. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest an early adaptation of the limbic network in SCD, which may reflect increased awareness of cognitive decline, irrespective of amyloid pathology. Different amyloid positivity rates may indicate a heterogeneous underlying etiology in Eastern and Western SCD cohorts when applying current research criteria. Future studies should identify culture-specific features to enrich preclinical Alzheimer's disease in non-Western populations. HIGHLIGHTS: Common limbic hyperconnectivity across Chinese and German subjective cognitive decline (SCD) cohorts was observed. Limbic hyperconnectivity may reflect awareness of cognition, irrespective of amyloid load. Further cross-cultural harmonization of SCD regarding Alzheimer's disease pathology is required.
