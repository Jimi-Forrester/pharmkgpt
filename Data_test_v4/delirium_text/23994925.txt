23994925|a|Recent studies support a role of the vascular factor in the development of not only cerebrovascular disease but also Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mechanisms of vascular risk factors involved in the pathogenesis of AD remain poorly studied so far. In a number of studies on the evaluation of the efficacy of antihypertensive drugs, statins, aspirin in patients with already developed AD, neuroprotective effect was not shown. Nevertheless, there is evidence that hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, hyperlipidemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, obesity, atherosclerosis, atrial fibrillation, smoking play a role in the pathogenesis of AD. It is important to study the role of these factors in the pathogenesis of AD since the timed modification of vascular factors in the middle age can reduce the risk of AD and offers new perspectives for its prevention.
