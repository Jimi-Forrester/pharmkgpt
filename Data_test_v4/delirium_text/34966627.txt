34966627|t|Utilization of Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteome Analysis in the Diagnosis of Meningioma: A Systematic Review.
34966627|a|Meningiomas have been classified as the most commonly occurring primary brain tumors. Although the majority of meningiomas are benign and slow-progressing, the tumors that grow to a larger size are associated with various risks during surgical procedures. Early detection of meningiomas is crucial to the treatment as those detected early can be treated through non-invasive methods. Due to their benign nature, meningiomas contain homogeneous protein biomarkers that can be easily identified. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has a high protein composition which can be used to diagnose various brain tumors. Because CSF comes into direct contact with the brain during its functioning, it is one of the factors that makes it an important source of different biomarkers. An analysis of biochemical changes occurring in the CSF can be useful in assessing the condition of the periventricular white matter and the parenchyma. In this review, PubMed, Medline, PubMed Central, and Google Scholar were used to identify studies discussing meningiomas regarding their assessment, types, diagnosis, and treatment, with more attention directed towards the application of CSF proteome analysis in diagnosis. Priority was given to studies published within the last 15 years. The following keywords were used in the literature search: "cerebrospinal fluid," "meningiomas," "brain tumors," "primary brain tumors," "protein biomarkers," "proteome analysis," and "diagnosis." Subsequently, the 15 most relevant studies were selected for inclusion in the review. We excluded studies discussing different types of non-brain tumors as well as older articles. The selected studies also underwent a quality appraisal process using corresponding assessment tools. The selected articles were highly informative about meningiomas and the processes of diagnosis and treatment that are currently in use as well as those that are being developed or implemented. The use of CSF proteins in the diagnostic process is also discussed in this review. The studies also describe proteomics as a less invasive procedure that allows for the analysis of entire proteins and the projection of diagnostic images with higher resolutions that aid in the diagnosis.
