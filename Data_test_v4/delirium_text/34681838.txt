34681838|a|Platelets play a significant role in atherothrombosis. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is critically involved in the regulation of LDL metabolism and interacts with platelet function. The effect of PCSK9 in platelet function is poorly understood. The authors of this article sought to characterize platelets as a major source of PCSK9 and PCSK9's role in atherothrombosis. In a large cohort of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), platelet count, platelet reactivity, and platelet-derived PCSK9 release were analyzed. The role of platelet PCSK9 on platelet and monocyte function was investigated in vitro. Platelet count and hyper-reactivity correlated with plasma LDL in CAD. The circulating platelets express on their surface and release substantial amounts of PCSK9. Release of PCSK9 augmented platelet-dependent thrombosis, monocyte migration, and differentiation into macrophages/foam cells. Platelets and PCSK9 accumulated in tissue derived from atherosclerotic carotid arteries in areas of macrophages. PCSK9 inhibition reduced platelet activation and platelet-dependent thrombo-inflammation. The authors identified platelets as a source of PCSK9 in CAD, which may have an impact on LDL metabolism. Furthermore, platelet-derived PCSK9 contributes to atherothrombosis, and inhibition of PCSK9 attenuates thrombo-inflammation, which may contribute to the reported beneficial clinical effects.
