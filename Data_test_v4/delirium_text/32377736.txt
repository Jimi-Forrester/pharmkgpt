32377736|a|Most tumors of the digestive system, including esophageal, gastric, liver and colorectal cancer, are malignant tumors that are associated with rates of high morbidity and mortality. The lack of effective methods for early diagnosis is an important cause of poor prognosis for these malignancies. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) belong to a family of endogenous, covalently closed non-coding RNAs that are characterized as having no 5' cap structures or 3' poly-A tails. Shortly following discovery, circRNAs were considered to be a product of mis-splicing and have no significant biological function. However, in recent years, accumulating evidence is demonstrating that they serve key roles in tumorigenesis and have the potential to serve as diagnostic markers. The present article summarizes the biogenesis and function of circRNAs and reviews their role in seven common types of tumor of the digestive system whilst exploring their potential as tumor markers and the significant roles they can serve in the digestive system, in addition to providing a referencing point for future studies of digestive system malignancies.
