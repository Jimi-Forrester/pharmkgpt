METHODS: Totally, 700 cases and 4,027 controls were genotyped in the discovery stage using Illumina Human660W-Quad BeadChips. Top associated single nucleotide polymorphisms from the discovery stage were then genotyped in an independent cohort with 884 cases and 5,329 controls. Combined analysis was conducted by combining all samples from the 2 stages. RESULTS: Two novel loci, 1p31 and 12p11, showed strong associations with ALS. These novel loci explained 2.2% of overall variance in disease risk. Expression quantitative trait loci searches identified TYW/CRYZ and FGD4 as risk genes at 1p13 and 12p11, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies novel susceptibility genes for ALS. Identification of TYW3/CRYZ in the current study supports the notion that insulin resistance may be involved in ALS pathogenesis, whereas FGD4 suggests an association with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.
