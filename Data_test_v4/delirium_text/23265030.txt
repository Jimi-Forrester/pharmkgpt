23265030|a|UNLABELLED: This prospective, randomized, double control study was carried out in 84 children aged 2-24 months posted for elective cleft lip surgery. METHODS: Patients were randomally divided into 2 groups of 42 patients each. In Group A patients were induced and maintained on sevoflurane while in Group B patients were induced with sevoflurane and maintained on isoflurane. Standardized anesthesia technique was used. Recovery milestones and post operative complications were recorded. RESULTS: Incidence of emergence delirium in sevoflurane group was 11.9% while in isoflurane group is 2.38%. The overall incidence of emergence delirium in the study was 7.14%. There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the incidence of emergence delirium between the two groups. There was no effect of duration of exposure of sevoflurane and time taken for achievement of recovery milestones while we observed a positive correlation with isoflurane. In sevoflurane the recovery endpoint first reached was limb movement > spontaneous respiration > spontaneous eye opening. In isoflurane group the recovery end point first reached was spontaneous respiration > limb movement = spontaneous eye opening. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that the recovery profile of sevoflurane in children less the two years is superior compared to isoflurane.
