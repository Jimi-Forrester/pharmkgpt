26810783|t|An Overview of Genome-Wide Association Studies in Alzheimer's Disease.
26810783|a|Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed a plethora of putative susceptibility genes for Alzheimer's disease (AD). With the sole exception of the APOE gene, these AD susceptibility genes have not been unequivocally validated in independent studies. No single novel functional risk genetic variant has been identified. In this review, we evaluate recent GWASs of AD, and discuss their significance, limitations, and challenges in the investigation of the genetic spectrum of AD.
