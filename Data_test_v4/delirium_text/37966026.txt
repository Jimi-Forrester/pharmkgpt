37966026|t|A retrospective analysis of complications associated with postpartum hemorrhage up to 1 year postpartum in mothers with and without a pre-existing mental health diagnosis.
37966026|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: There is limited research on the associated immediate and long-term outcomes of postpartum hemorrhage. Mothers with a pre-existing psychiatric disease prior to delivery may be especially vulnerable to postpartum hemorrhage outcomes but little is known on this topic. Barriers to studying this population exist and add to knowledge gaps. The goal of this study is to determine the clinical characteristics and frequency of complications within 1 year of a postpartum hemorrhage diagnosis and the psychiatric sequelae within 7 days of a postpartum hemorrhage diagnosis in mothers with a pre-existing mental health diagnosis prior to delivery versus those without. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a multicenter retrospective observational cohort study using TriNetX, a de-identified electronic health record database. The following electronic health record data were collected and evaluated in postpartum females who were billed for either a vaginal or cesarean delivery: age, race, ethnicity, diagnostic codes, medication codes, and number of deaths. RESULTS: We included 10,649 subjects (6994 (65.7%) no mental health diagnosis and 3655 (34.3%) pre-existing mental health diagnosis). Haloperidol administration (118 (3.2%) versus 129 (1.8%), p < 0.001) was more prevalent in subjects with a pre-existing mental health diagnosis. Adjusting for demographics, pre-existing mental health diagnoses were associated with complications within 1 year after postpartum hemorrhage diagnosis (OR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.26-1.52, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Having a mental health disorder history is associated with a higher odds of developing subsequent complications within 1 year of postpartum hemorrhage diagnosis. Mothers with a pre-existing mental health disorder have a significantly higher frequency of certain severe postpartum hemorrhage sequelae, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, retained placenta, sickle cell crisis, and need for mechanical ventilation/tracheostomy up to 1 year after delivery. Medications such as haloperidol were ordered more frequently within 7 days of a postpartum hemorrhage diagnosis in these mothers as well. Further research is needed to understand and manage the unique consequences of postpartum hemorrhage in this vulnerable maternal population.
