35954031|t|Suitability of Banana and Plantain Fruits in Modulating Neurodegenerative Diseases: Implicating the In Vitro and In Vivo Evidence from Neuroactive Narratives of Constituent Biomolecules.
35954031|a|Active principles in plant-based foods, especially staple fruits, such as bananas and plantains, possess inter-related anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, antioxidative, and neuromodulatory activities. Neurodegenerative diseases affect the functionality of the central and peripheral nervous system, with attendant cognitive deficits being hallmarks of these conditions. The dietary constitution of a wide range of bioactive compounds identified in this review further iterates the significance of the banana and plantain in compromising, halting, or preventing the pathological mechanisms of neurological disorders. The neuroprotective mechanisms of these biomolecules have been identified by using protein expression regulation and specific gene/pathway targeting, such as the nuclear and tumor necrosis factors, extracellular signal-regulated and mitogen-activated protein kinases, activator protein-1, and the glial fibrillary acidic protein. This review establishes the potential double-edged neuro-pharmacological fingerprints of banana and plantain fruits in their traditionally consumed pulp and less utilized peel component for human nutrition.
