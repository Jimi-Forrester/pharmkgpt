3188773|t|[Cytoarchitectonic characteristics of the fields of the human cerebral cortex in Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia].
3188773|a|Quantitative studies of the cytoarchitectonics were conducted in speech-motor (fields 44 and 45), motor (fields 4 and 6), limbic (fields 23, 24, 25) and temporal (field 37) areas in patients with Alzheimer disease and senile dementia. Pronounced atrophic alterations were identified in the brain cortex, especially in layers II and III. Cytoarchitectonic patterns were changed in the areas under study: cytoarchitectonic layers shifted, radial striae disappeared.
