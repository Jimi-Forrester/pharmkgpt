39572598|t|Whole-genome sequencing to identify rare variants in East Asian patients with dementia with Lewy bodies.
39572598|a|Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common form of age-related dementia, following Alzheimer's disease (AD). DLB is associated with a worse prognosis than AD and is characterized by a more rapid progression of cognitive impairment and a poorer quality of life. In addition, the pathogenesis of DLB is less understood than that of AD, and only three genes-SNCA (alpha-synuclein), APOE (apolipoprotein E), and GBA1 (glucosylceramidase beta 1)-have been convincingly demonstrated to be associated with DLB. In this study, we utilized whole-genome sequencing data from 1744 Japanese individuals, comprising 45 DLB patients and 1699 cognitively normal older adults, aiming to identify new genes associated with DLB. Our genome-wide association studies of genes with potentially deleterious mutations identified the CDH23 gene as being associated with DLB, reaching a Bonferroni-corrected significance (P = 7.43 x 10-4). The gene contained three ethnicity-specific heterozygous missense variants (rs181275139, rs563688802, and rs137937502). CDH23 has been linked to deafness syndromes, and DLB patients carrying these mutations displayed symptoms of subjective hearing loss, suggesting a potential association between DLB onset and auditory impairment. Additionally, we explored human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes associated with DLB but found no significant associations. This result suggests that the pathology of DLB differs from that of Parkinson's disease, which has been reported to have an association with HLA. Although a limitation of this study is the lack of replication of our findings, which require further validation in independent cohorts, our study enhances the understanding of the etiology of DLB in the Japanese population and provides new insights into the underlying mechanisms of its pathogenesis.
