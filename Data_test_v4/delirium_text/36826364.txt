36826364|t|Recognition of Delirium Superimposed on Dementia: Is There an Ideal Tool?
36826364|a|Delirium in persons with dementia (DSD) is a common occurrence. Over the past three decades, several tools have been developed and validated to diagnose delirium, yet there is still a shortage of tools recommended in persons with dementia and there is a lack of sufficient research on the accuracy of performance of such tools in this growing population. The purpose of this article is to (1) conduct a clinical review of the detection of DSD across settings of care by formal health care professionals and informal family members and care partners; (2) identify barriers and facilitators to detection and highlight delirium tools that have been tested in person with dementia; and (3) make recommendations for future research, practice, and policy. Given this review, an "ideal" tool for DSD would point to tools being brief, easy to integrate into the EMR, and accurate with at least 90% accuracy given the poor outcomes associated with delirium and DSD. Knowing the baseline and communication between family members and healthcare professionals should be a top priority for education, research, and health systems policy. More work is needed in better understanding DSD and optimizing and standardizing feature assessment, especially the acute change feature at the bedside for DSD.
