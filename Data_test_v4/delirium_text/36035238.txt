36035238|t|Solitary kidney functional damage due to caesarean ureteric injury monitored for 2 years after acute management: A case report.
36035238|a|Caesarean section with associated ureteric injuries that damage kidney function is uncommon. Such injury in women with a solitary kidney has far-reaching effects if the diagnosis is delayed. The case report describes the successful acute management with stenting of ureteric damage after caesarean section in a woman with a solitary kidney. A 29-year-old woman presented with anuria, hypertension (174/101 mmHg) and flank pain 3 days after caesarean section. Physical examination was significant for peri-orbital oedema, left flank tenderness, pallor and delirium. A diagnosis of acute kidney injury was confirmed by elevated blood urea and creatinine levels. An ultrasound scan revealed a solitary hydronephrotic left kidney. She had successful acute management at a resource-deprived facility, with normal renal function at a 2-year follow-up. Proteinuria lasted for about three months after surgery. Recovery of solitary kidney function with acute kidney injury due to caesarean section ureteric injury may be associated with prolonged proteinuria without evidence of further functional deterioration.
