35286658|t|Microglia in Alzheimer's Disease: a Key Player in the Transition Between Homeostasis and Pathogenesis.
35286658|a|Immune activation accompanies the development of proteinopathy in the brains of Alzheimer's dementia patients. Evolving from the long-held viewpoint that immune activation triggers the pathological trajectory in Alzheimer's disease, there is accumulating evidence now that microglial activation is neither pro-amyloidogenic nor just a simple reactive process to the proteinopathy. Preclinical studies highlight an interesting aspect of immunity, i.e., spurring immune system activity may be beneficial under certain circumstances. Indeed, a dynamic evolving relationship between different activation states of the immune system and its neuronal neighbors is thought to regulate overall brain organ health in both healthy aging and progression of Alzheimer's dementia. A new premise evolving from genome, transcriptome, and proteome data is that there might be at least two major phases of immune activation that accompany the pathological trajectory in Alzheimer's disease. Though activation on a chronic scale will certainly lead to neurodegeneration, this emerging knowledge of a potential beneficial aspect of immune activation allows us to form holistic insights into when, where, and how much immune system activity would need to be tuned to impact the Alzheimer's neurodegenerative cascade. Even with the trove of recently emerging -omics data from patients and preclinical models, how microglial phenotypes are functionally related to the transition of a healthy aging brain towards progressive degenerative state remains unknown. A deeper understanding of the synergism between microglial functional states and brain organ health could help us discover newer interventions and therapies that enable us to address the current paucity of disease-modifying therapies in Alzheimer's disease.
