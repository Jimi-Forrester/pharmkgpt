1535413|t|Slowed synthesis of DNA and methionine is a pathogenetic mechanism common to dementia in Down's syndrome, AIDS and Alzheimer's disease?
1535413|a|This is a presentation of the hypothesis of a pathogenetic mechanism common to the dementia seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Down's Syndrome (DS) and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). As there is experimental evidence of defective DNA repair capacity in AD and DS, unrepaired damage to DNA occurs in these diseases and may lead to complete breakdown of cellular function and ultimate cell death. Cobalamin and folate are coordinated in a vulnerable key position in the synthesis of DNA and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Cobalamin/folate deficiency, a significant feature in senile dementia of Alzheimer type and in AIDS-related dementia complex, will result in concomitant slowed synthesis of DNA and SAM. The enzyme cystathionine-beta-synthetase (CBS) has been localized to the chromosome band 21q22.3. Owing to gene dosage, CBS activity is increased in trisomy 21. As a consequence, cobalamin/folate metabolism is inhibited, which leads to slowing of DNA and SAM synthesis in DS patients. Amyloidosis is a hallmark of AD and DS brain neuropathology and recent experimental findings support the view that amyloid or amyloid precursors stimulate DNA synthesis, which is in agreement with the hypothesis presented in this paper. In summary, demented patients with cobalamin/folate deficiency, trisomy 21 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection display a simultaneous downregulation of DNA and SAM synthesis, which may indicate a pathway common to the dementia seen in AD, DS and AIDS.
