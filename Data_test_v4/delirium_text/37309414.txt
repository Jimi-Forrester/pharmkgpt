37309414|a|Objective: To investigate the feasibility of multimodal regimen by paracetamol, gabapentin, ketamine, lidocaine, dexmedetomidine and sufentanil among cardiac surgery patients, and compare the analgesia efficacy with conventional sufentanil-based regimen. Design: A single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Setting: One participating center, the cardiovascular center of the major integrated teaching hospital. Participants: A total of 115 patients were assessed for eligibility: 108 patients were randomized, 7 cases were excluded. Interventions: The control group (group T) received conventional anesthesia management. Interventions in the multimodal group (group M) were as follows in addition to the standard of care: gabapentin and acetaminophen 1 hour before surgery; ketamine for induction and to maintain anesthesia with lidocaine and dexmedetomide. Ketamine, lidocaine, and dexmedetomidine were added to routine sedatives postoperatively in group M. Measurements and Main Results: The incidence of moderate-to-severe pain on coughing made no significant difference (68.5% vs 64.8%, P=0.683). Group M had significantly less sufentanil use (135.72microg vs 94.85microg, P=0.000) and lower rescue analgesia rate (31.5% vs 57.4%, P=0.007). There was no significant difference in the incidence of chronic pain, PONV, dizziness, inflammation index, mechanical ventilation time, length of stay, and complications between the two groups. Conclusion: Our multimodal regimen in cardiac surgery is feasible, but was not superior to traditional sufentanil-based regimen in the aspects of analgesia effects; however, it did reduce perioperative opioid consumption along with rescue analgesia rate. Moreover, it showed the same length of stay and the incidences of postoperative complications.
