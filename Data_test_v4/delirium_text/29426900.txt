29426900|a|In recent years, microbial cholesterol oxidases have gained great attention due to its widespread use in medical applications for serum cholesterol determination. Streptomyces aegyptia strain NEAE-102 exhibited high level of extracellular cholesterol oxidase production using a minimum medium containing cholesterol as the sole source of carbon. Fifteen variables were screened using Plackett-Burman design for the enhanced cholesterol oxidase production. The most significant variables affecting enzyme production were further optimized by using the face-centered central composite design. The statistical optimization resulted in an overall 4.97-fold increase (15.631 UmL-1) in cholesterol oxidase production in the optimized medium as compared with the unoptimized medium before applying Plackett Burman design (3.1 UmL-1). The purified cholesterol oxidase was evaluated for its in vitro anticancer activities against five human cancer cell lines. The selectivity index values on rhabdomyosarcoma and breast cancer cell lines were 3.26 and 2.56; respectively. The in vivo anticancer activity of cholesterol oxidase was evaluated against Ehrlich solid tumor model. Compared with control mice, tumors growth was significantly inhibited in the mice injected with cholesterol oxidase alone, doxorubicin alone and cholesterol oxidase/doxorubicin combination by 60.97%, 72.99% and 97.04%; respectively. These results demonstrated that cholesterol oxidase can be used as a promising natural anticancer drug.
