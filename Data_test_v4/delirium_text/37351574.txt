37351574|t|Sex-specific clinical characteristics and treatment responses in delirium management: findings from a prospective cohort study in elderly patients.
37351574|a|Delirium incidence and phenotype differ between sexes. Sex differences in the selection of treatment strategies remain elusive. We evaluated sex-specific responses to non- and pharmacological management. In this observational prospective cohort study conducted at the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland, 602 patients managed for delirium were analyzed. Remission and benefit ratios of treatments were calculated using Cox regression models. Baseline characteristics were similar in both sexes. Overall, 89% of all patients (540/602) received pharmacological management for delirium, most (77%) with one or two different medications. An equal number of male and female patients had either no medication (P = 0.321) or three and more medications (P = 0.797). Men had two different medications more often (P = 0.009), while women more frequently received one medication (P = 0.037). Remission rates within 20 days were higher in non-pharmacological treatment and similar between sexes, with odds of 1.36 in females, and 2.3 in males. Non-pharmacological treatment was equally efficacious in both sexes. Women who received supportive treatment and monotherapy had equal odds of remission. Men fared better with supportive care compared to all pharmacologic therapies. Remission rates with different management strategies were similar between sexes. No sex differences were found regarding phenotypes, clinical course, and response to therapy.
