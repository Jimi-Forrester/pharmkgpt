39027446|a|Interactions between the gut microbiota and host immunity are sophisticated, dynamic, and host-dependent. Scientists have recently conducted research showing that disturbances in the gut bacterial community can lead to a decrease in some metabolites and, consequently, to behaviors such as depression. Exposure to stressors dropped the relative abundance of bacteria in the genus Bacteroides while soaring the relative abundance of bacteria in the genus Clostridium, Coprococcus, Dialister, and Oscillibacter, which were also reduced in people with depression. Microbiota and innate immunity are in a bilateral relationship. The gut microbiota has been shown to induce the synthesis of antimicrobial proteins such as catalysidins, type C lectins, and defensins. Probiotic bacteria can modulate depressive behavior through GABA signaling. The gut microbiome produces essential metabolites such as neurotransmitters, tryptophan metabolites, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that can act on the CNS. In the case of dysbiosis, due to mucin changes, the ratio of intestinal-derived molecules may change and contribute to depression. Psychotropics, including Bifidobacterium longum NCC3001, Clostridium butyricum CBM588, and Lactobacillus acidophilus, have mental health benefits, and can have a positive effect on the host-brain relationship, and have antidepressant effects. This article reviews current studies on the association between gut microbiota dysbiosis and depression. Comprehensively, these findings could potentially lead to novel approaches to improving depressive symptoms via gut microbiota alterations, including probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation.
