38786549|t|A Modern Approach to the Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury.
38786549|a|Background: Traumatic brain injury manifests itself in various forms, ranging from mild impairment of consciousness to severe coma and death. Traumatic brain injury remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Currently, there is no therapy to reverse the effects associated with traumatic brain injury. New neuroprotective treatments for severe traumatic brain injury have not achieved significant clinical success. Methods: A literature review was performed to summarize the recent interdisciplinary findings on management of traumatic brain injury from both clinical and experimental perspective. Results: In the present review, we discuss the concepts of traditional and new approaches to treatment of traumatic brain injury. The recent development of different drug delivery approaches to the central nervous system is also discussed. Conclusions: The management of traumatic brain injury could be aimed either at the pathological mechanisms initiating the secondary brain injury or alleviating the symptoms accompanying the injury. In many cases, however, the treatment should be complex and include a variety of medical interventions and combination therapy.
