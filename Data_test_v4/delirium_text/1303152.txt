1303152|a|The syntheses of prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha, E2 and D2, and thromboxane (TX) B2 from [14C]arachidonic acid were studied in frontal cortex of human control and Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains using the microsomal fractions. Under the assay conditions employed, it was found that the major metabolite of [14C]arachidonic acid was PGE2 accounting for 63% of total prostanoid production; PGF2 alpha accounted for 21.5%, TXB2 for 9%, and PGD2 for 6.5%. When AD samples were compared to control samples, microsomal PG synthesis was significantly decreased, with reduced production of PGE2, PGF2 alpha and PGD2. Such decreases in AD brain seem unrelated to age, sex, postmortem delay and, as far as could be determined, antemortem state. In both control and Alzheimer groups, a history of anti-inflammatory therapy seemed to correlate with increased PG synthesis.
