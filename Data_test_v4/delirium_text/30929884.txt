30929884|t|The Overlap Between Falls and Delirium in Hospitalized Older Adults: A Systematic Review.
30929884|a|Falls frequently occur in persons with cognitive impairment, including delirium. This article presents a systematic review of the association between falls and delirium in adults aged 65 years or older. For the studies that compared falls and delirium, the risk ratio was consistently elevated (median RR 4.5, range 1.4-12.6) and statistically significant in all but one study. These results suggest that falls and delirium are inextricably linked. There is a need to further refine fall risk assessment tools and protocols to specifically include delirium for consideration as a risk factor that needs additional assessment and management.
