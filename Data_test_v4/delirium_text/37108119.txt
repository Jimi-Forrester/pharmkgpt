37108119|t|The oDGal Mouse: A Novel, Physiologically Relevant Rodent Model of Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease.
37108119|a|Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) represents a serious and growing worldwide economic and healthcare burden. Almost 95% of current AD patients are associated with sAD as opposed to patients presenting with well-characterized genetic mutations that lead to AD predisposition, i.e., familial AD (fAD). Presently, the use of transgenic (Tg) animals overexpressing human versions of these causative fAD genes represents the dominant research model for AD therapeutic development. As significant differences in etiology exist between sAD and fAD, it is perhaps more appropriate to develop novel, more sAD-reminiscent experimental models that would expedite the discovery of effective therapies for the majority of AD patients. Here we present the oDGal mouse model, a novel model of sAD that displays a range of AD-like pathologies as well as multiple cognitive deficits reminiscent of AD symptomology. Hippocampal cognitive impairment and pathology were delayed with N-acetyl-cysteine (NaC) treatment, which strongly suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the drivers of downstream pathologies such as elevated amyloid beta and hyperphosphorylated tau. These features demonstrate a desired pathophenotype that distinguishes our model from current transgenic rodent AD models. A preclinical model that presents a phenotype of non-genetic AD-like pathologies and cognitive deficits would benefit the sAD field, particularly when translating therapeutics from the preclinical to the clinical phase.
