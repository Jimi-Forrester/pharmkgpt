36776074|a|BACKGROUND: Prognosis-related information regarding dementia needs to be updated, as changes in medical and long-term care environments for patients with dementia in recent decades may be improving the prognosis of the disease. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the mortality, cause of death, and prognostic factors by types of dementia in a Japanese clinic-based cohort. METHODS: The National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology-Life Stories of People with Dementia consists of clinical records and prognostic data of patients who visited the Memory Clinic in Japan. Patients who attended the clinic between July 2010 and September 2018, or their close relatives, were asked about death information via a postal survey. A cohort of 3,229 patients (mean age, 76.9; female, 1,953) was classified into six groups: normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. A Cox proportional hazards model was employed to compare the mortality of each type of dementia, MCI, and NC. RESULTS: Patients with all types of dementia and MCI had higher mortality rates than those with NC (hazard risks: 2.61-5.20). The most common cause of death was pneumonia, followed by cancer. In the MCI, AD, and DLB groups, older age, male sex, and low cognitive function were common prognostic factors but not presence of apolipoprotein E e4 allele. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest important differences in the mortality risk and cause of death among patients with dementia, which will be useful in advanced care planning and policymaking.
