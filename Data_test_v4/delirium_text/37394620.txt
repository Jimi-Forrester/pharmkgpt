37394620|t|Bioinformatics analysis and identification of hub genes of neutrophils in Kawasaki disease: a pivotal study.
37394620|a|BACKGROUND: Kawasaki disease (KD) is considered the main contributor to acquired heart diseases in developed countries. However, the precise pathogenesis of KD remains unclear. Neutrophils play roles in KD. This study aimed to select hub genes in neutrophils in acute KD. METHODS: mRNA microarray of neutrophils from four acute KD patients and three healthy controls was performed to screen differentially expressed mRNAs (DE-mRNAs). DE-mRNAs were analyzed and predicted by Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, and protein-protein interaction networks. Real time-PCR was finally conducted to confirm the reliability and validity of the expression level of DE-mRNAs from blood samples of healthy controls and KD patients in both acute and convalescent stage. RESULTS: A total of 1950 DE-mRNAs including 1287 upregulated and 663 downregulated mRNAs were identified. GO and KEGG analyses revealed the DE-mRNAs were mainly enriched in the regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, apoptotic process, intracellular signal transduction, protein phosphorylation, protein transport, metabolic pathways, carbon metabolism, lysosome, apoptosis, pyrimidine metabolism, alzheimer disease, prion disease, sphingolipid metabolism, huntington disease, glucagon signaling pathway, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, pyruvate metabolism, sphingolipid signaling pathway, and peroxisome. Twenty hub DE-mRNAs were selected including GAPDH, GNB2L1, PTPRC, GART, HIST2H2AC, ACTG1, H2AFX, CREB1, ATP5A1, ENO1, RAC2, PKM, BCL2L1, ATP5B, MRPL13, SDHA, TLR4, RUVBL2, TXNRD1, and ITGAM. The real-time PCR results showed that BCL2L1 and ITGAM mRNA were upregulated in acute KD and were normalized in the convalescent stage. CONCLUSIONS: These findings may improve our understanding of neutrophils in KD. Key Points   Neutrophilic BCL2L1 and ITGAM mRNA were first reported to be correlated with the pathogenic mechanism of KD.
