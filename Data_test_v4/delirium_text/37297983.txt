37297983|t|Incidence Rate and Factors Associated with Delirium and Subsyndromal Delirium in Patients with COVID-19 in an Intensive Care Unit.
37297983|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium subsyndrome (SSD) and delirium (DL) are known complications in the intensive care unit (ICU) and are associated with worse clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to screen for SSD and DL in individuals with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU and to study the associated factors and clinical outcomes. METHOD: An observational, longitudinal study was conducted in the reference ICU for COVID-19. All admitted individuals with COVID-19 were screened for SSD and DL during their ICU stay using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). Individuals with SSD and/or DL were compared to those without SSD and/or DL. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were evaluated, of which 46.7% had SSD and/or DL. The incidence rate was 4.17 cases/100 person-days. Individuals with SSD and/or DL had higher severity of illness on admission to the ICU, as measured by the APACHE II score (median 16 versus 8 points, p < 0.001). SSD and/or DL were associated with longer ICU and hospital stays (median 19 versus 6 days, p < 0.001 and median 22 versus 7 days, p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Individuals with SSD and/or DL had greater disease severity and longer ICU and hospital stays when compared to those without SSD and/or DL. This reinforces the importance of screening for consciousness disorders in the ICU.
