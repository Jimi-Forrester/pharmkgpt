38986163|t|Acquired Risk Factors that Influence Risk for Dementia and Possibly Alzheimer Disease.
38986163|a|Various medicinal agents aimed at improving Alzheimer disease (AD) include cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, aducanumab, and antioxidants. These medications are typically prescribed once AD is diagnosed in the clinical setting in order to slow progression. Though initiating treatment after being diagnosed with AD is important, significance should be placed on recognizing known acquired risk factors in order to potentially decrease the likelihood of developing dementia and perhaps specifically AD. This article summarizes the acquired factors that influence risk for dementia.
