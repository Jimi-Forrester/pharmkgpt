36979826|t|Characteristic Analysis of Featured Genes Associated with Cholangiocarcinoma Progression.
36979826|a|The noninvasive diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is insufficiently accurate. Therefore, the discovery of new prognostic markers is vital for the understanding of the CCA mechanism and related treatment. The information on CCA patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas database was used for weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were applied to analyze the modules of interest. By using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to analyze the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), the featured genes were subsequently verified. In addition, clinical samples and GSE119336 cohort data were also collected for the validation of these hub genes. Using WGCNA, we identified 61 hub genes that regulated the progression and prognosis of CCA. Eight hub genes (VSNL1, TH, PCP4, IGDCC3, RAD51AP2, MUC2, BUB1, and BUB1B) were identified which exhibited significant interactions with the tumorigenic mechanism and prognosis of CCA. In addition, GO and KEGG clarified that the blue and magenta modules were involved with chromosome segregation, mitotic and oocyte meiosis, the cell cycle, and sister chromatid segregation. Four hub genes (VSNL1, PCP4, BUB1, and BUB1B) were also verified as featured genes of progression and prognosis by the GSE119336 cohort data and five human tissue samples.
