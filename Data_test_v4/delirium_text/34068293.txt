34068293|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of neurodegenerative disease in the world. Genetic evidence strongly suggests that aberrant generation, aggregation, and/or clearance of neurotoxic amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) triggers the disease. Abeta accumulates at the points of contact of neurons in ordered cords and fibrils, forming the so-called senile plaques. Abeta isoforms of different lengths are found in healthy human brains regardless of age and appear to play a role in signaling pathways in the brain and to have neuroprotective properties at low concentrations. In recent years, different substances have been developed targeting Abeta production, aggregation, interaction with other molecules, and clearance, including peptide-based drugs. Abeta is a product of sequential cleavage of the membrane glycoprotein APP (amyloid precursor protein) by beta- and gamma-secretases. A number of familial mutations causing an early onset of the disease have been identified in the APP, especially in its transmembrane domain. The mutations are reported to influence the production, oligomerization, and conformational behavior of Abeta peptides. This review highlights the results of structural studies of the main proteins involved in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and the molecular mechanisms by which perspective therapeutic substances can affect Abeta production and nucleation.
