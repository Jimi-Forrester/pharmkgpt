38059755|a|Iron is required for the replication and growth of almost all bacterial species and in the production of myelin and neurotransmitters. Increasing clinical studies evidence that the gut microbiota plays a critical role in iron metabolism and cognition. However, the understanding of the complex iron-microbiome-cognition crosstalk remains elusive. In a recent study in the Aging Imageomics cohort (n = 1,030), we identified a positive association of serum ferritin (SF) with executive function (EF) as inferred from the semantic verbal fluency (SVF,) the total digit span (TDS) and the phonemic verbal fluency tests (PVF). Here, we explored the potential mechanisms by analyzing the gut microbiome and plasma metabolome using shotgun metagenomics and HPLC-ESI-MS/MS, respectively. Different bacterial species belonging to the Proteobacteria phylum (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella michiganensis, Unclassified Escherichia) were negatively associated both with SF and executive function. At the functional level, an enrichment of microbial pathways involved in phenylalanine, arginine, and proline metabolism was identified. Consistently, phenylacetylglutamine, a metabolite derived from microbial catabolism of phenylalanine, was negatively associated with SF, EF, and semantic memory. Other metabolites such as ureidobutyric acid and 19,20-DiHDPA, a DHA-derived oxylipin, were also consistently and negatively associated with SF, EF, and semantic memory, while plasma eicosapentaenoic acid was positively associated. The associations of SF with cognition could be mediated by the gut microbiome through microbial-derived metabolites.
