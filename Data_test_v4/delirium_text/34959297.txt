34959297|a|Nucleic acid-based therapeutics have demonstrated their efficacy in the treatment of various diseases and vaccine development. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) technology exploits a single-strand short oligonucleotide to either cause target RNA degradation or sterically block the binding of cellular factors or machineries to the target RNA. Chemical modification or bioconjugation of ASOs can enhance both its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic performance, and it enables customization for a specific clinical purpose. ASO-based therapies have been used for treatment of genetic disorders, cancer and viral infections. In particular, ASOs can be rapidly developed for newly emerging virus and their reemerging variants. This review discusses ASO modifications and delivery options as well as the design of antiviral ASOs. A better understanding of the viral life cycle and virus-host interactions as well as advances in oligonucleotide technology will benefit the development of ASO-based antiviral therapies.
