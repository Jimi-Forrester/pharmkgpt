38089594|a|Background and Aims: With advancements in imaging and microelectrode recording techniques, general anesthesia (GA) has emerged as an alternative option for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients undergoing subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS). In this study, we compared the advantages and disadvantages of using GA and local anesthesia for STN-DBS in enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS). Methods: Surgical outcomes of STN-DBS were evaluated using the unified PD rating scales (UPDRS). CT and magnetic resonance imaging scans are used to evaluate intracranial conditions. State-trait anxiety inventory and hospital anxiety and depression scale are used to evaluate patients' perioperative psychology. Results: Anesthesia method does not significantly impact the accuracy of microelectrode placement or the improvement of postoperative symptoms. However, the local anesthesia group had a higher incidence of intracranial air, as well as higher rates of postoperative complications such as headache, dizziness, vomiting, and delirium. GA effectively alleviated preoperative anxiety and resulted in lower levels of perioperative anxiety and psychological stress compared to local anesthesia. Additionally, the GA group had shorter surgery duration, earlier ambulation, and a shorter average hospital stay. Conclusion: DBS under GA is safe and effective. Due to shorter surgical duration, reduced occurrence of perioperative complications, effective reduction of preoperative anxiety, and faster postoperative recovery, DBS under GA is better aligned with the concept of ERAS.
