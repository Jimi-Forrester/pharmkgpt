34204902|t|Electrochemical Biosensing of Dopamine Neurotransmitter: A Review.
34204902|a|Neurotransmitters are biochemical molecules that transmit a signal from a neuron across the synapse to a target cell, thus being essential to the function of the central and peripheral nervous system. Dopamine is one of the most important catecholamine neurotransmitters since it is involved in many functions of the human central nervous system, including motor control, reward, or reinforcement. It is of utmost importance to quantify the amount of dopamine since abnormal levels can cause a variety of medical and behavioral problems. For instance, Parkinson's disease is partially caused by the death of dopamine-secreting neurons. To date, various methods have been developed to measure dopamine levels, and electrochemical biosensing seems to be the most viable due to its robustness, selectivity, sensitivity, and the possibility to achieve real-time measurements. Even if the electrochemical detection is not facile due to the presence of electroactive interfering species with similar redox potentials in real biological samples, numerous strategies have been employed to resolve this issue. The objective of this paper is to review the materials (metals and metal oxides, carbon materials, polymers) that are frequently used for the electrochemical biosensing of dopamine and point out their respective advantages and drawbacks. Different types of dopamine biosensors, including (micro)electrodes, biosensing platforms, or field-effect transistors, are also described.
