32425189|t|[Delirium in cardiology: an old problem, a new emergency].
32425189|a|Delirium is a common cognitive behavioral disorder, with acute onset, frequent in elderly hospitalized patients. This condition has long been the subject of research in the critical area, with the development of targeted prevention and management protocols. In the cardiology field, however, awareness of delirium is poor. The problem of delirium has recently begun to involve practitioners since the publication of first studies showing the increase of adverse events in patients with this condition. The pathophysiology of delirium is unclear and the risk factors are based on clinical conditions and factors related to patient's care itself that need to be readily identified. Thus, delirium is a clinical manifestation that can easily be confused with other conditions. Notwithstanding, delirium can be prevented and treated when clinically evident, with a number of non-pharmacological interventions based on a multidisciplinary approach. Pharmacological therapy, due to its unclear effectiveness, should be reserved to patients with severe agitation or at risk of injuring themselves and others. The purpose of this review is to increase the awareness in healthcare professionals about the recent data on etiology, prevention, treatment and prognosis of delirium and to put the basis for a protocol that could be used in Cardiology departments.
