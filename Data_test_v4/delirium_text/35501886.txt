35501886|a|BACKGROUND: Patient-to-patient variability in the degree to which beta-amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration impact cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) complicates disease modeling and treatment. However, the underlying mechanisms leading to cognitive resilience are not resolved. We hypothesize that the variability in cognitive function and loss relates to neuronal resilience of the hippocampal GABAergic network. METHODS: We compared TgF344-AD and non-transgenic littermate rats at 9, 12, and 15 months of age. Neurons, beta-amyloid plaques and tau inclusions were quantified in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PVB) interneurons were traced to examine hippocampal neuroplasticity and cognition was tested in the Barnes maze. RESULTS: The 9-month-old TgF344-AD rats exhibited loss of neurons in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Hippocampal neuronal compensation was observed in 12-month TgF344-AD rats, with upregulation of GABAergic interneuronal marker. By 15 months, the TgF344-AD rats had robust loss of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. beta-Amyloid and tau pathology accumulated continuously across age. SST interneurons exhibited tau inclusions and atrophy from 9 months, whereas PVB interneurons were resilient until 15 months. The hippocampal PVB circuit underwent neuroplastic reorganization with increased dendritic length and complexity in 9- and 12-month-old TgF344-AD rats, before atrophy at 15 months. Strikingly, 12-month-old TgF344-AD rats were resilient in executive function and cognitive flexibility. Cognitive resilience in TgF344-AD rats occurred as maintenance of function between 9 and 12 months of age despite progressive spatial memory deficits, and was sustained by PVB neuroplasticity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the inherent neuronal processes leading to cognitive maintenance, and describe a novel finding of endogenous cognitive resilience in an AD model.
