37965412|t|Diagnostic Efficacy and Clinical Relevance of Artificial Intelligence in Detecting Cognitive Decline.
37965412|a|Cognitive impairment is an age-associated disorder of increasing prevalence as the aging population continues to grow. Classified based on the level of cognitive decline, memory, function, and capacity to conduct activities of daily living, cognitive impairment ranges from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. When considering the insidious nature of the etiologies responsible for varying degrees of cognitive impairment, early diagnosis may provide a clinical benefit through the facilitation of early treatment. Typical diagnosis relies heavily on evaluation in a primary care setting. However, there is evidence that other diagnostic tools may aid in an earlier diagnosis of the different underlying pathologies responsible for cognitive impairment. Artificial intelligence represents a new intersecting field with healthcare that may aid in the early detection of neurodegenerative disorders. When assessing the role of AI in detecting cognitive decline, it is important to consider both the diagnostic efficacy of AI algorithms and the clinical relevance and impact of early interventions as a result of early detection. Thus, this review highlights promising investigations and developments in the space of artificial intelligence and healthcare and their potential to impact patient outcomes.
