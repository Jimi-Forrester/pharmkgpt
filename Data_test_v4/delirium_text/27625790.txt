27625790|t|Alzheimer's disease-associated mutations increase amyloid precursor protein resistance to gamma-secretase cleavage and the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio.
27625790|a|Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene and the aberrant cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we have developed a simple and sensitive cell-based assay to detect APP cleavage by gamma-secretase. Unexpectedly, most familial AD (FAD)-linked APP mutations make APP partially resistant to gamma-secretase. Mutations that alter residues N terminal to the gamma-secretase cleavage site Abeta42 have subtle effects on cleavage efficiency and cleavage-site selectivity. In contrast, mutations that alter residues C terminal to the Abeta42 site reduce cleavage efficiency and dramatically shift cleavage-site specificity toward the aggregation-prone Abeta42. Moreover, mutations that remove positive charge at residue 53 greatly reduce the APP cleavage by gamma-secretase. These results suggest a model of gamma-secretase substrate recognition, in which the APP region C terminal to the Abeta42 site and the positively charged residue at position 53 are the primary determinants for substrate binding and cleavage-site selectivity. We further demonstrate that this model can be extended to gamma-secretase processing of notch receptors, a family of highly conserved cell-surface signaling proteins.
