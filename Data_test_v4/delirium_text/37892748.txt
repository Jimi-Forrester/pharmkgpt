37892748|a|Dexmedetomidine prevents postoperative cognitive dysfunction by inhibiting high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which acts as an inflammatory marker. This study investigated the HMGB1 levels and the cognitive function using a Mini-Cog  score in elderly patients undergoing orthopedic surgery with dexmedetomidine infusion. In total, 128 patients aged >= 65 years were analyzed. The patients received saline in the control group and dexmedetomidine in the dexmedetomidine group until the end of surgery. Blood sampling and the Mini-Cog  test were performed before the surgery and on postoperative days 1 and 3. The primary outcomes were the effect of dexmedetomidine on the HMGB1 levels and the Mini-Cog  score in terms of postoperative cognitive function. The Mini-Cog  score over time differed significantly between the groups (p = 0.008), with an increase in the dexmedetomidine group. The postoperative HMGB1 levels increased over time in both groups; however, there was no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.969). The probability of perioperative neurocognitive disorders decreased by 0.48 times as the Mini-Cog  score on postoperative day 3 increased by 1 point. Intraoperative dexmedetomidine has shown an increase in the postoperative Mini-Cog  score. Thus, the Mini-Cog  score is a potential tool for evaluating cognitive function in elderly patients.
