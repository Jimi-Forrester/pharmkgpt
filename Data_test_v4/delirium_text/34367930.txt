34367930|t|Hypotheses and facts for genetic factors related to severe COVID-19.
34367930|a|Genome-wide association analysis allows the identification of potential candidate genes involved in the development of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hence, it seems that genetics matters here, as well. Nevertheless, the virus's nature, including its RNA structure, determines the rate of mutations leading to new viral strains with all epidemiological and clinical consequences. Given these observations, we herein comment on the current hypotheses about the possible role of the genes in association with COVID-19 severity. We discuss some of the major candidate genes that have been identified as potential genetic factors associated with the COVID-19 severity and infection susceptibility: HLA, ABO, ACE2, TLR7, ApoE, TYK2, OAS, DPP9, IFNAR2, CCR2, etc. Further study of genes and genetic variants will be of great benefit for the prevention and assessment of the individual risk and disease severity in different populations. These scientific data will serve as a basis for the development of clinically applicable diagnostic and prognostic tests for patients at high risk of COVID-19.
