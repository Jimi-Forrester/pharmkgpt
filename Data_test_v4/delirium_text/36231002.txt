36231002|t|Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation in Cardiovascular Diseases.
36231002|a|Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a biochemical process in cells that can drive proteins, RNA, and other molecules to concentrate into droplets. These droplets do not have a lipid membrane but rather exist as distinct organelles relative to the surrounding environment, and act as biochemical reaction chambers. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the study of LLPS, especially in the neurodegenerative disease, cancer, and virology fields, but little is known about LLPS in cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the mechanism and biological functions of LLPS, particularly its roles in regulating CVD.
