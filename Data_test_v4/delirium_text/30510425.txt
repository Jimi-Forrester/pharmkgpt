30510425|a|BACKGROUND: The association between circulating magnesium (Mg) and Parkinson's disease (PD) remains ambiguous and controversial. Thus, a meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the circulating Mg levels in PD patients and to clarify whether high circulating Mg levels should be considered as a potential risk factor for PD. METHODS: In this study, 17 case-control published studies were selected in our meta-analysis by searching the electronic databases of Web of Science, PubMed, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) before June 1, 2018. Overall, 848 PD cases and 784 healthy controls (HC), 1,023 PD cases and 911 HC, and 180 PD cases and 144 HC met the inclusion criteria for this study Mg levels in serum, peripheral blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), respectively. Standardized mean difference (SMD) in random-effects model and 95% CI were used to assess the correlation strength through the comparison of the two groups. RESULTS: Meta-analysis showed that the serum Mg levels in PD cases were significantly higher than those in HC individuals (SMD =1.09, 95% CI =0.52, 1.66). Furthermore, this result was further confirmed by the combined analysis of serum and whole blood studies together (SMD =0.64, 95% CI =0.10, 1.19). In addition, the higher CSF Mg levels in patients of PD were observed in comparison with normal range (SMD =0.55, 95% CI =0.21, 0.88). However, this data did not further discuss and analyze because of the smaller sample size of CSF studies. CONCLUSION: Our findings supported the notion that the increase of circulating Mg levels appears in the patients with PD.
