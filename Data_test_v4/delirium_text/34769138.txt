34769138|t|Trace Element Selenium Effectively Alleviates Intestinal Diseases.
34769138|a|Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element in the body. It is mainly used in the body in the form of selenoproteins and has a variety of biological functions. Intestinal diseases caused by chronic inflammation are among the most important threats to human health, and there is no complete cure at present. Due to its excellent antioxidant function, Se has been proven to be effective in alleviating intestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Therefore, this paper introduces the role of Se and selenoproteins in the intestinal tract and the mechanism of their involvement in the mediation of intestinal diseases. In addition, it introduces the advantages and disadvantages of nano-Se as a new Se preparation and traditional Se supplement in the prevention and treatment of intestinal diseases, so as to provide a reference for the further exploration of the interaction between selenium and intestinal health.
