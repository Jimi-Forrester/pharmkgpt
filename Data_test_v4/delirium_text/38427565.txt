38427565|t|Integration of in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics in rodents with PEDOT:PSS neural electrode array.
38427565|a|Here, we present a protocol for the fabrication of transparent implantable electrode arrays for integrating optogenetics and electrophysiology. We describe steps for fabricating microelectrodes using the conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate). We then detail procedures for analyzing performance of the electrodes and recording light-evoked neural activities from the transgenic mouse. This protocol utilizes photolithography rather than conventional electrodeposition. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Cho et al. (2022).1.
