32168739|a|The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a dynamic organelle essential for intracellular homeostasis maintenance, controlling synthesis, the folding of secreted and membrane-bound proteins, and transport of Ca2+. During cellular stress, ER dysfunction leads to the activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) due to accumulated misfolded proteins in the ER. This condition is referred as ER stress. Mitochondria and ER form a site of close contact (the mitochondria-associated membrane, MAM) which is a major platform exerting important physiological roles in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, lipid metabolism, mitochondrial fission, autophagosome formation, and apoptosis progression. Natural products have been receiving increasing attention for their ability to interfere with ER stress. Research works have focused on the capacity of these bioactive compounds to induce apoptosis by activating ER stress through the ER stress-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In this review we discuss the role of natural products in the signaling communication between ER and mitochondria, focusing on the effects induced by ER stress including Ca2+ permeability transition and UPR signaling (protein kinase R-like ER kinase/mitofusin 2).
