11503477|a|Managing the symptoms of advanced disease at the end of life is one of the most challenging aspects of medicine for most clinicians. Traditional textbooks provide limited resources for treating patients at this stoichiometric point in their disease. This article provides an overview in the treatment of common symptoms at the end of life, such as anxiety, anorexia and cachexia, constipation, delirium, dyspnea, fatigue and asthenia, nausea and vomiting, malignant intestinal obstruction, and terminal restlessness. By addressing these symptoms, the physician can play a key role in the patient's achievement of a peaceful, symptom-free, and dignified death in the setting of their choice.
