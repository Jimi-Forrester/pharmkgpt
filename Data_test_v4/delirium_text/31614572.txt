31614572|a|Although moderate concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are crucial for various physiological processes within the human body, their overproduction leads to oxidative stress, defined as the imbalance between the production and accumulation of ROS and the ability of the body to neutralize and eliminate them. In the brain, oxidative stress exhibits significant effects, due to its increased metabolical activity and limited cellular regeneration. Thus, oxidative stress is a major factor in the progressive loss of neurons structures and functions, leading to the development of severe neurodegenerative disorders. In this context, recent years have witnessed tremendous advancements in the field of antioxidant therapies, with a special emphasis for neuroprotection. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the oxidative stress and antioxidant defense mechanisms and to present the most recent studies on antioxidant therapies for neuroprotection.
