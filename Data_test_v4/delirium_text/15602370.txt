15602370|a|INTRODUCTION: Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is generally related to peripheral nervous system involvement, but certain variants with central nervous system manifestations have been described. CASE REPORT: In the present study we report 2 patients with GBS associated with hallucinations and onirism. Two men (age 64 and 49 years) presented GBS without proven infectious origin who required intensive care because of respiratory problems. The disease progressed and manifestations of encephalitis (hallucinations and onirism) appeared. The sensorimotor signs and encephalitis manifestations evolved in parallel with full recovery in the first patient and death after 11 months of intensive care in the second. CONCLUSION: GBS may be associated with stereotypic central nervous system symptoms, mimicking delirium tremens. The manifestations would be related to the severity of the initial period, but not to long-term prognosis.
