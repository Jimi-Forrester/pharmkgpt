37528395|a|PURPOSE: To identify the processes of cancer-related pain relief and exacerbation faced by outpatients in an acute care hospital and to examine the support needed for outpatient pain control. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with patients from the outpatient department of Showa University Northern Yokohama Hospital in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. Participants were recruited by purposive sampling. From the recorded data, verbatim transcripts were made and used as textual data for analysis by consistent comparative method. RESULTS: Between April 2018 and April 2022, interviews were conducted with 30 participants. Analysis of the verbatim transcripts generated 13 categories from 27 concepts. Category relationships were examined, and a conceptual framework was developed. Outpatients went from being in a state of hesitation towards consultation with medical professionals to receiving individual consistent follow-ups by medical professionals in the hospital and community pharmacies, which led to patient teleconsultations when their physical condition changed, leading to an improvement of pain. CONCLUSION: The process of relief and exacerbation of cancer-related pain experienced by outpatients in the acute care hospital reveals that the provision of consistent follow-up through remote or in-person interviews has an important role to play in pain management, as it helps to build relationships between patients and medical professionals. Alternatively, when outpatients exhibited endurance, their pain worsened, and they fell into a negative cycle of poor pain control.
