39500613|a|Recent advancements in single-cell technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq), have greatly improved our insight into the epigenomic landscapes across various biological contexts and diseases. This paper reviews key computational tools and machine learning approaches that integrate scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data to facilitate the alignment of transcriptomic data with chromatin accessibility profiles. Applying these integrated single-cell technologies in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, reveals how changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression can illuminate pathogenic mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets. Despite facing challenges like data sparsity and computational demands, ongoing enhancements in scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq technologies, along with better analytical methods, continue to expand their applications. These advancements promise to revolutionize our approach to medical research and clinical diagnostics, offering a comprehensive view of cellular function and disease pathology.
