38914735|a|Rising rates of insulin resistance and an ageing population are set to exact an increasing toll on individuals and society. Here we examine the contribution of age and insulin resistance to the association of cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism; both critical process in the supply of energy for the brain. Thirty-four younger (20-42 years) and 41 older (66-86 years) healthy adults underwent a simultaneous resting state MR/PET scan, including arterial spin labelling. Rates of cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism were derived using a functional atlas of 100 brain regions. Older adults had lower cerebral blood flow than younger adults in 95 regions, reducing to 36 regions after controlling for cortical atrophy and blood pressure. Lower cerebral blood flow was also associated with worse working memory and slower reaction time in tasks requiring cognitive flexibility and response inhibition. Younger and older insulin sensitive adults showed small, negative correlations between relatively high rates of regional cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism. This pattern was inverted in insulin resistant older adults, who showed hypoperfusion and hypometabolism across the cortex, and a positive correlation. In insulin resistant younger adults, the association showed inversion to positive correlations, although not to the extent seen in older adults. Our findings suggest that the normal course of ageing and insulin resistance alter the rates of and associations between cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism. They underscore the criticality of insulin sensitivity to brain health across the adult lifespan.
