36363754|t|Functionalized Noble Metal Nanoparticles for the Treatment of Herpesvirus Infection.
36363754|a|Neuroinfections caused by herpesviruses, mainly by HHV-1, represent a significant problem for modern medicine due to the small number of therapeutic substances available in the pharmaceutical sector. Furthermore, HHV-1 infection has been linked to neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer's disease, which justifies the search for new effective therapies. The development of nanotechnology opens up new possibilities for the treatment of neuroinflammation. Gold and silver nanoparticles are gaining popularity, and the number of clinical trials involving metallic nanoparticles is constantly increasing. This paper reviews the research on gold and silver nanoparticles and their potential use in the treatment of herpesvirus neuroinfection.
