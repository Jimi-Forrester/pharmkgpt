33022271|a|The absence of a specific treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection led to an intense global effort in order to find new therapeutic interventions and improve patient outcomes. One important feature of COVID-19 pathophysiology is the activation of immune cells, with consequent massive production and release of inflammatory mediators that may cause impairment of several organ functions, including the brain. In addition to its classical role as a neurotransmitter, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has immunomodulatory properties, downregulating the inflammatory response by central and peripheral mechanisms. In this review, we describe the roles of 5-HT in the regulation of systemic inflammation and the potential benefits of the use of specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors as a coadjutant therapy to attenuate neurological complications of COVID-19.
