39379008|t|A New Hospital-At-Home Model for Integrated Geriatric Care: Data From a Preliminary Italian Experience.
39379008|a|OBJECTIVE: Hospital-at-home (HaH) has emerged as an alternative to conventional in-hospital care in older adults, possibly reducing hospital admissions and related complications. This study aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients referred to "Gruppo di Intervento Rapido Ospedale-Territorio" (GIROT), a HaH service based on comprehensive geriatric assessment, developed in Florence, Italy, during the postpandemic period. DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: GIROT provided home-based care to patients with acute or exacerbated chronic diseases and a high risk of hospital-related complications (ie, patients with moderate-to-severe disability and/or dementia), referred from primary care, emergency departments, or in-hospital units. METHODS: All-cause mortality and hospitalization rates were assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months, and predictors of 6-month mortality were investigated. RESULTS: Among 391 patients (mean age, 88.4 years; 62.4% female) referred from emergency departments (58.6%), primary care (27.9%), and acute medical units (13.6%), the main diagnoses were respiratory failure (28.4%), acute heart failure (25.3%), and delirium (13.6%). Patients referred from primary care were older and showed a higher prevalence of severe disability and hypomobility. After 1, 3, and 6 months, mortality rates were 34.5%, 45.6%, and 53.8%, and hospitalization rates 7.2%, 21.5%, and 37.9%, respectively. Predictors of 6-month mortality included age (odds ratio [OR], 1.039), severe disability (OR, 3.446), impossible/assisted walking (OR, 4.450) and referral from primary care (OR, 2.066). High global satisfaction with the service was reported. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The GIROT model may help expanding acute health care capacity for older adults at high risk of hospital-related complications. Customized care plans are needed in patients with severe disability/hypomobility, considering also simultaneous palliative care.
