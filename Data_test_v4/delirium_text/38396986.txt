38396986|t|The Role of Complement Dysregulation in Glaucoma.
38396986|a|Glaucoma is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by damage to the optic nerve that results in irreversible vision loss. While the exact pathology of glaucoma is not well understood, emerging evidence suggests that dysregulation of the complement system, a key component of innate immunity, plays a crucial role. In glaucoma, dysregulation of the complement cascade and impaired regulation of complement factors contribute to chronic inflammation and neurodegeneration. Complement components such as C1Q, C3, and the membrane attack complex have been implicated in glaucomatous neuroinflammation and retinal ganglion cell death. This review will provide a summary of human and experimental studies that document the dysregulation of the complement system observed in glaucoma patients and animal models of glaucoma driving chronic inflammation and neurodegeneration. Understanding how complement-mediated damage contributes to glaucoma will provide opportunities for new therapies.
