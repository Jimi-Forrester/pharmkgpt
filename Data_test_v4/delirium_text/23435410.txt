23435410|a|BACKGROUND: Pre-progression rates (PPR) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been reported to be associated with cognitive and functional decline. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to reevaluate PPRs in a prospective cohort of AD patients. METHODS: A prospective AD cohort was analyzed. Multiple regression was used to examine associations of PPRs with short term decline on different cognitive and functional scales (MMSE, instrumental and basic ADL, GDS, UPDRS III). RESULTS: PPRs were only associated with first year instrumental ADL declines. CONCLUSION: The predictive abilities of PPRs could partially be confirmed. These findings can help to adapt patient care shortly after diagnosis.
