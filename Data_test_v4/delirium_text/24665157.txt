AIM: This study aimed to determine the prenatal effects of ethanolic extract of D. metel leaves exposure on the development of hippocampus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty rats (12 females and 8 males) were purchased. The females were grouped into four groups (A_D). Group A were given 500 mg/kg body weight of the extract on the first day of fertilization to the end of gestation period, Group B were given 500 mg/kg body weight on the 8(th) day of fertilization to the end of gestation period, Group C were given 500 mg/kg body weight on 15(th) day of fertilization to the end of gestation period and Group D were given normal saline throughout the gestation period. RESULTS: Rats in Group A showed no implantation, rats in Group B had abortion on the 7(th) day after administration, and rats in Group C gave birth with their litters showing retarded hippocampus development and neural degeneration and rats in Group D (control) showed normal development. CONCLUSION: Ethanolic extract of D. metel leaf is teratogenic in the late stage of pregnancy, is abortificient and can serve as a contraceptive.
