9930716|t|Regulation of amyloid precursor protein cleavage.
9930716|a|Multiple lines of evidence suggest that increased production and/or deposition of the beta-amyloid peptide, derived from the amyloid precursor protein, contributes to Alzheimer's disease. A growing list of neurotransmitters, growth factors, cytokines, and hormones have been shown to regulate amyloid precursor protein processing. Although traditionally thought to be mediated by activation of protein kinase C, recent data have implicated other signaling mechanisms in the regulation of this process. Moreover, novel mechanisms of regulation involving cholesterol-, apolipoprotein E-, and stress-activated pathways have been identified. As the phenotypic changes associated with Alzheimer's disease encompass many of these signaling systems, it is relevant to determine how altered cell signaling may be contributing to increasing brain amyloid burden. We review the myriad ways in which first messengers regulate amyloid precursor protein catabolism as well as the signal transduction cascades that give rise to these effects.
