29103038|t|Complexity and Selectivity of gamma-Secretase Cleavage on Multiple Substrates: Consequences in Alzheimer's Disease and Cancer.
29103038|a|The processing of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) by beta- and gamma-secretases is a pivotal event in the genesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Besides familial mutations on the AbetaPP gene, or upon its overexpression, familial forms of AD are often caused by mutations or deletions in presenilin 1 (PSEN1) and 2 (PSEN2) genes: the catalytic components of the proteolytic enzyme gamma-secretase (GS). The "amyloid hypothesis", modified over time, states that the aberrant processing of AbetaPP by GS induces the formation of specific neurotoxic soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides which, in turn, cause neurodegeneration. This theory, however, has recently evidenced significant limitations and, in particular, the following issues are debated: 1) the concept and significance of presenilin's "gain of function" versus "loss of function"; and 2) the presence of several and various GS substrates, which interact with AbetaPP and may influence Abeta formation. The latter consideration is suggestive: despite the increasing number of GS substrates so far identified, their reciprocal interaction with AbetaPP itself, even in the AD field, is significantly unexplored. On the other hand, GS is also an important pharmacological target in the cancer field; inhibitors or GS activity are investigated in clinical trials for treating different tumors. Furthermore, the function of AbetaPP and PSENs in brain development and in neuronal migration is well known. In this review, we focused on a specific subset of GS substrates that directly interact with AbetaPP and are involved in its proteolysis and signaling, by evaluating their role in neurodegeneration and in cell motility or proliferation, as a possible connection between AD and cancer.
