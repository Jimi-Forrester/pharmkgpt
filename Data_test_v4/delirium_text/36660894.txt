36660894|a|BACKGROUND: How inflammation relates to intrinsic capacity (IC), the composite of physical and mental capacities, remains undefined. Our study aimed to investigate the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between plasma inflammation-related biomarkers and IC in older adults. METHODS: This secondary analysis of the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) included 1238 community-dwelling older individuals with IC assessments from 12 to 60 months. Plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) were measured at 12 months. IC was operationalized as a score ranging from 0 to 100, derived from four domains: cognition, Mini-Mental State Examination; locomotion, Short Physical Performance Battery; psychological, Geriatric Depression Scale; and vitality, handgrip strength. A five-domain IC score (plus sensory) was investigated in a subsample (n = 535) with a 1-year follow-up as an exploratory outcome. RESULTS: The mean age of the 1238 participants was 76.2 years (SD = 4.3); 63.7% were female. Their initial four-domain IC scores averaged 78.9 points (SD = 9.3), with a yearly decline of 1.17 points (95% CI = -1.30 to -1.05; P < 0.001). We observed significant associations of lower baseline IC with higher CRP, IL-6, TNFR-1 and GDF-15, after controlling age, sex, MAPT group allocation and educational level [CRP: adjusted beta (95% CI) = -1.56 (-2.64 to -0.48); P = 0.005; IL-6: adjusted beta = -3.16 (-4.82 to -1.50); P < 0.001; TNFR-1: adjusted beta = -6.86 (-10.25 to -3.47); P < 0.001; GDF-15: adjusted beta = -7.07 (-10.02 to -4.12); P < 0.001]. Higher TNFR-1, MCP-1 and GDF-15 were associated with faster decline in four-domain IC over 4 years [TNFR-1: adjusted beta (95% CI) = -1.28 (-2.29 to -0.27); P = 0.013; MCP-1: adjusted beta = -1.33 (-2.24 to -0.42); P = 0.004; GDF-15: adjusted beta = -1.42 (-2.26 to -0.58); P = 0.001]. None of the biomarkers was significantly associated with the five-domain IC decline. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation was associated with lower IC in older adults. Among all plasma biomarkers, TNFR-1 and GDF-15 were consistently associated with IC at the cross-sectional and longitudinal levels.
