39800462|t|Expert opinion on Centiloid thresholds suitable for initiating anti-amyloid therapy. Summary of discussion at the 2024 spring Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable.
39800462|a|A 24-30 Centiloid (CL) threshold was collectively considered by a group of global dementia experts as a practical and implementable cut-off for anti-amyloid therapy intervention, in Alzheimer's disease patients who have been diagnosed at the mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of their disease. Though additional validation is needed, knowledge of this threshold would be valuable to those involved in diagnosing and treating patients in the new AD care pathways, as well as entry into clinical trials. Therapy monitoring to determine future treatment response and assess amyloid clearance can be accomplished with amyloid PET with some technical details still to be elucidated.
