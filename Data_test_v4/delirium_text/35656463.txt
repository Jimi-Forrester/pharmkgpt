35656463|a|Objective: To assess the clinical efficacy of oxymatrine plus antiviral therapy in the treatment of sepsis and its effects on the levels of endotoxin and inflammatory factors. Methodology. 90 patients with sepsis were selected for retrospective analysis and were assigned to receive either conventional treatment (control group) or oxymatrine plus antiviral treatment (study group). The clinical endpoint was treatment efficacy. Results: There were no significant differences in baseline patient profile between the two groups (P > 0.05). The study group showed a higher efficiency versus the control group (P < 0.05). Patients in the study group had a significantly shorter mechanical ventilation duration and ICU stay versus those in the control group (P < 0.05). Both groups had reduced Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, Marshall score, levels of endotoxin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT) after treatment, with lower results in the study group versus the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Oxymatrine plus antiviral therapy effectively improves clinical efficacy, reduces the levels of endotoxin and inflammatory factors, protects organ function, and boosts recovery. Further clinical trials are, however, required prior to general application in clinical practice.
