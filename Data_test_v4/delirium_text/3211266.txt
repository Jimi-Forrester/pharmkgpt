3211266|t|Animal models of age- and disease-related cognitive decline: perspectives on the models and therapeutic strategies.
3211266|a|The relative value of animals with memory impairments, due either to experimental lesions or aging processes, is dependent upon the specific hypothesis being tested. The experimental approaches described in the preceding reviews are valuable for basic studies on learning and memory in the mammalian brain. However, because of important differences between available model systems and human disease states, such as Alzheimer's disease, their use at present may be insufficient for understanding and developing treatment strategies for human cognitive dysfunctions. In this commentary, different aspects of animal models of memory dysfunction will be discussed relative to their ability to assess the structural and functional consequences of central nervous system (CNS) repair.
