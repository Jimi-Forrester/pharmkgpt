17943614|t|Motion analysis in delirium: a novel method of clarifying motoric subtypes.
17943614|a|The usefulness of motor subtypes of delirium is unclear due to inconsistency in subtyping methods and a lack of validation with objective measures of motor activity levels. We studied patients with hyperactive, hypoactive, and mixed presentations of delirium were studied with 24-h accelerometer-based monitoring. The procedures were well tolerated and motor presentations were readily distinguished using the accelerometer-based measurements. The system was capable of identifying static versus dynamic activity and the frequency of changes in posture. Electronic motion analysis concurs with observed gross movement and can distinguish motorically defined subtypes according to quantitative and qualitative aspects of movement.
