23413581|a|In the alkaloid galanthamine, the plant family Amaryllidaceae has endowed the pharmaceutical community with a potent and selective inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholinestersae (AChE), of prominence in the chemotherapeutic approach towards motor neuron diseases. Following on the commercial success of this prescription drug in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, it is anticipated that other drug candidates will in future emerge from the family. In this regard, the phenanthridones, exemplified by narciclasine and pancratistatin, of the lycorine series of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids have shown much promise as remarkably potent and selective anticancer agents, with a drug target of the series destined for the clinical market within the next decade. Given these interesting biological properties and their natural abundance, plants of the Amaryllidaceae have provided a diverse and accessible platform for phytochemical-based drug discovery. The crinane series of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids are also enriched with a significant array of biological properties. As a consequence of their close structural similarity to the anticancer agents of the lycorine series, the cytotoxic potential of crinane alkaloids has been realized through structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies involving targets of both semi-synthetic and natural origin, which has identified several members as leads with promising antiproliferative profiles. As the first of its kind, this review seeks to collate such information from the past few decades in advancing the crinane group as a viable platform for anticancer drug discovery.
