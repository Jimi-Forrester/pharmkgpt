38051740|t|Research protocol of the efficacy of probiotics for the treatment of alcohol use disorder among adult males: A comparison with placebo and acceptance and commitment therapy in a randomized controlled trial.
38051740|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Primarily, this study compares the efficacy of probiotic and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) in alleviating the severity of alcohol craving and alcohol use disorder (AUD) among patients who had undergo two weeks of in-patient detoxification. Secondarily, this study compares the efficacy of probiotic and ACT in mitigating the severity of comorbid depression and anxiety symptoms; decreasing serum level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha); changing the event-related potential in electroencephalogram (EEG) and restoring microbiota flora in the gut of AUD patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Initially, during Phase I of the study, the serum level of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha; ERP changes in the EEG and fecal microbiota content will be compared between 120 AUD patients and 120 healthy controls. Subsequently in Phase II of the study, 120 AUD patients will be randomized by stratified permuted block randomization into the probiotic, ACT and placebo groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. Participants in the probiotic and placebo groups will be administered one sachet per day of Lactobacillus spp. probiotic and placebo, respectively for 12 weeks. While those in the ACT group will receive one session per week of ACT for 8 weeks. Outcome measures will be administered at four timepoints, such as t0 = baseline assessment prior to intervention, t1 = 8 weeks after intervention began, t2 = 12 weeks after intervention and t3 = 24 weeks after intervention. Primary outcomes are the degrees of alcohol craving, alcohol withdrawal during abstinence and AUD. Secondary outcomes to be assessed are the severity of co-morbid depression and anxiety symptoms; the serum levels of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha; changes in ERP and fecal microbiota content.
