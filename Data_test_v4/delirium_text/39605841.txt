39605841|a|The optimal corticosteroids dose in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requiring high oxygen remains unknown. In this retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 requiring high oxygen and receiving corticosteroids, the efficacy, safety, and duration of high-dose treatment were evaluated. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality during follow-up. Safety outcomes included infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and venous thromboembolic events. 210 patients were included, with 126 in Group A (corticosteroids at a equivalent dose <1 mg/kg/d prednisone), 44 in Group B (corticosteroids at a equivalent dose >=1 mg/kg/d prednisone for <=5 days), and 40 in Group C (corticosteroids at a equivalent dose >=1 mg/kg/d prednisone for >5 days). The all-cause mortality risk was lower in Group C but higher in Group B than in Group A. Safety outcomes did not differ significantly, except for Group C, which had the highest venous thromboembolism rate. Our results suggest that high-dose corticosteroids for a longer course decrease mortality with comparable safety outcome.
