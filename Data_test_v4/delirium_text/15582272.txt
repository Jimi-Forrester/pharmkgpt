15582272|t|Estrogen and the brain: beyond ER-alpha and ER-beta.
15582272|a|17beta-Estradiol is a greatly under-appreciated neural growth and trophic factor for the mammalian brain of all ages. Like other growth factors, such as the neurotrophins, 17beta-estradiol influences neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, and neuronal survival of its targets throughout life. Estrogen elicits developmentally regulated differentiative effects, which are not normally seen in the adult brain. However, re-expression of this developmental response occurs in the adult, following loss of trophic support, whether induced by estrogen deprivation or brain injury. In addition to the classical intranuclear estrogen receptors (ER) ER-alpha and ER-beta, we have recently identified a novel, plasma membrane-associated, putative ER that is neither ER-alpha nor ER-beta, which we have designated 'ER-X'. ER-X is a developmentally regulated estrogen-binding protein, present in wild-type, ER-alpha gene-disrupted (alphaERKO) and ER-alpha null mice, which is re-expressed following ischemic brain injury. The preferred ligand of ER-X is 17alpha-estradiol. Although ER-X shares some homology with the C-terminus of ER-alpha, it is not an alternative splicing variant and may be a new gene. While ER-X appears to mediate 17alpha- and 17beta-estradiol activation of the MAPK cascade, ER-alpha, in contrast, is inhibitory to its activation. Estradiol activation of MAPK/ERK may be particularly relevant for neuroprotection during aging and Alzheimer's disease.
