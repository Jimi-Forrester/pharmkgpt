23741624|a|As a neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia found in the aging population. Immunotherapy with passive or active immunizations targeting amyloid beta (Abeta) build-up in the brain may provide a possible treatment option and may help prevent AD from progressing. A number of passive immunizations with anti-Abeta42 antibodies are in different phases of clinical trials. One active immunization approach, AN-1792, was stopped after the development of autoimmune encephalitis in 6% of patients and a second one, CAD106, in which a small Abeta epitope is used, is currently in safety and tolerability studies. Besides active immunizations with proteins or peptides, active immunizations using DNA which codes for the protein against which the immune response will be directed, so called genetic immunizations, provide additional safety as the immune response in DNA immunizations differs quantitatively and qualitatively from the response elicited by peptide immunizations. In this review, we summarize our data using DNA Abeta42 immunizations in mouse models and discuss the results together with the results presented by other groups working on a DNA vaccine as treatment option for AD.
