27212113|t|Finding novel distinctions between the sAPPalpha-mediated anabolic biochemical pathways in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Fragile X Syndrome plasma and brain tissue.
27212113|a|UNLABELLED: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Fragile X syndrome (FXS) are developmental disorders. No validated blood-based biomarkers exist for either, which impedes bench-to-bedside approaches. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) precursor protein (APP) and metabolites are usually associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). APP cleavage by alpha-secretase produces potentially neurotrophic secreted APPalpha (sAPPalpha) and the P3 peptide fragment. beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1) cleavage produces secreted APPbeta (sAPPbeta) and intact Abeta. Excess Abeta is potentially neurotoxic and can lead to atrophy of brain regions such as amygdala in AD. By contrast, amygdala is enlarged in ASD but not FXS. We previously reported elevated levels of sAPPalpha in ASD and FXS vs. CONTROLS: We now report elevated plasma Abeta and total APP levels in FXS compared to both ASD and typically developing controls, and elevated levels of sAPPalpha in ASD and FXS vs. CONTROLS: By contrast, plasma and brain sAPPbeta and Abeta were lower in ASD vs. controls but elevated in FXS plasma vs. CONTROLS: We also detected age-dependent increase in an alpha-secretase in ASD brains. We report a novel mechanistic difference in APP pathways between ASD (processing) and FXS (expression) leading to distinct APP metabolite profiles in these two disorders. These novel, distinctive biochemical differences between ASD and FXS pave the way for blood-based biomarkers for ASD and FXS.
