30863682|a|BACKGROUND: High-yielding dairy cows are prone to oxidative stress due to the high metabolic needs of homeostasis and milk production. Oxidative stress and inflammation are tightly linked; therefore, anti-inflammatory and/or natural antioxidant compounds may help improve mammary cell health. Baicalin, one of the major flavonoids in Scutellaria baicalensis, has natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in various cell types, but its effects on bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs) have not been investigated. METHODS: Explants from bovine mammary glands were collected by biopsy at the peak of lactation (approximately 60 days after the start of lactation) (n = three animals) to isolate BMECs corresponding to mature secretory cells. Cell viability, apoptosis, proliferative capacity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by BMECs were measured after increasing doses of baicalin were added to the culture media in the absence or presence of H2O2, which was used as an in vitro model of oxidative stress. RESULTS: Low doses of baicalin (1-10 microg/mL) had no or only slightly positive effects on the proliferation and viability of BMECs, whereas higher doses (100 or 200 microg/mL) markedly decreased BMEC proliferation. Baicalin decreased apoptosis rate at low concentrations (10 microg/mL) but increased apoptosis at higher doses. ROS production was decreased in BMECs treated with increasing doses of baicalin compared with untreated cells, and this decreased production was associated with increased intracellular concentrations of catalase and NRF-2. Irrespective of the dose, baicalin pretreatment attenuated H2O2-induced ROS production. DISCUSSION: These results indicate that baicalin exerts protective antioxidant effects on bovine mammary cells. This finding suggests that baicalin could be used to prevent oxidative metabolic disorders in dairy cows.
