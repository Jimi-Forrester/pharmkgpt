11394721|a|The effects of Alzheimer's disease (AD) on the organization of semantic knowledge (i.e., the semantic network) for living (e.g., animals) and non-living (e.g., tools) categories was examined. Multidimensional scaling and Pathfinder analyses of data from triadic comparison tasks showed that the semantic network for "animals", but not the network for "tools", was abnormal in patients with AD. Specifically, patients with AD tended to use a different primary dimension than control subjects for categorizing animals and their network was characterized by atypical associations between concepts. The differences in the integrity of the AD patients' networks for "animals" and "tools" was not likely to be an artifact of differences in the difficulty in identifying the stimuli in the two categories as all stimuli were identified on simple naming or matching tasks. These findings support the results of previous studies that have shown the presence of category-specific semantic deficits in patients with AD.
