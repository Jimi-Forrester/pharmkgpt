36836579|t|Evaluation of the Association between Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) and All-Cause Mortality in Geriatric Patients with Hip Fractures: A Prospective Cohort Study of 339 Patients.
36836579|a|BACKGROUND: Many factors affect the prognosis of hip fractures in the elderly. Some studies have suggested a direct or indirect association among serum lipid levels, osteoporosis, and hip fracture risk. LDL levels were found to have a statistically significant nonlinear U-shaped relationship with hip fracture risk. However, the relationship between serum LDL levels and the prognosis of patients with hip fractures remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the influence of serum LDL levels on patient mortality over a long-term follow-up period. METHODS: Elderly patients with hip fractures were screened between January 2015 and September 2019, and their demographic and clinical characteristics were collected. Linear and nonlinear multivariate Cox regression models were used to identify the association between LDL levels and mortality. Analyses were performed using Empower Stats and R software. RESULTS: Overall, 339 patients with a mean follow-up period of 34.17 months were included in this study. Ninety-nine patients (29.20%) died due to all-cause mortality. Linear multivariate Cox regression models showed that LDL levels were associated with mortality (HR = 0.69, 95%CI: 0.53, 0.91, p = 0.0085) after adjusting for confounding factors. However, the linear association was unstable, and nonlinearity was identified. An LDL concentration of 2.31 mmol/L was defined as the inflection point for prediction. A LDL level < 2.31 mmol/L was associated with mortality (HR = 0.42, 95%CI: 0.25, 0.69, p = 0.0006), whereas LDL > 2.31 mmol/L was not a risk factor for mortality (HR = 1.06, 95%CI: 0.70, 1.63, p = 0.7722). CONCLUSIONS: The preoperative LDL level was nonlinearly associated with mortality in elderly patients with hip fractures, and the LDL level was a risk indicator of mortality. Furthermore, 2.31 mmol/L could be considered a predictor cut-off for risk.
