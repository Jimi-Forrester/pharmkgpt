34801648|t|TO901317 activation of LXR-dependent pathways mitigate amyloid-beta peptide-induced neurotoxicity in 3D human neural stem cell culture scaffolds and AD mice.
34801648|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major cause of neurodegeneration worldwide and is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) in the brain, which is associated with neuronal loss and cognitive impairment. Liver X receptor (LXR), a critical nuclear receptor, and major regulator in lipid metabolism and inflammation, is suggested to play a protective role against the mitochondrial dysfunction noted in AD. In our study, our established 3D gelatin scaffold model and a well characterized in vivo (APP/PS1) murine model of AD were used to directly investigate the molecular, biochemical and behavioral effects of neuronal stem cell exposure to Abeta to improve understanding of the in vivo etiology of AD. Herein, human neural stem cells (hNSCs) in our 3D model were exposed to Abeta, and had significantly decreased cell viability, which correlated with decreased mRNA and protein expression of LXR, Bcl-2, CREB, PGC1alpha, NRF-1, and Tfam, and increased caspase 3 and 9 activities. Cotreatment with a synthetic agonist of LXR (TO901317) significantly abrogated these Abeta-mediated effects in hNSCs. Moreover, TO901317 cotreatment both significantly rescues hNSCs from Abeta-mediated decreases in ATP levels and mitochondrial mass, and significantly restores Abeta-induced fragmented mitochondria to almost normal morphology. TO901317 cotreatment also decreases tau aggregates in Abeta-treated hNSCs. Importantly, TO901317 treatment significantly alleviates the impairment of memory, decreases Abeta aggregates and increases proteasome activity in APP/PS1 mice; whereas, these effects were blocked by cotreatment with an LXR antagonist (GSK2033). Together, these novel results improve our mechanistic understanding of the central role of LXR in Abeta-mediated hNSC dysfunction. We also provide preclinical data unveiling the protective effects of using an LXR-dependent agonist, TO901317, to block the toxicity observed in Abeta-exposed hNSCs, which may guide future treatment strategies to slow or prevent neurodegeneration in some AD patients.
