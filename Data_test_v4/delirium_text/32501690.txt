32501690|t|Fragment-based Differential Targeting of PPI Stabilizer Interfaces.
32501690|a|Stabilization of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) holds great potential for therapeutic agents, as illustrated by the successful drugs rapamycin and lenalidomide. However, how such interface-binding molecules can be created in a rational, bottom-up manner is a largely unanswered question. We report here how a fragment-based approach can be used to identify chemical starting points for the development of small-molecule stabilizers that differentiate between two different PPI interfaces of the adapter protein 14-3-3. The fragments discriminately bind to the interface of 14-3-3 with the recognition motif of either the tumor suppressor protein p53 or the oncogenic transcription factor TAZ. This X-ray crystallography driven study shows that the rim of the interface of individual 14-3-3 complexes can be targeted in a differential manner with fragments that represent promising starting points for the development of specific 14-3-3 PPI stabilizers.
