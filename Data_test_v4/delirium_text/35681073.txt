35681073|t|Dietary restriction ameliorates TBI-induced phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster.
35681073|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects millions annually and is associated with long-term health decline. TBI also shares molecular and cellular hallmarks with neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), typically increasing in prevalence with age, and is a major risk factor for developing neurodegeneration later in life. While our understanding of genes and pathways that underlie neurotoxicity in specific NDs has advanced, we still lack a complete understanding of early molecular and physiological changes that drive neurodegeneration, particularly as an individual ages following a TBI. Recently Drosophila has been introduced as a model organism for studying closed-head TBI. In this paper, we deliver a TBI to flies early in adult life, and then measure molecular and physiological phenotypes at short-, mid-, and long-term timepoints following the injury. We aim to identify the timing of changes that contribute to neurodegeneration. Here we confirm prior work demonstrating a TBI-induced decline in lifespan, and present evidence of a progressive decline in locomotor function, robust acute and modest chronic neuroinflammation, and a late-onset increase in protein aggregation. We also present evidence of metabolic dysfunction, in the form of starvation sensitivity and decreased lipids, that persists beyond the immediate injury response, but does not differ long-term. An intervention of dietary restriction (DR) partially ameliorates some TBI-induced phenotypes, including lifespan and locomotor function, though it does not alter the pattern of starvation sensitivity of injured flies. In the future, molecular pathways identified as altered following TBI-particularly in the short-, or mid-term-could present potential therapeutic targets.
