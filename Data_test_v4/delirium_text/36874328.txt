36874328|t|Diagnostic Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) for Abdominal Pain: A Case of Tumefactive Sludge.
36874328|a|Biliary sludge is an extremely viscous sediment, consisting essentially of calcium bilirubinate granules and cholesterol crystals, which, due to its high viscosity, has poor and slow movement, leading to a mass-like configuration called tumefactive biliary sludge. Tumefactive sludge was first described with the advent of ultrasonography in the 1970s and is an uncommon intraluminal lesion of the gallbladder (GB). The differential diagnoses for an echogenic mass in the GB lumen include GB carcinoma, tumefactive sludge, and gangrenous cholecystitis. Ultrasonography is the election method for the screening of GB diseases, with diagnostic accuracy exceeding 90%. The point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has shown a major improvement in the evaluation of hepatobiliary diseases. POCUS allows the detection of GB wall thickness, pericholestatic fluid, sonographic Murphy's sign, and dilatation of the common bile duct. The authors present a case of abdominal pain caused by the presence of tumefactive sludge in the GB, in which POCUS helped establish the diagnosis and therapeutic guidance.
