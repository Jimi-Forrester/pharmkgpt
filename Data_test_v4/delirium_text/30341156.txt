30341156|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical phenotype, gray matter atrophy patterns, and small vessel disease in patients who developed prodromal or probable Alzheimer disease dementia, despite carrying the protective APOEepsilon2 allele. METHODS: We included 36 beta-amyloid-positive (by CSF or PET) APOEepsilon2 carriers (all epsilon2/epsilon3) with mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to Alzheimer disease who were matched for age and diagnosis (ratio 1:2) to APOEepsilon3 homozygotes and APOEepsilon4 carriers (70% epsilon3/epsilon4 and 30% epsilon4/epsilon4). We assessed neuropsychological performance across 4 cognitive domains (memory, attention, executive, and language functions), performed voxelwise and region of interest analyses of gray matter atrophy on T1-weighted MRI, used fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images to automatically quantify white matter hyperintensity volumes, and assessed T2*-weighted images to identify microbleeds. Differences in cognitive domain scores, atrophy, and white matter hyperintensities between epsilon2 carriers, epsilon3 homozygotes, and epsilon4 carriers were assessed using analysis of variance analyses, and Pearson chi2 tests were used to examine differences in prevalence of microbleeds. RESULTS: We found that epsilon2 carriers performed worse on nonmemory domains compared to both epsilon3 homozygotes and epsilon4 carriers but better on memory compared to epsilon4 carriers. Voxelwise T1-weighted MRI analyses showed asymmetric (left > right) temporoparietal-predominant atrophy with subtly less involvement of medial-temporal structures in epsilon2 carriers compared to epsilon4 carriers. Finally, epsilon2 carriers had larger total white matter hyperintensity volumes compared to epsilon4 carriers (mean 10.4 vs 7.3 mL) and a higher prevalence of microbleeds compared to epsilon3 homozygotes (37.5% vs 18.3%). CONCLUSION: APOEepsilon2 carriers who develop Alzheimer disease despite carrying the protective allele display a nonamnestic clinical phenotype with more severe small vessel disease.
