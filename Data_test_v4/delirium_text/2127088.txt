2127088|t|A monoclonal antibody Hy20-54-16-3L to lambda (lambda) light chain of human immunoglobulin reacts with amyloid in Alzheimer's disease brain.
2127088|a|We have previously described a monoclonal antibody Hy20-54-16-3L raised against crude primary (AL) amyloid fibrils that preferentially labelled amyloid deposits in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Ishii et al., Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol., 12 (1986) 441-445). In the present study, we analyzed the protein from an AL-amyloid laden spleen by gel filtration and SDS-PAGE; a partial amino acid sequence of the Hy20-54-16-3L-immunoreactive band excised from Western blots was determined and found to be a lambda light chain of human immunoglobulins. Additionally we have confirmed that this monoclonal antibody reacts with amyloid in AD brain by using a peroxidase-linked immunoelectron microscope technique. It is concluded that an epitope shared with a lambda light chain is included in or associated with amyloid deposits in the AD brain.
