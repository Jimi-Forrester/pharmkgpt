37226868|t|Association of preoperative nutritional status evaluated by the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score with walking independence at 180 days postoperatively: a prospective cohort study in Chinese older patients with hip fracture.
37226868|a|BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is significantly associated with unfavourable outcomes, but there is little high-level evidence to elucidate the association of malnutrition with losing walking independence (LWI) after hip fracture surgery. This study aimed to assess the association between preoperative nutritional status evaluated by the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score and walking independence at 180 days postoperatively in Chinese older hip fracture patients. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 1958 eligible cases from the SSIOS database. The restricted cubic spline (RCS) was used to assess the dose-effect relationship between the CONUT score and recovery of walking independence. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to balance potential preoperative confounders, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to assess the association between malnutrition and LWI with perioperative factors for further adjustment. Furthermore, inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) and sensitivity analyses were performed to test robustness of the results and the Fine and Grey hazard model was applied to adjust the competing risk of death. Subgroup analyses were used to determine potential population heterogeneity. RESULTS: We found a negative relationship between the preoperative CONUT score and recovery of walking independence at 180 days postoperatively, and that moderate-to-severe malnutrition evaluated by the CONUT score was independently associated with a 1.42-fold (95%CI, 1.12-1.80; P=0.004) increased risk of LWI. The results were overall robust. And in the Fine and Grey hazard model, the result was still statistically significant despite the apparent decrease in the risk estimate from 1.42 to 1.21. Furthermore, significant heterogeneities were observed in the subgroups of age, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, Charlson's comorbidity index (CCI) and surgical delay (P for interaction < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Preoperative malnutrition is a significant risk factor for LWI after hip fracture surgery, and nutrition screening on admission would generate potential health benefits.
