34101282|t|The intact parasympathetic nerve promotes submandibular gland regeneration through ductal cell proliferation.
34101282|a|OBJECTIVES: Salivary gland regeneration is closely related to the parasympathetic nerve; however, the mechanism behind this relationship is still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the parasympathetic nerve and morphological differences during salivary gland regeneration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a duct ligation/deligation-induced submandibular gland regeneration model of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The regenerated submandibular gland with or without chorda lingual (CL) innervation was detected by haematoxylin-eosin staining, real-time PCR (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. We counted the number of Ki67-positive cells to reveal the proliferation process that occurs during gland regeneration. Finally, we examined the expression of the following markers: aquaporin 5, cytokeratin 7, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and polysialyltransferases. RESULTS: Intact parasympathetic innervation promoted submandibular gland regeneration. The process of gland regeneration was significantly repressed by cutting off the CL nerve. During gland regeneration, Ki67-positive cells were mainly found in the ductal structures. Moreover, the expression of NCAM and polysialyltransferases-1 (PST) expression in the innervation group was significantly increased during early regeneration and decreased in the late stages. In the denervated submandibular glands, the expression of NCAM decreased during regeneration. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that the regeneration of submandibular glands with intact parasympathetic innervation was associated with duct cell proliferation and the increased expression of PST and NCAM.
