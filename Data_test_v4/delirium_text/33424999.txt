33424999|a|Since aging-related diseases, including dementia, represent major public health threats to our society, physician-scientists must develop innovative, interdisciplinary strategies to open new avenues for development of alternative therapies. One such novel approach may lie in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Gastrodia elata Blume (G. elata, tianma) is a TCM frequently used for treatment of cerebrocardiovascular diseases (CCVDs). Recent studies of G. elata-based treatment modalities, which have investigated its pharmacologically relevant activity, potential efficacy, and safety, have employed G. elata in well-characterized, aging-related disease models, with a focus on models of aging-related dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, I examine results from previous studies of G. elata, as well as related herbal preparations and pure natural products, as prophylaxis and remedies for aging-related CCVDs and dementia. Concluding, data suggest that tianma treatment may be used as a promising complementary therapy for AD.
