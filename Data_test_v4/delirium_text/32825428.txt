32825428|t|Antipsychotic Drugs in Prevention of Postoperative Delirium-What Is Known in 2020?
32825428|a|Delirium is one of the most frequently reported neuropsychiatric complications in the perioperative period, especially in the population of elderly patients who often suffer from numerous comorbidities undergoing extensive or urgent surgery. It can affect up to 80% of patients who require hospitalization in an intensive care setting postoperatively. Delirium increases mortality, morbidity, length of hospital stay, and cost of treatment. An episode of delirium in the acute phase may lower the general quality of life and increases the risk of cognitive decline long-term. Since pharmacological treatment of delirium is not highly effective, focus of research has shifted towards developing preventive strategies. We aimed to perform a review of the topic based on the most recent literature. We conclude that, based on the available data, it seems impossible to make strong recommendations for using antipsychotic drugs in prophylaxis. Further research should answer the question what, if any, benefit patients receive from the pharmacological prevention of delirium, and which agents should be used.
