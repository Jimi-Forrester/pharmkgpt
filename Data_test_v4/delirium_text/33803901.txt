33803901|t|The Impact of Sex on Arterial Ischemic Stroke in Young Patients: From Stroke Occurrence to Poststroke Consequences.
33803901|a|The male sex has been suggested to predominate in paediatric patients with arterial ischemic stroke (AIS), especially in newborns. The explanation for this phenomenon remains unsatisfactory since it focuses on the analysis of the potential relationship with trauma and arterial dissection. In turn, in some populations of young adults, men suffer from AIS more frequently than women, which may be related to the protective role of oestrogen. On the other hand, certain data indicate that women dominate over men. Some of the disparities in the frequencies of particular symptoms of AIS and poststroke consequences in both children and young adults have been suggested; however, data are scarce. Unfortunately, the low number of studies on the subject does not allow certain conclusions to be drawn. For adults, more data are available for patients aged over 60 years, the results of which are more obvious. The present literature review aimed to discuss available data on the prevalence of AIS, its clinical presentations, and poststroke consequences in regard to the sex of young patients. We considered young patients to be children from birth up to the age of 19 years of life and young adults to be individuals up to the age of 55 years. The role of sex hormones in AIS and possible gender differences in genetic risk factors for AIS were also discussed briefly.
