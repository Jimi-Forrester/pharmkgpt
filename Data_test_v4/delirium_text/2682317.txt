2682317|t|Beta-amyloid deposition and paired helical filament formation: which histopathological feature is more significant in Alzheimer's disease?
2682317|a|Clinicopathological, biochemical, immunochemical and molecular biological studies of beta amyloid and neurofibrillary changes have been recently described by this and other laboratories. Although amyloid deposition is present in every AD brain, it is also present, sometimes in great quantities, in nondemented individuals. On the other hand, paired helical filament formation in perikarya (neurofibrillary tangles) and the neuropil of the cerebrum appears to be the histopathological feature that is most characteristic of AD.
