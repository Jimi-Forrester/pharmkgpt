32583983|a|INTRODUCTION: Spontaneous ventriculomegaly has been observed in rats that were presumed normal. Because the external phenotype of these animals is unremarkable, they can be inadvertently included in behavioral experiments, despite the considerable enlargement of the ventricular system, reduced cortical thickness, and hippocampal atrophy upon imaging. Given the role of such structures in memory consolidation, we evaluated long-term memory retention while decision making in rats with spontaneous ventriculomegaly. METHODS: We studied adult male Sprague Dawley rats, identified as having spontaneous ventriculomegaly, while performing baseline magnetic resonance imaging scanning intended for a different research protocol. Control (n = 7) and experimental (n = 6) animals were submitted to a delayed-alternation task (no delay, 30, 60, and 180 s) and an object-in-context recognition task. During the first task, we evaluated the number of correct choices as well as the latency to reach any of the cavities located at the end of each branch arm during each trial. The second task assessed the rodents' ability to remember where they had previously encountered a specific object, calculating the context recognition index. RESULTS: When compared to control animals, rats with spontaneous ventriculomegaly required significantly more training sessions to reach the 80% criterion during the training phase. Moreover, they showed reduced delayed-alternation performance in the evaluated times, reaching significance only at 180 s. Increased latencies while trying to reach the cavity were also observed. Evaluation of the long-term memory formation during the object-in-context recognition task showed that subjects with ventriculomegaly spent less time investigating the familiar object, resulting in a significantly decreased recognition index value. CONCLUSION: Our results are the first to show how spontaneous ventriculomegaly-induced cerebral structural damage affects decision-making behaviors, particularly when comparing between immediate and delayed trials. Moreover, this lesion disrupts the animals' ability to recall or express contextual information.
