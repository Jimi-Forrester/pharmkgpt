38196645|a|Background: Beyond mere prognostication, optimal biomarkers of aging provide insights into qualitative and quantitative features of biological aging and might therefore offer useful information for the testing and ultimately clinical use of gerotherapeutics. Using a large proteomic cohort in the UK Biobank (UKB), we aimed to develop a proteomic aging clock for all-cause mortality risk as a proxy of biological age (BA). Methods: Participants in the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKB PPP) were included with ages between 39 and 70 years (n=53,021). Data were split into a training (70%, n=37,115) and a test set (30%, n=15,906), including 2,923 plasma proteins assessed using the Olink Explore 3072 assay . We developed a proteomic aging clock (PAC) for all-cause mortality risk as a surrogate of BA using a combination of Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) penalized Cox regression and Gompertz proportional hazards models. The validation for PAC included assessing its age-adjusted associations with, and predictions for all-cause mortality and 18 incident diseases, and head-to-head comparisons with two biological age measures (PhenoAge and BioAge) and leukocyte telomere length (LTL). Additionally, a functional analysis was performed to identify gene sets and tissues enriched with genes associated with BA deviation, based on different BA measures. Findings: The Spearman correlation between PAC proteomic age and chronological age was 0.76. 10.9% of the combined training and test samples died during a mean follow-up of 13.3 years (SD=2.2), with the mean age at death 70.1 years (SD=8.1). PAC proteomic age, after controlling for age and other covariates, showed stronger associations than PhenoAge, BioAge, and LTL, with mortality and multiple incident diseases in the test set sample and in disease-free participants, such as mortality, heart failure, pneumonia, delirium, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and dementia. Additionally, PAC proteomic age showed higher predictive power for the conditions above compared to chronological age, PhenoAge, and BioAge, based on Harrell's C-statistics. Proteins associated with PAC proteomic age deviation (from chronological age) are enriched in various hallmarks of biological aging, including immunoinflammatory responses, cellular senescence, extracellular matrix remodeling, cellular response to stressors, and vascular biology. Interpretation: PAC showed robust age-adjusted associations and predictions for all-cause mortality and the onset of various diseases. The diverse hallmark gene sets linked with PAC proteomic age deviation highlight the potential efficacy of geroscience-guided interventions. Further validation is essential to ascertain the use of PAC across different settings.
