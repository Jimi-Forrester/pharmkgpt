19445320|a|Several studies have indicated that oxidative stress is a major risk factor for the initiation and progression of neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's (AD). Therefore, reducing oxidative stress appears to be a rational choice for the prevention and reduction in the rate of progression of these neurological disorders. The brain utilizes about 25% of respired oxygen even though it represents only 5% of the body weight. Free radicals are generated during the normal intake of oxygen, during infection, and during normal oxidative metabolism of certain substrates. Although experimental data are consistent in demonstrating the neuroprotective effects of antioxidants in vitro and in animal models, the clinical evidence that antioxidant agents may prevent or slow the course of these diseases is still relatively unsatisfactory, and insufficient to strongly modify clinical practice. In this paper, natural possible substances that could be added to a beverage to prevent or decrease the developing of neurodegenerative diseases are reviewed.
