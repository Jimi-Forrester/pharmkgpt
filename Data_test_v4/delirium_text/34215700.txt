34215700|t|Progressive supranuclear palsy: diagnosis and management.
34215700|a|Treating patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is both effective and rewarding. This review aims to share our experience in the proactive management of PSP, considering the patient, the family and the medical context in which the illness unfolds. There are many opportunities to assist your patients, ameliorate their symptoms, reduce their risks and harm, and guide them through the complex medical, social and legal minefield that characterises life with chronic neurological illness. We summarise the challenges of early diagnosis, consider PSP mimics and the role of investigations in excluding these, and discuss the available pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment strategies to tackle the common and challenging symptoms of PSP. The best treatment will be patient centred and as part of a multidisciplinary team.
