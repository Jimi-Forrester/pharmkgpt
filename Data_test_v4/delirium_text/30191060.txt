30191060|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, with progressive onset of clinical symptoms. The main pathological hallmarks are brain deposits of extracellular amyloid beta plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Cerebrospinal fluid reflects pathological changes in the brain; amyloid beta 1-42 is a marker of amyloid plaques, while total and phosphorylated tau are markers of NFT formation. Additional biomarkers associated with disease pathogenesis are needed, for better prognosis, more specific diagnosis, prediction of disease severity and progression and for improved patient classification in clinical trials. The aim of the present study was to evaluate brain-specific proteins as potential biomarkers of progression of AD. Methods: Overall, 30 candidate proteins were quantified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild, moderate and severe AD dementia (n=101) using mass spectrometry-based selected reaction monitoring assays. ELISA was used for neuronal pentraxin receptor-1 (NPTXR) confirmation. Results: The best discrimination between MCI and more advanced AD stages (moderate and severe dementia) was observed for protein NPTXR (area under the curve, AUC=0.799). A statistically different abundance of this protein was observed between the two groups, with severe AD patients having progressively lower levels (p<0.05). ELISA confirmed lower levels in AD, in a separate cohort that included controls, MCI and AD patients. Conclusions: We conclude that NPTXR protein in CSF is a novel potential biomarker of AD progression and could have important utility in assessing treatment success in clinical trials.
