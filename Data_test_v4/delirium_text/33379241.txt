33379241|t|Long Non-Coding RNAs in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.
33379241|a|Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoid malignancy in adults. Although significant progress has been made in recent years to treat DLBCL patients, 30%-40% of the patients eventually relapse or are refractory to first line treatment, calling for better therapeutic strategies for DLBCL. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as a highly diverse group of non-protein coding transcripts with intriguing molecular functions in human disease, including cancer. Here, we review the current understanding of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis and progression of DLBCL to provide an overview of the field. As the current knowledge of lncRNAs in DLBCL is still in its infancy, we provide molecular signatures of lncRNAs in DLBCL cell lines to assist further lncRNA research in DLBCL.
