31002611|a|Previous studies showed that some mushrooms are highly efficient in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase and tyrosinase, the increased activity of which can trigger the development of Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. Starting from the fact that free radicals at high concentrations could cause neurodegenerative disorders as well as great interest in new, natural antineurodegenerative drugs, the goal of this study was to determine the in vitro antioxidative and neuroprotective potentials of various Pleurotus ostreatus and Laetiporus sulphureus extracts. L. sulphureus was a better antioxidative agent; it showed higher reducing power, was a more efficient scavenger of DPPH and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radicals, and was an Fe3+ reducer. The most efficient acetylcholinesterase inhibitor was hot water extract of P. ostreatus fruiting body, which was slightly weaker than the commercial preparation, galantamine. However, in comparison with alpha-kojic acid, tested extracts were weaker tyrosinase inhibitors. Considering that tested extracts were rich in phenols and that their amounts were in positive correlation with the extent of radical neutralization and acetylcholinesterase and tyrosinase inhibition, it is assumed that these compounds are the potential carriers of the neuroprotective activities. Owing to the significant antioxidative and antineurodegenerative capacity of these species, they can be suggested as novel nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals.
