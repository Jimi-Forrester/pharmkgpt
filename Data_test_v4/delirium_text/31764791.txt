31764791|a|After acute hip surgery, the 1-year mortality rate is high. Therefore, this study evaluated the risk factors for 1-year mortality. The purposes of this study was first to examine the effect of integrated care on 1-year mortality in surgical patients and secondly to explore magnitude of comorbidity and complication on mortality.This retrospective cohort study included 313 patients received surgery for hip fragility fracture. Patients with multiple fractures or combined trauma were excluded. The patients were grouping into integrated (n = 106) and non-integrated care group (n = 207) models. Univariate and multiple Cox regression were used to examine effect of care model, comorbidity, and complication event.One-year mortality in integrated and non-integrated patients was 4.7% and 14.0% respectively. After adjustments, patients in non-integrated care, have 2.89 times (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-7.81) likely to die 1-year after discharged.Patients had elevated comorbidity or postoperative complications contributed to the mortality. Our study found the effect of patients treated by integrated care models, compared with usual model, significantly reduced 1-year mortality rate. Appropriated treatment of comorbidities during hospitalization and after discharge is critical to post-surgical survival. The findings imply that the co-care for hip fracture of hip surgical patients with orthogeriatricians is strongly recommended, particularly for those with >3 comorbidities.
