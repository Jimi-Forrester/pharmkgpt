26045787|t|Screening of APP interaction proteins by DUALmembrane yeast two-hybrid system.
26045787|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of neurodegenerative disease. There is a growing interest in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) over the years due to its involvement in AD. Besides its role in pathological mechanisms of AD, APP participates in many signaling pathways as well. APP functions through protein-protein interactions, and in this report staufen 1 (STAU1) is demonstrated to have interaction with APP, using yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation in mammalian system. STAU1 belongs to the double-stranded RNA binding protein family and can mediate mRNA degradation in mammalian system, implicating that APP may be involved in the regulation of mRNA as well.
