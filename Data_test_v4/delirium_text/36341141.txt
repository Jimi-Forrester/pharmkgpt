36341141|t|Hyperhomocysteinemia dysregulates plasma levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids-derived eicosanoids.
36341141|a|Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) contributes to the incidence of many cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Our group have previously established crucial roles of eicosanoids and homocysteine in the incidence of vascular injury in diabetic retinopathy and renal injury. Using cystathionine-beta-synthase heterozygous mice (cbetas+/-) as a model of HHcy, the current study was designed to determine the impact of homocysteine on circulating levels of lipid mediators derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Plasma samples were isolated from wild-type (WT) and cbetas+/- mice for the assessment of eicosanoids levels using LC/MS. Plasma 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) activity significantly decreased in cbetas+/- vs. WT control mice. LOX-derived metabolites from both omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA were also reduced in cbetas+/- mice compared to WT control (P < 0.05). Contrary to LOX metabolites, cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolites from omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA were significantly elevated in cbetas+/- mice compared to WT control. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are epoxides derived from arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism by CYP with anti-inflammatory properties and are known to limit vascular injury, however their physiological role is limited by their rapid degradation by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to their corresponding diols (DiHETrEs). In cbetas+/- mice, a significant decrease in the plasma EETs bioavailability was obvious as evident by the decrease in EETs/ DiHETrEs ratio relative to WT control mice. Cyclooxygenase (COX) metabolites were also significantly decreased in cbetas+/- vs. WT control mice. These data suggest that HHcy impacts eicosanoids metabolism through decreasing LOX and COX metabolic activities while increasing CYP metabolic activity. The increase in AA metabolism by CYP was also associated with increase in sEH activity and decrease in EETs bioavailability. Dysregulation of eicosanoids metabolism could be a contributing factor to the incidence and progression of HHcy-induced CVD.
