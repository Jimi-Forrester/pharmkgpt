1789913|t|Progressive nonfluent aphasia with dementia: a case report.
1789913|a|We report a patient with progressive nonfluent aphasia and mild dementia. On 9-month follow-up evaluation, there was significant deterioration in both language and cognition. Unlike in Alzheimer's disease, the aphasia was of the Broca's type. In contrast with primary progressive aphasia, a dementia was present and the cognitive and language decline showed a rather rapid course.
