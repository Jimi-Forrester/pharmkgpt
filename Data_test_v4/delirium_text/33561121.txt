33561121|a|Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant health problem worldwide with poor prognosis. Drug repositioning represents a profitable strategy to accelerate drug discovery in the treatment of HCC. In this study, we developed a new approach for predicting therapeutic drugs for HCC based on tissue-specific pathways and identified three newly predicted drugs that are likely to be therapeutic drugs for the treatment of HCC. We validated these predicted drugs by analyzing their overlapping drug indications reported in PubMed literature. By using the cancer cell line data in the database, we constructed a Connectivity Map (CMap) profile similarity analysis and KEGG enrichment analysis on their related genes. By experimental validation, we found securinine and ajmaline significantly inhibited cell viability of HCC cells and induced apoptosis. Among them, securinine has lower toxicity to normal liver cell line, which is worthy of further research. Our results suggested that the proposed approach was effective and accurate for discovering novel therapeutic options for HCC. This method also could be used to indicate unmarked drug-disease associations in the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database. Meanwhile, our method could also be applied to predict the potential drugs for other types of tumors by changing the database.
