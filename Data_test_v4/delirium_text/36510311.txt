36510311|a|Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small bilipid layer-enclosed vesicles that can be secreted by all tested types of brain cells. Being a key intercellular communicator, EVs have emerged as a key contributor to the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease through delivery of bioactive cargos within the central nervous system (CNS). Importantly, CNS cell-derived EVs can be purified via immunoprecipitation, and EV cargos with altered levels have been identified as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of NDs. Given the essential impact of EVs on the pathogenesis of NDs, pathological EVs have been considered as therapeutic targets and EVs with therapeutic effects have been utilized as potential therapeutic agents or drug delivery platforms for the treatment of NDs. In this review, we focus on recent research progress on the pathological roles of EVs released from CNS cells in the pathogenesis of NDs, summarize findings that identify CNS-derived EV cargos as potential biomarkers to diagnose NDs, and comprehensively discuss promising potential of EVs as therapeutic targets, agents, and drug delivery systems in treating NDs, together with current concerns and challenges for basic research and clinical applications of EVs regarding NDs.
