16966830|t|Caregiver burden, health-related quality of life and coping in dementia caregivers: a comparison of frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
16966830|a|Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most prevalent dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD). We compared 29 FTD and 90 AD caregivers with respect to burden, health-related quality of life (HQoL) and coping. FTD caregivers were more burdened than AD caregivers, and caregivers of patients who were demented for shorter duration had lower HQoL. We furthermore compared the 29 FTD caregivers with 34 caregivers of institutionalized FTD patients to understand their specific caregiver issues. Caregivers of FTD patients institutionalized after shorter dementia duration were most burdened and affected in their HQoL. Overall, passive coping strategies were associated with increased burden and decreased HQoL. We recommend that FTD caregivers be offered more support than AD caregivers. Furthermore, we suggest that interventions target passive coping strategies.
