37415097|a|The metabolism of glucose and lipids is essential for energy production in the body, and dysregulation of the metabolic pathways of these molecules is implicated in various acute and chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis (AS), obesity, tumor, and sepsis. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins, which involve the addition or removal of covalent functional groups, play a crucial role in regulating protein structure, localization function, and activity. Common PTMs include phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, methylation, and glycosylation. Emerging evidence indicates that PTMs are significant in modulating glucose and lipid metabolism by modifying key enzymes or proteins. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the role and regulatory mechanisms of PTMs in glucose and lipid metabolism, with a focus on their involvement in disease progression associated with aberrant metabolism. Furthermore, we discuss the future prospects of PTMs, highlighting their potential for gaining deeper insights into glucose and lipid metabolism and related diseases.
