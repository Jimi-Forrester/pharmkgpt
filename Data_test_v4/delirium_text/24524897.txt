24524897|t|The familial Alzheimer's disease APPV717I mutation alters APP processing and Tau expression in iPSC-derived neurons.
24524897|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular plaques containing amyloid beta (Abeta)-protein and intracellular tangles containing hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. Here, we describe the generation of inducible pluripotent stem cell lines from patients harboring the London familial AD (fAD) amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutation (V717I). We examine AD-relevant phenotypes following directed differentiation to forebrain neuronal fates vulnerable in AD. We observe that over differentiation time to mature neuronal fates, APP expression and levels of Abeta increase dramatically. In both immature and mature neuronal fates, the APPV717I mutation affects both beta- and gamma-secretase cleavage of APP. Although the mutation lies near the gamma-secretase cleavage site in the transmembrane domain of APP, we find that beta-secretase cleavage of APP is elevated leading to generation of increased levels of both APPsbeta and Abeta. Furthermore, we find that this mutation alters the initial cleavage site of gamma-secretase, resulting in an increased generation of both Abeta42 and Abeta38. In addition to altered APP processing, an increase in levels of total and phosphorylated Tau is observed in neurons with the APPV717I mutation. We show that treatment with Abeta-specific antibodies early in culture reverses the phenotype of increased total Tau levels, implicating altered Abeta production in fAD neurons in this phenotype. These studies use human neurons to reveal previously unrecognized effects of the most common fAD APP mutation and provide a model system for testing therapeutic strategies in the cell types most relevant to disease processes.
