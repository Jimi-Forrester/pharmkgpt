34638764|t|FluCell-SELEX Aptamers as Specific Binding Molecules for Diagnostics of the Health Relevant Gut Bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila.
34638764|a|Based on their unique properties, oligonucleotide aptamers have been named a gift of biological chemistry to life science. We report the development of DNA aptamers as the first high-affinity binding molecules available for fast and rapid labeling of the human gut bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila with a certain impact on Alzheimer s disease. Fast and reliable analyses of the composition of microbiomes is an emerging field in microbiology. We describe the molecular evolution and biochemical characterization of a specific aptamer library by a FluCell-SELEX and the characterization of specific molecules from the library by bioinformatics. The aptamer AKK13.1 exerted universal applicability in different analysis techniques in modern microbiology, including fluorimetry, confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry. It was also functional as a specific binding entity hybridized to anchor primers chemically coupled via acrydite-modification to the surface of a polyacrylamide-hydrogel, which can be prototypically used for the construction of affinity surfaces in sensor chips. Together, the performance and methodological flexibility of the aptamers presented here may open new routes not only to develop novel Akkermansia-specific assays for clinical microbiology and the analyses of human stool samples but may also be an excellent starting point for the construction of novel electronic biosensors.
