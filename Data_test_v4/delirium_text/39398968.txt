39398968|a|Background: Robotic pet therapy could aid in the nonpharmacologic treatment of pain, agitation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption (PADIS) in the intensive care unit (ICU), similar to traditional pet therapy. Observations: The North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System implemented a robotic pet therapy program for patients requiring ICU care. Details of this program are described in this article, including evaluating its impact on PADIS management. Conclusions: Robotic pet therapy can be successfully implemented in the ICU and could be a simple, safe, and beneficial nonpharmacologic intervention for PADIS.
