37292838|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that is pervasive among the aging population. Two distinct phenotypes of AD are deficits in cognition and proteostasis, including chronic activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and aberrant Abeta production. It is unknown if restoring proteostasis by reducing chronic and aberrant UPR activation in AD can improve pathology and cognition. Here, we present data using an APP knock-in mouse model of AD and several protein chaperone supplementation paradigms, including a late-stage intervention. We show that supplementing protein chaperones systemically and locally in the hippocampus reduces PERK signaling and increases XBP1s, which is associated with increased ADAM10 and decreased Abeta42. Importantly, chaperone treatment improves cognition which is correlated with increased CREB phosphorylation and BDNF. Together, this data suggests that chaperone treatment restores proteostasis in a mouse model of AD and that this restoration is associated with improved cognition and reduced pathology. One-sentence summary: Chaperone therapy in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease improves cognition by reducing chronic UPR activity.
