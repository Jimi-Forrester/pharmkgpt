32143270|t|APP Maturation and Intracellular Localization Are Controlled by a Specific Inhibitor of 37/67 kDa Laminin-1 Receptor in Neuronal Cells.
32143270|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed along both the nonamyloidogenic pathway preventing amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) production and the amyloidogenic pathway, generating Abeta, whose accumulation characterizes Alzheimer's disease. Items of evidence report that the intracellular trafficking plays a key role in the generation of Abeta and that the 37/67 kDa LR (laminin receptor), acting as a receptor for Abeta, may mediate Abeta-pathogenicity. Moreover, findings indicating interaction between the receptor and the key enzymes involved in the amyloidogenic pathway suggest a strong link between 37/67 kDa LR and APP processing. We show herein that the specific 37/67 kDa LR inhibitor, NSC48478, is able to reversibly affect the maturation of APP in a pH-dependent manner, resulting in the partial accumulation of the immature APP isoforms (unglycosylated/acetylated forms) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and in transferrin-positive recycling endosomes, indicating alteration of the APP intracellular trafficking. These effects reveal NSC48478 inhibitor as a novel small molecule to be tested in disease conditions, mediated by the 37/67 kDa LR and accompanied by inactivation of ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases) signalling and activation of Akt (serine/threonine protein kinase) with consequent inhibition of GSK3beta.
