37878413|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder in the United States, disproportionately burdens minority populations. OBJECTIVE: To explore barriers to AD clinical trial participation by Asian and Native Hawaiian patients diagnosed with AD or mild cognitive impairment. METHOD: We surveyed 187 patients with a Mini-Mental State Examination score >=14 between January 2022 and June 2022. The score cutoff for clinical trial eligibility was set by the institution. Individuals also completed a 15-question telephone survey that assessed demographics, barriers to clinical trial participation, and clinical trial improvement methods. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients responded, with a response rate of 26%. Asian and Native Hawaiian patients were less likely than White patients to participate in AD trials. The main barrier to participation was a lack of information about AD trials. Providing additional information regarding AD trials to patients and family members were listed as the top two reasons patients would consider participating in a clinical trial. CONCLUSION: Insufficient information about AD clinical trials is the primary barrier to participation among Asian and Native Hawaiian patients, followed by difficulty coordinating transportation and, in the case of Asians, the time required for clinical trials. Increased outreach, education, and assistance with logistics in these populations should be pursued to improve rates of participation in clinical trials.
