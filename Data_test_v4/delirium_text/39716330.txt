39716330|t|Endosomal traffic disorders: a driving force behind neurodegenerative diseases.
39716330|a|Endosomes are crucial sites for intracellular material sorting and transportation. Endosomal transport is a critical process involved in the selective uptake, processing, and intracellular transport of substances. The equilibrium between endocytosis and circulation mediated by the endosome-centered transport pathway plays a significant role in cell homeostasis, signal transduction, and immune response. In recent years, there have been hints linking endosomal transport abnormalities to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Nonetheless, the related mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we provide an overview of endosomal-centered transport pathways and highlight potential physiological processes regulated by these pathways, with a particular focus on the correlation of endosomal trafficking disorders with common pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, we summarize potential therapeutic agents targeting endosomal trafficking for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
