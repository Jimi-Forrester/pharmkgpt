32854632|t|A cohort study investigating the relationship between patient reported outcome measures and pre-operative frailty in patients with operable, non-palliative colorectal cancer.
32854632|a|BACKGROUND: Frailty refers to the reduction in homeostatic reserve resulting from an accumulation of physiological deficits over a lifetime. Frailty is common in older patients undergoing surgery and is an independent risk factor for post-operative mortality, morbidity and increased length of hospital stay. In frail individuals, stressors, such as surgery, can precipitate an acute deterioration in health, manifesting as delirium, falls, reduction in mobility or continence, rendering these individuals at an increased risk of adverse perioperative outcomes. However, little is known about how frailty affects the patient experience, functional ability and quality of life (QoL) after surgery. In addition, the distribution of frailty in this population is unknown. METHODS: We will conduct a multi-centre observational trial to investigate the relationship between patient reported outcome measures and preoperative frailty. We aim to recruit approximately two-hundred patients with operable, potentially curative colorectal cancer. Eligible patients will be identified at three hospital sites. QoL and functional ability (measured using EORTC QLQ-C30 and WHO-DAS 2.0 respectively) will be recorded at the pre-operative assessment clinic, and at 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively. Frailty scores including the Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS) and Rockwood clinical frailty scale (CFS) will be calculated both preoperatively, and at 12 weeks post-operatively. Secondary outcome measures including post-operative morbidity and mortality will be measured using Clavien Dindo classification and 90-day mortality. DISCUSSION: This observational feasibility study seeks to define the prevalence of frailty in older (> 65 years) colorectal cancer patients and understand how frailty impacts on patient reported outcome measures. This information will help to inform larger studies relating to treatment decision algorithms and promote shared decision making in this population.
