37598429|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of the 3D-DST for delirium assessment in older adults by the nurse researcher. METHODS: The 3D-DST was administered by a trained nurse researcher to assess delirium among eligible older adults (aged >=70 years). The criteria for identifying delirium was based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-V). RESULTS: A total of 95 older adults were enrolled in the current study, and 23 patients were identified as positive for delirium by the psychiatrist. The sensitivity and specificity of the 3D-DST were 96% and 94%, respectively. High sensitivities of the 3D-DST were also observed among patients with hypoactive delirium (95%) and those with cognitive impairment (93%). CONCLUSION: The 3D-DST was demonstrated as an appropriate instrument with highly acceptable sensitivities and specificities for delirium detection in hospitalized older patients.
