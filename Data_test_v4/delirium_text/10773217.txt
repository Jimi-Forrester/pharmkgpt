10773217|a|Alteration in the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a central event in the formation of amyloid deposits in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been suggested that acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, which promote the cholinergic function and consequently improve the cognitive deficits, may also exert a neuroprotective effect by activating normal APP processing. We now report that an irreversible AChE inhibitor (metrifonate) increase the cell-associated APP level in a basal forebrain neuronal culture and also elevate the amount of APP secreted into the medium. The alterations in APP processing were accompanied by increased protein kinase C (PKC) levels. The results suggest that AChE inhibitors modulate the metabolism of APP, possibly via their stimulatory effects on PKC. Since changes in the activity and level of PKC may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD, it is concluded that the beneficial effect of metrifonate in AD therapy may be due not only to the stimulatory cholinergic function, but also to its activating effect on PKC.
