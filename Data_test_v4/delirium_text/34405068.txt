34405068|t|Approach to the Adolescent With Substance Use in the Acute Setting.
34405068|a|Psychoactive substance use during adolescence is an emerging challenge to the public health system due to the potential negative impact on the emotional, cognitive, social, physical and academic outcomes of adolescents. An increase in autonomy during adolescence, peer influence and willingness to experiment, lead to taking high-risk decisions subsequently prompting towards substance abuse and alcohol use. Substance use is heterogeneous among adolescents, which differs with availability, perceptions of use and specific drug usage. In adolescents' substance abuse, beyond emergency care, brief counselling with psychosocial assessment and follow up are recommended for successful management. The article reviews the common substances used by adolescents, types of presentations, clinical evaluation of patients and their background, laboratory testing, emergency management and follow up for long-term management.
