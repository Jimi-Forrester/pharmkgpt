38541862|t|The Present and Future of the Clinical Use of Physiological Traits for the Treatment of Patients with OSA: A Narrative Review.
38541862|a|People with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are a heterogeneous group. While many succeed in the treatment of their OSA, many others struggle with therapy. Herein, we discuss how anatomical and physiological factors that cause sleep apnea (OSA traits) impact treatment response and may offer an avenue for more precise care. These OSA traits, including anatomical (upper-airway collapsibility) and physiological (loop gain, airway muscle responsiveness, and arousal threshold) factors, may help determine who can succeed with continuous positive airway pressure, oral appliances, hypoglossal nerve stimulation, or pharmacotherapy. In the future, identifying OSA traits before initiating treatment may help guide the selection of the most effective and tolerable therapy modalities for each individual.
