38622401|t|Isolation and Culture of Mouse Primary Microglia and Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells.
38622401|a|Microglia and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are critical glia subsets in the central nervous system (CNS) and are actively engaged in a body of diseases, such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, etc. Microglia and OPC serve as compelling tools for the study of CNS diseases as well as the repair and damage of myelin sheath in vitro. In this protocol, we summarized a method which is capable of using the same batch of new-born mice to isolate and culture microglia and OPCs. It integrates the characteristics of practicality, convenience, and efficiency, providing a convenient, easy, and reliable technique for research.
