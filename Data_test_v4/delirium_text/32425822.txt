32425822|t|Theta-Burst Stimulation for Auditory-Verbal Hallucination in Very-Late-Onset Schizophrenia-Like Psychosis-A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Case Study.
32425822|a|BACKGROUND: Treating very-late-onset (>60 years) schizophrenia-like psychosis (VLOSLP) is challenging. Age-related factors in elderly individuals (e.g., metabolism, medication side effects, drug-interaction, somatic morbidity) may adversely affect treatment. Novel therapeutic approaches are needed to ensure the favorable therapeutic outcome in geriatric patients. Previously, theta-burst stimulation (TBS), a novel form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, was reported being beneficial in the treatment for auditory-verbal hallucination (AVH) in young and middle-aged schizophrenia (SZ) patients. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we present a case of a male patient aged 73. His first psychotic episode manifested with paranoid delusions, auditory-verbal and tactile hallucinations at the age of 66, and first remitted following a second-generation antipsychotics (SGA). Years later, after a relapse the AVH did not respond to previously effective olanzapine, whereas its augmentation with an inhibitory TBS over the left temporal lobe led to a stable remission. During his second relapse, TBS was again capable of facilitating therapeutic action of SGA in the same patient. Extending to our clinical observation, a series of functional MRI scans employing a tonal activation paradigm depicted altered auditory processing during AVH as well as brain activation change during remission. CONCLUSIONS: The current case might indicate to favorable effects of combining conventional medicament therapy and non-invasive brain stimulation techniques for elderly patients. Also, we speculate that despite obviously distinct etiologies, the present functional imaging and clinical observation may also demonstrate a possible common pathophysiological pathway underlying AVH in VLOSLP and SZ.
