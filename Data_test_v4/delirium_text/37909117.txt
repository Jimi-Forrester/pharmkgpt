37909117|t|Delirium in older patients with COVID-19: Prevalence, risk factors and clinical outcomes across the first three waves of the pandemic.
37909117|a|OBJECTIVES: Delirium is a serious condition, which poses treatment challenges during hospitalisation for COVID-19. Improvements in testing, vaccination and treatment might have changed patient characteristics and outcomes through the pandemic. We evaluated whether the prevalence and risk factors for delirium, and the association of delirium with in-hospital mortality changed through the pandemic. METHODS: This study was part of the COVID-OLD study in 19 Dutch hospitals including patients >=70 years in the first (spring 2020), second (autumn 2020) and third wave (autumn 2021). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to study risk factors for delirium, and in-hospital mortality. Differences in effect sizes between waves were studied by including interaction terms between wave and risk factor in logistic regression models. RESULTS: 1540, 884 and 370 patients were included in the first, second and third wave, respectively. Prevalence of delirium in the third wave (12.7%) was significantly lower compared to the first (22.5%) and second wave (23.5%). In multivariable-adjusted analyses, pre-existing memory problems was a consistent risk factor for delirium across waves. Previous delirium was a risk factor for delirium in the first wave (OR 4.02), but not in the second (OR 1.61) and third wave (OR 2.59, p-value interaction-term 0.028). In multivariable-adjusted analyses, delirium was not associated with in-hospital mortality in all waves. CONCLUSION: Delirium prevalence declined in the third wave, which might be the result of vaccination and improved treatment strategies. Risk factors for delirium remained consistent across waves, although some attenuation was seen in the second wave.
