37786885|t|Cerebral infarction after cardiac surgery.
37786885|a|Cerebral infarction, a common central nervous system complication after adult cardiac surgery, is one of the main factors leading to the poor prognosis of cardiac surgery patients besides cardiac insufficiency. However, there is currently no effective treatment for cerebral infarction. Therefore, early prevention and diagnosis of postoperative cerebral infarction are particularly important. There are many factors and mechanisms during and after cardiac surgery that play an important role in the occurrence of postoperative cerebral infarction, such as intraoperative embolism, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, atrial fibrillation, temperature regulation, blood pressure control, use of postoperative blood products, and so forth. The mechanism by which most risk factors act on the human body, leading to postoperative cerebral infarction, is not well understood, and further research is needed. Therefore, this paper aims to summarize and explain the relevant risk factors, mechanisms, clinical signs, imaging characteristics, and early diagnosis methods of cerebral infarction complications after cardiac surgery, and provides useful data for the establishment of related diagnosis and treatment standards.
