35163131|t|Clinical Implication of Phosphodiesterase-4-Inhibition.
35163131|a|The pleiotropic function of 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent pathways in health and disease led to the development of pharmacological phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE-I) to attenuate cAMP degradation. While there are many isotypes of PDE, a predominant role of PDE4 is to regulate fundamental functions, including endothelial and epithelial barrier stability, modulation of inflammatory responses and cognitive and/or mood functions. This makes the use of PDE4-I an interesting tool for various therapeutic approaches. However, due to the presence of PDE4 in many tissues, there is a significant danger for serious side effects. Based on this, the aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the approaches and effects of PDE4-I for different therapeutic applications. In summary, despite many obstacles to use of PDE4-I for different therapeutic approaches, the current data warrant future research to utilize the therapeutic potential of phosphodiesterase 4 inhibition.
