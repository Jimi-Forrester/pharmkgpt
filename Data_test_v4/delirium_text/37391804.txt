37391804|t|Tetra-block: ultrasound femoral, lateral femoral-cutaneous, obturator, and sciatic nerve blocks in lower limb anesthesia: a case series.
37391804|a|BACKGROUND: The gold standard anesthesiologic procedure for urgent femur fracture surgery is Spinal Anesthesia. It is not always feasible because of patients' severe comorbidities and difficulties in optimizing drug therapy in the appropriate time frame such as discontinuation of anticoagulant drugs. The use of four peripheral nerve blocks (tetra-block) can be a winning weapon when all seems lost. CASE PRESENTATION: We present, in this case series, three Caucasian adult femur fractures (an 83-year-old woman, a 73-year-old man, and a 68-year-old woman) with different and major comorbidities (cardiac or circulatory disorders on anticoagulants therapy that were not discontinued on time; breast cancer and others) underwent the same anesthesiologic approach in the urgent setting. Ultrasound peripheral nerve blocks, that is femoral, lateral femoral cutaneous, obturator, and sciatic with parasacral approach were successfully performed in all patients who underwent intramedullary nailing for intertrochanteric fracture. We evaluated the adequacy of the anesthesia plane, postoperative pain control with the VAS scale, and the incidence of postoperative side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Four peripheral nerve blocks (Tetra-block) can be alternative anesthesiologic management in urgent settings, in patients where drug therapy cannot be optimized, as in antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy.
