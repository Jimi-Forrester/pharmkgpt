OBJECTIVE: To examine how co-occurring ADNC impacts domain specific cognitive impairments at each pathologic stage (brainstem, limbic, cerebral cortical) of LBD. METHODS: 2,433 participants with antemortem longitudinal neuropsychological assessment and postmortem neuropathological assessment from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Set were characterized based on the evaluation of ADNC and LBD. Longitudinal mixed-models were used to derive measures of cumulative cognitive deficit for each cognitive domain at each pathologic stage of LBD (brainstem, limbic, and cerebral cortical). RESULTS: 111 participants with a pathologic diagnosis of LBD, 741 participants with combined LBD and ADNC, 1,357 participants with ADNC only, and 224 with no pathology (healthy controls) were included in the analyses. In the executive/visuospatial domain, combined LBD and ADNC showed worse deficits than LBD only when Lewy bodies were confined to the brainstem, but no difference when Lewy bodies extended to the limbic or cerebral cortical regions. The cerebral cortical LBD only group exhibited greater executive/visuospatial deficits than the ADNC only group. By contrast, the ADNC only group and the combined pathology group both demonstrated significantly greater cumulative memory deficits relative to Lewy body disease only, regardless of stage. CONCLUSION: The impact of co-occurring ADNC on antemortem cumulative cognitive deficits varies not only by domain but also on the pathological stage of Lewy bodies. Our findings stress the cognitive impact of different patterns of neuropathological progression in Lewy body diseases.
