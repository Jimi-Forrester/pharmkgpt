39037388|a|BACKGROUND: Polypharmacy and anticholinergic medications are associated with cognitive decline in elderly populations. Although several medications have been associated with HE, associations between medication burden, anticholinergics, and HE have not been explored. We examined medication burden and anticholinergics in patients with cirrhosis and their associations with HE-related hospitalization. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients aged 18-80 with cirrhosis seen in hepatology clinics during 2019. The number of chronic medications (medication burden) and anticholinergic use were recorded. The primary outcome was HE-related hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 1039 patients were followed for a median of 840 days. Thirty-seven percent had a history of HE, and 9.8% had an HE-related hospitalization during follow-up. The mean number of chronic medications was 6.1 +- 4.3. Increasing medication burden was associated with HE-related hospitalizations in univariable (HR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.05-1.12) and multivariable (HR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.03-1.11) models. This relationship was maintained in those with baseline HE but not in those without baseline HE. Twenty-one percent were taking an anticholinergic medication. Anticholinergic exposure was associated with increased HE-related hospitalizations in both univariable (HR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.09-2.57) and multivariable (HR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.11-2.63) models. This relationship was maintained in those with baseline HE but not in those without baseline HE. CONCLUSIONS: Anticholinergic use and medication burden are both associated with HE-related hospitalizations, particularly in those with a history of HE. Special considerations to limit anticholinergics and minimize overall medication burden should be tested for potential benefit in this population.
