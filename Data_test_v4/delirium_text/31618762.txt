31618762|a|Purpose: The goal was to visualize topographic thickness maps of the intraretinal layers and evaluate their discrimination abilities and relationships with clinical manifestations in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and a history of optic neuritis (ON). Methods: Thirty patients with relapsing-remitting MS (34 eyes with a history of ON [MSON] and 26 non-ON fellow eyes [MSFE]) were recruited together with 63 age- and sex-matched controls (HC). Ultrahigh resolution optical coherence tomography was used to image the macula and the volumetric data set was segmented to yield six intraretinal layers. Topographic thickness maps were aligned and averaged for the visualization. The thickness maps were partitioned using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) and related to Sloan low-contrast letter acuity (LCLA), Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and disease duration. Results: Focal thickness reduction occurred in the macular retinal nerve fiber layer (mRNFL) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL), with the most profound reduction occurring in MSON eyes (P < 0.05). A horseshoe-like thickness reduction pattern (U Zone) in the GCIPL appeared in MSON. The thickness of the U Zone had better discrimination power than the ETDRS partitions (area under the curve = 0.97) and differentiated 96% of MSON from HC. The thickness of the U Zone was positively correlated to 2.5% LCLA (r = 0.38, P < 0.05) and 1.25% LCLA (r = 0.57, P < 0.05). Conclusions: The horseshoe-like thickness reduction of the GCIPL appeared to be an ON-specific focal thickness alteration with the highest discrimination power of prior ON.
