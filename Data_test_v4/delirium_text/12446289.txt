12446289|a|BACKGROUND: The hippocampus is important for memory. Hippocampal atrophy and higher levels of homocysteine may both predict cognitive dysfunction in community-dwelling older people. We tested if higher homocysteine relates to hippocampal thinning in this group. SUBJECTS: 156 community-dwelling volunteers without clinical memory problems. METHOD: We measured minimal hippocampal widths on magnetic resonance images and homocysteine in plasma. RESULTS: Minimal hippocampal widths related inversely to homocysteine levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that, even in healthy older people, homocysteine may damage the hippocampus. Reducing homocysteine levels in healthy older people may help to prevent Alzheimer's disease.
