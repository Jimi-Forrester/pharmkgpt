27918993|t|Tetrahydropyranodiquinolin-8-amines as new, non hepatotoxic, antioxidant, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease therapy.
27918993|a|Herein we report an efficient two step synthesis and biological assessment of 12 racemic tetrahydropyranodiquinolin-8-amines derivatives as antioxidant, cholinesterase inhibitors and non-hepatotoxic agents. Based on the results of the primary screening, we identified 7-(3-methoxyphenyl)-9,10,11,12-tetrahydro-7H-pyrano[2,3-b:5,6-h']diquinolin-8-amine (2h) as a particularly interesting non-hepatotoxic compound that shows moderate antioxidant activity (1.83 equiv Trolox in the ORAC assay), a non competitive inhibition of hAChE (IC50 = 0.75 +- 0.01 muM), and brain permeable as determined by the PAMPA-Blood Brain Barrier assay.
