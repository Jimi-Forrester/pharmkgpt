33080757|a|BACKGROUND: Total hip arthroplasties (THA) and total knee arthroplasties (TKA) are always associated with a frequent incidence of postoperative pain. Effective pain management after surgery is quite essential for surgeons and patients. The purpose of the present meta-analysis is to evaluate the analgesic effect of perioperative ketamine after THA and TKA. METHODS: Seven online databases, Embase, Cochrane Library, Pubmed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), and Wanfang Data were searched for the related randomized controlled trials (RCT) by August 15, 2019. The qualities of the included studies were assessed based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 5.0. The visual analog scale (VAS), morphine equivalent consumption, and the side effects were used to evaluate the postoperative analgesic effect of ketamine by meta-analysis, which was performed by Review Manager version 5.3 software. RESULTS: The VAS scores at 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after surgery were statistically lower in the ketamine group. The morphine equivalent consumptions in 24 hours and 48 hours after surgery were also significantly lower in the ketamine group. For the side effects, no statistical differences in odds ratio (OR) of sedation, dizziness, hallucination, sweating, pruritus, urinary retention, constipation, version trouble, nightmares, and delirium were observed between the ketamine group and the control group. But postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) showed lower OR in the ketamine group. CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis demonstrated perioperative ketamine could be used as a safe and effective analgesic agent for THA and TKA.
