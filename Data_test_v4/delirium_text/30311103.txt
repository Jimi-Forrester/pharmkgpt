30311103|t|Frequency and Correlates of Subjective Cognitive Impairment in HIV Disease.
30311103|a|The increasing prevalence of older adults living with HIV has raised growing concerns about a possible rise in the incidence of neurocognitive disorders due to HIV and other age-related factors. In typical aging, subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) among individuals with normal neurocognitive functioning may be an early manifestation of an incipient neurocognitive disorder. The current study examined the frequency and correlates of SCI in 188 HIV-infected adults without performance-based neurocognitive deficits or a current psychiatric disorder and 133 HIV seronegative comparison participants. All participants completed the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire and Profile of Mood States Confusion/Bewilderment scale. Consistent with the diagnostic criteria proposed by Jessen et al. (Alzheimers Dement 10(6):844-852, 2014), participants were classified with SCI if their scores on either of the self-reported measures was greater than 1.5 SD above the normative mean. A logistic regression controlling for current mood complaints and lifetime history of substance use disorders revealed that HIV infection increased the odds of SCI (odds ratio= 4.5 [1.6, 15.4], p = 0.004). Among HIV+ individuals, SCI was associated with lower performance-based learning and delayed memory scores (Cohen's d range 0.41-0.42.) and poorer global everyday functioning (odds ratio= 8.5 [2.6, 15.9]), but not HIV disease severity (ps > 0.10). In a sample of individuals without neurocognitive impairment or elevated mood symptoms, HIV disease was associated with a nearly fivefold increased odds of SCI compared to seronegative individuals, which may indicate an increased risk for developing major neurocognitive disorders as these HIV+ individuals age.
