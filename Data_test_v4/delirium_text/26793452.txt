26793452|t|Anaerobic urinary tract infection caused by Veillonella parvula identified using cystine-lactose-electrolyte deficient media and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
26793452|a|We report a case of Veillonella parvula causing a urinary tract infection. The organism was isolated from urine using cystine-lactose-electrolyte deficient media and identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry confirmed by 16s RNA. This case highlights important clinical and microbiological considerations for urinary tract infections.
