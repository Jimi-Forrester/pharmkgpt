36310202|t|Functional Applications of Stable Tau Oligomers in Cell Biology and Electrophysiology Studies.
36310202|a|Aggregated tau protein plays a key role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease. Soluble, low-molecular-weight tau oligomers are formed early in disease processes and are thought to have toxic functions that disrupt neuronal function. The dynamic and transient nature of tau oligomers complicates in vitro functional studies to explore the mechanistic links between oligomer formation and neurodegeneration. We have previously described a method of producing stable and structurally characterized oligomers that maintain their oligomeric conformation and prevent further aggregation. This method allows for the flexibility of stabilizing tau oligomers by specifically labelling cysteine residues with fluorescent or colorless maleimide conjugates. Here, we describe the functional applications of these preformed stable tau oligomers in cell biology and electrophysiological studies. These investigations allow real-time insights into the cellular uptake of exogenous tau oligomers and their functional effects in the recipient cells.
