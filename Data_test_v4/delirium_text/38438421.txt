38438421|t|Association of periodontal disease treatment with mortality in patients with dementia: a population-based retrospective cohort study (2002-2018).
38438421|a|Dementia is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. In this study, we analyzed the association of periodontal treatment with the risk of death in patients with dementia. The analyzed data were obtained by linking the National Health Insurance Corporation claims data between 2002 and 2018 to the Statistics Korea death registry. In total, 1,131,406 patients with dementia aged >= 65 years had undergone dental treatment during the study period. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model was performed. The mortality rate was approximately 10% among the patients with dementia. The 17-years cumulative survival rates for patients who received periodontal treatment and their untreated counterparts were 83.5% and 71.5%, respectively. The crude hazard ratio of the periodontal group was approximately twice as high as that of the non-periodontal group (1.99; P < 0.001). Furthermore, in the regression model that was adjusted for socio-demographic variables and systematic chronic diseases, the risk of death in the non-periodontal group was approximately 1.83 times higher than that of the periodontal group (P < 0.00). These findings suggest that preventive periodontal treatment may decrease mortality risk in older people with dementia.
