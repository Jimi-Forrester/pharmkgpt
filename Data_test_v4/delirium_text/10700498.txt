10700498|t|Neurobehavioral outcome prediction after cardiac surgery: role of neurobiochemical markers of damage to neuronal and glial brain tissue.
10700498|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The goal of the present study was to investigate the predictive value of neurobiochemical markers of brain damage (protein S-100B and neuron-specific enolase [NSE]) with respect to the short- and long-term neuropsychological outcomes after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). METHODS: We investigated 74 patients who underwent elective CABG or valve replacement surgery and who showed no severe neurological deficits after surgery. Patients were investigated with a standardized neurological examination and a comprehensive neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric assessment 1 to 2 days before surgery, 3 and 8 days after surgery, and 6 months later. Serial venous blood samples were taken preoperatively and 1, 6, 20, and 30 hours after skin closure. Protein S-100B and NSE were analyzed with immunoluminometric assays. RESULTS: Patients with severe postoperative neuropsychological disorders showed a significantly higher and longer release of neurobiochemical markers of brain damage. Patients who presented with a delirium according to DSM-III-R criteria 3 days after surgery had significantly higher postoperative S-100B serum concentrations. Multivariate analysis (based on postoperative NSE and S-100B concentrations and age of patients, type of operation, length of cross-clamp and perfusion time, and intraoperative and postoperative oxygenation) identified NSE and S-100B concentrations 6 to 30 hours after skin closure as the only variables that contributed significantly to a predictive model of the neuropsychological outcome. NSE, but not S-100B, release was significantly higher in patients undergoing valve replacement surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative serum concentrations and kinetics of S-100B and NSE have a high predictive value with respect to the early neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric outcome after cardiac surgery. The analysis of NSE and S-100B release might allow insight into the underlying pathophysiology of brain dysfunction, thus providing a valuable tool to monitor and evaluate measures to improve cardiac surgery with CPB.
