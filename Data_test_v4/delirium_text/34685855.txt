34685855|t|Innovative Biochemometric Approach to the Metabolite and Biological Profiling of the Balkan Thistle (Cirsium appendiculatum Griseb.), Asteraceae.
34685855|a|The widespread genus Cirsium Mill. (Asteraceae) is renowned in traditional medicine. In the present study, an innovative biochemometric-assisted metabolite profiling of the flower heads, aerial parts and roots of Cirsium appendiculatum Griseb. (Balkan thistle) in relation to their antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory potential was developed. The workflow combines ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) with partial least-square analysis to discriminate the herbal extracts and identify the most prominent biological activities. The annotation and dereplication of 61 secondary metabolites were evidenced, including 15 carboxylic (including hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic) acids and their glycosides, 11 acylquinic acids, 26 flavonoids and 9 fatty acids. All compounds were reported for the first time in the studied species. The root extract revealed the highest cupric and ferric reducing power (618.36 +- 5.17 mg TE/g and 269.89 +- 8.50 mg TE/g, respectively) and antioxidant potential in phosphomolybdenum (3.36 +- 0.15 mmol TE/g) as well as the most prominent enzyme inhibitory potential on alpha-glucosidase (0.72 +- 0.07 mmol ACAE/g), acetylcholinesterase (4.93 +- 0.25 mg GALAE/g) and butyrylcholinesterase (3.80 +- 0.26 mg GALAE/g). Nevertheless, the flower heads were differentiated by their higher metal chelating activity (32.53 +- 3.51 mg EDTAE/g) and total flavonoid content (46.59 +- 0.89 mgRE/g). The partial least-square discriminant and heat-map analysis highlighted the root extract as the most active and a promising source of bioactive compounds for the therapeutic industry.
