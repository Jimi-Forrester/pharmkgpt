38314244|a|Introduction: Patients undergoing revision total hip surgery (RTHS) have a high prevalence of mild and moderate preoperative anemia, associated with adverse outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of perioperative allogeneic blood transfusions (ABT) and postoperative complications in preoperatively mild compared to moderate anemic patients undergoing RTHS who did not receive a diagnostic anemia workup and treatment before surgery. Methods: We included 1,765 patients between 2007 and 2019 at a university hospital. Patients were categorized according to their severity of anemia using the WHO criteria of mild, moderate, and severe anemia in the first Hb level of the case. Patients were grouped as having received no ABT, 1-2 units of ABT, or more than 2 units of ABT. Need for intraoperative ABT was assessed in accordance with institutional standards. Primary endpoint was the compound incidence of postoperative complications. Secondary outcomes included major/minor complications and length of hospital and ICU stay. Results: Of the 1,765 patients, 31.0% were anemic of any cause before surgery. Transfusion rates were 81% in anemic patients and 41.2% in nonanemic patients. The adjusted risks for compound postoperative complication were significantly higher in patients with moderate anemia (OR 4.88, 95% CI: 1.54-13.15, p = 0.003) but not for patients with mild anemia (OR 1.93, 95% CI: 0.85-3.94, p < 0.090). Perioperative ABT was associated with significantly higher risks for complications in nonanemic patients and showed an increased risk for complications in all anemic patients. In RTHS, perioperative ABT as a treatment for moderate preoperative anemia of any cause was associated with a negative compound effect on postoperative complications, compared to anemia or ABT alone. Discussion: ABT is associated with adverse outcomes of patients with moderate preoperative anemia before RTHS. For this reason, medical treatment of moderate preoperative anemia may be considered.
