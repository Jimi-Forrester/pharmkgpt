33688611|a|Cytosolic PSD-95 interactor (cypin) regulates many aspects of neuronal development and function, ranging from dendritogenesis to synaptic protein localization. While it is known that removal of postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) from the postsynaptic density decreases synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and that cypin overexpression protects neurons from NMDA-induced toxicity, little is known about cypin's role in AMPA receptor clustering and function. Experimental work shows that cypin overexpression decreases PSD-95 levels in synaptosomes and the PSD, decreases PSD-95 clusters/mum2, and increases mEPSC frequency. Analysis of microelectrode array (MEA) data demonstrates that cypin or cypinDeltaPDZ overexpression increases sensitivity to CNQX (cyanquixaline) and AMPA receptor-mediated decreases in spike waveform properties. Network-level analysis of MEA data reveals that cypinDeltaPDZ overexpression causes networks to be resilient to CNQX-induced changes in local efficiency. Incorporating these findings into a computational model of a neural circuit demonstrates a role for AMPA receptors in cypin-promoted changes to networks and shows that cypin increases firing rate while changing network functional organization, suggesting cypin overexpression facilitates information relay but modifies how information is encoded among brain regions. Our data show that cypin promotes changes to AMPA receptor signaling independent of PSD-95 binding, shaping neural circuits and output to regions beyond the hippocampus.
