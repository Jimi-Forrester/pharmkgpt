37678390|a|ABSTRACT: In our report, and review of the literature, we present an important clinical lesson for the recognition and treatment of alprazolam withdrawal with complicated delirium and psychosis, and present a strong case for future treatment algorithms. Our case is unique due to the severity of behavioral disturbance associated with acute psychosis secondary to alprazolam withdrawal and the significant quantity of alprazolam consumed. The use of high cumulative doses of longer-acting benzodiazepines resulted in rapid improvement in symptoms with full resolution of psychosis. Within 4 days of treatment in hospital, delirium and psychosis had fully resolved. Detoxification continued in the community and the patient was followed up in clinic for monitoring of mental state. There was no recurrence of psychotic symptoms.
