38237295|t|Aluminum, a colorful gamechanger: Uptake of an aluminum-containing food color in human cells and its implications for human health.
38237295|a|Aluminum is added to many food colors to change their solubility. This study compares the aluminum-containing food color carmine with its aluminum-free version carminic acid (both E 120), hypothesizing that the addition of aluminum does not only change the color's solubility, but also its effects on human cells. We could show that carmine, but not carminic acid, is taken up by gastrointestinal Caco-2 and umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Clear differences between gene expression profiles of Caco-2 cells exposed to carmine, carminic acid or control were shown. KEGG analysis revealed that carmine-specific genes suppress oxidative phosphorylation, and showed that this suppression is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and Parkinson disease. Furthermore, carmine, but not carminic acid, increased proliferation of Caco-2 cells. Our findings show that a food color containing aluminum induces different cellular effects compared to its aluminum-free form, which is currently not considered in EU legislation.
