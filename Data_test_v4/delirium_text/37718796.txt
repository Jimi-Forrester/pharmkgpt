37718796|t|TOMM40 '523 Genotype Distinguishes Patterns of Cognitive Improvement for Executive Function in APOEe3 Homozygotes.
37718796|a|BACKGROUND: TOMM40 '523 has been associated with cognitive performance and risk for developing Alzheimer's disease independent of the effect of APOE genotype. Few studies have considered the longitudinal effect of this genotype on change in cognition over time. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the relationship between TOMM40 genotype status and change in cognitive performance in the TOMMORROW study, which was designed to prospectively evaluate an algorithm that includes TOMM40 '523 for genetic risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment. METHODS: We used latent growth curve models to estimate the effect of TOMM40 allele carrier (short, very long) status on the intercept and slope of change in cognitive performance in four broad cognitive domains (attention, memory, executive function, and language) and a combined overall cognitive score over 30 months. RESULTS: TOMM40 very long allele carriers had significantly lower baseline performance for the combined overall cognitive function score (B = -0.088, p = 0.034) and for the executive function domain score (B = -0.143, p = 0.013). Slopes for TOMM40 VL carriers had significantly greater increases over time for the executive function domain score only. In sensitivity analyses, the results for executive function were observed in participants who remained clinically stable, but not in those who progressed clinically over the study duration. CONCLUSIONS: Our results add to the growing body of evidence that TOMM40, in the absence of APOEe4, may contribute to cognitive changes with aging and dementia and support the view that mitochondrial function is an important contributor to AD risk.
