34353458|t|Gender Differences in Critical Illness and Critical Care Research.
34353458|a|Gender is emerging as a factor that may impact the trajectory of critical illness; clinical trials in critical care have largely enrolled men with little attention to equal distribution of sexes. Distribution of admission to the intensive care unit and utilization of resources differs by gender. Sex hormones are thought to impact the course of critical illness. Management and outcomes in sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome have been demonstrated to differ by gender as well as in pregnancy. Outcomes of critically ill patients may be impacted by gender.
