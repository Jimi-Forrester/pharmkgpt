39106936|a|Spinal cord (SC) atrophy obtained from structural magnetic resonance imaging has gained relevance as an indicator of neurodegeneration in various neurological disorders. The common method to assess SC atrophy is by comparing numerical differences of the cross-sectional spinal cord area (CSA) between time points. However, this indirect approach leads to considerable variability in the obtained results. Studies showed that this limitation can be overcome by using a registration-based technique. The present study introduces the Structural Image Evaluation using Normalization of Atrophy on the Spinal Cord (SIENA-SC), which is an adapted version of the original SIENA method, designed to directly calculate the percentage of SC volume change over time from clinical brain MRI acquired with an extended field of view to cover the superior part of the cervical SC. In this work, we compared SIENA-SC with the Generalized Boundary Shift Integral (GBSI) and the CSA change. On a scan-rescan dataset, SIENA-SC was shown to have the lowest measurement error than the other two methods. When comparing a group of 190 Healthy Controls with a group of 65 Multiple Sclerosis patients, SIENA-SC provided significantly higher yearly rates of atrophy in patients than in controls and a lower sample size when measured for treatment effect sizes of 50%, 30% and 10%. Our findings indicate that SIENA-SC is a robust, reproducible, and sensitive approach for assessing longitudinal changes in spinal cord volume, providing neuroscientists with an accessible and automated tool able to reduce the need for manual intervention and minimize variability in measurements.
