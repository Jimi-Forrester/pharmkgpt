39629181|a|Aerosol therapy administered via handheld inhaler or nebulizer device has long been standard for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), both for maintenance therapy and for management of acute exacerbations. Of the 2 options for drug delivery, inhaler devices are the most widely used for ambulatory patients with COPD as they are small, portable, and convenient and offer an array of medication options. They are, however, prone to suboptimal inhalation technique and use errors, which decrease the amount of medication delivered, compromise efficacy, and adversely affect clinical outcomes. Nebulizers are less often employed for aerosol delivery than inhalers, particularly in the home environment. Considered bulky and expensive, nebulizers have historically had limited medication options compared with inhalers. Nonetheless, nebulizers may be preferred over inhalers in specific patient populations, such as in patients with poor lung function, lack of hand-breath coordination, or cognitive impairment. Furthermore, technological advances and development of new nebulizer-compatible medications are shifting the benefit equation for nebulizers versus inhalers in a way that merits reconsideration of the role of nebulizers in the maintenance treatment of COPD. Using the available literature, this state-of-the-art review critically evaluates the benefits and limitations of aerosol therapy delivery via inhaler or nebulizer for patients with COPD; describes the factors that may influence the benefit equation, including current advances in nebulizer technology and future developments; and provides insights on implementation of nebulizer therapy in clinical practice.
