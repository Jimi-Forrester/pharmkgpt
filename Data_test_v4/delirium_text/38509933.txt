38509933|a|Anesthesia is regarded as an important milestone in medicine. However, the negative effect on memory and learning has been observed. In addition, the impact of anesthetics on postoperative cognitive functions is still discussed. In this work, in vivo experiment simulating a general anesthesia and ICU sedation was designed to assess the impact of two intravenous (midazolam, dexmedetomidine) and two inhalational (isoflurane, desflurane) agents on neuronal centers for cognition (neocortex), learning, and memory (hippocampus). More than 3600 proteins were quantified across both neocortex and hippocampus. Proteomic study revealed relatively mild effects of anesthetics, nevertheless, protein dysregulation uncovered possible different effect of isoflurane (and midazolam) compared to desflurane (and dexmedetomidine) to neocortical and hippocampal proteins. Isoflurane induced the upregulation of hippocampal NMDAR and other proteins of postsynaptic density and downregulation of GABA signaling, whereas desflurane and dexmedetomidine rather targeted mitochondrial VDAC isoforms and protein regulating apoptotic activity.
