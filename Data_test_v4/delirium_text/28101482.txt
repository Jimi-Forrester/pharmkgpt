28101482|a|Cefepime-induced encephalopathy including nonconvulsive status epilepticus has been known to develop in the patients with renal impairment. However, we report a 74-year-old woman with normal renal function who developed stuporous mental status during cefepime administration. Electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed 2 Hz rhythmic sharp-and-waves continuously, which suggested nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). After cefepime discontinuation, clinical symptoms recovered gradually and EEG findings showed only background slowing without epileptiform discharges. Cefepime-induced NCSE could be developed even in the patients with normal renal function, when they are elderly. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of the possibility of cefepime-induced NCSE when prescribing cefepime even to the patients with normal renal function.
