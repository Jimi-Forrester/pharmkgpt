24693363|t|Comparison of alpha blockers in treatment of premature ejaculation: a pilot clinical trial.
24693363|a|BACKGROUND: Premature ejaculation (PE) is the most common sexual disorder in men and studies reported prevalence up to 30% (1, 2). PE is not a life-threatening medical condition but it influences the quality of life (QoL). OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the efficiency, and safety of alpha blocker drugs in the treatment of patients with premature ejaculation (PE). Additionally we investigated the quality of life (QoL) in patients with PE who were treated with alpha blocker drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a pilot clinical trial. Prospectively documented 108 patients with PE were treated and were followed-up in urology outpatient clinic. All patients were divided into 5 groups according to used alpha blocker agents which were determined by simple randomization. Silodosin 4mg (Group 1, n = 21), tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4mg (Group 2, n = 23), alfuzosin 10mg (Group 3, n = 22), terazosin 5mg (Group 4, n = 21), doksazosin mesylate 4mg (Group5, n = 21), were used for treatment. The demographic parameters of patients, pre and post treatment intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT), PE Profile (PEP), and QoL index were recorded and evaluated. Effectiveness of treatment was evaluated by measuring IELT. Additionally, side effects of drugs were recorded. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: All alpha blocker drugs were statistically effective for preventing PE. Notably, silodosin seemed to be more effective for preventing PE than other alpha blockers (P < 0.05). However all alpha blockers provided development in QoL scores, silodosin was a little better than other drugs in statistical analyses. Furthermore statistical increase in IELT and decrease in PEP were provided more in Group 1 than other groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Silodosin seems to be able to even more prevent PE. Silodosin may provide development in QoL than other alpha blocker agents. Additionally, lower systemic adverse events and more effectivity are the prominent features of silodosin in PE.This study was a pilot clinical trial.
