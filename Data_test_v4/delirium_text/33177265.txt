33177265|t|Dramatic Performance by a Professional Actor for the Treatment of Patients with Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia.
33177265|a|Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) challenge caregivers, leading to caregiver burden and subsequent nursing home or inpatient placement in a psychiatric hospital for dementia. Favorable positive emotions should be an important goal for the treatment of negative emotions of BPSD. Arts are one of the most profound areas to stimulate favorable emotions. We have asked a professional actor, who was not involved in the daily care and regular rehabilitations, to give a dramatic performance by reading selected stories as if the patients with BPSD felt to be in the audiences of a theater. We wondered whether a dramatic performance by the actor might be a way to respond to the complex needs of inpatients with BPSD, especially focused on favorable emotions. New inpatients (Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, or dementia with Lewy bodies) were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 20) and a dramatic performance group (n = 14) in Sendai Tomizawa Hospital, a psychiatric hospital for dementia, in Japan. Dramatic performances were performed for one and half hours once per week for 3 months. Neuropsychiatric Inventory for BPSD decreased in both groups and delightful emotional index (DEI) for favorable emotions increased in the intervention group but not in the control group after 3 months. At 3 months, there was an increase of DEI in intervention group compared with control group. We conclude that dramatic performance may be one of the appropriate interventions in patients with BPSD, as it appears to help in their favorable emotional state.
