35380400|a|The medicinal plant Mucuna pruriens (Fabaceae) is widely known for its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. It is a well-established drug in Ayurveda and has been widely used for the treatment of neurological disorders and male infertility for ages. The seeds of the plant have potent medicinal value and its extract has been tested in different models of neurodegenerative diseases, especially Parkinson's disease (PD). Apart from PD, Mucuna pruriens is now being studied in models of other nervous systems disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and stroke because of its neuroprotective importance. This review briefly discusses the pathogenesis of PD, AD, ALS and stroke. It aims to summarize the medicinal importance of Mucuna pruriens in treatment of these diseases, and put forward the potential targets where Mucuna pruriens can act for therapeutic interventions. In this review, the effect of Mucuna pruriens on ameliorating the neurodegeneration evident in PD, AD, ALS and stroke is briefly discussed. The potential targets for neuroprotection by the plant are delineated, which can be studied further to validate the hypothesis regarding the use of Mucuna pruriens for the treatment of these diseases.
