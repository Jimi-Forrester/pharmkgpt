24792708|a|The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of multisensory stimulation in a multisensory stimulation environment (MSSE) such as a Snoezelen room versus one-to-one activity sessions with regard to mood, behavior, and biomedical parameters (heart rate and blood oxygen saturation). The MSSE group and activity group (one-to-one activities) of patients with dementia participated in 2 weekly individualized intervention sessions over 16 weeks, where mood and behavior before, during, and after the sessions, and biomedical parameters immediately before and after, were recorded. Immediately after the sessions, patients spoke more spontaneously, related better to others, were more attentive to their environments, more active/alert, less bored/inactive, and more relaxed/content. Both groups exhibited decreases in heart rate and increases in oxygen saturation (Spo 2) values from before to after the sessions. The MSSE sessions in a Snoezelen room were found to be as effective as activity sessions, highlighting the importance of the one-to-one interaction with the therapist.
