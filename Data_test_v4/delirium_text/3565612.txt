3565612|t|A study of crying in medically and surgically hospitalized patients.
3565612|a|In a prospective study of hospitalized patients referred to a psychiatry consultation service, 46 patients were referred for a presumed diagnosis of depression because crying was a prominent symptom. Psychiatric consultation determined that 20% had a psychiatric disorder only, 33% had a neurological disorder only, 43% had both psychiatric and neurological disorders, and 4% had a previously undescribed entity, "essential" crying. The most common neurological disorder in these crying patients was bilateral hemispheric dysfunction associated with dementia or delirium; the most common psychiatric disorder was major depression. Effective therapy for patients who cry depends on proper identification of the cause of crying.
