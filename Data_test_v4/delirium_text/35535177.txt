35535177|t|Rescue Revascularisation in Acute Internal Carotid Artery Occlusion with a Super Extended Time Window of More than 48 hours.
35535177|a|Methods: We present the case of a 71-year-old Caucasian male "minor stroke" patient with LVO, good collateral flow via the ophthalmic artery, receiving rescue MT following clinical deterioration after >48 hours. NIHSS and modified Rankin scale (mRS) were used for follow-up and modified treatment in cerebral infarction (mTICI) score for angiographic results. Results: Excellent angiographic result (mTICI 3) and clinical improvement were achieved (NIHSS preintervention 18, on discharge 2 points). 90-day follow-up showed excellent outcome (mRS 1). Conclusions: Late intervention MT should be encouraged when clinical deficit exceeds infarct demarcation. Standardized identification based on clinical and imaging data is required to target critical patients with LVO and low NIHSS, favouring a primary intervention.
