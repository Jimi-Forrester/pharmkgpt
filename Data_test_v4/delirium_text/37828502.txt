37828502|a|micro-Conotoxin GIIIB (micro-CTX GIIIB) is a polypeptide containing three disulfide bridges, produced by the sea snail Conus geographus. This study was aimed to explored the cytotoxic effects of micro-CTX GIIIB on mouse skeletal musculoblast (Sol8). Sol8 cells were exposed to ouabain and veratridine to establish the cell injury model, and then treated with micro-CTX GIIIB. CCK-8 was adopted to evaluate the cytotoxicity of micro-CTX GIIIB. Then, proteomics and transcriptome were conducted, and the explore the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) affected by micro-CTX GIIIB were found. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis was used to investigate the affected signaling pathways. micro-CTX GIIIB increased the cell survival rate of injured Sol8 cells. We found and identified 1,663 DEGs and 444 DEPs influenced by micro-CTX GIIIB. 106 pairs of correlated DEGs and DEPs were selected by combining transcriptome and proteome data. The results of KEGG and GO analysis showed that micro-CTX GIIB affected the cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA damage and repair, lipid metabolism and other biological processes of Sol8 cells. micro-CTX GIIIB could affected cell cycle regulation, DNA damage repair, and activation of tumor factors, with potential carcinogenic effects. Our results provide an important basis for the study of in vitro toxicity, the mechanism of toxicity and injury prevention by micro-CTX GIIIB.
