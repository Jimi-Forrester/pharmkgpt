39475209|t|Profiling Cysteine Proteases Activities in Neuroinflammatory Cells.
39475209|a|A new activity-based probe (ABP) of cysteine proteases (FGA139) has been designed and synthesized. The design of the ABP has been done based upon the chemical structure of an irreversible inhibitor of cysteine proteases by attaching a bodipy fluorophore at the N-terminus of the peptide backbone. The synthetic route of the probe has a metathesis and a "click" reaction as key steps. Although some studies have been reported about the role played by cysteine proteases in neurodegenerative diseases, there are not definitive conclusions. The obtained ABP has been employed as a chemical tool to profile activities of cysteine proteases cathepsins B, L, and calpain in neurodegenerative cell models through confocal imaging. Colocalization of the probe to specific antibodies of the proteases and competitive experiments with non-fluorescent inhibitors confirm the specificity of the ABP. From a theranostic perspective, our findings strongly suggest that FGA139 exhibits a protective role in various cell lines against oxidative stress or pro-inflammatory toxicity and it effectively attenuates macrophage activation triggered by LPS.
