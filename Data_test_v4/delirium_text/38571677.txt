38571677|t|Anti-aging effects of icariin and the underlying mechanisms: A mini-review.
38571677|a|Aging is an extremely intricate and progressive phenomenon that is implicated in many physiological and pathological conditions. Icariin (ICA) is the main active ingredient of Epimedium and has exhibited multiple bioactivities, such as anti-tumor, neuroprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-aging properties. ICA could extend healthspan in both invertebrate and vertebrate models. In this review, the roles of ICA in protection from declined reproductive function, neurodegeneration, osteoporosis, aging intestinal microecology, and senescence of cardiovascular system will be summarized. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of ICA-mediated anti-aging effects will be introduced. Finally, we will discuss some key aspects that constrain the usage of ICA in clinical practice and the corresponding strategies to solve these issues.
