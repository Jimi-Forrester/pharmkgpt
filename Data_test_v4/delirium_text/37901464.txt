37901464|t|Machine learning: a powerful tool for identifying key microbial agents associated with specific cancer types.
37901464|a|Machine learning (ML) includes a broad class of computer programs that improve with experience and shows unique strengths in performing tasks such as clustering, classification and regression. Over the past decade, microbial communities have been implicated in influencing the onset, progression, metastasis, and therapeutic response of multiple cancers. Host-microbe interaction may be a physiological pathway contributing to cancer development. With the accumulation of a large number of high-throughput data, ML has been successfully applied to the study of human cancer microbiomics in an attempt to reveal the complex mechanism behind cancer. In this review, we begin with a brief overview of the data sources included in cancer microbiomics studies. Then, the characteristics of the ML algorithm are briefly introduced. Secondly, the application progress of ML in cancer microbiomics is also reviewed. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future prospects facing ML in cancer microbiomics. On this basis, we conclude that the development of cancer microbiomics can not be achieved without ML, and that ML can be used to develop tumor-targeting microbial therapies, ultimately contributing to personalized and precision medicine.
