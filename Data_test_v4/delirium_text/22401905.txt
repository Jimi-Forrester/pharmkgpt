22401905|t|Intraneuronal Abeta accumulation and neurodegeneration: lessons from transgenic models.
22401905|a|AIMS: In the present review we summarize current knowledge on the concept of intraneuronal Abeta as a determinant for neuron loss and other pathological alterations in transgenic models for Alzheimer disease. MAIN METHODS: We discuss the use of transgenic mouse and non-vertebrate transgenic models accumulating intracellular Abeta peptides and their impact on the ongoing discussion. KEY FINDINGS: Intraneuronal Abeta accumulation in transgenic models is intimately linked to pathological alterations including neuron loss. One of the technical caveats for visualizing intraneuronal Abeta is the antibody used to unequivocally demonstrate its presence. Very often antibodies were used that recognize both Abeta and APP, leading to false positive results due to misinterpretation. SIGNIFICANCE: Whereas a clear relationship between intraneuronal Abeta accumulation and neuron loss is evident in transgenic mouse models it remains an unresolved issue whether the concept of intraneuronal Abeta can be integrated into the human pathology as well.
