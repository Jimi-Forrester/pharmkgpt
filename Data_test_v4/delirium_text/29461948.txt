29461948|t|Case 251: Nontraumatic Drug-associated Rhabdomyolysis of Head and Neck Muscles.
29461948|a|History A 21-year-old man with a history of abuse of multiple drugs and mild cognitive impairment who initially underwent treatment for excited delirium developed respiratory arrest shortly after admission and was successfully resuscitated. Unenhanced computed tomography (CT) of the head and neck and contrast material-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and complete spine were performed shortly after the initial treatment. Head and neck magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed 24 hours after admission. No other abnormalities were noted. There were no fractures, and there was no vascular injury in the head and neck region. The patient had no external neck injuries, congestion, or petechiae suggesting neck compression. He had no history of chronic or recurrent pain or skin rash. Urine testing was positive for cocaine, cannabis, and methamphetamine. Serum creatine kinase level was initially high (31 117 U/L [520 mukat/L]; normal, 1000 U/L [16.7 mukat/L]). Corrected calcium level was 2.22 mmol/L, and ionized calcium level was 1.09 mmol/L (lower end of the normal range). There was no acute renal failure at the initial phase, but serum creatinine levels reached 180 micromol/L 24 hours after admission, and creatine kinase peaked at 61 000 U/L [1019 mukat/L]. Urine was initially red, but the patient was not tested for myoglobinuria.
