1095511|t|[Double-blind study of Aprotininum (Trasylol) in the management of alcoholic delirium].
1095511|a|The results of uncontrolled studies, in which the period of the delirium tremens was reduced and the intensity was lowered significantly by aprotininum, could not be verified in our double-blind study. Continuing a preliminary double-blind study another group of 20 male patients was examined again to evaluate the effectiveness of aprotininum given in a modified experimental arrangement. Not only at the beginning of the treatment but also every 6 h an infusion of 200,000 KIE Trasylol was given during the period of the acute alcohol withdrawal syndromes. Time as well as intensity of symptoms (quantitatively measured by needed chlormethiazol) did not differ significantly between the aprotininum and the placebo group.
