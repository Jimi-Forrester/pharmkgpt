36117913|a|Many questions surround the underlying mechanism for the differential metabolic processing observed for the prion protein (PrP) in healthy and prion-infected mammals. Foremost, the physiological alpha-cleavage of PrP interrupts a region critical for both toxicity and conversion of cellular PrP (PrP C ) into its misfolded pathogenic isoform (PrP Sc ) by generating a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored C1 fragment. During prion diseases, alternative beta-cleavage of PrP becomes prominent, producing a GPI-anchored C2 fragment with this particular region intact. It remains unexplored whether physical up-regulation of alpha-cleavage can inhibit disease progression. Furthermore, several pieces of evidence indicate that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) 10 and ADAM17 play a much smaller role in the alpha-cleavage of PrP C than originally believed, thus presenting the need to identify the primary protease(s) responsible. For this purpose, we characterized the ability of plasmin to perform PrP alpha-cleavage. Then, we conducted functional assays using protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) and prion-infected cell lines to clarify the role of plasmin-mediated alpha-cleavage during prion propagation. Here, we demonstrated an inhibitory role of plasmin for PrP Sc formation through PrP alpha-cleavage that increased C1 fragments resulting in reduced prion conversion compared with non-treated PMCA and cell cultures. The reduction of prion infectious titer in the bioassay of plasmin-treated PMCA material also supported the inhibitory role of plasmin on PrP Sc replication. Our results suggest that plasmin-mediated endoproteolytic cleavage of PrP may be an important event to prevent prion propagation.
