35503161|a|BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation-related infective endocarditis (TAVI-IE) is a well-recognised and serious complication following TAVI. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics, microorganism spectrum, and outcomes of TAVI-IE in an Irish context. METHODS: A prospective registry was used to assess the baseline demographics, procedural variables, and clinical outcomes of patients undergoing TAVI between 2009 and 2020 at two tertiary referral Irish Hospitals. RESULTS: A total of 733 patients underwent TAVI during the study period. During a follow-up duration of 1,949 person-years (median 28 months), TAVI-IE occurred in 17 (2.3%) patients. The overall incidence was 0.87 per 100 person-years and the median time from TAVI to presentation with IE was 7 months [IQR: 5-13 months]. In those who developed TAVI-IE, the mean age was 78.7 years, 70.5% were male, and there was a trend towards more permanent pacemaker implantations post-TAVI (17.6% vs. 5.86%; p = 0.08). The dominant culprit microorganisms were streptococci (41.1%) and four (23.5%) cases were attributed to dental seeding. Major complications of TAVI-IE included one (5.8%) stroke, one (5.8%) in-hospital death, and two (11.7%) urgent surgical aortic valve replacements. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival at 1-year was 82% (95% CI = 55-95). CONCLUSIONS: This Irish cohort of TAVI-IE exhibited a similar incidence and time to presentation compared to prior international registries; however, the 1-year mortality rate was comparatively lower. The need for rigorous dental clearance pre-TAVI and maintenance of dental health post-TAVI is underscored by the high prevalence of oral streptococcus species in this cohort.
