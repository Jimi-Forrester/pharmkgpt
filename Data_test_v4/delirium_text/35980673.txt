35980673|a|Kidney transplant (KT) recipients with delirium, a preventable surgical complication, are likely to reap cognitive benefits from restored kidney function, but may be more vulnerable to longer-term neurotoxic stressors post-KT (i.e., aging, immunosuppression). In this prospective cohort study, we measured delirium (chart-based), global cognitive function (3MS), and executive function (Trail Making Test Part B minus Part A) in 894 recipients (2009-2021) at KT, 1/3/6-months, 1-year, and annually post-KT. Dementia was ascertained using linked Medicare claims. We described repeated measures of cognitive performance (mixed effects model) and quantified dementia risk (Fine & Gray competing risk) by post-KT delirium. Of 894 recipients, 43(4.8%) had post-KT delirium. Delirium was not associated with global cognitive function at KT (difference = -3.2 points, 95%CI: -6.7, 0.4) or trajectories post-KT (0.03 points/month, 95%CI: -0.27, 0.33). Delirium was associated with worse executive function at KT (55.1 s, 95%CI: 25.6, 84.5), greater improvements in executive function <2 years post-KT (-2.73 s/month, 95%CI: -4.46,-0.99), and greater decline in executive function >2 years post-KT (1.72 s/month, 95%CI: 0.22, 3.21). Post-KT delirium was associated with over 7-fold greater risk of dementia post-KT (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio = 7.84, 95%CI: 1.22, 50.40). Transplant centers should be aware of cognitive risks associated with post-KT delirium and implement available preventative interventions to reduce delirium risk.
