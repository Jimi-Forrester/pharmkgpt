36824554|t|A Case of Pseudoappendicitis Caused by Campylobacter Enteritis Diagnosed by Gram Staining and Direct Microscopic Investigation of Stool Specimen.
36824554|a|Campylobacter infection may progress to a systemic infection through the intestinal tract. In many cases, symptoms are within the self-limiting range and do not require multidisciplinary treatment. In contrast, systemic infections in younger patients may be more severe and require hospitalization. Many differential diagnoses are considered when Campylobacter infection presents with severe abdominal pain, and the initial diagnosis may be difficult. We encountered a patient with Campylobacter infection who presented with acute-onset fever and general malaise. We diagnosed the case in a resource-poor setting by performing Gram staining of stool samples and fecal microscopy. This case suggests that a diagnosis of Campylobacter pseudoappendicitis can be made efficiently by combining various stool tests rather than waiting for culture results.
