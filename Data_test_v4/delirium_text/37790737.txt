37790737|t|Nurses' Perception and Performance of End-of-Life Care in a Tertiary Hospital.
37790737|a|Purpose: This study aimed to identify levels of perception and performance of end-of-life care among nurses and to investigate correlations between perception and performance. Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive survey included 321 nurses from a tertiary hospital in Seoul, Korea. The participants had at least 6 months of work experience and had been involved in end-of-life care at least once, in either ward or intensive care unit settings. A structured questionnaire was utilized to assess their perception and performance of end-of-life care. Results: The mean score for perception of end-of-life care was 3.23+-0.34, while the score for performance of end-of-life care was 3.08+-0.34. There was a significant positive correlation between nurses' perception of end-of-life care and their performance in this area (r=0.78, P<0.001). Conclusion: It is necessary to change perceptions regarding end-of-life care and to develop systematic and standardized education programs including content such as assessing the hydration status of dying patients, evaluating mental aspects such as suicidal ideation, and providing spiritual care for nurses working in end-of-life departments.
