36436991|a|Epidemiological studies have suggested that diets rich in polyphenols/phenolic compounds are associated with reduced risk of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Experimental studies have indicated that these compounds have specific effects on AD pathogenesis as well as anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. For clinical use, several compounds have been investigated by clinical trials to establish their efficacy for prevention and treatment of AD or cognitive impairment.
