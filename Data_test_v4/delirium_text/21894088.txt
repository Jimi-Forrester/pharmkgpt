21894088|t|Synthesis and SAR study of novel peptide aldehydes as inhibitors of 20S proteasome.
21894088|a|Based on the analysis of the crystal structure of MG101 (1) and 20S proteasomes, a new series of peptide aldehyde derivatives were designed and synthesized. Their ability to inhibit 20S proteasome was assayed. Among them, Cbz-Glu(OtBu)-Phe-Leucinal (3c), Cbz-Glu(OtBu)-Leu-Leucinal (3d), and Boc-Ser(OBzl)-Leu-Leucinal (3o) exhibited the most activity, which represented an order of magnitude enhancement compared with MG132 (2). The covalent docking protocol was used to explore the binding mode. The structure-activity relationship of the peptide aldehyde inhibitors is discussed.
