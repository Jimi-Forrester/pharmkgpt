35548356|t|Integrated Network Pharmacology and Comprehensive Bioinformatics Identifying the Mechanisms and Molecular Targets of Yizhiqingxin Formula for Treatment of Comorbidity With Alzheimer's Disease and Depression.
35548356|a|Background: The Yizhiqinxin formula (YZQX) has been used to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) or major depression disorder (MDD). However, its specific underlying mechanisms and therapeutic targets remain unclear. Methods: The ingredients and putative targets of YZQX were screened using the TCMSP and Drugbank databases. Next, the GEO database was used to retrieve relevant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AD or MDD and normal tissues. The PPI network was established, merged, and further screened to identify the main ingredients and core targets of YZQX against AD and MDD comorbidities. We performed enrichment analysis of core targets to identify biological processes and pathways. Finally, AutoDock software was used to validate the binding affinity between the crucial targets of direct action and their corresponding ingredients. Results: A total of 43 ingredients were identified from YZQX, of which 43 were screened to yield 504 targets. By establishing the PPI network, 92 targets were regarded as targets of YZQX against AD and MDD comorbidities in the core network. Promising targets (HSP90AA1, ESR1, AKT1, VCAM1, EGFR, CDK1, MAPK1, CDK2, MYC, HSPB1, and HSPA5) and signaling pathways (PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, MAPK signaling pathway, etc.) were filtered and refined to elucidate the underlying mechanism of YZQX against AD and MDD comorbidities. Molecular docking confirmed the ingredients of YZQX (quercetin and kaempferol) could bind well to multiple crucial targets. Conclusion: The ingredients of YZQX, such as quercetin and kaempferol, might treat AD and MDD comorbidities by acting on multiple targets and pathways.
