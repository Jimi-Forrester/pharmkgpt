36579592|a|This case series presents the novel genetic addiction risk score (GARS), which shows a high prevalence of polymorphic risk alleles of reward genes in a nuclear family with multiple reward deficiency syndrome (RDS) behavioral issues expressing a hypodopaminergic antecedent. The family consists of a mother, father, son, and daughter. The mother experienced issues with focus, memory, anger, and amotivational syndrome. The father experienced weight issues and depression. The son experienced heavy drinking, along with some drug abuse and anxiety. The daughter experienced depression, lethargy, brain fog, focus issues, and anxiety, among others. A major clinical outcome of the results presented to the family members helped reduce personal guilt and augment potential hope for future healing. Our laboratory's prior research established that carriers of four or more alleles measured by GARS (DRD1-DRD4, DAT1, MOR, GABABR3, COMT, MAOAA, and 5HTLPR) are predictive of the addiction severity index (ASI) for drug abuse, and carriers of seven or more alleles are predictive of severe alcoholism. This generational case series shows the impact that genetic information has on reducing stigma and guilt in a nuclear family struggling with RDS behaviors. The futuristic plan is to introduce an appropriate DNA-guided "pro-dopamine regulator" into the recovery and enhancement of life.
