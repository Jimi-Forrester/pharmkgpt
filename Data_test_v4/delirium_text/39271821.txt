39271821|a|Although the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still unknown, the molecular pathological phenomena is clear, mainly due to mitochondrial dysfunction and central nervous system inflammation caused by imbalanced antioxidant capacity and synaptic dysfunction, so antioxidant therapy is still the preferred treatment for AD. However, although antioxidant enzymes have high catalytic efficiency, the substrate spectrum is narrow; Antioxidants have wider range of effects, but their efficiency is low. Since the antioxidant defense system in high-grade organisms is composed of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic systems, therefore we synthesized a metal-organic framework (MOF) with superoxide dismutase activity, and depending on the interface potential effect, curcumin was loaded to construct a synergistic antioxidant treatment system. More importantly, due to the complementary surface electrostatic potential between MOF and curcumin, the system exhibited both good antioxidant activity and efficient beta-amyloid plaque scavenging ability, which slowed down the cognitive dysfunction in the brain of AD mice.
