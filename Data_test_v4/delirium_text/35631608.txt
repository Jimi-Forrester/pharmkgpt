35631608|t|A Real-Time Sensing System for Monitoring Neural Network Degeneration in an Alzheimer's Disease-on-a-Chip Model.
35631608|a|Stem cell-based in vitro models may provide potential therapeutic strategies and allow drug screening for neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, we develop a neural stem cell (NSC) spheroid-based biochip that is characterized by a brain-like structure, well-defined neural differentiation, and neural network formation, representing a brain-on-a-chip. This system consisted of microelectrode arrays with a multichannel platform and allowed the real-time monitoring of network formation and degeneration by impedance analysis. The parameters of this platform for the real-time tracking of network development and organization were established based on our previous study. Subsequently, beta-amyloid (Abeta) was added into the brain-on-a-chip system to generate an AD-on-a-chip model, and toxic effects on neurons and the degeneration of synapses were observed. The AD-on-a-chip model may help us to investigate the neurotoxicity of Abeta on neurons and neural networks in real time. Abeta causes neural damage and accumulates around neurites or inside neurospheroids, as observed by immunostaining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). After incubation with Abeta, reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased, synapse function decreased, and the neurotransmitter-acetylcholine (ACh) concentration decreased were observed. Most importantly, the real-time analysis system monitored the impedance value variation in the system with Abeta incubation, providing consecutive network disconnection data that are consistent with biological data. This platform provides simple, real-time, and convenient sensing to monitor the network microenvironment. The proposed AD-on-a-chip model enhances the understanding of neurological pathology, and the development of this model provides an alternative for the study of drug discovery and cell-protein interactions in the brain.
