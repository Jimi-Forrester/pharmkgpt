29037261|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition in the brain is an early and invariable feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Abeta peptides are composed of about 40 amino acids and are generated from amyloid precursor proteins (APP), by beta- and gamma-secretases. The distribution of individual Abeta peptides in the brains of aged people, and those suffering from AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is not fully characterized. We employed the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) to illustrate the spatial distribution of a broad range of Abeta species in human autopsied brains. With technical advancements such as formic acid pretreatment of frozen autopsied brain samples, we have: i) demonstrated that Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-43 were selectively deposited in senile plaques while full-length Abeta peptides such as Abeta1-36, 1-37, 1-38, 1-39, 1-40, and Abeta1-41 were deposited in leptomeningeal blood vessels. ii) Visualized distinct depositions of N-terminal truncated Abeta40 and Abeta42, including pyroglutamate modified at Glu-3 (N3pE), only with IMS for the first time. iii) Demonstrated that one single amino acid alteration at the C-terminus between Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-41 results in profound changes in their distribution pattern. In vitro, this can be attributed to the difference in the self-aggregation ability amongst Abeta1-40, Abeta1-41, and Abeta1-42. These observations were further confirmed with immunohistochemistry (IHC), using the newly developed anti-Abeta1-41 antibody. Here, distinct depositions of truncated and/or modified C- and N-terminal fragments of Abetas in AD and CAA brains with MALDI-IMS were visualized in a spacio-temporal specific manner. Specifically, Abeta1-41 was detected both with MALDI-IMS and IHC suggesting that a single amino acid alteration at the C-terminus of Abeta results in drastic distribution changes. These results suggest that MALDI-IMS could be used as a standard approach in combination with clinical, genetic, and pathological observations in understanding the pathology of AD and CAA.
