18635022|t|NMDA receptors in clinical neurology: excitatory times ahead.
18635022|a|Since the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits were cloned less than two decades ago, a substantial amount of research has been invested into understanding their physiological function in the healthy CNS. Research has also been directed at their pathological roles in various neurological diseases, including disorders resulting from acute excitotoxic insults (eg, ischaemic stroke, traumatic brain injury), diseases due to chronic neurodegeneration (eg, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), disorders arising from sensitisation of neurons (eg, epilepsy, neuropathic pain), and neurodevelopmental disorders associated with NMDAR hypofunction (eg, schizophrenia). Selective NMDAR antagonists have not produced positive results in clinical trials. However, there are other NMDAR-targeted therapies used in current practice that are effective for treating some neurological disorders. In this Review, we describe the evidence for the use of these therapies and provide an overview of drugs being investigated in clinical trials. We also discuss new NMDAR-targeted strategies in clinical neurology.
