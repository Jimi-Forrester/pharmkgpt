27316085|t|Confusion: an age-old problem.
27316085|a|Despite the fact that around one third of older people admitted to hospital over the age of 65 years has delirium, this serious condition gets little attention in either practice or journals. It is often not recognised and is not routinely assessed, but its impact is significant. Lack of diagnosis and treatment can mean that many older people follow care trajectories that could otherwise be avoided, and can result in long-term care and unnecessary suffering.
