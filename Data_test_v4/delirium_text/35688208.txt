35688208|a|Neurosteroids, modulators of neuronal and glial cell functions, are synthesized in the nervous system from cholesterol. In peripheral steroidogenic tissues, cholesterol is converted to the major steroid precursor pregnenolone by the CYP11A1 enzyme. Although pregnenolone is one of the most abundant neurosteroids in the brain, expression of CYP11A1 is difficult to detect. We found that human glial cells produced pregnenolone, detectable by mass spectrometry and ELISA, despite the absence of observable immunoreactive CYP11A1 protein. Unlike testicular and adrenal cortical cells, pregnenolone production in glial cells was not inhibited by CYP11A1 inhibitors DL-aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole. Furthermore, addition of hydroxycholesterols increased pregnenolone synthesis, suggesting desmolase activity that was not blocked by DL-aminoglutethimide or ketoconazole. We explored three different possibilities for an alternative pathway for glial cell pregnenolone synthesis: (1) regulation by reactive oxygen species, (2) metabolism via a different CYP11A1 isoform, and (3) metabolism via another CYP450 enzyme. First, we found oxidants and antioxidants had no significant effects on pregnenolone synthesis, suggesting it is not regulated by reactive oxygen species. Second, overexpression of CYP11A1 isoform b did not alter synthesis, indicating use of another CYP11A1 isoform is unlikely. Finally, we show nitric oxide and iron chelators deferoxamine and deferiprone significantly inhibited pregnenolone production, indicating involvement of another CYP450 enzyme. Ultimately, knockdown of endoplasmic reticulum cofactor NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase had no effect, while knockdown of mitochondrial CYP450 cofactor ferredoxin reductase inhibited pregnenolone production. These data suggest that pregnenolone is synthesized by a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzyme other than CYP11A1 in human glial cells.
