34345600|a|Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases in the world. Cancer may occur due to gene mutation. Rhaphidophora pinnata is a plant that has many benefits, especially in the leaves which have been used traditionally to treat cancer. The aim of this research is to test the antimutagenic activity of nanoparticles R. pinnata using the micronucleus method. The mice were induced with cyclophosphamide and then followed with the administration of nanoparticles of R. pinnata at the doses of 50, 100, 200 mg/kg for 7 days. The antimutagenic activity was evaluated at the decrease in the number of micronucleus in 200 polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) cells of mice bone marrow. The result showed that the reduction of amount of micronucleus in PCE of a negative control group, treatment groups, and normal group is 22.65%, 60.3%, 79.6%, 93.8%, and 100%. These results indicate that the antimutagenic activity of nanoparticle of R. pinnata increases proportionally as the doses were increased. It can be concluded that nanoparticles R. pinnata at the doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg have antimutagenic activity.
