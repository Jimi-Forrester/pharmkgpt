35357053|a|Ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke, ranked as the second leading cause of death worldwide. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is considered as a systematic method of assessing ischemic change on non-contrast CT scans (NCCT) of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients, while still suffering from the requirement of experts' experience and also the inconsistent results between readers. In this study, we proposed an automated ASPECTS method to utilize the powerful learning ability of neural networks for objectively scoring CT scans of AIS patients. First, we proposed to use the CT perfusion (CTP) from one-stop stroke imaging to provide the golden standard of ischemic regions for ASPECTS scoring. Second, we designed an asymmetry network to capture features when comparing the left and right sides for each ASPECTS region to estimate its ischemic status. Third, we performed experiments in a large main dataset of 870 patients, as well as an independent testing dataset consisting of 207 patients with radiologists' scorings. Experimental results show that our network achieved remarkable performance, as sensitivity and accuracy of 93.7 and 92.4% in the main dataset, and 95.5 and 91.3% in the independent testing dataset, respectively. In the latter dataset, our analysis revealed a high positive correlation between the ASPECTS score and the prognosis of patients in 90DmRs. Also, we found ASPECTS score is a good indicator of the size of CTP core volume of an infraction. The proposed method shows its potential for automated ASPECTS scoring on NCCT images.
