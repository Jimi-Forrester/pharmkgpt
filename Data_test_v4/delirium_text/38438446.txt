38438446|a|Colocalization of microbial pathogens and the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients suggests that microbial infection may play a role in sporadic AD. Abeta exhibits antimicrobial activity against numerous pathogens, supporting a potential role for Abeta in the innate immune response. While mammalian amyloid is associated with disease, many bacteria form amyloid fibrils to fortify the biofilm that protects the cells from the surrounding environment. In the microbial AD hypothesis, Abeta aggregates in response to infection to combat the pathogen. We hypothesize that this occurs through toxic Abeta oligomers that contain alpha-sheet structure and form prior to fibrillization. De novo designed alpha-sheet peptides specifically bind to the alpha-sheet structure present in the oligomers of both bacterial and mammalian amyloidogenic proteins to neutralize toxicity and inhibit aggregation. Here, we measure the effect of E. coli on Abeta, including upregulation, aggregation, and toxicity. Additionally, we determined the effect of Abeta structure on E. coli amyloid fibrils, or curli comprised of the CsgA protein, and biofilm formation. We found that curli formation by E. coli increased Abeta oligomer production, and Abeta oligomers inhibited curli biogenesis and reduced biofilm cell density. Further, curli and biofilm inhibition by Abeta oligomers increased E. coli susceptibility to gentamicin. Toxic oligomers of Abeta and CsgA interact via alpha-sheet interactions, neutralizing their toxicity. These results suggest that exposure to toxic oligomers formed by microbial pathogens triggers Abeta oligomer upregulation and aggregation to combat infection via selective interactions between alpha-sheet oligomers to neutralize toxicity of both species with subsequent inhibition of fibrillization.
