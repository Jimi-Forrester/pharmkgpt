38273871|t|Marburg Virus Outbreak in Equatorial Guinea: Need for Speed.
38273871|a|The co-existence of deadly viral pandemics can be considered a nightmare for public health authorities. The surge of a Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreak in Africa at a time when the coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is partially controlled with its limited resources is an urgent call for concern. Over the past decades, several bouts of MVD outbreaks have occurred in Africa with an alarming case fatality rate. Despite this, little has been done to end its recurrence, and affected countries essentially depend on preventative rather than curative measures of management. The recent outbreak of MVD declared by the health officials of Equatorial Guinea, causing several deaths in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, signals the need for speed in the establishment and the implementation of appropriate health policies and health system strategies to contain, destroy, and prevent the spread of this deadly virus to other neighboring countries.
