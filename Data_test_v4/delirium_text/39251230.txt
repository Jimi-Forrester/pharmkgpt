39251230|a|The majority of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibit aggregates of Trans-active response DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in their hippocampus, which is associated with a more aggressive disease progression. The TDP-43 inclusions are commonly found in neurons, but also in astrocytes. The impact of the inclusions in astrocytes is less known. In the current study, we investigate the presence of phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) inclusions in astrocytic endfeet and their potential association with blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage, glymphatic system dysfunction, and AD pathology. By staining postmortem hippocampal sections from AD patients and non-demented controls against TDP-43 and pTDP-43 together with the astrocytic markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), astrocytic endfeet marker Aquaporin-4 (AQP4), and markers for BBB alterations (CD146) and leakiness (Immunoglobulin A), we demonstrate a close association between perivascular pTDP-43 or TDP-43 inclusions and GFAP or AQP4. These perivascular inclusions were more prominent in AD and correlated with the disease severity and loss of CD146 and AQP4. The findings indicate a relationship between pTDP-43 accumulation in astrocytic endfeet and BBB and glymphatic system dysfunction, which may contribute to the downstream pathological events seen in AD patients and the aggressive disease progression.
