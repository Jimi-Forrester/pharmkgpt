36606679|t|Functional Network Alterations Associated with Cognition in Pre-Clinical Alzheimer's Disease.
36606679|a|Objective: Accumulation of cerebral amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a risk factor for cognitive decline and defining feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta is implicated in brain network disruption, but the extent to which these changes correspond with observable cognitive deficits in pre-clinical AD has not been tested. This study utilized individual-specific functional parcellations to sensitively evaluate the relationship between network connectivity and cognition in adults with and without Abeta deposition. Participants and Methods: Cognitively unimpaired adults ages 45-85 completed amyloid positron emission tomography, resting-state-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and neuropsychological tests of episodic memory and executive function (EF). Participants in the upper tertile of mean standard uptake value ratio were considered Abeta+ (n = 50) while others were Abeta- (n = 99). Individualized functional network parcellations were generated from resting-state fMRI data. We examined the effects of group, network, and group-by-network interactions on memory and EF. Results: We observed several interactions such that within the Abeta+ group, preserved network integrity (i.e., greater connectivity within specific networks) was associated with better cognition, whereas network desegregation (i.e., greater connectivity between relative to within networks) was associated with worse cognition. This dissociation was most apparent for cognitive networks (frontoparietal, dorsal and ventral attention, limbic, and default mode), with connectivity relating to EF in the Abeta+ group specifically. Conclusions: Using an innovative approach to constructing individual-specified resting-state functional connectomes, we were able to detect differences in brain-cognition associations in pre-clinical AD. Our findings provide novel insight into specific functional network alterations occurring in the presence of Abeta that relate to cognitive function in asymptomatic individuals.
