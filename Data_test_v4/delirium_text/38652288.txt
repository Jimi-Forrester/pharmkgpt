38652288|t|Does Full-Mouth Disinfection Influence the Size of the Periodontal Inflammatory Burden and the Level of hsCRP?
38652288|a|PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of full-mouth disinfection on the sizes of the periodontal wound and periodontal inflammatory burden and whether it leads to a decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 20 systemically healthy subjects (11 women and 9 men) 30 to 68 years old with localised or generalised periodontitis (stage III, grade C). The sizes of the periodontal wound and periodontal inflammatory burden were measured with the web application "Periodontalwound", which is based on measurements of average tooth cervices, as well as probing depths and bleeding on probing assessed at six sites around each tooth present in the oral cavity. The levels of hsCRP (high-sensitivity CRP) were measured with an immunochemical method. All three parameters were measured before initial treatment and 3 months after therapy. Full-mouth disinfection included removal of plaque and calculus with ultrasonic and hand instruments in one session. RESULTS: The results showed a statistically significant decrease in the size of the periodontal wound (p < 0.001), a statistically significant decrease in the size of periodontal inflammatory burden (p < 0.001), and a decrease in hsCRP levels 3 months after therapy. CONCLUSION: Full-mouth disinfection leads to a decrease in the periodontal wound and periodontal inflammatory burden size, as well as a decrease in the levels of hsCRP in patients with localised or generalised periodontitis (stage III, grade C).
