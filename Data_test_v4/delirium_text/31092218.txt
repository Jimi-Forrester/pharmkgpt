31092218|t|Prevalence of dementia in the People's Republic of China from 1985 to 2015: a systematic review and meta-regression analysis.
31092218|a|BACKGROUND: In China, the most populous developing country in the world, dementia represents a serious challenge. We performed a large-scale systematic review and meta-regression analysis to elucidate the prevalence of dementia and its subtypes and to identify potential factors underlying the differences between articles. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in the following databases to identify studies published up to December 2015: Cochrane Library, CBMDISK, Chongqing VIP, CNKI, PubMed and EMBASE. All statistical analyses (including subtype and meta-regression analyses) were performed with R version 3.3.3. RESULTS: In total, 51 surveys were selected. The pooled prevalence rates of dementia and its main subtypes, namely, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VAD), for the population aged 55 years and older were 4.03, 2.44 and 1.09%, respectively. The outcomes showed that the meta-regression analysis was affected by the publication year, sample size, region and diagnostic criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis provided reliable estimates of the prevalence of dementia/ AD/ VD over the past 30 years, which may be affected by education level, and diagnostic criteria. The prevalence of AD/VAD was higher in northern than in southern China, which warrants further study.
