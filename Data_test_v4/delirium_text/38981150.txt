38981150|t|Occurrence and risk factors for post-stroke delirium: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
38981150|a|OBJECTIVES: Delirium is a significant health concern in acute stroke patients. We aim to systematically summarize existing evidence to conduct a meta-analysis to quantify the occurrence and risk factors for delirium after acute stroke. METHOD: PubMed, EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched from inception to Feb. 2023 for prospective observational studies that reported the incidence or prevalence of post-stroke delirium and/or evaluated potential risk factors. The search strategy was created using controlled vocabulary terms and text words for stroke and delirium. We performed a meta-analysis of the estimates for occurrence and risk factors using random-effects models. Meta-regression and subgroup meta-analyses were conducted to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Study quality and quality of evidence were assessed using the customized Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and GRADE, respectively. RESULTS: Forty-nine studies that enrolled 12383 patients were included. The pooled occurrence rate of post-stroke delirium was 24.4 % (95 %CI, 20.4 %-28.9 %, I2=96.2 %). The pooled occurrence of hyperactive, hypoactive, and mixed delirium was 8.5 %, 5.7 % and 5.0 %, respectively. Study location, delirium assessment method and stroke type independently affected the heterogeneity of the pooled estimate of delirium. Statistically significant risk factors were older age, low education level, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, atrial fibrillation, lower ADL level, higher pre-stroke mRS score, premorbid cognitive impairment or dementia, aphasia, total anterior circulation impairment, higher National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score and infection. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium affected 1 in 4 acute stroke patients, although reported rates may depend on assessment method and stroke type. Timely prevention, recognition and intervention require prioritizing patients with dominant risk factors.
