9779506|t|MR spectroscopy of Alzheimer disease.
9779506|a|Spectroscopy is a technique that permits noninvasive evaluation of biological metabolites. Used with magnetic resonance imaging, spectroscopy can measure metabolites associated with Alzheimer disease. Researchers are trying to find a distinct connection between the disease and certain metabolites so that an accurate diagnosis can be made during a patient's life. Speculation arises as chemical metabolites present in patients with Alzheimer disease also correlate with other dementia diseases. At present, in vitro and in vivo spectroscopy studies are assessing a baseline for an accurate diagnosis.
