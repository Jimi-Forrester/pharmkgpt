21860093|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta40/42) aggregates containing the cross-beta-sheet structure are associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is generally accepted that the N-terminal peptide of Abeta40/42, Abeta1-16, does not aggregate, and is not cytotoxic. However, we here show that Abeta1-16 can aggregate, and form cytotoxic aggregates containing beta-turns and regular non-amyloid beta-sheet structures. Factors such as pH, ionic strength, and agitation were found to influence Abeta1-16 aggregation, and the amino acid residues Asp1, His6, Ser8, and Val12 in Abeta1-16 may play a role in this aggregation. Our MTT results showed that Abeta1-16 monomers or oligomers were toxic to SH-SY5Y cells, but Abeta1-16 fibrils exhibited less cytotoxicity. Our studies also indicate that Abeta1-16 aggregates can increase the formation of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, induce the loss of calcium homeostasis, and incur the microglial production of TNF-alpha and IL-4. Thus, our findings suggest that Abeta1-16 may contribute to AD pathogenesis.
