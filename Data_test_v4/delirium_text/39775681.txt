39775681|a|A virtual ward can provide hospital-level care for older people in their usual place of residence during an episode of acute illness. Care on a virtual ward may be delivered through a mix of in-person home visits, telephone or video calls and remote monitoring. This model of care can prevent unnecessary inpatient admissions, which in turn can prevent the development of associated complications in this patient population, such as deconditioning, delirium and hospital-acquired infections. However, there are barriers to the use of virtual wards in the care of older people. This article provides an overview of technology-enabled virtual wards and discusses some of the barriers to their use in older people's care as well as ways in which these can be addressed. The author also considers how nurses can help ensure that the care provided to an older person admitted to a virtual ward is person-centred and safe.
