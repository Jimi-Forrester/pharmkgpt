35984119|t|A bibliometric analysis of neuroimaging biomarkers in Parkinson disease based on Web of Science.
35984119|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to analyze and summarize the research hotspots and trends in neuroimaging biomarkers (NMBM) in Parkinson disease (PD) based on the Web of Science core collection database and provide new references for future studies. METHODS: Literature regarding NMBM in PD from 1998 to 2022 was analyzed using the Web of Science core collection database. We utilized CiteSpace software (6.1R2) for bibliometric analyses of countries/institutions/authors, keywords, keyword bursts, references, and their clusters. RESULTS: A total of 339 studies were identified with a continually increasing annual trend. The most productive country and collaboration was the United States. The top research hotspot is PD cognitive disorder. NMBM and artificial intelligence medical imaging have been applied in the clinical diagnosis, differential diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of PD. The trends in this field include research on T1 weighted structure magnetic resonance imaging in accordance with voxel-based morphometry, PD cognitive disorder, and neuroimaging features of Lewy body dementia and Alzheimer disease. CONCLUSION: The development of NMBM in PD will be effectively promoted by drawing on international research hotspots and cutting-edge technologies, emphasizing international collaboration and institutional cooperation at the national level, and strengthening interdisciplinary research.
