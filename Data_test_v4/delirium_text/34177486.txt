34177486|t|Theta-Range Oscillations in Stress-Induced Mental Disorders as an Oscillotherapeutic Target.
34177486|a|Emotional behavior and psychological disorders are expressed through coordinated interactions across multiple brain regions. Brain electrophysiological signals are composed of diverse neuronal oscillations, representing cell-level to region-level neuronal activity patterns, and serve as a biomarker of mental disorders. Here, we review recent observations from rodents demonstrating how neuronal oscillations in the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex are engaged in emotional behavior and altered by psychiatric changes such as anxiety and depression. In particular, we focus mainly on theta-range (4-12 Hz) oscillations, including several distinct oscillations in this frequency range. We then discuss therapeutic possibilities related to controlling such mental disease-related neuronal oscillations to ameliorate psychiatric symptoms and disorders in rodents and humans.
