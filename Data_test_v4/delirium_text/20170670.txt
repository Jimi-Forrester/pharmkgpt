20170670|t|Acute lecozotan administration increases learning and memory in rats without affecting anxiety or behavioral depression.
20170670|a|Lecozotan is a selective serotonergic 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist previously shown to enhance task performance efficiency in aged rhesus monkeys. In the present report we tested the ability of this drug to modify memory and learning in rats during a modified passive avoidance response test, and also tested its effect on anxiety with the elevated plus maze, and behavioral depression in the inescapable swim test. Lecozotan enhanced memory in a dose-dependent manner (0, 0.3, 0.5, 1 and 2mg/kg; s.c.), or prevented memory impairment previously induced with scopolamine-HCl. No significant changes in anxiety and behavioral depression were detected in animals treated with different doses of lecozotan (0, 0.3, 1 and 2mg/kg; s.c.) compared to control animals. These results suggest that lecozotan could enhance learning and memory in animals without affecting anxiety or behavioral depression scores and that it could be a viable alternative in the treatment of patients with cognitive deficits such as the Alzheimer's disease.
