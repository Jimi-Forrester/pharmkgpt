38698559|a|Frailty is a clinical state reflecting a decrease in physiological reserve capacities, known to affect numerous biological pathways and is associated with health issues, including neurodegenerative diseases. However, how global protein expression is affected in the central nervous system in frail subject remains underexplored. In this post hoc cross-sectional biomarker analysis, we included 90 adults (52-85 years) suspected of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) and presenting with markers of neurodegenerative diseases. We investigated the human proteomic profile of cerebrospinal fluid associated with frailty defined by an established cumulated frailty index (FI, average = 0.32), not enriched for neurology clinical features. Using a label-free quantitative proteomic approach, we identified and quantified 999 proteins of which 13 were positively associated with frailty. Pathway analysis with the top positively frailty-associated proteins revealed enrichment for proteins related to inflammation and immune response. Among the 60 proteins negatively associated with frailty, functional pathways enriched included neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and neuronal guidance. We constructed a frailty prediction model using ridge regression with 932 standardized proteins. Our results showed that the "proteomic model" could become an equivalent predictor of FI in order to study chronological age. This study represents the first comprehensive exploration of the proteomic profile of frailty within cerebrospinal fluid. It sheds light on the physiopathology of frailty, particularly highlighting processes of neuroinflammation and inhibition of neurogenesis. Our findings unveil a range of biological mechanisms that are dysregulated in frailty, in NPH subjects at risk of neurodegenerative impairment, offering new perspectives on frailty phenotyping and prediction.
