32874036|t|Methadone in Cancer Pain.
32874036|a|Methadone has been an unique, versatile, cost effective, synthetic opioid utilized in nociceptive as well as neuropathic pain. Pain and palliative care physicians started accepting methadone in treatment of complex pain associated with advanced cancer and neuropathic pain syndromes in which conventional opioids were no longer effective. The challenge is in accepting methadone as a main stream first line opioid, from being considered as a second line replacement/substitution drug all these years. Methadone has a significant role as opioid rotation in refractory cancer pain, especially when started early leading to successful conversion. Advantages of methadone in paediatric patients with advanced cancer were its safety and efficacy as a first-choice opioid, availability as a liquid formulation and its infrequent dose requirements. Methadone is neither recommended nor justified to be used as an anti-cancer drug and its role as an anti-cancer agent is a misconception. Many guidelines were proposed after 2008 to address methadone safety. Most of them emphasized on prevention of cardiac arrhythmia and association of methadone with QTc prolongation rather than address the real issue. Methadone has been established to be safe when used in opioid naive patients with careful titration instituted in an ambulatory setting and has equal success in opioid rotation in outpatient setup. Methadone prescription should be carried out by experienced pain and palliative care providers with careful dose titration and clinical monitoring.
