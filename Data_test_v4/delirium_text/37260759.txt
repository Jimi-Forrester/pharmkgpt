37260759|a|Background: Insomnia is a commonly seen symptom in adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD). The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is the circadian rhythm regulation center, plays a crucial role in the regulation of sleep-wake circulation. Nevertheless, how SCN function contributes to the exact neural mechanisms underlying the associations between insomnia and depressive symptoms has not been explored in adolescents. In the current study, we aimed to explore the relationship between SCN functional connectivity (FC) and insomnia symptoms in adolescents with MDD using a seed-based FC method. Methods: In the current study, we recruited sixty-eight first-episode drug-naive adolescents with MDD and classified them into high insomnia (MDD-HI) and low insomnia (MDD-LI) groups according to the sleep disturbance subscale of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-S). Forty-three age/gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) were also recruited. SCN FC maps were generally for all subjects and compared among three groups using one-way ANOVA with age, gender and adjusted HAMD score as covariates. We used partial correlations to explore associations between altered FC and clinical symptoms, including sleep quality scores. Results: Adolescents with MDD showed worse sleep quality, which positively correlated with the severity of depression. Compared to MDD-LI and HCs, MDD-HI adolescents demonstrated significantly decreased FC between the right SCN and bilateral precuneus, and there was no significant difference between the MDD-LI and HC groups. The HAMD-S scores were negatively correlated with bilateral SCN-precuneus connectivity, and the retardation factor score of HAMD was negatively correlated with right SCN-precuneus connectivity. Conclusion: The altered FC between the SCN and precuneus may underline the neural mechanism of sleep-related symptoms in depressive adolescents and provide potential targets for personalized treatment strategies.
