21535289|t|Teenage toxins: recreational poisoning in the adolescent.
21535289|a|Adolescents are experimenting with recreational drugs on a regular basis, particularly at social gatherings such as parties, raves and mass events. A combination of reduced fluid intake, physical activity and drug-induced hyperthermia leads to complications such as heat stroke, delirium and potentially death. The clinician needs to be aware of the variety of pharmacologically active substances available in the recreational marketplace in order to diagnose and manage these patients. Recreational misadventure, because of incorrect dosage or mixing multiple substances, is a common reason for teenagers presenting to hospital with toxidromes. Death from club drug overdose is more likely to be associated with suicidal intent, related risky behaviour and trauma, as well as the inherent toxicity of the drug itself. Although many teenagers are concerned about 'drink spiking' with club drugs, the most common agent causing drink spiking incidents is ethanol.
