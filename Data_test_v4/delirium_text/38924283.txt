38924283|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. Omega-3 fatty acids (n-3-PUFA) are essential to normal neural development and function. Souvenaid , a medical supplement that contains n-3-PUFA's: eicosatetraenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), has emerged as an alternative, slowing cognitive decline in AD patients. In this study, we investigated the effect of dietary supplementation with n-3-PUFA, EPA, DHA, and Souvenaid  in AD patients. AIM: This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to establish the relationship between n-3-PUFA, EPA, DHA, and Souvenaid  with cognitive effects, ventricular volume and adverse events in AD patients. METHODS: A systematic search of randomized control trials (RCT), cohorts, and case-control studies was done in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Embase for AD adult patients with dietary supplementation with n-3-PUFA, EPA, DHA, or Souvenaid  between 2003 and 2024. RESULTS: We identified 14 studies with 2766 subjects aligned with our criteria. Most publications described positive cognitive outcomes from supplements (58%). The most common adverse events reported were gastrointestinal symptoms. CDR scale showed reduced progression of cognitive decline (SMD = -0.4127, 95% CI: [-0.5926; -0.2327]), without subgroup differences between different dietary supplement interventions. ADCS-ADL, MMSE, ADAS-cog, adverse events, and ventricular volume did not demonstrate significant differences. However, Souvenaid  showed a significant negative effect (SMD = -0.3593, 95% CI: -0.5834 to -0.1352) in ventricular volumes. CONCLUSIONS: The CDR scale showed reduced progression of cognitive decline among patients with n-3-PUFA supplemental interventions, with no differences between different n-3-PUFA supplements.
