30480226|t|Aluminum Should Now Be Considered a Primary Etiological Factor in Alzheimer's Disease.
30480226|a|In this paper, I have summarized the experimental and largely clinical evidence that implicates aluminum as a primary etiological factor in Alzheimer's disease. The unequivocal neurotoxicity of aluminum must mean that when brain burdens of aluminum exceed toxic thresholds that it is inevitable that aluminum contributes toward disease. Aluminum acts as a catalyst for an earlier onset of Alzheimer's disease in individuals with or without concomitant predispositions, genetic or otherwise. Alzheimer's disease is not an inevitable consequence of aging in the absence of a brain burden of aluminum.
