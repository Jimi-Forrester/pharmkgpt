36718002|a|Synapse loss has been considered as a major pathological change in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It remains unclear about whether and how synapse loss relates to functional and structural connectivity dysfunction in AD. We measured synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A (SV2A) binding using 18F-SynVesT-1 PET to evaluate synaptic alterations in 33 participants with AD, 31 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 30 controls. We examined the correlation between synaptic density and cognitive function. Functional MRI was performed to analyze functional connectivity in lower synaptic density regions. We tracked the white matter tracts between impaired functional connectivity regions using Diffusion MRI. In AD group, lower synaptic density in bilateral cortex and hippocampus was found when compared with controls. The synaptic density changes in right insular cortex and bilateral caudal middle frontal gyrus (MFG) were correlated with cognitive decline. Among them, right MFG synaptic density was positively associated with right MFG - bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG) functional connectivity. AD had lower probability of tract (POT) between right MFG and SFG than controls, which was significantly associated with global cognition. These findings provide evidence supporting synapse loss contributes to functional and related structural connectivity alterations underlying cognitive impairment of AD.
