26641942|a|Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are a marker of small vessel disease, increasingly recognized as being of importance in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) process. CMBs influence in AD, and its longitudinal impact on disease progression is however still unknown. CMBs show several associations with AD across studies, are associated with decreased cerebrospinal fluid amyloid levels and are related with the ApoE epsilon4 allele, as well as other imaging manifestations typical for small vessel disease. CMBs, in addition to other markers of small vessel disease, are important to discover further in order to discern possible AD phenotypes.
