34911929|a|Liquid-liquid phase separation or LLPS of proteins is a field of mounting importance and the value of quantitative kinetic and thermodynamic characterization of LLPS is increasingly recognized. We present a method, Capflex, which allows rapid and accurate quantification of key parameters for LLPS: Dilute phase concentration, relative droplet size distributions, and the kinetics of droplet formation and maturation into amyloid fibrils. The binding affinity between the polypeptide undergoing LLPS and LLPS-modulating compounds can also be determined. We apply Capflex to characterize the LLPS of Human DEAD-box helicase-4 and the coacervate system ssDNA/RP3. Furthermore, we study LLPS and the aberrant liquid-to-solid phase transition of alpha-synuclein. We quantitatively measure the decrease in dilute phase concentration as the LLPS of alpha-synuclein is followed by the formation of Thioflavin-T positive amyloid aggregates. The high information content, throughput and the versatility of Capflex makes it a valuable tool for characterizing biomolecular LLPS.
