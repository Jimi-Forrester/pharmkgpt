32774341|a|BACKGROUND: Easy Z-score imaging system (eZIS)-assisted SPECT accurately detects decreases in cerebral blood flow in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, and parietal lobe, the cerebral regions deeply implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several studies suggested onset age-dependent decreases in cerebral blood flow in these regions in AD, but these studies did not screen for amyloid accumulation, suggesting inclusion of non-AD patients in their subjects. OBJECTIVE: By applying eZIS-SPECT to patients with amyloid deposition, it was the aim of this study to clarify onset age-dependent decreases in cerebral blood flow in the regions critical to AD. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed eZIS-SPECT data on 34 AD patients with amyloid retention confirmed by 11C-Pittsburgh compound B-PET. The subjects were divided into an early-onset group (n = 16) and a late-onset group (n = 18). The three indicators of the eZIS that had discriminated between AD patients and normal controls in previous studies were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The mean values for the respective indicators were significantly higher in the early-onset group than in the late-onset group. Also, the proportion of patients with abnormalities in all indicators was significantly higher in the early-onset group (93.8%) than in the late-onset group (50.0%). CONCLUSIONS: The present study, applying eZIS-SPECT to amyloid-positive AD patients, suggests that reduced cerebral blood flow in the PCC, precuneus, and parietal lobe is more pronounced in the early-onset type than in the late-onset type of the disease.
