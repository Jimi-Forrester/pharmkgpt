37958586|t|Raman-Based Techniques in Medical Applications for Diagnostic Tasks: A Review.
37958586|a|Raman spectroscopy is a widely developing approach for noninvasive analysis that can provide information on chemical composition and molecular structure. High chemical specificity calls for developing different medical diagnostic applications based on Raman spectroscopy. This review focuses on the Raman-based techniques used in medical diagnostics and provides an overview of such techniques, possible areas of their application, and current limitations. We have reviewed recent studies proposing conventional Raman spectroscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy for rapid measuring of specific biomarkers of such diseases as cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurogenerative disease, and coronavirus disease (COVID-19). As a result, we have discovered several most promising Raman-based applications to identify affected persons by detecting some significant spectral features. We have analyzed these approaches in terms of their potentially diagnostic power and highlighted the remaining challenges and limitations preventing their translation into clinical settings.
