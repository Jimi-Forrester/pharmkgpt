36669750|a|Radial glial cells (RGCs) play a pivotal role in cerebral cortical development by functioning as a source of new neurons and by supporting the migration of newborn neurons. These functions are primarily dependent on the apical-basolateral structures of radial glial processes. This study aims to investigate the effects of ethanol exposure on the development of radial glial processes and the generation, migration, and transformation of outer radial glial cells (oRGCs). For this purpose, forebrain organoids were developed from human embryonic stem cells. These forebrain organoids contain abundant neural progenitor cells (SOX2+), express high levels of neural epithelial markers beta-catenin and PKClambda, and dorsal forebrain marker PAX6, and display well-organized cortical architectures containing abundant apical and basal RGCs, intermediate progenitors (IPCs), and neurons. Exposure of forebrain organoids to ethanol resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis in Nestin-positive radial glial cells. Ethanol exposure also remarkably decreased the levels of radial glial process-associated proteins, including Nestin, GFAP, and Vimentin, in radial glial cells and distinctly impaired the integrity and morphologies of radial glial processes. In addition, the ethanol-induced impairment of the radial glial processes is associated with decreased migration and proliferation of radial glial cells, reduction in the generation of HOPX+ oRGCs, and the accelerated transformation of oRGCs into astrocytes. These results demonstrate that ethanol exposure can disrupt cerebral cortex development by impairing the formation of radial glial processes and the generation, migration, and transformation of oRGCs.
