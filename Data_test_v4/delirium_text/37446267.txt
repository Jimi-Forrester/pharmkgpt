37446267|t|Opioids Alleviate Oxidative Stress via the Nrf2/HO-1 Pathway in LPS-Stimulated Microglia.
37446267|a|Opioids are known to have antioxidant effects and to modulate microglial function under certain conditions. It has been previously shown that opioid ligands can effectively inhibit the release of proinflammatory cytokines when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and convert microglia to an anti-inflammatory polarization state. Here, we used C8-B4 cells, the mouse microglial cell line activated by LPS as a model to investigate the anti-inflammatory/antioxidant potential of selected opioid receptor agonists (DAMGO, DADLE, and U-50488). We found that all of these ligands could exert cytoprotective effects through the mechanism affecting LPS-induced ROS production, NADPH synthesis, and glucose uptake. Interestingly, opioids elevated the level of reduced glutathione, increased ATP content, and enhanced mitochondrial respiration in microglial cells exposed to LPS. These beneficial effects were associated with the upregulation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. The present results indicate that activation of opioid signaling supports the preservation of mitochondrial function with concomitant elimination of ROS in microglia and suggest that an Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway-dependent mechanism is involved in the antioxidant efficacy of opioids. Opioid receptor agonists may therefore be considered as agents to suppress oxidative stress and inflammatory responses of microglia.
