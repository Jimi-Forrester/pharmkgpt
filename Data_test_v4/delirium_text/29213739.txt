29213739|t|Criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: Recommendations of the Scientific Department of Cognitive Neurology and Aging of the Brazilian Academy of Neurology.
29213739|a|This consensus prepared by the Scientific Department of Cognitive Neurology and Aging of the Brazilian Academy of Neurology is aimed at recommending new criteria for the diagnosis of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Brazil. A revision was performed of the proposals of clinical and of research criteria suggested by other institutions and international consensuses. The new proposal for the diagnosis of dementia does not necessarily require memory impairment if the cognitive or behavioral compromise affects at least two of the following domains: memory, executive function, speech, visual-spatial ability and change in personality. For the purpose of diagnosis, AD is divided into three phases: dementia, mild cognitive impairment and pre-clinical phase, where the latter only applies to clinical research. In the dementia picture, other initial forms were accepted which do not involve amnesia and require a neuroimaging examination. Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers are recommended for study, but can be utilized as optional instruments, when deemed appropriate by the clinician.
