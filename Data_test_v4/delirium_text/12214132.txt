12214132|a|Pentosidine, an advanced glycation end product (AGE), was assayed by HPLC in serum proteins from patients with Alzheimer type dementia (AD), patients with diabetes mellitus (D), and healthy (C) age-matched old subjects (mean age from each group = 84 years). Serum pentosidine was significantly different between the three groups despite similar renal function (serum creatinine < 160 micromol/L). In all groups of patients, pentosidine was independent of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and the early glycation marker fructosamine and appeared to be an independent marker, mainly bound to serum albumin. Pentosidine could be an important factor useful for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
