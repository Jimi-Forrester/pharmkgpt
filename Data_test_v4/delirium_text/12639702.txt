12639702|t|Red wine micronutrients as protective agents in Alzheimer-like induced insult.
12639702|a|Plant extract micronutrients are commonly added to diets for health and prevention of degenerative disease. However, there are barriers to the introduction of these products as antioxidant therapies in counteracting chronic human diseases, probably because the molecular bases of their therapeutic potential are poorly clarified. The present study was designed to evaluate the possible protective effect of combined micronutrients present in black grape skin on toxicity induced by 25-35 beta-amyloid peptid or by serum of Alzheimer's disease patients, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The hypothesis was tested by examining the results of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) release to estimate cytoplasmic membrane breakdown; activity of mitochondrial complexes, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and malonyl dialdehyde (MDA) levels as markers of oxidative stress induction and COMET assay to evaluate DNA fragmentation. The results demonstrate that black grape skin extract reduces the ROS production, protects the cellular membrane from oxidative damage, and consequently prevents DNA fragmentation. The experimental results suggest that this natural compound may be used to ameliorate the progression of pathology in AD disease therapy.
