34754608|t|Tau-PET imaging as a molecular modality for Alzheimer's disease.
34754608|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative condition. The definitive diagnosis of AD remains a post-mortem neuropathological study of the brain. Unfortunately, there are no established diagnostic criteria to achieve an accurate diagnosis of AD in a similarly objective fashion among living patients. Molecular imaging provides one way of enhancing clinical criteria where objective measures of AD correlate to the presence and progression of disease. In this article, the amyloid and tau hypotheses are considered with respect to pathological, imaging, and therapeutic studies. The value of beta-amyloid (Abeta) PET and tau PET are ascertained. Subsequently, the binding characteristics and quality of Abeta and tau tracers are explored. Finally, the value of Abeta and tau imaging in AD can be determined relevant from in-vivo studies of AD patients. Considering the evolving literature in AD and PET imaging, it has become clear that PET can play a role in the diagnosis and prognosis of AD. The use of Abeta imaging has been extensively studied with mixed results suggesting a limited clinical utility. Conversely, tau-PET has shown early success in similar applications as Abeta imaging. Specifically, we find that there is value in FDG-PET and prospective utility in tau-PET. Ultimately, the community must acknowledge that the role of Abeta imaging for diagnosing and managing AD is very limited and that FDG-PET will remain the study of choice at this time. Moreover, research efforts must continue to determine the prospective value of tau imaging to the assessment of this disease.
