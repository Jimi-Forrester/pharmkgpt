11489281|a|Most familial early-onset Alzheimer's disease (FAD) is caused by mutations in the presenilin-1 (PS1) gene. Abeta 42 is derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) and increased concentrations are widely believed to be a pathological hallmark of abnormal PS function. Thus, the interaction between PS1 and APP is central to the molecular mechanism of AD. To examine the effect of wild-type human PS1 on rat APP metabolism, we made several PC12D cell lines that expressed human wild or mutant PS1, and analyzed the processing of endogenous rat APP and the intracellular gamma-secretase activity. We found the ratio of Abeta 42/Abeta 40 increased in PC12D cells expressing wild-type human PS1. These changes were identical to those found in PC12D cells expressing human PS1 bearing the A260V mutation. These results suggest that APP metabolism is physiologically regulated by the PS1 and that loss of normal PS1 affects gamma-secretase activity.
