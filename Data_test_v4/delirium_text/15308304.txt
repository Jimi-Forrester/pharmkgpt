15308304|t|Association between presenilin-1 -48C/T polymorphism and Down's syndrome.
15308304|a|Individuals with Down's syndrome (DS), i.e., trisomy 21, over 40 years of age, are likely to develop neuropathological changes characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The involvement of chromosome 21 both in DS and AD suggests a shared genetic susceptibility to these disorders, but genetic determinants are still undefined. The -48C/T polymorphism in the PSEN1 promoter is a possible candidate, since it has recently been associated with an increased risk of early onset AD. Based on the assumption that the excess of dementia in DS might be a consequence of a different distribution of the -48C/T polymorphism, we investigated the association between DS and this polymorphism in patients with trisomy 21 and controls. Overall, 260 DS patients and 197 controls were recruited at the Department of Neurosciences, Tor Vergata University of Rome. Cases and controls had similar age and gender distribution. High molecular weight DNA was extracted from whole blood samples collected in EDTANa(2) and -48C/T genotypes were determined. Genotype and allele frequencies were compared between cases and controls. Cases were less likely than controls to have the CC genotype ( P = 0.05). A significant difference for allele distribution between DS cases and controls was found, with DS showing a lower frequency of the allele C compared with the control population (OR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.35-0.91; P = 0.01). No significant interaction of PSEN1 with age, gender, ApoE and -850 TNF-alpha polymorphisms was found. The association found suggests that the -48C/T polymorphism in the PSN1 gene promoter, which is involved in the modulation of amyloid beta load in human AD, is associated with DS. However, the biological role of this polymorphism in DS-related dementia remains unclear and merits further investigation.
