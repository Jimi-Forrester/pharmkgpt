36237170|t|Anterior dorsal attention network tau drives visual attention deficits in posterior cortical atrophy.
36237170|a|Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), usually an atypical clinical syndrome of Alzheimer's disease, has well-characterized patterns of cortical atrophy and tau deposition that are distinct from typical amnestic presentations of Alzheimer's disease. However, the mechanisms underlying the cortical spread of tau in PCA remain unclear. Here, in a sample of 17 biomarker-confirmed (A+/T+/N+) individuals with PCA, we sought to identify functional networks with heightened vulnerability to tau pathology by examining the cortical distribution of elevated tau as measured by 18F-flortaucipir (FTP) PET. We then assessed the relationship between network-specific FTP uptake and visuospatial cognitive task performance. As predicted, we found consistent and prominent localization of tau pathology in the dorsal attention network and visual network of the cerebral cortex. Elevated FTP uptake within the dorsal attention network (particularly the ratio of FTP uptake between the anterior and posterior nodes) was associated with poorer visuospatial attention in PCA; associations were also identified in other functional networks, although to a weaker degree. Furthermore, using functional MRI data collected from each patient at wakeful rest, we found that a greater anterior-to-posterior ratio in FTP uptake was associated with stronger intrinsic functional connectivity between anterior and posterior nodes of the dorsal attention network. Taken together, we conclude that our cross-sectional marker of anterior-to-posterior FTP ratio could indicate tau propagation from posterior to anterior dorsal attention network nodes, and that this anterior progression occurs in relation to intrinsic functional connectivity within this network critical for visuospatial attention. Our findings help to clarify the spatiotemporal pattern of tau propagation in relation to visuospatial cognitive decline and highlight the key role of the dorsal attention network in the disease progression of PCA.
