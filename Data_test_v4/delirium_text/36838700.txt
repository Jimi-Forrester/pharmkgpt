36838700|t|Flavonoid Components, Distribution, and Biological Activities in Taxus: A review.
36838700|a|Taxus, also known as "gold in plants" because of the famous agents with emphases on Taxol and Docetaxel, is a genus of the family Taxaceae, distributed almost around the world. The plants hold an important place in traditional medicine in China, and its products are used for treating treat dysuria, swelling and pain, diabetes, and irregular menstruation in women. In order to make a further study and better application of Taxus plants for the future, cited references from between 1958 and 2022 were collected from the Web of Science, the China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI), SciFinder, and Google Scholar, and the chemical structures, distribution, and bioactivity of flavonoids identified from Taxus samples were summed up in the research. So far, 59 flavonoids in total with different skeletons were identified from Taxus plants, presenting special characteristics of compound distribution. These compounds have been reported to display significant antibacterial, antiaging, anti-Alzheimer's, antidiabetes, anticancer, antidepressant, antileishmaniasis, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive and antiallergic, antivirus, antilipase, neuronal protective, and hepatic-protective activities, as well as promotion of melanogenesis. Flavonoids represent a good example of the utilization of the Taxus species. In the future, further pharmacological and clinical experiments for flavonoids could be accomplished to promote the preparation of relative drugs.
