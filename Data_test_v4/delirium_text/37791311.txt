37791311|t|Ketone Bodies Rescue Mitochondrial Dysfunction Via Epigenetic Remodeling.
37791311|a|Ischemic cardiac disease is a major cause of mortality worldwide. However, the exact molecular processes underlying this disorder are not fully known. This study includes a comprehensive and coordinated set of in vivo and in vitro experiments using human cardiac specimens from patients with postischemic heart failure (HF) and healthy control subjects, a murine model of HF, and cellular systems. These approaches identified for the first time a specific pattern of maladaptive chromatin remodeling, namely a double methylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 and a single methylation at lysine 36 (H3_K27me2K36me1) consistently induced by ischemic injury in all these settings: human HF; murine HF; and in vitro models. Mechanistically, this work demonstrates that this histone modification mediates the ischemia-induced transcriptional repression of PPARG coactivator 1alpha (PGC1alpha), master regulator of mitochondrial function and biogenesis. Intriguingly, both the augmented H3_K27me2K36me1 and the mitochondrial dysfunction ensued by PGC1alpha down-regulation were significantly attenuated by the treatment with beta-hydroxybutyrate, the most abundant ketone body in humans, revealing a novel pathway coupling metabolism to gene expression. Taken together, these findings establish maladaptive chromatin remodeling as a key mechanism in postischemic heart injury, functionally modulated by ketone bodies.
