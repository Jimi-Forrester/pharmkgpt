20085559|a|OBJECTIVE: The application of biomarkers may potentially improve the efficiency of the diagnosis for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, no reliable biomarker has been identified to date. This study is aimed to identify proteins that might serve as potential biomarkers for PD diagnosis or pathogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D DIGE) technique, in combination with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), was used to determine the differentially expressed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins in PD patients (n = 3) compared with normal controls (n = 3). Selected proteins were further confirmed by Western blotting analysis in the CSF of PD patients (n = 8), Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (n = 6) and normal control subjects (n = 7). RESULTS: Eight proteins were identified after MS and protein database interrogation. In the CSF of PD patients, the expression levels of one isoform of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), tetranectin, myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1), and two unknown proteins were down-regulated, whereas the expression levels of another apoA-I isoform, proapolipoprotein, and lipoprotein were up-regulated. Western blotting indicates that the expression of tetranectin was reduced in the CSF from PD patients and elevated in AD, while the expression of apoA-I was changed only in the CSF from PD patients. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest that tetranectin and apoA-I may serve as potential biomarkers for PD, though further validation is needed.
