33632454|t|The relationship between heart disease and cognitive impairment.
33632454|a|Neurodegenerative dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease, and vascular cognitive impairment were once considered unrelated processes. Emerging evidence, however, shows that both conditions often coexist and that vascular risk factors in midlife predispose to the development of cognitive decline later in older adults. In addition, recent advanced in basic science research have elucidated key underpinnings of this association. In this chapter, we review the clinical and basic science data that explain the relationship between vascular risk factors, heart disease, and cognitive decline.
