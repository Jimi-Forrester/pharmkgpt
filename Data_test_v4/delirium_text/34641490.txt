34641490|a|As a new target protein for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) was expressed on the surface of microglia, which was shown to regulate neuroinflammation, be associated with a variety of neuropathologic, and regarded as a potential indicator for monitoring AD. In this study, a novel recognition system based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for the TREM2 target spot was established coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS), in order to screen the active ingredients targeting TREM2 from Datura metel seeds. The results showed that four lignan-amides were discovered as candidate compounds by SPR biosensor-UPLC/MS recognition analysis. According to the guidance of the active ingredients discovered by the system, the lignin-amides from Datura metel seeds (LDS) were preliminarily identified as containing 27 lignan-amides, which were enriched compositions by the HP-20 of Datura metel seeds. Meanwhile, the anti-inflammatory activity of LDS was evaluated in BV2 microglia induced by LPS. Our experimental results demonstrated that LDS could reduce NO release in LPS-treated BV2 microglia cells and significantly reduce the expression of the proteins of inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), microtubule-associated protein tau (Tau), and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA-1). Accordingly, LDS might increase the expression of TREM2/DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa (DAP12) and suppress the Toll-like receptor SX4 (TLR4) pathway and Recombinant NLR Family, Pyrin Domain Containing Protein 3 (NLRP3)/cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase-1 (Caspase-1) inflammasome expression by LDS in LPS-induced BV2 microglial cells. Then, the inhibitory release of inflammatory factors Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), and Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) inflammatory cytokines were detected to inhibit neuroinflammatory responses. The present results propose that LDS has potential as an anti-neuroinflammatory agent against microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory disorders.
