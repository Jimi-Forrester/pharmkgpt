33106552|a|The myristoylated zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP), which was originally developed as a protein kinase C/Mzeta (PKCzeta/PKMzeta) inhibitor, is known to produce the loss of different forms of memories. However, ZIP induces memory loss even in the absence of PKMzeta, and its mechanism of action, therefore, remains elusive. Here, through a kinome-wide screen, we found that glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3beta) was robustly activated by ZIP in vitro. ZIP induced depotentiation (a cellular substrate of memory erasure) of conditioning-induced potentiation at LA synapses, and the ZIP-induced depotentiation was prevented by a GSK-3beta inhibitor, 6-bromoindirubin-3-acetoxime (BIO-acetoxime). Consistently, GSK-3beta inhibition by BIO-acetoxime infusion or GSK-3beta knockdown by GSK-3beta shRNA in the LA attenuated ZIP-induced disruption of learned fear. Furthermore, conditioned fear was decreased by expression of a non-inhibitable form of GSK-3beta in the LA. Our findings suggest that GSK-3beta activation is a critical step for ZIP-induced disruption of memory.
