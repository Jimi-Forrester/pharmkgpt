24152606|t|Identification of PrP sequences essential for the interaction between the PrP polymers and Abeta peptide in a yeast-based assay.
24152606|a|Alzheimer disease is associated with the accumulation of oligomeric amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), accompanied by synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. Polymeric form of prion protein (PrP), PrP(Sc), is implicated in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). Recently, it was shown that the monomeric cellular form of PrP (PrP(C)), located on the neuron surface, binds Abeta oligomers (and possibly other beta-rich conformers) via the PrP(23-27) and PrP(90-110) segments, acting as Abeta receptor. On the other hand, PrP(Sc) polymers efficiently bind to Abeta monomers and accelerate their oligomerization. To identify specific PrP sequences that are essential for the interaction between PrP polymers and Abeta peptide, we have co-expressed Abeta and PrP (or its shortened derivatives), fused to different fluorophores, in the yeast cell. Our data show that the 90-110 and 28-89 regions of PrP control the binding of proteinase-resistant PrP polymers to the Abeta peptide, whereas the 23-27 segment of PrP is dispensable for this interaction. This indicates that the set of PrP fragments involved in the interaction with Abeta depends on PrP conformational state.
