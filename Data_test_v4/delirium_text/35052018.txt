35052018|a|BACKGROUND: Several nonpharmacological strategies for the prevention and treatment of delirium have been increasingly used because the aetiology of delirium is multifactorial. AIMS: To verify the association between nonpharmacological strategies (presence of companion, mobilization, absence of physical restraint and natural light) and the occurrence of delirium, and to identify risk factors for delirium in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. STUDY DESIGN: The study was conducted in a Brazilian medical and surgical ICU. The sample included patients older than 18 years with length of ICU stay greater than 24 h and without delirium on admission. Delirium was identified by applying the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU). The association between the variables and delirium was analysed using Mann-Whitney and chi-square tests, and multivariate logistic regression to identify the predictive factors. RESULTS: Of the 356 patients, 64 (18%) had delirium. The presence of a companion, mobilization, and physical restraint were associated with delirium, and the first two were identified as protective factors. That is, the odds of delirium decreased by 88% when a companion was present and by 95% when the patient was mobilized. The risk factors of delirium were length of ICU stay and age. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a companion and patient mobilization were identified as protective factors against delirium, highlighting their importance as preventive actions, especially in patients with a higher risk of developing this disorder. The findings regarding physical restraint can also be considered evidence indicating the need for careful use of this measure in clinical practice until evidence of its relationship with delirium is confirmed. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The implementation of strategies such as early mobilization, presence of a companion and careful assessment for the use of physical restraint by the multidisciplinary team can help control the occurrence of delirium in the ICU.
