37724837|t|Establishing an Efficient Electroporation-Based Method to Manipulate Target Gene Expression in the Axolotl Brain.
37724837|a|The tetrapod salamander species axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) is capable of regenerating injured brain. For better understanding the mechanisms of brain regeneration, it is very necessary to establish a rapid and efficient gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches to study gene function in the axolotl brain. Here, we establish and optimize an electroporation-based method to overexpress or knockout/knockdown target gene in ependymal glial cells (EGCs) in the axolotl telencephalon. By orientating the electrodes, we were able to achieve specific expression of EGFP in EGCs located in dorsal, ventral, medial, or lateral ventricular zones. We then studied the role of Cdc42 in brain regeneration by introducing Cdc42 into EGCs through electroporation, followed by brain injury. Our findings showed that overexpression of Cdc42 in EGCs did not significantly affect EGC proliferation and production of newly born neurons, but it disrupted their apical polarity, as indicated by the loss of the ZO-1 tight junction marker. This disruption led to a ventricular accumulation of newly born neurons, which are failed to migrate into the neuronal layer where they could mature, thus resulted in a delayed brain regeneration phenotype. Furthermore, when electroporating CAS9-gRNA protein complexes against TnC (Tenascin-C) into EGCs of the brain, we achieved an efficient knockdown of TnC. In the electroporation-targeted area, TnC expression is dramatically reduced at both mRNA and protein levels. Overall, this study established a rapid and efficient electroporation-based gene manipulation approach allowing for investigation of gene function in the process of axolotl brain regeneration.
