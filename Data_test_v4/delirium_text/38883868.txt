38883868|t|Lycopene: A Potent Antioxidant with Multiple Health Benefits.
38883868|a|Lycopene is a naturally occurring carotenoid predominantly found in tomatoes and tomato-based products. Like other phytochemicals, it exhibits health beneficial biological activities that can be exploited when it is used as a dietary supplement. In vitro and in vivo, lycopene has been demonstrated to mitigate oxidative stress-induced metabolic dysfunctions and diseases including inflammation, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. Lycopene has been shown to alleviate metabolic diseases that affect the bone, eye, kidney, liver, lungs, heart, and nervous system. This review presents the state of the art regarding lycopene's health benefits and its potential applications in health system delivery. Furthermore, lycopene's protective effects against toxins, safety in its use, and possible toxicity are explored.
