36568067|t|Cognition and brain oxygen metabolism improves after bariatric surgery-induced weight loss: A pilot study.
36568067|a|Objective: The primary objectives of this pilot study were to assess cognition and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) consumption in people with severe obesity before (baseline), and again, 2- and 14-weeks after sleeve gastrectomy bariatric surgery. Methods: Six people with severe/class 3 obesity (52 +- 10 years, five females, body mass index (BMI) = 41.9 +- 3.9 kg/m2), and 10 normal weight sex- and age-matched healthy controls (HC) (48 +- 6 years, eight females, 22.8 +- 1.9 kg/m2). Global CMRO2 was measured non-invasively using MRI and cognition using the Integneuro testing battery. Results: Following a sleeve gastrectomy induced weight loss of 6.4 +- 2.5 kg (% total-body-weight-lost = 5.4) over two-weeks, cognition total scores improved by 0.8 +- 0.5 T-scores (p=0.03, 15.8% improvement from baseline). Weight loss over 14-weeks post-surgery was 15.4 +- 3.6 kg (% total-body-weight-lost = 13.0%) and cognition improved by 1.1 +- 0.4 (p=0.003, 20.6% improvement from baseline). At 14-weeks, cognition was 6.4 +- 0.7, comparable to 6.0 +- 0.6 observed in the HC group. Baseline CMRO2 was significantly higher compared to the HC (230.4 +- 32.9 vs. 177.9 +- 33.9 micromol O2/100 g/min, p=0.02). Compared to baseline, CMRO2 was 234.3 +- 16.2 micromol O2/100 g/min at 2-weeks after surgery (p=0.8, 1.7% higher) and 217.3 +- 50.4 at 14-weeks (p=0.5, 5.7% lower) after surgery. 14-weeks following surgery, CMRO2 was similar to HC (p=0.17). Conclusion: Sleeve gastrectomy induced weight loss was associated with an increase in cognition and a decrease in CMRO2 observed 14-weeks after surgery. The association between weight loss, improved cognition and CMRO2 decrease should be evaluated in larger future studies.
