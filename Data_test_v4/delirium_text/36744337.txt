36744337|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) frequently co-occurs with other brain pathologies. Recent studies suggest there may be a mechanistic link between AD and small vessel cerebrovascular disease (CVD), as opposed to simply the overlap of two disorders. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the cross-sectional relationship between white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes (markers of CVD) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD. METHODS: WMH volumes were assessed globally and regionally (i.e., frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, and limbic). CSF AD biomarkers (i.e., Abeta 40, Abeta 42, Abeta 42/Abeta 40 ratio, phosphorylated tau-181 [p-tau181], and total tau [t-tau]) were measured among 152 non-demented individuals (134 cognitively unimpaired and 18 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). RESULTS: Linear regression models showed that among all subjects, higher temporal WHM volumes were associated with AD biomarkers (higher levels of p-tau181, t-tau, and Abeta 40), particularly among APOE e 4 carriers (independent of Abeta 42 levels). Higher vascular risk scores were associated with greater parietal and frontal WMH volumes (independent of CSF AD biomarker levels). Among subjects with MCI only, parietal WMH volumes were associated with a lower level of Abeta 42/Abeta 40. In addition, there was an association between higher global WMH volumes and higher CSF t-tau levels among younger participants versus older ones (~<65 versus 65+ years), independent of Abeta 42/Abeta 40 and p-tau181. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that although WMH are primarily related to systemic vascular risk and neurodegeneration (i.e., t-tau), AD-specific pathways may contribute to the formation of WMH in a regionally-specific manner, with neurofibrillary tangles (i.e., p-tau) playing a role in temporal WMHs and amyloid (i.e., Abeta 42/Abeta 40) in parietal WMHs.
