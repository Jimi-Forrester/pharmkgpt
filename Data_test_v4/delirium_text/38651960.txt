38651960|a|The growing number of people suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a major public health problem. The diagnosis of AD is multidisciplinary and involves the use of amyloid and tau biomarkers measured in cerebrospinal fluid. Recent advances in analytical techniques now allow us to measure these biomarkers in blood. Blood biomarkers offer particularly promising potential for early, minimally invasive detection of AD, as well as for differential diagnosis of dementia and patient follow-up. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of current and candidate blood biomarkers for AD, their informative value, and their potential to be integrated into clinical practice in the near future.
