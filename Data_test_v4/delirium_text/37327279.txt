37327279|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a very common sick syndrome in patients receiving mechanical ventilatory support in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Music therapy is a promising non-pharmacological intervention. However, its effect on the duration, incidence and severity of delirium is unknown. So we will perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of music therapy on delirium in patients receiving mechanical ventilatory support in the ICU. METHODS: This systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO. We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Protocol to accomplish the systematic review protocol. Searches of PubMed, EMbase, the Cochrane library, CBM, CNKI and Wanfang databases will be conducted through computer to collect randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of music therapy on delirium in patients receiving mechanical ventilatory support in the ICU. The search time will be all from database establishment to April 2023. Two evaluators will independently screen the literature, extract information and evaluate the risk of bias of included studies, then data analysis will be performed using Stata 14.0 software. RESULTS: The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis will be publicly available and published in a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSION: This study will provide evidence-based medical evidence for music therapy to control delirium in patients receiving mechanical ventilatory support in the ICU.
