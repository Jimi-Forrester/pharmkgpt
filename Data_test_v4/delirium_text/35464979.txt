35464979|a|Growing evidence has demonstrated that hypertension was associated with dysbiosis of intestinal flora. Since intestinal microbes could critically regulate neurofunction via the intestinal-brain axis, the study aimed to reveal the role and prediction value of intestinal flora alteration in hypertension-associated cognitive impairment. A cohort of 97 participants included 63 hypertension patients and 34 healthy controls. The structure of intestinal flora was analyzed by V3-V4 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale, and 31 patients were considered to have cognitive impairment (MoCA < 26). Patients with cognitive impairment had considerable alterations in intestinal flora structure, composition, and function compared with normal-cognitive patients. In particular, the abundance of LPS-containing taxa (Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Enterobacterales, Enterobacteriaceae, and Escherichia-Shigella) and SCFA-producing taxon (Prevotella) significantly changed in cognition-impaired patients. Tax4Fun predication results showed downregulation of glycan biosynthesis and metabolism in hypertension patients with cognitive impairment. Additionally, the pathway was demonstrated to be significantly correlated with LPS-containing taxa (Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Enterobacterales, Enterobacteriaceae, and Escherichia-Shigella) and SCFA-producing taxon Prevotella. Furthermore, the taxa-based multiple joint prediction model (9x) was demonstrated to have excellent diagnostic potential for cognitive impairment of hypertension patients (AUC = 0.944). The current study revealed the involvement of intestinal microbiota dysbiosis in cognition-impaired hypertension patients and provided an objective predictive index for this cognition disorder.
