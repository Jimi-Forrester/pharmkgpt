28566609|t|Progressive Balint's Syndrome in a Patient Demonstrating Dementia with Lewy Bodies.
28566609|a|We herein report a 65-year-old man demonstrating dementia with Lewy bodies who first presented with Balint's syndrome. Two years later, a mild cognitive impairment was noted. From three years after onset, he developed progressive parkinsonism, visual hallucination, and autonomic dysfunction, in line with the deterioration of the cognitive function. Single photon emission computed tomography with a 99mTc-ethylcysteinate dimer performed two years after onset revealed hypoperfusion in the restricted area of the bilateral superior parietal lobule, which extended to the lateral occipital cortices within two years. It is suggested that the pathological process can extend from the parietal to occipital lobes.
