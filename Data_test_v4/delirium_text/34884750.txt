34884750|t|Prenatal Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane Exposure Impaired Proliferation of Neuronal Progenitor, Leading to Motor, Cognition, Social and Behavioral Functions.
34884750|a|Cyclic siloxane octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) has raised concerns as an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC). D4 is widely used in detergent products, cosmetics, and personal care products. Recently, robust toxicological data for D4 has been reported, but the adverse effects of D4 on brain development are unknown. Here, pregnant mice on gestational day 9.5 were treated daily with D4 to postnatal day 28, and the offspring mice were studied. The prenatal D4-treated mice exhibited cognitive dysfunction, limited memory, and motor learning defect. Moreover, prenatal D4 exposure reduced the proliferation of neuronal progenitors in the offspring mouse brain. Next, the mechanisms through which D4 regulated the cell cycle were investigated. Aberrant gene expression, such as cyclin-dependent kinases CDK6 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, were found in the prenatal D4-treated mice. Furthermore, the estrogen receptors ERa and ERb were increased in the brain of prenatal D4-treated mice. Overall, these findings suggest that D4 exerts estrogen activity that affects the cell cycle progression of neuronal progenitor cells during neurodevelopment, which may be associated with cognitive deficits in offspring.
