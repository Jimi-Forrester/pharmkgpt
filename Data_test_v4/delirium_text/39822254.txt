39822254|t|Piezo Ion Channels and Their Association With Haptic Technology Use: A Narrative Review.
39822254|a|The recent identification of Piezo ion channels demonstrating a mechano-sensitive impact on neurons revealed distinct Piezo-1 and 2 types. While Piezo-1 predominates in neurons linked to non-sensory stimulation, such as pressure in blood vessels, Piezo-2 predominates in neurons linked to sensory stimulation, such as touch. Piezo-1 and 2 have a major bidirectional impact on transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels, and TRPs also impact neurotransmitter release. Particularly existent in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, which are located in nerve endings, Piezo-2 is a key DRG activator. Subsequent Piezo findings have been vital to recent medical haptic technology developments, in tandem with breakthroughs in the emerging neurology subfield of connectomics plus AI developments. Included in this review are a historical Piezo overview, the interrelationship of Piezo channels with TRPs, inclusive of TRPV1/TRPV8, the impact on medical and rehab haptic technology, a focus on haptic technology use in stroke survivor rehab inclusive of pain mitigation, and the development of a haptic technology patch aimed at alleviating pain and/or anxiety. Neurogenic pain resulting from hyperalgesia/allodynia in stroke survivors is a potential target for drugs and haptics aimed at pain reduction; patients experiencing neuropathic or psychosomatic pain are other prime targets. Increased Piezo knowledge may promote more precisely targeted haptic therapeutic developments.
