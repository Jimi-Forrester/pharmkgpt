38934787|a|STUDY OBJECTIVES: Insomnia symptoms are prevalent along the trajectory of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the neurobiological underpinning of their interaction is poorly understood. Here, we assessed structural and functional brain measures within and between the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and central executive network (CEN). METHODS: We selected 320 subjects from the ADNI database and divided by their diagnosis: cognitively normal (CN), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and AD, with and without self-reported insomnia symptoms. We measured the gray matter volume (GMV), structural covariance (SC), degrees centrality (DC), and functional connectivity (FC), testing the effect and interaction of insomnia symptoms and diagnosis on each index. Subsequently, we performed a within-group linear regression across each network and ROI. Finally, we correlated observed abnormalities with changes in cognitive and affective scores. RESULTS: Insomnia symptoms were associated with FC alterations across all groups. The AD group also demonstrated an interaction between insomnia and diagnosis. Within-group analyses revealed that in CN and MCI, insomnia symptoms were characterised by within-network hyperconnectivity, while in AD, within- and between-network hypoconnectivity was ubiquitous. SC and GMV alterations were non-significant in the presence of insomnia symptoms, and DC indices only showed network-level alterations in the CEN of AD individuals. Abnormal FC within and between DMN and CEN hubs was additionally associated with reduced cognitive function across all groups, and increased depressive symptoms in AD. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that patients with clinical AD present with a unique pattern of insomnia-related functional alterations, highlighting the profound interaction between both conditions.
