10948585|a|OBJECTIVE: This document intends to review the main features of Binswanger's disease and its differential diagnosis with other vascular pathologies of the white matter. DEVELOPMENT: Nowadays, the raise of the elderly group of population has led to a remarkable increase in dementia's prevalence, therefore it becomes necessary to study deeply vascular dementias, the second most common kind of dementia behind Alzheimer's disease. The detection of Binswanger's disease has increased due to the progress of neuroimaging techniques, that allow to identify ischemic lesions situated in the cerebral white matter and the existence of multiple lacunar infarcts. This clinical entity represents the most frequent type of subcortical dementia, although controversy still remains about its pathogeny, ethiology, and nosologic limits. CONCLUSIONS: The search for unified criteria is the first step in the microangiopathic subcortical dementia's field to achieve valuable treatment strategies.
