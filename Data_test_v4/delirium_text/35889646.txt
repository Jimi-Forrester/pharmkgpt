35889646|t|Insight into a Fenton-like Reaction Using Nanodiamond Based Relaxometry.
35889646|a|Copper has several biological functions, but also some toxicity, as it can act as a catalyst for oxidative damage to tissues. This is especially relevant in the presence of H2O2, a by-product of oxygen metabolism. In this study, the reactions of copper with H2O2 have been investigated with spectroscopic techniques. These results were complemented by a new quantum sensing technique (relaxometry), which allows nanoscale magnetic resonance measurements at room temperature, and at nanomolar concentrations. For this purpose, we used fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) containing ensembles of specific defects called nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. More specifically, we performed so-called T1 measurements. We use this method to provide real-time measurements of copper during a Fenton-like reaction. Unlike with other chemical fluorescent probes, we can determine both the increase and decrease in copper formed in real time.
