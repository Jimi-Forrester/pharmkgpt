38115996|a|Background: Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is a medical condition characterized by the immune system of the body attacking the peripheral nerves, including those in the spinal nerve roots, peripheral nerves, and cranial nerves. It can cause limb weakness, abnormal sensations, and facial nerve paralysis. Some studies have reported clinical cases associated with the severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and GBS, but how COVID-19 affects GBS is unclear. Methods: We utilized bioinformatics techniques to explore the potential genetic connection between COVID-19 and GBS. Differential expression of genes (DEGs) related to COVID-19 and GBS was collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. By taking the intersection, we obtained shared DEGs for COVID-19 and GBS. Subsequently, we utilized bioinformatics analysis tools to analyze common DEGs, conducting functional enrichment analysis and constructing Protein-protein interaction networks (PPI), Transcription factors (TF) -gene networks, and TF-miRNA networks. Finally, we validated our findings by constructing the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: This study utilizes bioinformatics tools for the first time to investigate the close genetic relationship between COVID-19 and GBS. CAMP, LTF, DEFA1B, SAMD9, GBP1, DDX60, DEFA4, and OAS3 are identified as the most significant interacting genes between COVID-19 and GBS. In addition, the signaling pathway of NOD-like receptors is believed to be essential in the link between COVID-19 and GBS.
