36015135|t|Toxicity Profiles of Kleeb Bua Daeng Formula, a Traditional Thai Medicine, and Its Protective Effects on Memory Impairment in Animals.
36015135|a|Kleeb Bua Daeng (KBD) formula has long been used in Thailand as a traditional herbal medicine for promoting brain health. Our recent reports illustrated that KBD demonstrates multiple modes of action against several targets in the pathological cascade of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The main purpose of the present study was to determine the protective effect and mechanism of KBD in amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced AD rats and its toxicity profiles. Pretreatment with the KBD formula for 14 days significantly improved the short- and long-term memory performance of Abeta-induced AD rats as assessed by the Morris Water Maze (MWM) and object-recognition tests. KBD treatment increased the activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase; reduced the malondialdehyde content, and; decreased the acetylcholinesterase activity in the rat brain. An acute toxicity test revealed that the maximum dose of 2000 mg/kg did not cause any mortality or symptoms of toxicity. An oral, subchronic toxicity assessment of KBD at doses of 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg body weight/day for 90 days showed no adverse effects on behavior, mortality, hematology, or serum biochemistry. Our investigations indicate that KBD is a nontoxic traditional medicine with good potential for the prevention and treatment of AD.
