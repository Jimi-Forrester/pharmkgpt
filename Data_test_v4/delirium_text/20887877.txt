20887877|a|In this chapter the imaging changes associated with non-motor aspects of Parkinson's disease (PD) are reviewed. The relationship between reduced monoaminergic and cholinergic function and cognitive difficulties, depression, fatigue, sleep disorders, and dysautonomia is discussed and the relevance of Alzheimer pathology to PD dementia debated. Finally the discordance between the development of functional changes in PD and Braak staging is highlighted.
