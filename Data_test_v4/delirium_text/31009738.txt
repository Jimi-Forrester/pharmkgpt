31009738|t|A pilot metabolomics study of tuberculosis immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.
31009738|a|BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of paradoxical tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) is challenging and new tools are needed for early diagnosis as well as to understand the biochemical events that underlie the pathology in TB-IRIS. METHODS: Plasma samples were obtained from participants from a randomized HIV/TB treatment strategy study (AIDS Clinical Trials Group [ACTG] A5221) with (n = 26) and without TB-IRIS (n = 22) for an untargeted metabolomics pilot study by liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry. The metabolic profile of these participants was compared at the study entry and as close to the diagnosis of TB-IRIS as possible (TB-IRIS window). Molecular features with p < 0.05 and log2 fold change >=0.58 were submitted for pathway analysis through MetaboAnalyst. We also elucidated potential metabolic signatures for TB-IRIS using a LASSO regression model. RESULTS: At the study entry, we showed that the arachidonic acid and glycerophospholipid metabolism were altered in the TB-IRIS group. Sphingolipid and linoleic acid metabolism were the most affected pathways during the TB-IRIS window. LASSO modeling selected a set of 8 and 7 molecular features with the potential to predict TB-IRIS at study entry and during the TB-IRIS window, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the use of plasma metabolites may distinguish HIV-TB patients with and without TB-IRIS.
