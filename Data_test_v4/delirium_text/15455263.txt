We assessed the relation between five APOE region SNPs and risk of AD in both case-control and family-based analyses. We observed a statistically significant association with the +5361T allele in the overall case-control analysis (P value=0.04) after adjusting for the known effect of the APOE-4 allele. Further analysis revealed this association to be limited to carriers of the APOE-4 allele. Age-stratified analyses in the patients with age at onset of 80 years or greater and age-matched controls showed that the -219T allele (P value=0.009) and the +113C allele (P value=0.03) are associated with increased risk of AD. Despite these findings, haplotype and family-based association analyses were unable to provide evidence that the APOE region SNPs influenced risk of AD independent of the APOE-4 allele. In addition to risk, we tested for association between the SNPs and age at onset of AD, but found no association in the case-control or family based analyses. In conclusion, SNPs +5361, or a SNP in strong linkage disequilibrium, may confer some additional risk for developing AD beyond the risk due to APOE-4; however, the effect independent of APOE-4 is likely to be small.
