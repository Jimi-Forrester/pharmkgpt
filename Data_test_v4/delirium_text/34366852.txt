34366852|a|With an increase in aging populations worldwide, age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) have become a global concern. At present, a cure for neurodegenerative disease is lacking. There is an urgent need for a biomarker that can facilitate the diagnosis, classification, prognosis, and treatment response of AD. The recent emergence of highly sensitive mass-spectrometry platforms and high-throughput technology can be employed to discover and catalog vast datasets of small metabolites, which respond to changed status in the body. Metabolomics analysis provides hope for a better understanding of AD as well as the subsequent identification and analysis of metabolites. Here, we review the state-of-the-art emerging candidate biomarkers for AD.
