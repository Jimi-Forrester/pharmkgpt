31928331|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that mostly strikes the elderly. However, the exact molecular and cellular pathogenesis of AD, especially the dynamic changes of neurons during disease progression, remains poorly understood. Here we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to access the transcriptional changes of hippocampal neurons in APP23 mouse model of AD. We performed snRNA-seq using a modified Smart-seq2 technique on 3,280 neuronal nuclei from the hippocampus of young and aged APP23 and control mice and identified four distinct subpopulations. Comparative transcriptional analysis showed multiple changes in different subtypes of hippocampal neurons of APP23 mice in comparison to control mice, as well as the transcriptional changes in these neurons during disease progression. Our findings revealed multiple neuronal subtype-specific transcriptional changes that may lead to targets for future studies of AD.
