36353605|t|Role of neuroinflammation mediated potential alterations in adult neurogenesis as a factor for neuropsychiatric symptoms in Post-Acute COVID-19 syndrome-A narrative review.
36353605|a|Persistence of symptoms beyond the initial 3 to 4 weeks after infection is defined as post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). A wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms like anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep disorders and cognitive disturbances have been observed in PACS. The review was conducted based on PRISMA-S guidelines for literature search strategy for systematic reviews. A cytokine storm in COVID-19 may cause a breach in the blood brain barrier leading to cytokine and SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain. This triggers an immune response in the brain by activating microglia, astrocytes, and other immune cells leading to neuroinflammation. Various inflammatory biomarkers like inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, acute phase proteins and adhesion molecules have been implicated in psychiatric disorders and play a major role in the precipitation of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Impaired adult neurogenesis has been linked with a variety of disorders like depression, anxiety, cognitive decline, and dementia. Persistence of neuroinflammation was observed in COVID-19 survivors 3 months after recovery. Chronic neuroinflammation alters adult neurogenesis with pro-inflammatory cytokines supressing anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines favouring adult neurogenesis. Based on the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms/disorders in PACS, there is more possibility for a potential impairment in adult neurogenesis in COVID-19 survivors. This narrative review aims to discuss the various neuroinflammatory processes during PACS and its effect on adult neurogenesis.
