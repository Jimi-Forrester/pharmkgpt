35845597|a|Objective: We aimed to analyze the correlation between the level of skin advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and the diabetic retinopathy (DR) staging in different traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndromes. Methods: 416 T2DM patients were divided into normal group, nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) group (mild, moderate, and severe), and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) group according to the DR grade. Patients' height, weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG), hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), blood lipid, renal function, and skin AGEs were measured. According to TCM syndrome differentiation criteria, 230 patients with T2DM and DR were divided into I. qi and yin deficiency, collateral stasis group; II. liver and kidney deficiency, eye collaterals loss group; and III. yin and yang deficiency, blood stasis, and phlegm coagulation group. Results: The skin AGEs levels of different DR staging groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05), and the skin AGEs levels in the mild and moderate NPDR groups were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of the normal group. It was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the severe NPDR group than in the normal group, mild and moderate NPDR groups. The skin AGEs levels of the PDR group were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the normal group, mild and moderate NPDR groups. It was positively correlated with DR stage, HbA1c, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and urine metal analysis (UMA) (r = 0.467, 0.411, 0.413, 0.503, 0.424, P < 0.05). The skin AGEs levels of the qi and yin deficiency and collaterals stasis syndrome group were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in the liver and kidney deficiency and eye collaterals loss groups. It was also significantly higher (P < 0.05) in yin and yang deficiency, blood stasis, and phlegm coagulation syndrome groups than in qi and yin deficiency and collaterals stasis syndrome groups. Conclusion: There is a positive correlation between skin AGEs and DR staging in T2DM patients. Skin AGEs level is predictive for the risk of DR complications in T2DM patients and is vital in assessing DR degree per TCM syndrome type.
