32499589|a|Exogenous insulin, used as a therapeutic agent for diabetes, forms insoluble deposits containing amyloid fibrillar structures near the administration site. We have analyzed the in vitro anti-amyloid activity of four green tea constituents: (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), (-)-epicatechin (EC), gallic acid (GA), caffeine (CF), and their equimolar mixtures. Regarding individually tested compounds, only EGCG inhibited the fibrillization process. The individual EC, GA, and CF molecules were ineffective. The presence of EGCG in equimolar combinations with GA, EC, or CF was required for the inhibitory activity of most mixtures. Molecular docking revealed that EGCG interacts with an essential amyloidogenic region of insulin chain B. Individually inactive GA had a potentiating effect on the activity of EGCG. In contrast, EC and CF had a negative impact on the activity of the mixtures. We have observed diverse morphology and the amount of insulin amyloid aggregates formed in the presence of studied compounds. The distinct types of amyloid aggregates created in vitro in the presence of EGCG and other green tea constituents were characterized. Results indicate that the biological activity of individual molecules is not directly applicable to the pooled samples effects prediction.
