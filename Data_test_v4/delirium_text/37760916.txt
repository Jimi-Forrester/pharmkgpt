37760916|t|Exploring Astrocyte-Mediated Mechanisms in Sleep Disorders and Comorbidity.
37760916|a|Astrocytes, the most abundant cells in the brain, are integral to sleep regulation. In the context of a healthy neural environment, these glial cells exert a profound influence on the sleep-wake cycle, modulating both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep phases. However, emerging literature underscores perturbations in astrocytic function as potential etiological factors in sleep disorders, either as protopathy or comorbidity. As known, sleep disorders significantly increase the risk of neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, metabolic, or psychiatric diseases. Meanwhile, sleep disorders are commonly screened as comorbidities in various neurodegenerative diseases, epilepsy, and others. Building on existing research that examines the role of astrocytes in sleep disorders, this review aims to elucidate the potential mechanisms by which astrocytes influence sleep regulation and contribute to sleep disorders in the varied settings of brain diseases. The review emphasizes the significance of astrocyte-mediated mechanisms in sleep disorders and their associated comorbidities, highlighting the need for further research.
