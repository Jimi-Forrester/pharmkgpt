35103400|a|INTRODUCTION: Mild behavioral impairment (MBI) is characterized by later-life emergence of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Investigating its relationship with progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD) would provide insight on its importance as a predictor of AD. METHODS: Cognitively normal participants (N = 11,372) from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center were stratified by MBI status, using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire. We investigated whether MBI and its domains were predictors of progression to clinically-diagnosed AD. MBI as a predictor of progression to neuropathology-confirmed AD was also investigated in those with neuropathological data. RESULTS: Six percent (N = 671) of participants progressed to AD. MBI (N = 2765) was a significant predictor of progression to clinically-diagnosed (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.75) and neuropathology-confirmed AD (HR = 1.59). MBI domains were also associated with clinically-diagnosed AD, with psychosis having the greatest effect (HR = 6.49). DISCUSSION: These findings support the biological underpinnings of MBI, emphasizing the importance of later life behavioral changes in dementia detection and prognostication.
