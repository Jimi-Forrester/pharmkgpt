29707738|t|Central nervous system localisation of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, description of two very distinct cases and a review of the literature.
29707738|a|Central nervous system (CNS) localisation of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) can induce various neurological symptoms. Unfamiliarity with this manifestation causes diagnostic delay. We present two cases of leptomeningeal CLL. These cases and our literature review emphasise that CNS localisation of CLL should be considered in patients with any neurological symptom, irrespectively of the stage and systemic activity of CLL.
