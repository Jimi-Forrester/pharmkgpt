30397816|a|Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), characterized by a very early and subtle cognitive decline prior to the appearance of objective cognitive impairment, is considered to be the preclinical manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Given the lack of significant abnormalities in standardized neuropsychological assessments for individuals with SCD, biochemical and neuroimaging biomarkers may be important indicators of the preclinical stage of AD. The application of various biomarkers derived from the cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging thus has the potential to make AD-related pathology detectable in vivo. In this review, we discuss the conceptual evolution of SCD as an entity and further elucidate characteristic cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers of SCD.
