We hypothesized that the electroencephalographic (EEG) response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) could serve as a toy-model of an individual's capacity to resist psychological stress, in this case linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed data from 74 participants who underwent mental health monitoring and concurrent electroencephalography with transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) and left inferior parietal lobule (L-IPL). Within the following 19 months, mental health was reassessed at three timepoints during lock-down confinement and different phases of de-escalation in Spain. Compared with participants who remained stable, those who experienced increased mental distress showed, months earlier, significantly larger late EEG responses locally after L-DLPFC stimulation (but not globally nor after L-IPL stimulation). This response, together with years of formal education, was significantly predictive of mental health status during the pandemic. These findings reveal that the effect of TMS perturbation offers a predictive toy model of psychosocial stress response, as exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic.
