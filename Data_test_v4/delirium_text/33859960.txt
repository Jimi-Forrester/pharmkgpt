33859960|a|Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury is a complication that occurs during liver surgery, whereby hepatic tissue is injured by oxygen deficiency during ischemia, then further damaged by a cascade of inflammatory and oxidative insults when blood is resupplied during reperfusion. Antrodia camphorata is an indigenous fungus in Taiwan and an esteemed Chinese herbal medicine with various bioactivities. This study examined the effect of ergostatrien-3beta-ol (EK100), an active compound found in both the fruiting body and mycelia of A. camphorata, on IR injury pathologies in rats and cell models of oxidative and inflammatory stress. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to receive a vehicle or 5 mg/kg EK100 prior to hepatic IR injury induced by 1 h ischemia followed by 24 h reperfusion, or a sham operation. RAW 264.7 murine macrophages and HepG2 hepatocytes were pretreated with EK100, then inflammation was induced with lipopolysaccharides in the former and oxidative stress was induced with hydrogen peroxide in the latter. EK100 decreased IR-induced elevation in serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase and lowered levels of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1beta. In addition, EK100 significantly reduced hepatic mRNA levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2, as well as nitrite production and iNOS gene expression in both hepatocyte and macrophage cell lines. We demonstrated that EK100 exhibits potent protec-tion against hepatic IR injury, which may be used to design strategies to ameliorate liver damage during liver surgery.
