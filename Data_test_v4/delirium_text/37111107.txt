37111107|t|Quercetin as a Dietary Supplementary Flavonoid Alleviates the Oxidative Stress Induced by Lead Toxicity in Male Wistar Rats.
37111107|a|Quercetin is a naturally existing plant pigment belonging to the flavonoid group; it is contained in a wide range of vegetables and fruits. The accumulated evidence points to the potential uses of quercetin in protection of some disease conditions. Lead is one of the highly toxicant heavy metals that are widely spread in the environment and implicated in a wide spectrum of industries. No previous study has been reported to evaluate the effect of quercetin on lead toxicity. Therefore, the present study was conducted to elucidate some aspects of quercetin bioactivities in regard to its ability to combat the oxidative stress induced by lead toxicity. For this purpose, a total of sixty male Wistar rats were randomly and equally divided into three groups of 20 animals each; untreated control animals (group 1), lead-exposed animals (group 2; exposed to lead daily by oral gavage at the dose of 80 mg/Kg b.w.), and group 3 of animals, which were exposed to lead and daily received quercetin (10 h gap time between lead exposure and the receiving of quercetin) by oral gavage at the dose of 350 mg/Kg b.w. The experiment period was 8 weeks. All the assayed hematological and biochemical parameters of animals exposed to lead were significantly altered compared with the untreated control levels. Animals exposed to lead (group 2) exhibited significant decrements of the erythrocytic and total leucocytic counts, hemoglobin concentration, packed cell volume percent, total proteins, albumin and globulin. These animals also disclosed significantly decreased levels of antioxidant markers including total thiols, catalase and glutathione. On the other hand, these animals demonstrated significant increments in the levels of bilirubin, urea, creatinine, BUN, serum enzymes, H2O2 and MDA. Animals exposed to lead and given quercetin (group 3) exhibited improvement of these parameters, which were brought back at varying degrees toward the untreated control levels. Basing on the improvements of the assayed hematological and biochemical parameters, it was concluded that quercetin as a dietary supplement can act efficiently as an antioxidant to counteract the oxidative stress induced by lead toxicity and to maintain the oxidant antioxidant balance.
