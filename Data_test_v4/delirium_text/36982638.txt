36982638|t|The Regulatory Roles of Cerebellar Glycosphingolipid Microdomains/Lipid Rafts.
36982638|a|Lipid rafts are dynamic assemblies of glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelin, cholesterol, and specific proteins which are stabilized into platforms involved in the regulation of vital cellular processes. Cerebellar lipid rafts are cell surface ganglioside microdomains for the attachment of GPI-anchored neural adhesion molecules and downstream signaling molecules such as Src-family kinases and heterotrimeric G proteins. In this review, we summarize our recent findings on signaling in ganglioside GD3 rafts of cerebellar granule cells and several findings by other groups on the roles of lipid rafts in the cerebellum. TAG-1, of the contactin group of immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecules, is a phosphacan receptor. Phosphacan regulates the radial migration signaling of cerebellar granule cells, via Src-family kinase Lyn, by binding to TAG-1 on ganglioside GD3 rafts. Chemokine SDF-1alpha, which induces the tangential migration of cerebellar granule cells, causes heterotrimeric G protein Goalpha translocation to GD3 rafts. Furthermore, the functional roles of cerebellar raft-binding proteins including cell adhesion molecule L1, heterotrimeric G protein Gsalpha, and L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels are discussed.
