37788369|a|BACKGROUND: Supportive care medication use differences may contribute to racial disparities observed in health-related quality of life in patients with pancreatic cancer. METHODS: In this observation study utilizing the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database, we sought to examine supportive care medication use disparities in patients with pancreatic cancer from 2005-2017 by race and ethnicity. RESULTS: Among 74,309 patients included in the final analysis, racial and ethnic disparities in the use of supportive care medications were identified. After adjustment for confounding factors and compared with non-Hispanic Whites, minorities had significantly less use of opioids (Black: adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 0.84, 95% CI: 0.79-0.88; Asian: aOR 0.84, 95% CI: 0.79-0.90), and skeletomuscular relaxants (Black: aOR 0.90, 95%CI: 0.82-0.99; Hispanic: aOR 0.82, 95%CI: 0.74-0.91; Asian: aOR 0.59, 95%CI: 0.51-0.68), and increased use of non-opioid analgesics (Hispanic: aOR 1.16, 95%CI: 1.01-1.14; Asian: aOR 1.37, 95%CI: 1.26-1.49). Racial and ethnic minorities had less use of antidepressants (Black: aOR 0.56, 95%CI:0.53-0.59; Hispanic: aOR 0.77, 95%CI: 0.73-0.82; Asian: aOR 0.47, 95%CI: 0.44-0.51), anxiolytics (Black: aOR 0.78, 95%CI: 0.74-0.82; Hispanic: aOR 0.66, 95%CI: 0.62-0.71; Asian: aOR 0.52, 95%CI: 0.48-0.57), and antipsychotics (Hispanic: aOR 0.90, 95%CI: 0.82-0.99; Asian: aOR 0.84, 95%CI: 0.74-0.95). CONCLUSION: Racial and ethnic disparities in the use of supportive care medications among patients with pancreatic cancer were observed, with the differences unexplained by sociodemographic factors. IMPACT: Future studies should identify strategies to promote equitable use of supportive care medications among racial minorities and explore factors that may influence their use in these populations.
