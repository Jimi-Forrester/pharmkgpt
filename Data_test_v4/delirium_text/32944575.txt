32944575|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of foot massage on pain severity during in unconscious trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial (RCT), 80 unconscious trauma patients admitted in the ICU of a hospital in an urban area of Iran were included using the convenience sampling method. They were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups (n=40 in each group). In both groups, the intensity of pain was measured immediately, 10 minutes after the first change position and without any intervention before the change of position using the Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CCPOT). In the intervention group, before the second position change, classic foot massage was performed for 20 minutes, but the control group received routine care. Pain was re-evaluated after the change position at desired times. The pain intensity was compared between the two study groups. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics were comparable between the two study groups and no difference was found. There was no statistically significant difference between the mean scores of pain after the change of position (immediately and ten minutes later) before the intervention in the groups (p=0.915 and 0.660, respectively). However, after the intervention, the pain intensity was significantly lower in the intervention groups compared to the control group (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Foot massage decreases the pain intensity related to the change of position in unconscious trauma patients admitted in the ICU. Due to its simplicity and low cost, this method can be used along with analgesic drugs to reduce pain in patients.
