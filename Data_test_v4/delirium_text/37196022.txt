37196022|a|Continuing education for dementia has been shown to be beneficial by improving informal caregiver knowledge, dementia care, management, and caregiver physical and mental health. Technology-based dementia education has been noted to have equivalent effects as in-person education, but with the added benefit of asynchronous and/or remote delivery, which increases accessibility. Using Cochrane review methodology, this study systematically reviewed the literature on technology-based dementia education and its impacts on caregivers. Technology-based delivery included dementia education delivered via the Internet, telephone, telehealth, videophone, computer, or digital video device (DVD). In the review, twenty-eight studies were identified with fourteen included in a meta-analysis, and these data revealed a significant small effect of technologically based dementia education on reducing caregiver depression, and a medium effect on reducing caregiver distress in response to caregivers' observations of behavioral problems displayed by persons with dementia. No evidence was found for a significant effect of the educational intervention on caregiver burden or self-efficacy, which are known to be gendered aspects of caregiving. None of the studies included in the meta-analysis reported separate outcomes for male and female care providers, which has implications for gendered caregiving norms and aspects of care.
