36119016|t|Chemical constituents and their pharmacological activities of plants from Cichorium genus.
36119016|a|Plants of genus Cichorium are famous due to their therapeutic and medicinal properties. They are used as traditional medicine and edible food. To date, several scholars concentrated on compounds belonging to coumarins, flavonoids, sesquiterpenoids, triterpenoids, steroids, organic acids and other chemical constituents. Pharmacological effects such as photo-protective, hepatoprotective, anti-diabetic and lipid lowering, antioxidant, anti-inflammation, antifungal, antimalarial, increased bone mineral density,  as well as vasorelaxant and antitumour activity were wildly reported. In this study, botanical resources, ethnopharmacological application, chemical constituents and bioactivities, as well as safety and toxicity of clinical applications of genus Cichorium were reviewed, which may provide a reliable basis for further development and utilization of Cichorium genetic resources.
