17965033|t|Delirium post-stroke.
17965033|a|Delirium is not only one of the most common complications that older patients develop after admission to hospital but it is also one of the most serious. Although stroke is a known predisposing factor for delirium, few studies have investigated this association and results from existing studies give conflicting results with prevalence estimates ranging from 13 to 48%. The aetiology of delirium post-stroke is poorly understood. There is no consensus on the best screening tool to use to detect delirium in the post-stroke setting. Specific stroke types may be more likely to precipitate delirium than others, for example, delirium is more frequent after intracerebral haemorrhage and total anterior circulation infarction (TACI). In addition, case reports have suggested that delirium may be associated with specific lesions, for example, in the thalamus and caudate nucleus. There is a lack of intervention data in both the prevention and treatment of delirium post-stroke. However, it is known that the development of delirium post-stroke has grave prognostic implications. It is associated with longer stay in hospital, increased mortality and increased risk of institutionalisation post discharge. In this article, we review the literature to date on delirium in the acute stroke setting.
