36985015|t|Design and Modelling of Graphene-Based Flexible 5G Antenna for Next-Generation Wearable Head Imaging Systems.
36985015|a|Arguably, 5G and next-generation technology with its key features (specifically, supporting high data rates and high mobility platforms) make it valuable for coping with the emerging needs of medical healthcare. A 5G-enabled portable device receives the sensitive detection signals from the head imaging system and transmits them over the 5G network for real-time monitoring, analysis, and storage purposes. In terms of material, graphene-based flexible electronics have become very popular for wearable and healthcare devices due to their exceptional mechanical strength, thermal stability, high electrical conductivity, and biocompatibility. A graphene-based flexible antenna for data communication from wearable head imaging devices over a 5G network was designed and modelled. The antenna operated at the 34.5 GHz range and was designed using an 18 microm thin graphene film for the conductive radiative patch and ground with electric conductivity of 3.5 x 105 S/m. The radiative patch was designed in a fractal fashion to provide sufficient antenna flexibility for wearable uses. The patch was designed over a 1.5 mm thick flexible polyamide substrate that made the design suitable for wearable applications. This paper presented the 3D modelling and analysis of the 5G flexible antenna for communication in a digital care-home model. The analyses were carried out based on the antenna's reflection coefficient, gain, radiation pattern, and power balance. The time-domain signal analysis was carried out between the two antennas to mimic real-time communication in wearable devices.
