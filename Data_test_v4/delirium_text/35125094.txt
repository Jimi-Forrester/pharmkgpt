35125094|a|BACKGROUND: Imperial College London launched a new, spiral undergraduate medical curriculum in September 2019. Clinical & Scientific Integrative cases (CSI) is an innovative, flagship module, which uses pioneering methodology to provide early-years learning that [1] is patient-centred, [2] integrates clinical and scientific curriculum content, [3] develops advanced team-work skills and [4] provides engaging, student-driven learning. These aims are designed to produce medical graduates equipped to excel in a modern healthcare environment. METHODS: CSI has adopted a novel educational approach which utilises contemporary digital resources to deliver a collaborative case-based learning (CBL) component, paired with a team-based learning (TBL) component that incorporates both learning and programmatic assessment. This paper serves to explore how first-year students experienced CSI in relation to its key aims, drawing upon quantitative and qualitative data from feedback surveys from CSI's inaugural year. It provides a description and analysis of the module's design, delivery, successes and challenges. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that CSI has been extremely well-received and that the majority of students agree that it met its aims. Survey outputs indicate success in integrating multiple elements of the curriculum, developing an early holistic approach towards patients, expediting the development of important team-working skills, and delivering authentic and challenging clinical problems, which our students found highly relevant. Challenges have included supporting students to adapt to a student-driven, deep learning approach. CONCLUSIONS: First-year students appear to have adopted a patient-centred outlook, the ability to integrate knowledge from across the curriculum, an appreciation for other team members and the self-efficacy to collaboratively tackle challenging, authentic clinical problems. Ultimately, CSI's innovative design is attractive and pertinent to the needs of modern medical students and ultimately, future doctors.
