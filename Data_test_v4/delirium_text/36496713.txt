36496713|t|Phenolic Profiles and Bioactivities of Ten Original Lineage Beans in Thailand.
36496713|a|Legumes and pulses are important food components with various phytochemicals and health benefits. However, the health-related bioactivities of some underutilized species remain uninvestigated. To breed a new bean lineage with particular health-related properties, this study investigated phenolics (specifically, isoflavones) and the in vitro inhibitory activities of the enzyme relevant to some non-communicable diseases in underutilized cultivars of Phaseolus lunatus (lima beans), compared to the commonly consumed P. vulgaris (red kidney bean) and beans in the Glycine and Vigna genera. The results indicated that soybeans in the Glycine genus contained the highest isoflavone contents, especially glycitein (1825-2633 mg/100 g bean) and daidzein (1153-6471 mg/100 g bean), leading to potentially higher enzyme inhibitory activities (25-26% inhibition against alpha-amylase, 54-60% inhibition against alpha-glucosidase, 42-46% inhibition against dipeptidyl peptidase IV, 12-19% inhibition against acetylcholinesterase and 20-23% inhibition against butyrylcholinesterase) than those from other genera. Interestingly, lima beans with low isoflavone content (up to 2 mg/100 g bean) still possessed high inhibitory activities against lipase (12-21% inhibition) and beta-secretase (50-58% inhibition), suggesting that bioactive compounds other than the isoflavones might be responsible for these activities. Isoflavone contents and enzyme inhibitory activities in Vigna beans were diverse, depending on the particular cultivars. The information gained from this study can be used for further investigation of bioactive components and in-depth health properties, as well as for future breeding of a new lineage of bean with specific health potentials.
