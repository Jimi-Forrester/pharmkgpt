34938154|t|Segmental Abnormalities of White Matter Microstructure in End-Stage Renal Disease Patients: An Automated Fiber Quantification Tractography Study.
34938154|a|Background and Purpose: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) results in extensive white matter abnormalities, but the specific damage segment cannot be identified. This study aimed to determine the segmental abnormalities of white matter microstructure in ESRD and its relationship with cognitive and renal function indicators. Methods: Eighteen ESRD patients and 19 healthy controls (HCs) were prospectively recruited. All participants underwent DTI and clinical assessments. Automatic fiber quantification (AFQ) was applied to generate bundle profiles along 16 main white matter tracts. We compared the DTI parameters between groups. Besides, we used partial correlation and multiple linear regression analyses to explore the associations between white matter integrity and cognitive performance as well as renal function indicators. Results: In the global tract level, compared to HCs, ESRD patients had greater MD, AD, and RD values and lower FA value in several fibers (P < 0.05, FDR correction). In the point-wise level, extensive damage existed in specific locations of different fiber tracts, particularly in the left hemisphere (P < 0.05, FDR correction). Among these tracts, the mean AD values of the left cingulum cingulate correlated negatively with MoCA score. Urea and UA level were independent predictors of the AD value of superior component of the left corticospinal. Besides, urea level was the independent predictors of mean MD value of left anterior thalamic radiation (ATR). Conclusion: White matter fiber tract damage in ESRD patients may be characterized by abnormalities in its specific location, especially in the left hemisphere. Aberrational specific located fibers were related to cognitive impairment and renal dysfunction.
