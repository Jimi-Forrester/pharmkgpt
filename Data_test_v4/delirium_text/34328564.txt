34328564|t|Olfaction in patients with Parkinson's disease: a new threshold test analysis through turning points trajectories.
34328564|a|Olfactory deficit is a widely documented non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). Abnormal turning points trajectories through olfactory threshold testing have been recently reported in patients with olfactory dysfunction, who seem to adapt faster to olfactory stimuli, but data on PD patients are lacking. The aim of this study is to perform olfactory threshold test and explore the turning points trajectories in PD patients in comparison to normal controls. We recruited 59 PD patients without dementia, and no conditions that could influence evaluation of olfaction and cognition. Sixty healthy subjects served as controls. Patients and controls underwent a comprehensive olfactory evaluation with the Sniffin' Sticks extended test assessing threshold, discrimination and identification and a full neuropsychological evaluation. Besides, threshold test data were analyzed examining all the turning points trajectories. PD patients showed a different olfactory threshold test pattern, i.e., faster olfactory adaptation, than controls with no effect of age. Normosmic PD patients showed different olfactory threshold test pattern, i.e., better threshold score, than normosmic controls. Visuospatial dysfunction was the only factor that significantly influenced this pattern. Olfactory threshold trajectories suggested a possible adaptation phenomenon in PD patients. Our data offered some new insights on normosmic PD patients, which appear to be a subset with a specific psychophysical profile. The analysis of the turning points trajectories, through an olfactory threshold test, could offer additional information on olfactory function in PD patients. Future larger studies should confirm these preliminary findings.
