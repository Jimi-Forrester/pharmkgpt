34357330|t|Assessment of Antioxidant and Antimutagenic Properties of Red and White Wine Extracts In Vitro.
34357330|a|Wine is an alcoholic beverage of complex composition obtained through the fermentation of grape must. The consumption of wine has already been associated with a multitude of beneficial effects due to its high polyphenolic content. In this study, four Greek emblematic wines from two red (i.e., Xinomavro and Agiorgitiko) and two white (i.e., Assyrtiko and Malagouzia) varieties were analyzed for the estimation of their antioxidant profiles. To address this question, we assessed their ability to scavenge both synthetic and endogenous free radicals, such as DPPH , ABTS+ , OH , O2-, their potential reducing power, and their antimutagenic and antigenotoxic properties. All varieties exhibited potent antioxidant activity, as indicated by the results of methods above, with the red wines appearing more effective than the white ones regarding antioxidant capacity. Our small-scale study is the first to reveal that these wine varieties may have the ability to scavenge the most reactive endogenous radicals. In the future, this finding must be accompanied by larger studies to fill a knowledge gap in the scientific literature concerning a holistic approach of the in vitro antioxidant action of plant polyphenolic compounds. Conclusively, we believe that wines possess high bioactivity that allow them to settle in the industry of food additives and medicinal products.
