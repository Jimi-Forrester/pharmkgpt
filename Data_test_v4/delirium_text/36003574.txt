36003574|a|Objective: This study investigates the influence of timing of surgery among infants with congenital heart disease and active respiratory tract infections in a contemporary Western Canadian cohort. Methods: This was a retrospective matched cohort study of infants aged 1 week to 6 months undergoing surgical repair of congenital heart disease between 2014 and 2017. Case patients had active respiratory tract infections preoperatively and were matched to control patients based on primary heart lesion. The primary outcome was time to extubation. Results: We identified 20 cases (median age, 3.4 months [range, 2.4-4.3 months]) that were matched to 40 controls (1:2 ratio). In case patients, surgery occurred at a median of 1 day after the positive viral testing. There were no statistically significant differences between cases and controls in time to extubation (59 vs 34 hours [P = .12]), postoperative vasoactive scores at 24 hours (0 vs 0 [P = .53]), 48 hours (0 vs 0 [P = .23]), maximum vasoactive score in postoperative period (5 vs 5.5 [P = .54]), or time to hospital discharge (13 vs 12 days [P = .39]). Case patients had increased duration of total respiratory support (including noninvasive ventilation, 3.5 vs 2 days [P = .02]) and postoperative intensive care unit length of stay (5.5 vs 3 days [P = .01]). Conclusions: Cardiac surgery on infants with congenital heart disease during an acute viral respiratory tract infection may yield a clinically relevant prolongation in time to extubation.
