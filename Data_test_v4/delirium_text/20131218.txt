20131218|a|The prevalence of deliria is increasing exponentially with cumulative age. At the University Hospital of Basel 16 % of patients in the 70-79 year age-group, 27 % in the 80-89 year age-group and 39 % of the over 90 year old are rated as confused and disoriented. Delirious patients suffer from functional decline and show a significant higher mortality and institutionalization rate after hospital discharge. Nurses have an important role in the multi-component delirium-management. In addition to the assessment of medication, laboratory parameters, oxygenation or urinary excretion, patient-oriented evaluations, pain and stress management, assessment of patient perception and communication are of particular importance. To meet these goals, nurses need knowledge, education and proof of clinical evidence.
