28761331|a|Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) can promote intracellular reactive oxygen species production, and the levels of AGEs are highly correlated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes complications. Acetohydroxamic acid (acetH) is a bacterial urease inhibitor drug used to treat kidney stones and infections in the urinary tract, and hydroxyurea (HU) is a drug used for antineoplasm and sickle cell diseases. Both acetH and HU are hydroxamic acid derivatives. It was found that acetH and HU at 2.5 or 5 mM showed anti-AGE formation by lowering the AGEs' fluorescent intensities and Nepsilon-(carboxymethyl)lysine formation in bovine serum albumin/galactose models, and both showed better and significant differences (P<0.05) compared to the positive control of aminoguanidine. Regarding radical scavenging activities, the half-inhibition concentrations (IC50) of acetH against alpha,alpha-diphenyl-beta-picrylhydrazyl radical and hydroxyl radical were 34.86 and 104.42 muM, respectively. The IC50 of acetH against semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase was 10.56 muM, and acetH showed noncompetitive inhibition respective to the substrates (benzylamine). The antiglycation, antioxidant, and semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase inhibitory activities of acetH prove that it has the potential for treating cardiovascular disease and diabetes complications and it needs further investigation in animal models.
