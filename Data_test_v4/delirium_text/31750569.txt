31750569|a|BACKGROUND: The progressive disease trajectory makes people with dementia increasingly vulnerable and gradually more dependent on others which can lead to admission to a nursing home. Special interest in dignity in people with dementia has led to a growing body of knowledge towards promoting or hindering their dignity. AIM: The aim of this narrative review was to synthesise dignifying and undignifying aspects of formal and informal care for people with dementia within nursing homes. METHOD: The electronic databases CINAHL, SCOPUS, PSycInfo and PubMed were systematically searched with the terms 'dementia' and 'dignity', complemented with the use of snowballing and reference check. A total of 789 unique items were found. The search and selection process was structured by the PRISMA framework, and both authors formulated the criteria of eligibility. A methodological check was performed using the critical appraisal tool of Hawker. This process led to inclusion of 29 articles which were reviewed with the help of the guidelines for narrative synthesis by Popay et al. FINDINGS: The emerged dignifying and undignifying aspects of formal and informal care are characterised by either a successful or unsuccessful process of adjustment towards changing abilities, preferences and care needs of people with dementia. Three themes appeared as undignifying aspects of care: 'Stigmatisation and objectivation', 'Scarcity and hastiness' and 'Impending estrangement and misunderstanding'. Four themes were identified as dignifying aspect of care: 'Personalisation', 'Respect, attentiveness and encouragement', 'Attention for physical care and bodily gestures', and 'Foster belonging'. Literature synthesis showed mostly relational aspects of care concerning dignity in people with dementia. Formal and informal caregivers are important in maintaining and promoting their dignity.
