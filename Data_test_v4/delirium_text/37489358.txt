37489358|a|SARS-CoV-2, a single-stranded RNA coronavirus, causes an illness known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Long-term complications are an increasing issue in patients who have been infected with COVID-19 and may be a result of viral-associated systemic and central nervous system inflammation or may arise from a virus-induced hypercoagulable state. COVID-19 may incite changes in brain function with a wide range of lingering symptoms. Patients often experience fatigue and may note brain fog, sensorimotor symptoms, and sleep disturbances. Prolonged neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms are prevalent and can interfere substantially in everyday life, leading to a massive public health concern. The mechanistic pathways by which SARS-CoV-2 infection causes neurological sequelae are an important subject of ongoing research. Inflammation- induced blood-brain barrier permeability or viral neuro-invasion and direct nerve damage may be involved. Though the mechanisms are uncertain, the resulting symptoms have been documented from numerous patient reports and studies. This review examines the constellation and spectrum of nervous system symptoms seen in long COVID and incorporates information on the prevalence of these symptoms, contributing factors, and typical course. Although treatment options are generally lacking, potential therapeutic approaches for alleviating symptoms and improving quality of life are explored.
