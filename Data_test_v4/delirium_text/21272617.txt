21272617|a|The receptor for advanced glycation end (RAGE) products is a multi-ligand receptor that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface receptors, whose ligands are known to be upregulated in neuropathological conditions. RAGE upregulation has been described in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease and Huntington's disease (HD). To analyze in detail the implication of RAGE in HD, we studied the immunohistochemical distribution of RAGE in the striatum of the R6/2 mouse model of HD, with particular attention to the neuronal subpopulations and their relative vulnerability to HD neurodegeneration. We show that RAGE immunoreactivity is evenly distributed to the cytoplasm of neurons in the wild type mouse, while it is finely granular in the cytoplasm of striatal neurons of R6/2 mouse. RAGE is distributed in 98% of spiny projection neurons, both in the normal mouse and in the R6/2. RAGE co-localizes with all of the striatal interneuron subsets both in the wild-type and in the R6/2 mouse. However, the intensity of RAGE immunoreactivity is significantly higher in the spiny neurons and in the PARV neurons of R6/2 mouse, whereas it is comparable between R6/2 and wild-type in the cholinergic and somatostatinergic interneurons. These data support the concept that RAGE is upregulated in the neurodegenerative process of HD, and suggests that its activation is related to the individual vulnerability of the striatal neuronal subtype.
