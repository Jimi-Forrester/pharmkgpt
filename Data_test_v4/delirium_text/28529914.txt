28529914|a|AIM: To synthesize the available evidence focusing on morbidities in pediatric survivors of critical illness that fall within the defined construct of postintensive care syndrome (PICS) in adults, including physical, neurocognitive and psychological morbidities. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and CINAHL using controlled vocabulary and key word terms to identify studies reporting characteristics of PICS in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patients. Two reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts and performed data extraction. From the 3176 articles identified in the search, 252 abstracts were identified for full text review and nineteen were identified for inclusion in the review. All studies reporting characteristics of PICS in PICU patients were included in the final synthesis. RESULTS: Nineteen studies meeting inclusion criteria published between 1995 and 2016 were identified and categorized into studies reporting morbidities in each of three categories-physical, neurocognitive and psychological. The majority of included articles reported prospective cohort studies, and there was significant variability in the outcome measures utilized. A synthesis of the studies indicate that morbidities encompassing PICS are well-described in children who have survived critical illness, often resolving over time. Risk factors for development of these morbidities include younger age, lower socioeconomic status, increased number of invasive procedures or interventions, type of illness, and increased benzodiazepine and narcotic administration. CONCLUSION: PICS-related morbidities impact a significant proportion of children discharged from PICUs. In order to further define PICS in children, more research is needed using standardized tools to better understand the scope and natural history of morbidities after hospital discharge. Improving our understanding of physical, neurocognitive, and psychological morbidities after critical illness in the pediatric population is imperative for designing interventions to improve long-term outcomes in PICU patients.
