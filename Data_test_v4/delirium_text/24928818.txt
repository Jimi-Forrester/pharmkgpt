24928818|a|For almost everyone, the need for reading glasses is an inevitable part of the second half of life. Forgetting one's reading glasses at a restaurant can be a disturbing reminder of one's dependence on them. For geriatric inpatients, however, the value of reading glasses in improving quality of life and preventing delirium may be overlooked. Subsequently, the authors present a brief review of visual impairment, the relationship of visual impairment and cognition and the cost of reading glass, and the results of a survey that was conducted to determine the proportion of inpatient geriatric psychiatry inpatient units in the United States, which provide reading glasses to inpatients as well as to assess the knowledge of medical directors of these units regarding the cost and perceived value of providing reading glasses to hospitalized patients.
