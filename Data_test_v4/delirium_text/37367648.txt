37367648|t|Therapeutic Potential of Polyphenols and Other Micronutrients of Marine Origin.
37367648|a|Polyphenols are compounds found in various plants and foods, known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Recently, researchers have been exploring the therapeutic potential of marine polyphenols and other minor nutrients that are found in algae, fish and crustaceans. These compounds have unique chemical structures and exhibit diverse biological properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial and antitumor action. Due to these properties, marine polyphenols are being investigated as possible therapeutic agents for the treatment of a wide variety of conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. This review focuses on the therapeutic potential of marine polyphenols and their applications in human health, and also, in marine phenolic classes, the extraction methods, purification techniques and future applications of marine phenolic compounds.
