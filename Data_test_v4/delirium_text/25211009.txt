25211009|a|Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) aggregation in the brain, known as amyloid plaques, is a pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies show that heme binds to the His residue of Abeta with the iron center and subsequently forms an Abeta-heme complex, which can inhibit Abeta aggregation. Although Tyr-10 was not the residue binding heme, the key roles for Tyr-10 in Abeta-heme complexes and its potential biological relevance to AD etiology under oxidative stress were not sufficiently evaluated. Here, we used wild-type and Tyr-10-mutated human Abeta peptides and studied the impact of the mutation on Abeta-heme peroxidase activity, heme-bound Abeta aggregation, and oxidation and nitration under oxidative and nitrative stresses. Our results indicate that the mutation of Tyr-10 in Abeta16 and Abeta40 decreased the peroxidase activity of Abeta-heme complexes and that the mutation of Tyr-10 could inhibit Abeta40 self-assembly aggregation. Under oxidative (H2O2) and nitrative (H2O2/NaNO2) stress conditions, the Abeta40-heme complexes caused oxidation and nitration of the Abeta Tyr-10 residue through promoting peroxidase-like reactions, which were different from the classic inhibitive effect of heme on Abeta aggregation. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the formation of a heme-to-protein cross-linked Abeta40-heme complex under oxidative stress has been reported; in addition, the mutation of Tyr-10 could inhibit the cross-link formation. Therefore, Tyr-10 is pivotal in Abeta-heme complexes and plays key roles in Abeta aggregation under oxidative and nitrative stresses, demonstrating a novel significance of Tyr-10 as well as Abeta-heme complexes in the pathology of AD.
