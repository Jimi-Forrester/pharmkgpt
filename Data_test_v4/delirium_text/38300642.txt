38300642|a|The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a critical role in maintaining ion and fluid homeostasis, essential for brain metabolism and neuronal function. Regulation of nutrient, water, and ion transport across the BBB is tightly controlled by specialized ion transporters and channels located within its unique cellular components. These dynamic transport processes not only influence the BBB's structure but also impact vital signaling mechanisms, essential for its optimal function. Disruption in ion, pH, and fluid balance at the BBB is associated with brain pathology and has been implicated in various neurological conditions, including stroke, epilepsy, trauma, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, knowledge gaps exist regarding the impact of ion transport dysregulation on BBB function in neurodegenerative dementias. Several factors contribute to this gap: the complex nature of these conditions, historical research focus on neuronal mechanisms and technical challenges in studying the ion transport mechanisms in in vivo models and the lack of efficient in vitro BBB dementia models. This review provides an overview of current research on the roles of ion transporters and channels at the BBB and poses specific research questions: 1) How are the expression and activity of key ion transporters altered in AD and vascular dementia (VaD); 2) Do these changes contribute to BBB dysfunction and disease progression; and 3) Can restoring ion transport function mitigate BBB dysfunction and improve clinical outcomes. Addressing these gaps will provide a greater insight into the vascular pathology of neurodegenerative disorders.
