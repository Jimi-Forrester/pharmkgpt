35076505|t|Behavioral Interventions in Long-Term Care Facilities during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study.
35076505|a|During the COVID-19 pandemic, long-term care (LTC) centers have adopted a series of measures that have affected the physical and cognitive health of patients. The routines of the patients, as well as the interventions of professionals, have been altered. In the case presented here, our aim was to explain the effect that the strong confinement due to the spread of the first COVID-19 wave in Spain had on a 75-year-old resident in an LTC center, with cognitive and behavioral symptomatology compatible with a diagnosis of mixed dementia, as well as the measures that the center adopted to manage the lockdown situation in the best possible way, including personalized attention protocols and a video call program. Different nosological hypotheses are also raised using a semiological analysis, including the analysis of the initial and continuation diagnostic protocols, as well as the therapeutic options.
