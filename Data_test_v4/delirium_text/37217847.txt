37217847|a|BACKGROUND: Analgesia after robot assisted radical cystectomy aims to reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption, while facilitating early mobilization and enteral nutrition and minimizing complications. Epidural analgesia is currently recommended for an open radical cystectomy, but it is unclear if intrathecal morphine is a suiting, less-invasive alternative for a robot-assisted radical cystectomy. METHODS: The analgesic method of choice changed from epidural anesthesia to intrathecal anesthesia for patients undergoing a robot-assisted radical cystectomy. This single-center retrospective study aims to investigate if there is a difference between epidural and intrathecal analgesia in postoperative pain scores, opioid consumption, length of hospital stays and postoperative complications. An Propensity Matched Analysis was added to conventional analysis to consolidate the findings. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 153 patients of whom 114 received an epidural catheter with bupivacaine/sufentanil and 39 received a single shot of intrathecal bupivacaine/morphine. Mean pain scores on the first two postoperative days (POD) were slightly higher in the intrathecal analgesia group (epidural versus intrathecal analgesia, NRS POD0: 0(0-2)[0-8] versus 1(0-3)[0-5], p = 0.050; POD1: 2(1-3)[0-8] versus 3(1-4)[0-7], p = 0.058; POD2: 2(0-3)[0-8] versus 3(2-4)[0-7], p = 0.010). Total postoperative morphine consumption was similar over the first seven days: 15 mg (5-35)[0-148] in the epidural group versus 11 mg (0-35)[0-148] in the intrathecal morphine group, p = 0.167. Length of hospital stay and time until fit for discharge where slightly higher in the epidural group (respectively 7 days (5-9)[4-42] versus 6 days (5-7)[4-38], p = 0.006, and 5 days (4-8)[3-30]) versus 5 days (4-6)[3-34], p = 0.018). There was no further difference in postoperative course. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the effects of epidural analgesia and intrathecal morphine are comparable and that intrathecal morphine may be a suiting alternative for epidural analgesia.
