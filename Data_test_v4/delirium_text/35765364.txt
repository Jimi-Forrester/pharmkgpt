35765364|a|The worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, is not only a great threat to the victim life but it is leaving invisible devastating negative affect on mental health of quarantined individual because of isolation, depression, bereavement, and loss of income. Therefore, the precise monitoring catecholamine neurotransmitters specifically of dopamine (DA) is of great importance to assess the mental health. Thus, herein we have synthesized Co-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) through solvothermal method for precise monitoring of DA. To facilitate the fast transportation of ions, highly conductive polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene; PEDOT) has been integrated on the surface of ZIF-67 which not only provides the smooth pathway for ions/electrons transportation but also saves the electrode from pulverization. The fabricated ZIF-67/PEDOT electrode shows a significant sensing performance towards DA detection in terms of short diffusion pathways by expositing more active sites, over good linear range (15-240 muM) and a low detection limit of (0.04 muM) even in the coexistence of the potentially interfering molecules. The developed ZIF-67/PEDOT sensor was successfully employed for sensitive and selective monitoring of DA from COVID-19 quarantined person blood, thus suggesting reliability of the developed electrode.
