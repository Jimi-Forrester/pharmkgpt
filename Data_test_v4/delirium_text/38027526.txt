38027526|t|Competing endogenous RNAs in human astrocytes: crosstalk and interacting networks in response to lipotoxicity.
38027526|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are characterized by a progressive deterioration of neuronal function, leading to motor and cognitive damage in patients. Astrocytes are essential for maintaining brain homeostasis, and their functional impairment is increasingly recognized as central to the etiology of various NDs. Such impairment can be induced by toxic insults with palmitic acid (PA), a common fatty acid, that disrupts autophagy, increases reactive oxygen species, and triggers inflammation. Although the effects of PA on astrocytes have been addressed, most aspects of the dynamics of this fatty acid remain unknown. Additionally, there is still no model that satisfactorily explains how astroglia goes from being neuroprotective to neurotoxic. Current incomplete knowledge needs to be improved by the growing field of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which is proven to be related to NDs, where the complexity of the interactions among these molecules and how they control other RNA expressions need to be addressed. In the present study, we present an extensive competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network using transcriptomic data from normal human astrocyte (NHA) cells exposed to PA lipotoxic conditions and experimentally validated data on ncRNA interaction. The obtained network contains 7 lncRNA transcripts, 38 miRNAs, and 239 mRNAs that showed enrichment in ND-related processes, such as fatty acid metabolism and biosynthesis, FoxO and TGF-beta signaling pathways, prion diseases, apoptosis, and immune-related pathways. In addition, the transcriptomic profile was used to propose 22 potential key controllers lncRNA/miRNA/mRNA axes in ND mechanisms. The relevance of five of these axes was corroborated by the miRNA expression data obtained in other studies. MEG3 (ENST00000398461)/hsa-let-7d-5p/ATF6B axis showed importance in Parkinson's and late Alzheimer's diseases, while AC092687.3/hsa-let-7e-5p/[SREBF2, FNIP1, PMAIP1] and SDCBP2-AS1 (ENST00000446423)/hsa-miR-101-3p/MAPK6 axes are probably related to Alzheimer's disease development and pathology. The presented network and axes will help to understand the PA-induced mechanisms in astrocytes, leading to protection or injury in the CNS under lipotoxic conditions as part of the intricated cellular regulation influencing the pathology of different NDs. Furthermore, the five corroborated axes could be considered study targets for new pharmacologic treatments or as possible diagnostic molecules, contributing to improving the quality of life of millions worldwide.
