34071112|t|Effect of a Music Therapy Intervention Using Gerdner and Colleagues' Protocol for Caregivers and Elderly Patients with Dementia: A Single-Blind Randomized Controlled Study.
34071112|a|Music therapy (MT) is considered one of the complementary strategies to pharmacological treatment for behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) of dementia. However, studies adopting MT protocols tailored for institutionalized people with dementia are limited and their usefulness for supporting caregivers is under investigated to date. Our study aimed at evaluating the effects of an MT intervention according to Gerdner and colleagues' protocol in a sample of 60 elderly people with moderate-to-severe dementia of the Auxologico Institute (Milan, Italy) and associated caregivers, randomly assigned to an Experimental Group (EG) (n = 30) undergoing 30 min of MT two times a week for 8 weeks and to a Control Group (n = 30) (CG) receiving standard care. Before and after the intervention, residents-associated caregivers were administered the Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Depression and worry were also assessed in caregivers prior to the intervention, by the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the Penn State Worry Questionnaire, respectively. A mixed model ANCOVA revealed a Time*Group effect (p = 0.006) with regard to CBI decreasing after the intervention for the EG and Time*Group effects (p = 0.001) with regard to NPI_frequencyXseverity and NPI_distress, with a greater effect for the EG than the CG. Implications for MT protocols implementations are discussed.
