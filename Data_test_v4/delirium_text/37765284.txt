37765284|t|A Promising Approach: Magnetic Nanosystems for Alzheimer's Disease Theranostics.
37765284|a|Among central nervous system (CNS) disorders, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and a major cause of dementia worldwide. The yet unclear etiology of AD and the high impenetrability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limit most therapeutic compounds from reaching the brain. Although many efforts have been made to effectively deliver drugs to the CNS, both invasive and noninvasive strategies employed often come with associated side effects. Nanotechnology-based approaches such as nanoparticles (NPs), which can act as multifunctional platforms in a single system, emerged as a potential solution for current AD theranostics. Among these, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are an appealing strategy since they can act as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and as drug delivery systems. The nanocarrier functionalization with specific moieties, such as peptides, proteins, and antibodies, influences the particles' interaction with brain endothelial cell constituents, facilitating transport across the BBB and possibly increasing brain penetration. In this review, we introduce MNP-based systems, combining surface modifications with the particles' physical properties for molecular imaging, as a novel neuro-targeted strategy for AD theranostics. The main goal is to highlight the potential of multifunctional MNPs and their advances as a dual nanotechnological diagnosis and treatment platform for neurodegenerative disorders.
