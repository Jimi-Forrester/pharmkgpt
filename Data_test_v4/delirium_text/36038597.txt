36038597|t|Biomarker characterization of clinical subtypes of Parkinson Disease.
36038597|a|The biological underpinnings of the PD clusters remain unknown as the existing PD clusters lacks biomarker characterization. We try to identify clinical subtypes of Parkinson Disease (PD) in an Asian cohort and characterize them by comparing clinical assessments, genetic status and blood biochemical markers. A total of 206 PD patients were included from a multi-centre Asian cohort. Hierarchical clustering was performed to generate PD subtypes. Clinical and biological characterization of the subtypes were performed by comparing clinical assessments, allelic distributions of Asian related PD gene (SNCA, LRRK2, Park16, ITPKB, SV2C) and blood biochemical markers. Hierarchical clustering method identified three clusters: cluster A (severe subtype in motor, non-motor and cognitive domains), cluster B (intermediate subtype with cognitive impairment and mild non-motor symptoms) and cluster C (mild subtype and young age of onset). The three clusters had significantly different allele frequencies in two SNPs (Park16 rs6679073 A allele carriers in cluster A B C: 67%, 74%, 89%, p = 0.015; SV2C rs246814 T allele distribution: 7%, 12%, 25%, p = 0.026). Serum homocysteine (Hcy) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also significantly different among three clusters (Mean levels of Hcy and CRP among cluster A B C were: 19.4 +- 4.2, 18.4 +- 5.7, 15.6 +- 5.6, adjusted p = 0.005; 2.5 +- 5.0, 1.5 +- 2.4, 0.9 +- 2.1, adjusted p < 0.0001, respectively). Of the 3 subtypes identified amongst early PD patients, the severe subtype was associated with significantly lower frequency of Park16 and SV2C alleles and higher levels of Hcy and CRP. These biomarkers may be useful to stratify PD subtypes and identify more severe subtypes.
