36985839|t|In Vitro Antiglycation and Methylglyoxal Trapping Effect of Peppermint Leaf (Mentha x piperita L.) and Its Polyphenols.
36985839|a|The most significant reactive alpha-dicarbonyl RCS involved in the pathomechanism of glycation and related diseases is methylglyoxal (MGO). Hyperglycemia promotes the generation of MGO and leads to the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Therefore, MGO trapping and glycation inhibition appear to be important therapeutic targets in prediabetes, diabetes, and in the early prevention of hyperglycemic complications. Peppermint leaf is commonly used as herbal tea, rich in polyphenols. Eriocitrin, its predominant component, in a double-blind, randomized controlled study reversed the prediabetic condition in patients. However, the antiglycation activity of this plant material and its polyphenols has not been characterized to date. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of a peppermint leaf dry extract and its polyphenols to inhibit non-enzymatic protein glycation in a model with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and MGO as a glycation agent. Peppermint polyphenols were also evaluated for their potential to trap MGO in vitro, and the resulting adducts were analyzed by UHPLC-ESI-MS. To relate chemical composition to glycation inhibitory activity, the obtained peppermint extract was subjected to qualitative and quantitative analysis. The capability of peppermint leaf polyphenols to inhibit glycation (27.3-77.2%) and form adducts with MGO was confirmed. In the case of flavone aglycones, mono- and di-adducts with MGO were observed, while eriodictyol and eriocitrin effectively produced only mono-adducts. Rosmarinic acid and luteolin-7-O-glycosides did not reveal this action. IC50 of the peppermint leaf dry extract was calculated at 2 mg/mL, equivalent to a concentration of 1.8 muM/mL of polyphenols, including ~1.4 muM/mL of flavonoids and ~0.4 muM/mL of phenolic acids. The contribution of the four major components to the anti-AGE activity of the extract was estimated at 86%, including eriocitrin 35.4%, rosmarinic acid 25.6%, luteolin-7-O-rutinoside 16.9%, luteolin-7-O-beta-glucuronoside 8.1%, and others 14%. The effect of peppermint dry extract and polyphenols in inhibiting MGO-induced glycation in vitro was comparable to that of metformin used as a positive control.
