33425085|a|Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is an uncommon but well-established cause of acute pancreatitis. The patients with pancreatitis are at risk for both local and systemic complications. Abdominal compartment syndrome is underdiagnosed and undertreated in this patient population. We report a case of 39-year-old male with medical history of diabetes mellitus who presented with abdominal pain and was diagnosed with HTG induced pancreatitis, complicated by abdominal compartment syndrome requiring surgical decompression and plasmapheresis.
