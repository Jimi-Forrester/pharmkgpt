39099831|t|The Medical Complexity of Newly Admitted Long-Term Care Residents Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta: A Serial Cross-Sectional Study.
39099831|a|The COVID-19 pandemic had profound effects on the long-term care (LTC) setting worldwide, including changes in admission practices. We aimed to describe the characteristics and medical complexity of newly admitted LTC residents before (March 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020) and during (March 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021) the COVID-19 pandemic via a population-based serial cross-sectional study in Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia, Canada. With data from the Minimum Data Set 2.0 we characterize the medical complexity of newly admitted LTC residents via the Geriatric 5Ms framework (mind, mobility, medication, multicomplexity, matters most) through descriptive statistics (counts, percentages), stratified by pandemic wave, month, and province. We included 45 756 residents admitted in the year prior to and 35 744 during the first year of the pandemic. We found an increased proportion of residents with depression, requiring extensive assistance with activities of daily living, hip fractures, antipsychotic use, expected to live <6 months, with pneumonia, low social engagement, and admitted from acute care. Our study confirms an increase in medical complexity of residents admitted to LTC during the pandemic and can be used to plan services and interventions and as a baseline for continued monitoring in changes in population characteristics over time.
