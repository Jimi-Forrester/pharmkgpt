33336220|t|Assessing the Impact of Factors that Influence the Ketogenic Response to Varying Doses of Medium Chain Triglyceride (MCT) Oil.
33336220|a|Objectives, Design, Setting: The ketogenic effect of medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil offers potential for Alzheimer's disease prevention and treatment. Limited literature suggests a linear B-hyroxybutyrate (BHB) response to increasing MCT doses. This pharmacokinetic study evaluates factors affecting BHB response in three subject groups. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy subjects without cognitive deficits <65years, similarly healthy subjects >=65years, and those with Alzheimer's Disease were assessed. INTERVENTION: Different doses (0g,14g, 28g, 42g) of MCT oil (99.3% C8:0) were administered, followed by fasting during the study period. MEASUREMENTS: BHB measured by finger prick sampling hourly for 5 hours after ingestion. Each subject attended four different days for each ascending dose. Data was also collected on body composition, BMI, waist/hip ratio, grip strength, gait speed, nutrient content of pre-study breakfast and side effects. RESULTS: Twenty-five participants: eight healthy; average age of 44yr (25-61), nine healthy; 79yr (65-90) and eight with AD; 78.6yr (57-86) respectively. Compiled data showed the expected linear dose response relationship. No group differences, with baseline corrected area under the blood vs. time curve (r2=0.98) and maximum concentrations (r2=0.97). However, there was notable individual variability in maximum BHB response (42g dose: 0.4 -2.1mM), and time to reach maximum BHB response both, within and between individuals. Variability was unrelated to age, sex, sarcopenic or AD status. Visceral fat, BMI, waist/hip ratio and pretest meal CHO and protein content all affected the BHB response (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: There was a large inter-individual variability, with phenotype effects identified. This highlights challenges in interpreting clinical responses to MCT intake.
