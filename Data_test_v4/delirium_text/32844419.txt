32844419|t|Life-threatening pathogens in severe/progressive periodontitis: Focal infection risk, future periodontal practice, role of the Periodontology 2000.
32844419|a|Severe/progressive periodontitis is associated with cardiovascular disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and dozens of other serious diseases. Herpesviruses are implicated in severe periodontitis and in specific subsets of each of the above systemic diseases. That both periodontitis and herpesviruses are linked to the same nonoral diseases is consistent with a systemic pathogenic role of periodontal herpesviruses. Effective control of periodontitis-related systemic diseases requires collaboration between dentistry and medicine. Periodontology has emerged as an important preventive medical discipline, and periodontal teaching and practice need to adjust accordingly.
