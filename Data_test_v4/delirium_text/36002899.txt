36002899|a|BACKGROUND: Amiodarone is a commonly used antiarrhythmic for the treatment of atrial fibrillation with a unique pharmacokinetic profile. While general side effects can be frequently associated with amiodarone, psychiatric adverse reactions to this medication are uncommon. The relationship between amiodarone and hallucinations independent of delirium has been rarely reported in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 63-year-old female with a history of estrogen and progesterone receptor positive invasive ductal carcinoma with osseous metastases to the ribs and skull, major depressive disorder, and unspecified anxiety. She was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma 12 years prior and underwent a lumpectomy with axillary lymph node dissection and radiation, currently maintained on anastrozole and trastuzumab for the past 11 years. Her symptoms of major depressive disorder and anxiety have remained in remission on a regimen of bupropion extended release, duloxetine, and trazodone without recent dose changes. This patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was admitted to the general medical floor with new-onset atrial fibrillation. She was subsequently started on amiodarone for rhythm control. Shortly after its initiation, the patient developed new onset auditory and visual hallucinations with an unremarkable extensive medical evaluation. Auditory hallucinations consisted of music and unintelligible conversations, while visual hallucinations were of a family member crying on the floor and a man carrying a gun. The differential diagnoses included depression with psychotic features, delirium, and amiodarone-induced hallucinations. Given the lack of current depressive symptoms, absence of altered cognition, and the temporal relationship between the initiation of amiodarone and the onset of hallucinations, amiodarone was suspected to be probable etiology of her hallucinations. For this reason, amiodarone was replaced with dronedarone. Visual and auditory hallucinations ceased within less than 3 days after the discontinuation of amiodarone. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric adverse events from amiodarone are uncommon, and associated isolated hallucinations have only been rarely reported in the literature. While the risk of visual and auditory hallucinations appears to be low with amiodarone initiation, clinicians should be aware of this potential side effect.
