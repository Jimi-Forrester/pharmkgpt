35246046|a|BACKGROUND: Isaacs' syndrome is a peripheral nerve hyperexcitability (PNH) syndrome due to peripheral motor nerve instability. Acquired Isaacs' syndrome is recognized as a paraneoplastic autoimmune disease with possible pathogenic voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) complex antibodies. However, the longitudinal correlation between clinical symptoms, VGKC antibodies level, and drug response is still unclear. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old man had progressive four limbs soreness, muscle twitching, cramps, and pain 4 months before admission. Electromyography (EMG) studies showed myokymic discharges, neuromyotonia, and an incremental response in the high-rate (50 Hz) repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) test. Isaacs' syndrome was diagnosed based on clinical presentations and EMG reports. Serum studies showed positive VGKC complex antibodies, including leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) and contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) antibodies. The acetylcholine receptor antibody was negative. Whole-body computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography revealed a mediastinal tumor with the great vessels encasement, right pleura, and diaphragm seeding. Biopsy confirmed a World Health Organization type B2 thymoma, with Masaoka stage IVa. His symptoms gradually improved and both LGI1 and CASPR2 antibodies titer became undetectable after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and high dose steroid treatment. However, his Isaacs' syndrome recurred after the steroid was reduced 5 months later. Follow-up chest CT showed probable thymoma progression. LGI1 antibody turned positive again while CASPR2 antibody remained undetectable. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient demonstrates that Isaacs' syndrome could be the initial and only neuromuscular manifestation of malignant thymoma. His Isaacs' syndrome is correlated well with the LGI1 antibody level. With an unresectable thymoma, long-term immunosuppressant therapy may be necessary for the management of Isaacs' syndrome in addition to CCRT for thymoma.
