Thanks to the development of powerful tools for molecular analysis, researchers in recent years have begun to uncover the genes behind such multifactorial neurologic and systemic disorders as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and diabetes. Likewise investigators have been able to confirm that the course of these diseases and their clinical manifestations depend on the concurrence in the same individual of specific genetic variations. Because each gene confers a certain degree of predisposition to a specific disease, they are therefore called susceptibility genes. The search for and analysis of susceptibility genes in defined populations is termed genetic epidemiology. This multidisciplinary science is providing valuable data that further our understanding and ability to diagnose of disorders of the nervous system. It also enables us to predict the clinical course of disease in a given patient with a high degree of reliability, even when no clinical signs are yet evident.
