35958035|t|Feasibility of Measuring Frailty and Patient-Reported Outcomes During and After Post-Acute Skilled Nursing Facility Rehabilitation.
35958035|a|Functional status and quality of life are not routinely assessed after skilled nursing facility (SNF) discharge. We determined feasibility of measuring frailty among adults >=65 years admitted to SNF after hospitalization, and post-discharge outcomes. We calculated a frailty index (non-frail [<=0.25], mild frailty [0.26-0.35], moderate [0.36-0.45], and severe [>0.45]). After SNF discharge, we conducted serial telephone interviews measuring ability to perform functional activities and Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scores. Overall of 68 screened patients, 42 were eligible, and 24 (57.1%) eligible patients were enrolled. Of these, 5 (20.8%) were admitted after elective hospitalizations, 17 (70.8%) were female, and 11 (45.8%) had moderate-to-severe frailty. Frailty was measured in all participants in a mean 32.1 minutes. At 90 days, a total of three participants died, and two were lost to follow-up. Post-discharge functional status varied by frailty, with moderate-to-severe frailty having persistent impairment and lower PROMIS scores (worse quality of life) compared to those with no or mild frailty (38.2 [13.7] vs. 47.3 [8.1] p = .04). Measuring frailty and quality of life in older patients admitted to SNF is feasible. Furthermore, measuring frailty may help identify those at particularly high risk of poor recovery and lower quality of life after discharge.
