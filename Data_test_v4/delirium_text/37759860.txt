37759860|t|Non-Opioid Anesthetics Addiction: A Review of Current Situation and Mechanism.
37759860|a|Drug addiction is one of the major worldwide health problems, which will have serious adverse consequences on human health and significantly burden the social economy and public health. Drug abuse is more common in anesthesiologists than in the general population because of their easier access to controlled substances. Although opioids have been generally considered the most commonly abused drugs among anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists, the abuse of non-opioid anesthetics has been increasingly severe in recent years. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the clinical situation and potential molecular mechanisms of non-opioid anesthetics addiction. This review incorporates the clinical and biomolecular evidence supporting the abuse potential of non-opioid anesthetics and the foreseeable mechanism causing the non-opioid anesthetics addiction phenotypes, promoting a better understanding of its pathogenesis and helping to find effective preventive and curative strategies.
