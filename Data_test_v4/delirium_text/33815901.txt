33815901|t|Symptoms Associated with Low Threshold Lead Poisoning Among Roadside and Organized Panel Beaters in Enugu Metropolis, Nigeria.
33815901|a|BACKGROUND: There is no safe level of human exposure to lead (Pb). Detecting common early symptoms of low threshold Pb poisoning can help to prevent the damaging effects of higher doses and chronic low dose exposures. Panel beaters or auto body mechanics are exposed to Pb through their occupational duties. OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to determine common early symptoms associated with lower threshold Pb poisoning among roadside and organized panel beaters in Enugu Metropolis, Nigeria. METHODS: This was a comparative cross-sectional study of 428 panel beaters in Enugu metropolis. A multi-stage sampling method was used to select 214 respondents each from the roadside and organized sectors. A semi-structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. Samples were collected under aseptic procedures. Blood Pb samples were extracted using the conventional wet acid digestion method and analyzed using a flame atomic absorption spectrometer (wavelength 283.3 nm). Comparative analysis was performed using the chi - square and Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: Median Pb levels were 3.0 ug/dL and 16.0 ug/dL among roadside and organized panel beaters, respectively, with a significant difference. Numbness of limbs (P = 0.010) and fatigue (chi2 = 5.294, P = 0.023) were found to be associated with roadside panel beaters, while weakness (chi2 = 6.185, P = 0.019) and fatigue (chi2 = 4.206, P = 0.046) were associated with organized panel beaters. CONCLUSIONS: Nonspecific constitutional symptoms were common early symptoms of Pb poisoning irrespective of workplace occupational practices. These symptoms will help in early detection and control of occupational lead exposures. PARTICIPANT CONSENT: Obtained. ETHICS APPROVAL: Ethics approval was obtained from the Health Research Ethics Committee of the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Ituku Ozalla, Enugu.
