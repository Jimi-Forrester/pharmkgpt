37242119|t|Obesity, Gut Microbiota, and Metabolome: From Pathophysiology to Nutritional Interventions.
37242119|a|Obesity is a disorder identified by an inappropriate increase in weight in relation to height and is considered by many international health institutions to be a major pandemic of the 21st century. The gut microbial ecosystem impacts obesity in multiple ways that yield downstream metabolic consequences, such as affecting systemic inflammation, immune response, and energy harvest, but also the gut-host interface. Metabolomics, a systematized study of low-molecular-weight molecules that take part in metabolic pathways, represents a serviceable method for elucidation of the crosstalk between hosts' metabolism and gut microbiota. In the present review, we confer about clinical and preclinical studies exploring the association of obesity and related metabolic disorders with various gut microbiome profiles, and the effects of several dietary interventions on gut microbiome composition and the metabolome. It is well established that various nutritional interventions may serve as an efficient therapeutic approach to support weight loss in obese individuals, yet no agreement exists in regard to the most effective dietary protocol, both in the short and long term. However, metabolite profiling and the gut microbiota composition might represent an opportunity to methodically establish predictors for obesity control that are relatively simple to measure in comparison to traditional approaches, and it may also present a tool to determine the optimal nutritional intervention to ameliorate obesity in an individual. Nevertheless, a lack of adequately powered randomized trials impedes the application of observations to clinical practice.
