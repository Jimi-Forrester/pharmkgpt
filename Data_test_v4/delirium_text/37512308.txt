37512308|t|Antimicrobial Solutions for Endotracheal Tubes in Prevention of Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia.
37512308|a|Ventilator-associated pneumonia is one of the most frequently encountered hospital infections and is an essential issue in the healthcare field. It is usually linked to a high mortality rate and prolonged hospitalization time. There is a lack of treatment, so alternative solutions must be continuously sought. The endotracheal tube is an indwelling device that is a significant culprit for ventilator-associated pneumonia because its surface can be colonized by different types of pathogens, which generate a multispecies biofilm. In the paper, we discuss the definition of ventilator-associated pneumonia, the economic burdens, and its outcomes. Then, we present the latest technological solutions for endotracheal tube surfaces, such as active antimicrobial coatings, passive coatings, and combinatorial methods, with examples from the literature. We end our analysis by identifying the gaps existing in the present research and investigating future possibilities that can decrease ventilator-associated pneumonia cases and improve patient comfort during treatment.
