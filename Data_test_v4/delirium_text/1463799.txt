1463799|a|With life spans increasing the number of demented people rises steeply which requires proper diagnosis, particularly in the early stage of the disease. Although the majority of patients suffering from dementia have Alzheimer's disease characterized by slowly progressive course, searching for treatable causes will enable effective support to a certain number of patients. Presence of only one clinical symptom and/or sign, like the memory impairment is not sufficient for diagnosing dementia owing to its nonspecificity. Proper diagnosis depends upon one's familiarity with the criteria, clinical features, associated symptoms and the natural course of the disease as well as a wide variety of different etiological factors manifested by the similar clinical picture. In spite of certain shortcomings, the flow chart system approach of diagnostic procedure is intended for more accurate and less time consuming assessment of the clinical diagnosis of dementia. Understanding and familiarity with different aspects of the clinical picture lie behind the rational approach and selection of various laboratory methods and techniques to confirm or exclude presence of the disease for the benefit of patients and to avoid unnecessary wasting of considerable amounts of financial resources.
