33735031|t|Polymorphisms of apolipoprotein E in the Afro-descendant population of Buenaventura, Colombia.
33735031|a|OBJETIVES: To estimate the frequency distribution, both allelic and genotypic, of the APOE gene in the Afro-descendant population of Buenaventura, Colombia. METHODS: Three hundred and forty-eight Afro-descendant individuals were analysed and the APOE locus was genotyped by PCR-RFLP. The allelic and genotypic frequencies were established by direct counting and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was evaluated through chi2 test. The frequencies obtained in this study were compared with frequencies reported for other Colombian populations through the Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: The following allelic frequencies were observed: E3, 70.8%; E4, 21.4%, and E2, 7.8%. The genotypic frequencies were: E3/E3, 51.1%; E3/E4, 27.3%; E2/E3, 12.1%; E4/E4, 6%; E2/E4, 3.5%, and E2/E2, 0%. The entire examined population was found in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P=.074), and significant differences were found in the allele E4 when comparing this population with the Amerindian and mestizo populations of Bogota, Quindio, Centro-Oriente, Valle del Cauca, Barranquilla and Medellin (P<= 0.0345). CONCLUSIONS: The allelic frequencies observed in this study were significantly different from the frequencies reported in other Colombian populations. The high representativeness of the E4 and E2 alleles validates the hypothesis that there are micro-evolutionary processes that have been acting on their frequencies and could be associated with susceptibility to neuropsychiatric diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, metabolic alterations of fats and/or coronary artery disease.
