36123961|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore clinical correlates of fear of progression (FoP) among patients with cancer during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and examine the mediation effect of cancer-related dysfunctional beliefs about sleep (C-DBS). METHODS: Medical charts of patients with cancer who visited a psycho-oncology clinic between July and November 2021 were reviewed. Baseline socio-demographic and cancer-related variables were collected. Patients' self-report questionnaires, regarding FoP, depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items; PHQ-9), viral anxiety (Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 items; SAVE-6), C-DBS, and other distress, were investigated. Pearson's correlation and linear regression were performed to examine the risk factors of FoP. Mediation effect analysis with the bootstrap method with 2,000 resamples was implemented. RESULTS: A total of 231 patients were included in the analysis. Linear regression revealed that FoP was predicted by age (beta = -0.14, P = 0.003), PHQ-9 (beta = 0.48, P < 0.001), SAVE-6 (beta = 0.34, P < 0.001), and C-DBS (beta = 0.15, P = 0.005). FoP was directly influenced by SAVE-6 and mediated by C-DBS, while it was directly influenced by PHQ-9 with no mediation effect. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the FoP of patients with cancer was associated with younger age, depression, viral anxiety, and C-DBS. Depression and viral anxiety directly influenced FoP, while C-DBS mediated the association between viral anxiety and FoP. Therefore, oncology healthcare professionals are recommended to assess C-DBS of their patients when they are highly distressed from FoP.
