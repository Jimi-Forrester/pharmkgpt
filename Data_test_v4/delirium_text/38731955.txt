38731955|t|Unlocking Preclinical Alzheimer's: A Multi-Year Label-Free In Vitro Raman Spectroscopy Study Empowered by Chemometrics.
38731955|a|Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, the early detection of which is crucial for timely intervention and enrollment in clinical trials. However, the preclinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's encounters difficulties with gold-standard methods. The current definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's still relies on expensive instrumentation and post-mortem histological examinations. Here, we explore label-free Raman spectroscopy with machine learning as an alternative to preclinical Alzheimer's diagnosis. A special feature of this study is the inclusion of patient samples from different cohorts, sampled and measured in different years. To develop reliable classification models, partial least squares discriminant analysis in combination with variable selection methods identified discriminative molecules, including nucleic acids, amino acids, proteins, and carbohydrates such as taurine/hypotaurine and guanine, when applied to Raman spectra taken from dried samples of cerebrospinal fluid. The robustness of the model is remarkable, as the discriminative molecules could be identified in different cohorts and years. A unified model notably classifies preclinical Alzheimer's, which is particularly surprising because of Raman spectroscopy's high sensitivity regarding different measurement conditions. The presented results demonstrate the capability of Raman spectroscopy to detect preclinical Alzheimer's disease for the first time and offer invaluable opportunities for future clinical applications and diagnostic methods.
