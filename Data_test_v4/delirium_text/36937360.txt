36937360|a|Background: Studies regarding the impact of the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010) on the mortality of adults with hypertension are lacking. Objectives: This study aimed to prospectively explore the relationships between HEI-2010 and mortality from heart disease and all causes in adults with hypertension based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2007-2014. Methods: This is a prospective cohort study including 6,690 adults with hypertension from NHANES (2007-2014). National Death Index data up to 31 December 2019 were used to determine the number of deaths due to heart disease and all other causes. We evaluated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the Cox proportional hazards model. Results: A total of 1,259 deaths from all causes, including 338 due to heart disease, were documented over an average follow-up duration of 8.4 years. In comparison with the lowest quartile of HEI-2010 scores, multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality were 0.82 (0.70, 0.97), 0.78 (0.64, 0.95), and 0.68 (0.54, 0.85) for the second, third, and fourth quartiles of the HEI-2010 scores (P-trend < 0.001) and for heart disease mortality were 0.60 (0.44, 0.81), 0.59 (0.40, 0.89), and 0.53 (0.35, 0.80) (P-trend = 0.010). Each increment in natural-log-transformed HEI-2010 scores was linked to a 43% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality (P < 0.001) and a 55% reduction in the risk of heart disease mortality (P = 0.003). Among the 12 components of HEI-2010, adherence to a higher intake of greens and beans, vegetables, total protein foods, seafood and plant proteins, and unsaturated fatty acids, as well as moderate consumption of empty calories, were related to a 21-29% lower risk of all-cause mortality. Conclusion: In the current study, there was a statistically significant inverse relationship between HEI-2010 and mortality from heart disease and all causes among adults with hypertension. Based on the findings, it may help guide the dietary intake for adults with hypertension.
