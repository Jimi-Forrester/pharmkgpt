35204697|t|DOTA: Deep Learning Optimal Transport Approach to Advance Drug Repositioning for Alzheimer's Disease.
35204697|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of age-related dementia, affecting over 5 million people in the United States and incurring a substantial global healthcare cost. Unfortunately, current treatments are only palliative and do not cure AD. There is an urgent need to develop novel anti-AD therapies; however, drug discovery is a time-consuming, expensive, and high-risk process. Drug repositioning, on the other hand, is an attractive approach to identify drugs for AD treatment. Thus, we developed a novel deep learning method called DOTA (Drug repositioning approach using Optimal Transport for Alzheimer's disease) to repurpose effective FDA-approved drugs for AD. Specifically, DOTA consists of two major autoencoders: (1) a multi-modal autoencoder to integrate heterogeneous drug information and (2) a Wasserstein variational autoencoder to identify effective AD drugs. Using our approach, we predict that antipsychotic drugs with circadian effects, such as quetiapine, aripiprazole, risperidone, suvorexant, brexpiprazole, olanzapine, and trazadone, will have efficacious effects in AD patients. These drugs target important brain receptors involved in memory, learning, and cognition, including serotonin 5-HT2A, dopamine D2, and orexin receptors. In summary, DOTA repositions promising drugs that target important biological pathways and are predicted to improve patient cognition, circadian rhythms, and AD pathogenesis.
