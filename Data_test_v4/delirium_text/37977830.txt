37977830|t|Delirium following pregabalin discontinuation in an individual with no psychiatric or substance use history.
37977830|a|We report about a man in his mid-50s who was prescribed pregabalin (150 mg/day) for neuropathic pain due to a herniated intervertebral disc. Four weeks later, he presented to the emergency room with symptoms consistent with delirium. After ruling out acute intoxication with a substance and neurological causes, collateral information from the family and review of his medical chart indicated potential discontinuation syndrome owing to pregabalin. Following the successful treatment and resolution of delirium, the patient revealed he had been consistently consuming pregabalin doses upwards of 2 g/day over the past 2 weeks, leading to the premature exhaustion of his prescription and an abrupt cessation. The case findings underscore the necessity for physicians to recognise the potential for pregabalin misuse and the associated withdrawal risks, including delirium.
