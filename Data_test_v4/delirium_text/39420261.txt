39420261|a|BACKGROUND: Synaptic degeneration, axonal injury, and white matter disintegration are among the pathological events in Alzheimer's disease (AD), for which growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) could be an indicator. In this study, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) GAP-43 clinical trajectories and their association with progression and AD hallmarks with white matter microstructural changes were evaluated. METHODS: A total number of 133 participants were enrolled in GAP-43 and DTI values were compared between groups, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally with two and four-year follow-ups. Subsequently, the correlation between GAP-43 levels in the CSF and DTI values was investigated using Spearman's correlation. RESULTS: The CSF level of GAP-43 is negatively correlated with the mean diffusivity measures in Fornix (Cres)/Stria terminals in early and late MCI (rs=-0.478 p = 0.021 and rs=-0.425 p = 0.038). Additionally, the CSF level of GAP-43 is negatively correlated with fractional anisotropy in the cingulum in late MCI (rs=-0.437 p = 0.033). Moreover, the axial diffusivity in superior corona radiate (rs=-0.562 p = 0.005 and rs=-0.484 p = 0.036) and radial diffusivity in superior fronto-occipital fasciculus was negatively correlated with GAP-43 level in the early and mid-MCI participants (rs=-0.520 p = 0.011 and rs=-0.498 p = 0.030). CONCLUSIONS: Presynaptic marker GAP-43 in combination with DTI can be used as a novel biomarker to identify microstructural synaptic degeneration in the early MCI. In addition, it can be used as a biomarker for tracking the progression of AD and monitoring treatment efficacy.
