34098397|t|Identification of ortho catechol-containing isoflavone as a privileged scaffold that directly prevents the aggregation of both amyloid beta plaques and tau-mediated neurofibrillary tangles and its in vivo evaluation.
34098397|a|In this study, polyhydroxyisoflavones that directly prevent the aggregation of both amyloid beta (Abeta) and tau were expediently synthesized via divergent Pd(0)-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura coupling and then biologically evaluated. By preliminary structure-activity relationship studies using thioflavin T (ThT) assays, an ortho-catechol containing isoflavone scaffold was proven to be crucial for preventing both Abeta aggregation and tau-mediated neurofibrillary tangle formation. Additional TEM experiment confirmed that ortho-catechol containing isoflavone 4d significantly prevented the aggregation of both Abeta and tau. To investigate the mode of action (MOA) of 4d, which possesses an ortho-catechol moiety, 1H-15N HSQC NMR analysis was thoroughly performed and the result indicated that 4d could directly inhibit both the formation of Abeta42 fibrils and the formation of tau-derived neurofibrils, probably through the catechol-mediated nucleation of tau. Finally, 4d was demonstrated to alleviate cognitive impairment and pathologies related to Alzheimer's disease in a 5XFAD transgenic mouse model.
