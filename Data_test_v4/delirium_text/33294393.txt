33294393|t|Association of APOE E2 and low-density lipoprotein with depressive symptoms in Chinese senile schizophrenia inpatients: A cross-sectional study.
33294393|a|BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is considered to occur due to both environmental and genetic factors. Depressive symptoms and apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene polymorphisms are involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. However, the effect of APOE gene polymorphism on depressive symptoms has never been investigated among Chinese elderly schizophrenia patients. OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the effect of APOE gene polymorphism on blood lipid metabolism and depressive symptoms among elderly schizophrenia patients. METHOD: A total of 301 elderly schizophrenia patients (161 males, age ranges from 60 to 92 years, with an average age of 67.31 +- 6.667) were included in the study. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). APOE gene polymorphisms were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Correlations between GDS and serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels with APOE genotypes were assessed. RESULTS: The concentration of LDL in the APOE E2 group was significantly lower than those in the APOE E3 and APOE E4 groups, and the GDS scores in the APOE E2 and APOE E3 groups were higher than those in the APOE E4 group. Using partial correlation analysis and controlling the duration of disease and hyperlipidemia, we found that GDS scores were significantly correlated with LDL (r = -0.179, p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: The APOE E2 genotype is associated with more depressive symptoms and lower serum LDL in elderly Chinese schizophrenia patients, and there is a negative correlation between depressive symptoms and LDL.
