24192669|a|BACKGROUND: Presenilin 1 (PS1) mutations associated with familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) generally increase the amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta42) to Abeta40 ratio secreted in cultured cells. Some of these mutants reduce the secretion of Abeta40 rather than increase that of Abeta42. Since it has been difficult to estimate Abeta42 secretion in brains of PS1-FAD patients due to substantial Abeta42 accumulation, it remains unknown whether the enhanced Abeta42 to Abeta40 ratio in brains of FAD patients is caused by elevated Abeta42 secretion or by reduced secretion of Abeta40. OBJECTIVE/METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) of PS1-FAD patients and neurological control patients (controls) were collected. Levels of CSF amyloid precursor-like protein-1-derived Abeta-like peptide (APL1beta), including APL1beta28, an Abeta42 surrogate marker, were quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and Abeta42 secretion in the brain was estimated. RESULTS: The relative ratio of CSF APL1beta28 to total APL1beta was higher in PS1-FAD patients than in controls. Importantly, CSF APL1beta28 was not significantly higher. However, C-terminally shorter CSF APL1beta25 and APL1beta27 were significantly lower in PS1-FAD patients and, as expected, so were CSF Abeta40 and Abeta42. CONCLUSION: A higher relative ratio of the CSF Abeta42 surrogate in PS1-FAD patients is not due to its increase in CSF, suggesting that massive Abeta42 accumulation in the PS1-FAD brain occurs without an apparent increase in Abeta42 secretion.
