39567497|a|Copper (Cu), an indispensable micronutrient for the sustenance of living organisms, contributes significantly to a vast array of fundamental metabolic processes. The human body maintains a relatively low concentration of copper, which is mostly found in the bones, liver, and brain. Despite its low concentration, Cu plays a crucial role as an indispensable element in the progression and pathogenesis of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Extensive studies have been conducted in recent years on copper homeostasis and copper-induced cell death in CNS disorders, including glioma, Alzheimer's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and stroke. Cuproptosis, a novel copper-induced cell death pathway distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis, has been identified as potentially intricately linked to the pathogenic mechanisms underlying various CNS diseases. Therefore, a systematic review of copper homeostasis and cuproptosis and their relationship with CNS disorders could deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases. In addition, it may provide new insights and strategies for the treatment of CNS disorders.
