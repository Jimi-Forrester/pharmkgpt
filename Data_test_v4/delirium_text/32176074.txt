32176074|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive dysfunction, which is mainly manifested as memory impairment and a reduced ability to self-care, often accompanied by neuropsychiatric and behavioral disorders. Donepezil is the second drug to be approved by the US FDA for the treatment of AD. Of the five FDA-approved drugs for AD treatment, donepezil is currently the most widely used. Here, we report an extrapyramidal adverse reaction to donepezil in an elderly patient with AD. PATIENT CONCERNS: An 87-year-old woman presented with a 1-year history of forgetfulness that was aggravated since the past 2 months. She had a long-term history of multiple major conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, and arterial plaques. Brain imaging showed age-related changes, and her Mini Mental State Examination score was 20. Other tests revealed no abnormalities apart from multiple thyroid nodules on ultrasonography. DIAGNOSIS: She was diagnosed with AD, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, diabetic neuropathy, osteoporosis, carotid and lower-extremity arterial plaques, thyroid nodules. INTERVENTIONS: She was treated with donepezil (5 mg/day), amlodipine besylate (5 mg/day), glimepiride (4 mg/day), methylcobalamin (1.5 mg/day), calcium carbonate D3 (600 mg/day), simvastatin (20 mg/day) and enteric-coated aspirin (100 mg/day). OUTCOMES: Four days later, she experienced fatigue, panic, sweating, and one episode of vomiting. On the 5th day, she developed increased muscle tension, speech difficulty, and involuntary tremors. Imaging and blood tests revealed no obvious abnormality, and the patient was not receiving psychotropic drugs. An extrapyramidal adverse reaction to donepezil was considered, and the drug was discontinued, after which the symptoms gradually disappeared. CONCLUSION: Serious adverse reactions to donepezil can occur in elderly patients, who typically require multiple medications for a variety of comorbidities. In particular, extrapyramidal reactions have occurred when donepezil is administered in combination with psychotropic drugs. However, in our patient, an extrapyramidal adverse reaction occurred in the absence of psychotropic drugs. Thus, clinicians must be aware of inter-individual differences in drug actions and possible serious adverse reactions, and carefully monitor these patients to ensure the timely detection of adverse events and their safe treatment.
