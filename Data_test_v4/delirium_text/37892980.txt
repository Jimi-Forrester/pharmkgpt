37892980|a|Approximately 50% of all global blindness is caused by cataract in adults aged >=50 years. The mechanisms of the disease are most arguably related to a redox imbalance and inflammation; therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate the processes associated with inflammation in cataract patients. Twenty-four patients aged 22-60 years (62.5% females) participated in the study, with 33 controls aged 28-60 years (66.7% females). Venous blood serum of the subjects was examined for alpha 1-antitrypsin, as well as selected lysosomal enzymes and adipokines. The activities of lysosomal enzymes, as well as the activity of alpha 1-antitrypsin and the concentrations of c-reactive protein and leptin, were similar in the patients versus the controls. The concentrations of interleukin 6 and resistin were lower, in turn, whereas omentin-1 and adiponectin were higher. Moreover, the study revealed the existence of many linear relationships between the parameters, including multiple linear regression, especially gender-wise. No systemic inflammation was probably noted in the cataract patients tested; nevertheless, the deregulation of adiponectin, omentin-1 and resistin secretion was observed.
