34659361|t|Revisiting Secondary Information Related to Pharmacogenetic Testing.
34659361|a|Incidental or secondary findings have been a major part of the discussion of genomic medicine research and clinical applications. For pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing, secondary findings arise due to the pleiotropic effects of pharmacogenes, often related to their endogenous functions. Unlike the guidelines that have been developed for whole exome or genome sequencing applications for management of secondary findings (though slightly different from PGx testing in that these refer to detection of variants in multiple genes, some with clinical significance and actionability), no corresponding guidelines have been developed for PGx clinical laboratories. Nonetheless, patient and provider education will remain key components of any PGx testing program to minimize adverse responses related to secondary findings.
