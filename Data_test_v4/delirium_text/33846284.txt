33846284|t|Neurocognitive disorders in the elderly: altered functional resting-state hyperconnectivities in postoperative delirium patients.
33846284|a|Postoperative delirium (POD) represents a confusional state during days/weeks after surgery and is particularly frequent in elderly patients. Hardly any fMRI studies were conducted to understand the underlying pathophysiology of POD patients. This prospective observational cohort study aims to examine changes of specific resting-state functional connectivity networks across different time points (pre- and 3-5 months postoperatively) in delirious patients compared to no-POD patients. Two-hundred eighty-three elderly surgical patients underwent preoperative resting-state fMRI (46 POD). One-hundred seventy-eight patients completed postoperative scans (19 POD). For functional connectivity analyses, three functional connectivity networks with seeds located in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and hippocampus were investigated. The relationship of POD and connectivity changes between both time points (course connectivity) were examined (ANOVA). Preoperatively, delirious patients displayed hyperconnectivities across the examined functional connectivity networks. In POD patients, connectivities within NAcc and OFC networks demonstrated a decrease in course connectivity [max. F = 9.03, p = 0.003; F = 4.47, p = 0.036, resp.]. The preoperative hyperconnectivity in the three networks in the patients at risk for developing POD could possibly indicate existing compensation mechanisms for subtle brain dysfunction. The observed pathophysiology of network function in POD patients at least partially involves dopaminergic pathways.
