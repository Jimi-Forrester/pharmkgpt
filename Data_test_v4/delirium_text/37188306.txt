37188306|a|Background and objective: Post-operative pneumonia (POP), a common complication, may be associated with prolonged hospitalization and long-term mortality in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) patients. This study aimed to explore the association between pre-operative prognostic nutrition index (PNI) and POP in aSAH patients. Methods: A total of 280 aSAH patients were enrolled from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital. PNI was calculated as follows: [10 x albumin(gr/dl)] + [0.005 x absolute pre-operative lymphocyte count (per mm3)]. We utilized multivariate analyses, restricted cubic spline, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) to elucidate the role of PNI in POP. Results: Pre-operative PNI levels in the POP group were higher, compared with the non-POP group (41.0 [39.0, 45.4] vs. 44.4 [40.5, 47.3], P = 0.001). When we included PNI as a categorical variable in the multivariate analysis, the levels of PNI were associated with POP (odds ratio, 0.433; 95% confidence interval, 0.253-0.743; P=0.002). In addition, when we included PNI as a continuous variable in the multivariate analysis, the PNI levels were also associated with POP (odds ratio, 0.942; 95% confidence interval, 0.892-0.994; P = 0.028). The level of albumin was also a predictor of the occurrence of POP, with a lower diagnostic power than PNI [AUC: 0.611 (95% confidence interval, 0.549-0.682; P = 0.001) for PNI vs. 0.584 (95% confidence interval, 0.517-0.650; P = 0.017) for albumin]. Multivariable-adjusted spline regression indicated a linear dose-response association between PNI and POP in aSAH participants (P for linearity = 0.027; P for non-linearity = 0.130). Reclassification assessed by IDI and NRI was significantly improved with the addition of PNI to the conventional model of POP in aSAH patients (NRI: 0.322 [0.089-0.555], P = 0.007; IDI: 0.016 [0.001-0.031], P = 0.040). Conclusion: The lower levels of pre-operative PNI may be associated with the higher incidence of POP in aSAH patients. Neurosurgeons are supposed to pay more attention to pre-operative nutrition status in aSAH patients.
