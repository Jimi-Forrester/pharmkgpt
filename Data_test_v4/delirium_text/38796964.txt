38796964|a|Anesthesia and surgery activate matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), leading to blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and postoperative delirium (POD)-like behavior, especially in the elderly. Aged mice received intraperitoneal injections of either the MMP9 inhibitor SB-3CT, melatonin, or solvent, and underwent laparotomy under 3 % sevoflurane anesthesia(anesthesia/surgery). Behavioral tests were performed 24 h pre- and post-operatively. Serum and cortical tissue levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured using ELISA. Levels of PDGFRbeta, MMP9, tight junction, Mfsd2a, caveolin-1, synaptophysin, and postsynaptic densin (PSD)-95 proteins in the prefrontal cortex were assayed using Western blotting. BBB permeability was assessed by detecting IgG in the prefrontal cortex and serum S100beta levels. Anesthesia/surgery-induced peripheral inflammation activated MMP9, which in turn injured pericytes and tight junctions and increased transcytosis, thereby disrupting the BBB. Impaired BBB allowed the migration of peripheral inflammation into the central nervous system (CNS), thereby inducing neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and POD-like behaviors. However, MMP9 inhibition reduced pericyte and tight junction injury and transcytosis, thereby preserving BBB function and preventing the migration of peripheral inflammation into the CNS, thus attenuating synaptic dysfunction and POD-like behavior. In addition, to further validate the above findings, we showed that melatonin exerted similar effects through inhibition of MMP9. The present study shows that after anesthesia/surgery, inflammatory cytokines upregulation is involved in regulating BBB permeability in aged mice through activation of MMP9, suggesting that MMP9 may be a potential target for the prevention of POD.
