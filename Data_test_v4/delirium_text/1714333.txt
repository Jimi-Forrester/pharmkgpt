1714333|t|Axonal transport of two major components of the ubiquitin system: free ubiquitin and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase PGP 9.5.
1714333|a|Ubiquitin (Ub), a stress protein thought to target abnormal proteins for degradation, is present in abnormal structures that occur in neuronal perikarya and axons of degenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease. To begin to assess the role of the Ub system in the axon, we studied expression and axonal transport of Ub and other stress proteins, as well as of Ub carboxyl-terminal hydrolase PGP 9.5, in the rat visual system in normal conditions and following heat-shock (HS). In the retina, both the constitutive and inducible forms of HSPs 70 were expressed under normal conditions, while in the superior colliculus the inducible form was detected only following HS. Ub, PGP 9.5 and HSPs 70 were transported in the axon exclusively with the slow component b (SCb), known to carry cytoskeletal and cytoplasmic proteins. The exceedingly long time needed for stress proteins to reach distant axonal locales at the rate of SCb (approximately 3 mm/day) makes it unlikely that they could contribute significantly to the stress response at those sites.
