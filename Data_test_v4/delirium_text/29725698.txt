29725698|t|SCARF1: a multifaceted, yet largely understudied, scavenger receptor.
29725698|a|BACKGROUND: As is a prerequisite of belonging to the scavenger receptor super family, SCARF1 (scavenger receptor class F, member 1) is known to play a key role in the binding and endocytosis of a wide range of endogenous and exogenous ligands. FINDINGS: Unlike most scavenger receptors, SCARF1 is an essential protein, as SCARF1-deficient mice exhibit a severe resting phenotype in which they develop systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like disease, thus highlighting the importance of SCARF1-mediated clearance of apoptotic host cells in homeostasis. In addition, a number of other roles in homeostasis and disease pathology have also been suggested, including roles in both innate and adaptive immunity; however, the majority of these studies have utilised transfected cell lines engineered to ectopically express SCARF1 and very few have utilised in vivo or ex vivo approaches. CONCLUSION: This review summarises our current knowledge on SCARF1 biology and reflects on future directions for research on this multifaceted, yet largely understudied, scavenger receptor.
