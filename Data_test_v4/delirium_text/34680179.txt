34680179|t|Hyperhomocysteinemia: Metabolic Role and Animal Studies with a Focus on Cognitive Performance and Decline-A Review.
34680179|a|Disturbances in the one-carbon metabolism are often indicated by altered levels of the endogenous amino acid homocysteine (HCys), which is additionally discussed to causally contribute to diverse pathologies. In the first part of the present review, we profoundly and critically discuss the metabolic role and pathomechanisms of HCys, as well as its potential impact on different human disorders. The use of adequate animal models can aid in unravelling the complex pathological processes underlying the role of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCys). Therefore, in the second part, we systematically searched PubMed/Medline for animal studies regarding HHCys and focused on the potential impact on cognitive performance and decline. The majority of reviewed studies reported a significant effect of HHCys on the investigated behavioral outcomes. Despite of persistent controversial discussions about equivocal findings, especially in clinical studies, the present evaluation of preclinical evidence indicates a causal link between HHCys and cognition-related- especially dementia-like disorders, and points out the further urge for large-scale, well-designed clinical studies in order to elucidate the normalization of HCys levels as a potential preventative or therapeutic approach in human pathologies.
