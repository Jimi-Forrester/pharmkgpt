32872557|a|Making decisions regarding return-to-play after sport-related concussion (SRC) based on resolution of symptoms alone can expose contact-sport athletes to further injury before their recovery is complete. Task-related functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) could be used to scan for abnormalities in the brain activation patterns of SRC athletes and help clinicians to manage their return-to-play. This study aims to show a proof of concept of mapping brain activation, using tomographic task-related fNIRS, as part of the clinical assessment of acute SRC patients. A high-density frequency-domain optical device was used to scan 2 SRC patients, within 72 h from injury, during the execution of 3 neurocognitive tests used in clinical practice. The optical data were resolved into a tomographic reconstruction of the brain functional activation pattern, using diffuse optical tomography. Moreover, brain activity was inferred using single-subject statistical analyses. The advantages and limitations of the introduction of this optical technique into the clinical assessment of acute SRC patients are discussed.
