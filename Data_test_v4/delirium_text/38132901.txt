38132901|t|Histamine Receptors: Ex Vivo Functional Studies Enabling the Discovery of Hits and Pathways.
38132901|a|Histamine receptors (HRs) are G-protein-coupled receptors involved in diverse responses triggered by histamine release during inflammation or by encounters with venomous creatures. Four histamine receptors (H1R-H4R) have been cloned and extensively characterized. These receptors are distributed throughout the body and their activation is associated with clinical manifestations such as urticaria (H1R), gastric acid stimulation (H2R), regulation of neurotransmitters in neuronal diseases (H3R), and immune responses (H4R). Despite significant homologous overlap between H3R and H4R, much remains unknown about their precise roles. Even though some drugs have been developed for H1R, H2R, and H3R, not a single H4R antagonist has been approved for clinical use. To enhance our understanding and advance innovative therapeutic targeting of H1R, H2R, H3R, and H4R, we established a robust ex vivo functional platform. This platform features the successful heterologous expression of H1R-H4R in Xenopus laevis oocytes, utilizing an electrophysiological readout. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the function and pharmacological properties of the histamine receptors. Researchers can benefit from the utility of this platform when investigating the effects of histamine receptors and exploring potential therapeutic targets. In doing so, it broadens the horizon of drug discovery, offering new perspectives for therapeutic interventions.
