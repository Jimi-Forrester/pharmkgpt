10532714|t|Weight loss in cancer and Alzheimer's disease is mediated by a similar pathway.
10532714|a|Weight loss, despite adequate caloric intake, occurs in Alzheimer's disease and cancer. Similar alterations of biochemistry accompany the weight loss in both diseases, and this suggests a common pathway of weight loss. If this hypothesis is correct, then drugs that prevent weight loss in cancer should also prevent weight loss in Alzheimer's disease. Megestrol acetate prevents weight loss in human and animal cancers. Omega 3 fatty acids prevent weight loss in animal models of cancer. Both compounds might prevent weight loss in Alzheimer patients.
