The damaged brain cells lead to shrinkage in the size of the brain and it is very difficult to extract the grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM). The segmentation of GM and WM is a challenging task due to its homogeneous nature between the neighborhood tissues. In this proposed system, an attempt has been made to extract GM and WM tissues using optimization-based segmentation techniques.Materials and methods: The optimization method is considered for the classification of normal and alzheimer disease (ad) through magnetic resonance images (mri) using a modified cuckoo search algorithm. Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features are calculated from the extracted GM and WM. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is adopted for selecting the best features from the GLCM features. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a classifier which is used to classify the normal and abnormal images. Results: The proposed optimization algorithm provides most promising and efficient level of image segmentation compared to fuzzy c means (fcm), otsu, particle swarm optimization (pso) and cuckoo search (cs). The modified cuckoo yields high accuracy of 96%, sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 94% than other methods due to its powerful searching potential for the proper identification of gray and WM tissues.Conclusions: The results of the classification process proved the effectiveness of the proposed technique in identifying alzheimer affected patients due to its very strong optimization ability. The proposed pipeline helps to diagnose early detection of AD and better assessment of the neuroprotective effect of a therapy.
