23541188|t|The neuropsychology of normal aging and preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
23541188|a|OBJECTIVE: A National Institute on Aging-sponsored work group on preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) articulated the need to characterize cognitive differences between normal aging and preclinical AD. METHODS: Seventy-one apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 homozygotes, 194 epsilon3/epsilon4 heterozygotes, and 356 epsilon4 noncarriers age 21 to 87 years who were cognitively healthy underwent neuropsychological testing every 2 years. Longitudinal trajectories of test scores were compared between APOE subgroups. RESULTS: There was a significant effect of age on all cognitive domains in both APOE epsilon4 carriers and noncarriers. A significant effect of APOE epsilon4 gene dose was confined to the memory domain and the Dementia Rating Scale. Cross-sectional comparisons did not discriminate the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although cognitive aging patterns are similar in APOE epsilon4 carriers and noncarriers, preclinical AD is characterized by a significant epsilon4 gene dose effect that impacts memory and is detectable longitudinally. Preclinical neuropsychological testing strategies should emphasize memory-sensitive measures and longitudinal design.
