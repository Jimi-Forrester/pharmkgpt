37590980|t|Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health: Consensus Bundle on Sepsis in Obstetric Care.
37590980|a|Sepsis in obstetric care is one of the leading causes of maternal death in the United States, with Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native obstetric patients experiencing sepsis at disproportionately higher rates. State maternal mortality review committees have determined that deaths are preventable much of the time and are caused by delays in recognition, treatment, and escalation of care. The "Sepsis in Obstetric Care" patient safety bundle provides guidance for health care teams to develop coordinated, multidisciplinary care for pregnant and postpartum people by preventing infection and recognizing and treating infection early to prevent progression to sepsis. This is one of several core patient safety bundles developed by AIM (the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health) to provide condition- or event-specific clinical practices that should be implemented in all appropriate care settings. As with other bundles developed by AIM, the "Sepsis in Obstetric Care" patient safety bundle is organized into five domains: Readiness, Recognition and Prevention, Response, Reporting and Systems Learning, and Respectful, Equitable, and Supportive Care. The Respectful, Equitable, and Supportive Care domain provides essential best practices to support respectful, equitable, and supportive care to all patients. Further health equity considerations are integrated into the elements of each domain.
