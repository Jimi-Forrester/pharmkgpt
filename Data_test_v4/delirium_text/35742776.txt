35742776|t|How Diabetes and Other Comorbidities of Elderly Patients and Their Treatment Influence Levels of Glycation Products.
35742776|a|Medical care for geriatric patients is a great challenge, mainly due to various overlapping deficits relevant to numerous coexisting diseases, of which the most common are diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. In the case of diabetes, the glycation process is intensified, which accelerates atherosclerosis development and diabetic complications. Our goal was to investigate the relationship between the classical biochemical parameters of diabetes and atherosclerosis, as well as parameters which may indicate a nephropathy, and the parameters strictly related to glycation, taking into account the pharmacological treatment of patients. Methods: We analyzed the patients' serum concentrations of fluorescent glycation product-pentosidine, concentrations of soluble receptors for advanced glycation products (sRAGE), lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1), galectin 3 (GAL3), scavenger receptor class A (SR-A), and scavenger receptor class B (SR-BI), as well as the level of lipid peroxidation and free amine content. Among the identified correlations, the most interesting are the following: sRAGE with triglycerides (r = 0.47, p = 0.009), sRAGE with SR-BI (r = 0.47, p = 0.013), SR-BI with LOX-1 (r = 0.31, p = 0.013), and SR-BI with HDL (r = -0.30, p = 0.02). It has been shown that pentosidine and reactive free amine contents are significantly higher in elderly patients with ischemic heart disease. Pentosidine is also significantly higher in patients with arterial hypertension. Malondialdehyde turned out to be higher in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 that was not treated with insulin or metformin than in those treated with both medications (p = 0.052). GAL3 was found to be lower both in persons without diabetes and in diabetics treated with metformin (p = 0.005). LOX-1 was higher in diabetic patients not treated with metformin or insulin, and lowest in diabetics treated with both insulin and metformin, with the effect of metformin reducing LOX-1 levels (p = 0.039). Our results were the basis for a discussion about the diagnostic value in the clinical practice of LOX-1 and GAL3 in geriatric patients with diabetes and also provide grounds for inferring the therapeutic benefits of insulin and metformin treatment.
