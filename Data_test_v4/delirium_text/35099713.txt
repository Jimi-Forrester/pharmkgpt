35099713|t|The Effect of Hyperoxemia on Neurological Outcomes of Adult Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
35099713|a|Hyperoxemia commonly occurs in clinical practice and is often left untreated. Many studies have shown increased mortality in patients with hyperoxemia, but data on neurological outcome in these patients are conflicting, despite worsened neurological outcome found in preclinical studies. To investigate the association between hyperoxemia and neurological outcome in adult patients, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to May 2020 for observational studies correlating arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) with neurological status in adults hospitalized with acute conditions. Studies of chronic pulmonary disease or hyperbaric oxygenation were excluded. Relative risks (RRs) were pooled at the study level by using a random-effects model to compare the risk of poor neurological outcome in patients with hyperoxemia and patients without hyperoxemia. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses and assessments of publication bias and risk of bias were performed. Maximum and mean PaO2 in patients with favorable and unfavorable outcomes were compared using standardized mean difference (SMD). Of 6255 records screened, 32 studies were analyzed. Overall, hyperoxemia was significantly associated with an increased risk of poor neurological outcome (RR 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.23, statistical heterogeneity I2 58.8%, 22 studies). The results were robust across sensitivity analyses. Patients with unfavorable outcome also showed a significantly higher maximum PaO2 (SMD 0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.30, I2 78.4%, 15 studies) and mean PaO2 (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.04-0.45, I2 91.0%, 13 studies). These associations were pronounced in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.14-1.56) and ischemic stroke (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.14-1.74), but not in patients with cardiac arrest, traumatic brain injury, or following cardiopulmonary bypass. Hyperoxemia is associated with poor neurological outcome, especially in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and ischemic stroke. Although our study cannot establish causality, PaO2 should be monitored closely because hyperoxemia may be associated with worsened patient outcome and consequently affect the patient's quality of life.
