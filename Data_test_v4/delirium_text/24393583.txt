24393583|a|Salvia miltiorrhiza (danshen) is widely used for the clinical treatment of cerebral ischemia and cardiovascular diseases. Its diverse molecular makeup of simple and poly hydroxycinnamic acids and diterpenoid quinones are also associated with its beneficial health effects such as improved cognitive deficits in mice, protection of neuronal cells, prevention of amyloid fibril formation and preformed amyloid fibril disaggregation related to Alzheimer's disease. Whilst the in vitro studies have therapeutic promise, the anti-dementia effect/impact of danshen however depends on its absorbed constituents and pharmacokinetic properties. Both the water and lipid danshen fractions have been shown to have low oral bioavailability and at physiological pH, the polyphenolic carboxylate anions are not brain permeable. To tap into the many neuroprotective and other biological benefits of danshen, the key challenge resides in developing danshen nanopharmaceuticals, semi-synthetic pro-drug forms of its constituents to improve its biocompatability, that is, absorption, circulation in bloodstream and optimization of BBB permeability.
