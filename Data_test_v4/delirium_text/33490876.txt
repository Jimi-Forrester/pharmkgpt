33490876|t|Management and Prevention of Cerebrovascular Accidents in SARS-CoV-2-Positive Patients Recovering from COVID-19: a Case Report and Review of Literature.
33490876|a|We discuss the current understanding of COVID-19's neurological implications, their basis, and the evolving clinical consensus with a focus on cerebrovascular stroke. We further illustrate the potential significance of these implications with the aid of an accompanying case report outlining the disease course and treatment of a COVID-19 patient suffering from ischemic stroke and pulmonary embolism. The ever-growing strain on the global healthcare system due to the spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 requires focused attention on urgent care of independent, coexisting, and associated comorbidities, including cerebrovascular accidents. For illustration purposes, we outline the case of a 68-year-old female presenting with COVID-19 subsequently complicated by bilateral pulmonary embolism and a right-sided cerebrovascular accident. The patient was successfully managed pharmacologically and discharged without significant neurological deficit. The evidence for a hypercoagulable state in this patient along with discussion of mechanistic bases, corroborative evidence from the literature, along with relevant guidance on screening, treatment, and prophylaxis is offered. Greater study of the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related cerebrovascular complications and revisiting current guidelines on their management including potentially heightened levels of thromboprophylaxis are warranted.
