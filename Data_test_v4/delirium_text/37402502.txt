37402502|a|AIM: This study identified the correlates of delirium care competency among shift leader nurses in acute medical wards in Japan. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2019 to February 2020. We sent request letters to a random sample of 381 general acute care hospitals in Japan. Of these, 68 agreed to participate and distributed 735 self-administered questionnaires to shift leader nurses working in their acute medical wards. The questionnaire included the Self-rated Delirium Care Competency Scale for Shift Leader Nurses in Acute Medical Wards (DCSL-M), developed by the authors. It gathered data on the respondents' demographics and delirium care competency, and investigated a total of 25 variables. We calculated descriptive statistics and examined associations between delirium care competency and the demographics using multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of the total, 301 (40.9%) questionnaires were returned. Delirium care competency was high among shift leader nurses who: (1) had experience as a clinical practice preceptor for nursing students; (2) had experience attending training related to dementia or delirium care; (3) worked at a hospital/ward that charged additional medical fees for dementia care; and (4) had access to consulting psychiatrists to refer patients with delirium. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest the need for efforts to improve delirium care competency among shift leader nurses who work in hospitals that do not charge additional medical fees for dementia care or that do not have consulting psychiatrists to refer patients with delirium.
