29391755|t|circRNA_0046366 inhibits hepatocellular steatosis by normalization of PPAR signaling.
29391755|a|AIM: To investigate micro (mi)R-34a-antagonizing circular (circ)RNA that underlies hepatocellular steatosis. METHODS: The effect of circRNA on miR-34a was recognized by the miRNA response element (MRE), and validated by the dual-luciferase reporter assay. Its association with hepatocellular steatosis was investigated in HepG2-based hepatocellular steatosis induced by free fatty acids (FFAs; 2:1 oleate:palmitate) stimulation. After normalization of the steatosis-related circRNA by expression vector, analysis of miR-34a activity, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha level, and expression of downstream genes were carried out so as to reveal its impact on the miR-34a/PPARalpha regulatory system. Both triglyceride (TG) assessment and cytopathological manifestations uncovered the role of circRNA in miR-34a-dependent hepatosteatogenesis. RESULTS: Bioinformatic and functional analysis verified circRNA_0046366 to antagonize the activity of miR-34a via MRE-based complementation. In contrast to its lowered level during FFA-induced hepatocellular steatosis, circRNA_0046366 up-regulation abolished the miR-34a-dependent inhibition of PPARalpha that played a critical role in metabolic signaling pathways. PPARalpha restoration exerted transcriptional improvement to multiple genes responsible for lipid metabolism. TG-specific lipolytic genes [carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) and solute-carrier family 27A (SLC27A)] among these showed significant increase in their expression levels. The circRNA_0046366-related rebalancing of lipid homeostasis led to dramatic reduction of TG content, and resulted in the ameliorated phenotype of hepatocellular steatosis. CONCLUSION: Dysregulation of circRNA_0046366/miR-34a/PPARalpha signaling may be a novel epigenetic mechanism underlying hepatocellular steatosis. circRNA_0046366 serves as a potential target for the treatment of hepatic steatosis.
