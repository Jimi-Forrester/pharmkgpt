35449173|a|Repurposing FDA-approved drugs is an efficient and cost-effective approach in the development of therapeutics for a broad range of diseases. However, prediction of function can be challenging, especially in the brain. We screened a small-molecule library with FDA-approved drugs for effects on behavior. The studies were carried out using zebrafish larvae, imaged in a 384-well format. We found that various drugs affect activity, habituation, startle responses, excitability, and optomotor responses. The changes in behavior were organized in behavioral profiles, which were examined by hierarchical cluster analysis. One of the identified clusters includes the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK506), which are immunosuppressants and potential therapeutics in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease. The calcineurin inhibitors form a functional cluster with seemingly unrelated drugs, including bromocriptine, tetrabenazine, rosiglitazone, nebivolol, sorafenib, cabozantinib, tamoxifen, meclizine, and salmeterol. We propose that drugs with 'CsA-type' behavioral profiles are promising candidates for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
