37239991|a|The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment analyzes the health and quality of life of the elderly. Basic and instrumental daily activities may be compromised due to neuroimmunoendocrine changes, and studies suggest that possible immunological changes occur during infections in the elderly. Thus, this study aimed to analyze cytokine and melatonin levels in serum and correlate the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment in elderly patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sample consisted of 73 elderly individuals, 43 of whom were without infection and 30 of whom had positive diagnoses of COVID-19. Blood samples were collected to quantify cytokines by flow cytometry and melatonin by ELISA. In addition, structured and validated questionnaires were applied to assess basic (Katz) and instrumental (Lawton and Brody) activities. There was an increase in IL-6, IL-17, and melatonin in the group of elderly individuals with infection. In addition, a positive correlation was observed between melatonin and IL-6 and IL-17 in elderly patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, there was a reduction in the score of the Lawton and Brody Scale in the infected elderly. These data suggest that the melatonin hormone and inflammatory cytokines are altered in the serum of the elderly with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, there is a degree of dependence, mainly regarding the performance of daily instrumental activities, in the elderly. The considerable impact on the elderly person's ability to perform everyday tasks necessary for independent living is an extremely important result, and changes in cytokines and melatonin probably are associated with alterations in these daily activities of the elderly.
