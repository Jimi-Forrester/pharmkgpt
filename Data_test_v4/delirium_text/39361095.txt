39361095|t|Discovering Effective Chiral Dipeptides against Abeta(1-42) Aggregation by the Computational Screening Strategy.
39361095|a|The beta-sheet-breaker (BSB) peptides inhibiting amyloidogenic aggregation have been extensively studied. However, the inhibition efficacy of ultrashort chiral dipeptides remains inadequately understood. In this study, we proposed a computational screening strategy to identify chiral dipeptides as BSB with optimal antiaggregation performance against Abeta(1-42) aggregation. We constructed a complete dipeptide library encompassing all possible chiral sequence arrangements and then filtered the library by cascaded molecular docking-molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Our screening strategy discovered dipeptide DWDP (superscript for chirality) that displayed strong interactions with Abeta fibrils and inhibitory effects on Abeta aggregation, validated by subsequent experiments. Mechanistic investigation by both MD and replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations revealed that DWDP interacts with Abeta by hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonds and thus inhibits Abeta intermolecular contacts and salt bridge formation, therefore inhibiting Abeta aggregation and disrupting Abeta aggregates. Totally, our strategy presents a viable approach to discover potential dipeptides with effective antiaggregation ability as potential therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease.
