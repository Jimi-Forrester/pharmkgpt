37786692|t|A Humanized Yeast System for Evaluating the Protein Prenylation of a Wide Range of Human and Viral CaaX Sequences.
37786692|a|The C-terminal CaaX sequence (cysteine-aliphatic-aliphatic-any of several amino acids) is subject to isoprenylation on the conserved cysteine and is estimated to occur in 1-2% of proteins within yeast and human proteomes. Recently, non-canonical CaaX sequences in addition to shorter and longer length CaX and CaaaX sequences have been identified that can be prenylated. Much of the characterization of prenyltransferases has relied on the yeast system because of its genetic tractability and availability of reporter proteins, such as the a -factor mating pheromone, Ras GTPase, and Ydj1 Hsp40 chaperone. To compare the properties of yeast and human prenyltransferases, including the recently expanded target specificity of yeast farnesyltransferase, we have developed yeast strains that express human farnesyltransferase or geranylgeranyltransferase-I in lieu of their yeast counterparts. The humanized yeast strains display robust prenyltransferase activity that functionally replaces yeast prenyltransferase activity in a wide array of tests, including the prenylation of a wide variety of canonical and non-canonical human CaaX sequences, virus encoded CaaX sequences, non-canonical length sequences, and heterologously expressed human proteins HRas and DNAJA2. These results reveal highly overlapping substrate specificity for yeast and human farnesyltransferase, and mostly overlapping substrate specificity for GGTase-I. This yeast system is a valuable tool for further defining the prenylome of humans and other organisms, identifying proteins for which prenylation status has not yet been determined. Summary Statement: We report yeast engineered to express human prenylation enzymes with which prenylation can be investigated for established and novel CaaX sequences associated with proteins involved in human disease.
