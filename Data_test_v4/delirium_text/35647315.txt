35647315|t|Prevalence, risk factors, and long-term outcomes of cerebral ischemia in hospitalized COVID-19 patients - study rationale and protocol of the CORONIS study: A multicentre prospective cohort study.
35647315|a|Background: COVID-19 is often complicated by thrombo-embolic events including ischemic stroke. The underlying mechanisms of COVID-19-associated ischemic stroke, the incidence and risk factors of silent cerebral ischemia, and the long-term functional outcome in these patients are currently unknown. Patients and methods: CORONavirus and Ischemic Stroke (CORONIS) is a multicentre prospective cohort study investigating the prevalence, risk factors and long-term incidence of (silent) cerebral ischemia, and the long-term functional outcome among patients with COVID-19. We aim to include 200 adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 without symptomatic ischemic stroke to investigate the prevalence of silent cerebral ischemia compared with 60 (matched) controls with MRI. In addition, we will identify potential risk factors and/or causes of cerebral ischemia in COVID-19 patients with (n = 70) or without symptomatic stroke (n = 200) by means of blood sampling, cardiac workup and brain MRI. We will measure functional outcome and cognitive function after 3 and 12 months with standardized questionnaires in all patients with COVID-19. Finally, the long-term incidence of (new) silent cerebral ischemia in patients with COVID-19 will be assessed with follow up MRI (n = 120). Summary: The CORONIS study is designed to add further insight into the prevalence, long-term incidence and risk factors of cerebral ischemia, and the long-term functional outcome in hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19.
