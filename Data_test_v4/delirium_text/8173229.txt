8173229|t|Autopsy findings in patients with mental handicap.
8173229|a|Autopsies were carried out on 60 mentally handicapped patients and the brain was examined in detail in all cases. The clinical records were studied and correlated with the pathological findings. A variety of pathological changes were found in the central nervous system, and there was a high incidence of microcephaly and gross abnormalities among the patients with epilepsy and neurological dysfunction. The incidence of Alzheimer's disease was very high among patients with Down's syndrome, but in those patients without Down's syndrome, the incidence appeared to be much the same as in the general population. The most common cause of death was respiratory disease, followed by cardiovascular disease. There was a high incidence of volvulus among the group with epilepsy. The findings are discussed, and reference made to the long-term care of the mentally handicapped. The study demonstrates the importance of the autopsy in terms of furthering knowledge in the field of mental handicap.
