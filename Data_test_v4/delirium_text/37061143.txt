37061143|t|Alcohol and Immunology: Mechanisms of multi-organ damage. Summary of the 2022 alcohol and Immunology research interest group (AIRIG) meeting.
37061143|a|On October 26th, 2022 the annual Alcohol and Immunology Research Interest Group (AIRIG) meeting was held as a satellite symposium at the annual meeting of the Society for Leukocyte Biology in Hawaii. The 2022 meeting focused broadly on the immunological consequences of acute, chronic, and prenatal alcohol exposure and how these contribute to damage in multiple organs and tissues. These included alcohol-induced neuroinflammation, impaired lung immunity, intestinal dysfunction, and decreased anti-microbial and anti-viral responses. In addition, research presented covered multiple pathways behind alcohol-induced cellular dysfunction, including mitochondrial metabolism, cellular bioenergetics, gene regulation, and epigenetics. Finally, the work presented highlighted potential biomarkers and novel avenues of treatment for alcohol-induced organ damage.
