38045237|t|Sex differences in brain transcriptomes of juvenile Cynomolgus macaques.
38045237|a|Background: Behavioral, social, and physical characteristics are posited to distinguish the sexes, yet research on transcription-level sexual differences in the brain is limited. Here, we investigated sexually divergent brain transcriptomics in prepubertal cynomolgus macaques, a commonly used surrogate species to humans. Methods: A transcriptomic profile using RNA sequencing was generated for the temporal lobe, ventral midbrain, and cerebellum of 3 female and 3 male cynomolgus macaques previously treated with an Adeno-associated virus vector mix. Statistical analyses to determine differentially expressed protein-coding genes in all three lobes were conducted using DeSeq2 with a false discovery rate corrected P value of .05. Results: We identified target genes in the temporal lobe, ventral midbrain, and cerebellum with functions in translation, immunity, behavior, and neurological disorders that exhibited statistically significant sexually divergent expression. Conclusions: We provide potential mechanistic insights to the epidemiological differences observed between the sexes with regards to mental health and infectious diseases, such as COVID19. Our results provide pre-pubertal information on sexual differences in non-human primate brain transcriptomics and may provide insight to health disparities between the biological sexes in humans.
