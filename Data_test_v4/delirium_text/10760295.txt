10760295|a|Induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1) triggers cell growth arrest associated with senescence and damage response. Overexpression of p21 from an inducible promoter in a human cell line induces growth arrest and phenotypic features of senescence. cDNA array hybridization showed that p21 expression selectively inhibits a set of genes involved in mitosis, DNA replication, segregation, and repair. The kinetics of inhibition of these genes on p21 induction parallels the onset of growth arrest, and their reexpression on release from p21 precedes the reentry of cells into cell cycle, indicating that inhibition of cell-cycle progression genes is a mechanism of p21-induced growth arrest. p21 also up-regulates multiple genes that have been associated with senescence or implicated in age-related diseases, including atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, amyloidosis, and arthritis. Most of the tested p21-induced genes were not activated in cells that had been growth arrested by serum starvation, but some genes were induced in both forms of growth arrest. Several p21-induced genes encode secreted proteins with paracrine effects on cell growth and apoptosis. In agreement with the overexpression of such proteins, conditioned media from p21-induced cells were found to have antiapoptotic and mitogenic activity. These results suggest that the effects of p21 induction on gene expression in senescent cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of cancer and age-related diseases.
