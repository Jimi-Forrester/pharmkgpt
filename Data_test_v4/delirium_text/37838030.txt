37838030|t|Long-term particulate matter exposure and the risk of neurological hospitalization: Evidence from causal inference of a large longitudinal cohort in South China.
37838030|a|With limited evidence on the neurological impact of particulate matter (PM) exposure in China, particularly for PM1 which is smaller but more toxic, we conducted a large Chinese cohort study using causal inference approaches to comprehensively clarify such impact. A total of 36,271 participants in southern China were recruited in 2015 and followed up through 2020. We obtained the neurological hospitalizations records by linking the cohort data to the electronic reports from 418 medical institutions across the study area. By using high-resolution PM concentrations from satellite-based spatiotemporal models and the cohort data, we performed marginal structural Cox models under causal assumptions to assess the potential causal links between time-varying PM exposure and neurological hospitalizations. Our findings indicated that increasing PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations by 1 mug/m3 were associated with higher overall neurological hospitalization risks, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.10 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.16), 1.09 (95% CI 1.04-1.14), and 1.03 (95% CI 1.00-1.06), respectively. PM1 appeared to have a stronger effect on neurological hospitalization, with a 1% and 7% higher impact compared to PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. Additionally, each 1-mug/m3 increase in the annual PM1 concentration was associated with an elevated risk of hospitalizations for ischemic stroke (HR: 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06-1.26), which tended to be larger than the estimates for PM2.5 (HR: 1.13, 95% CI, 1.04-1.23) and PM10 (HR: 1.05, 95% CI, 1.00-1.09). Furthermore, never-married or female individuals tended be at a greater risk compared with their counterparts. Our study provides important insights into the health impact of particles, particularly smaller particles, on neurological hospitalization risk and highlights the need for clean-air policies that specifically target these particles.
