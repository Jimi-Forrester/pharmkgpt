32902340|a|Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is important in monitoring energy homeostasis and cancer cachexia. Different from white adipose tissue, BAT is characterized by the presence of a large number of mitochondria in adipocytes. Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), a critical transporter, is expressed in the outer membrane of mitochondria. We speculated that [18F]DPA714, a specific TSPO tracer, may monitor BAT activity in tumor-bearing mice in vivo. We first analyzed the radioactive uptake of positron emission tomography (PET) tracers in BAT of CT26 xenograft mice with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) and [18F]DPA714. We also studied the BAT uptake of [18F]DPA714 in CT26, A549 and LLC tumor models. The dynamic distribution of [18F]FDG is quite variable among animals, even in mice of the same tumor model (%ID/g-mean: mean +- SDM, 8.61 +- 8.90, n = 16). Contrarily, [18F]DPA714 produced high-quality and stable BAT imaging in different tumor models and different animals of the same model. Interestingly, %ID/g-mean of [18F]DPA714 in BAT was significantly higher on day 26 than that on day 7 in CT26 xenograft model. Taken together, these results strongly indicate the potential feasibility of [18F]DPA714 PET imaging in investigating BAT and energy metabolism during tumor progression in preclinical and clinical study.
