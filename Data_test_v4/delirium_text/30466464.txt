30466464|t|GSK3beta-mediated tau hyperphosphorylation triggers diabetic retinal neurodegeneration by disrupting synaptic and mitochondrial functions.
30466464|a|BACKGROUND: Although diabetic retinopathy (DR) has long been considered as a microvascular disorder, mounting evidence suggests that diabetic retinal neurodegeneration, in particular synaptic loss and dysfunction of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) may precede retinal microvascular changes. Key molecules involved in this process remain poorly defined. The microtubule-associated protein tau is a critical mediator of neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, the effect of tau, if any, in the context of diabetes-induced retinal neurodegeneration has yet to be ascertained. Here, we investigate the changes and putative roles of endogeneous tau in diabetic retinal neurodegeneration. METHODS: To this aim, we combine clinically used electrophysiological techniques, i.e. pattern electroretinogram and visual evoked potential, and molecular analyses in a well characterized high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mouse diabetes model in vivo and primary retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in vitro. RESULTS: We demonstrate for the first time that tau hyperphosphorylation via GSK3beta activation causes vision deficits and synapse loss of RGCs in HFD-induced DR, which precedes retinal microvasculopathy and RGCs apoptosis. Moreover, intravitreal administration of an siRNA targeting to tau or a specific inhibitor of GSK3beta reverses synapse loss and restores visual function of RGCs by attenuating tau hyperphosphorylation within a certain time frame of DR. The cellular mechanisms by which hyperphosphorylated tau induces synapse loss of RGCs upon glucolipotoxicity include i) destabilizing microtubule tracks and impairing microtubule-dependent synaptic targeting of cargoes such as mRNA and mitochondria; ii) disrupting synaptic energy production through mitochondria in a GSK3beta-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our study proposes mild retinal tauopathy as a new pathophysiological model for DR and tau as a novel therapeutic target to counter diabetic RGCs neurodegeneration occurring before retinal vasculature abnormalities.
