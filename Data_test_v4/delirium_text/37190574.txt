37190574|t|Clinical Evaluation of Sleep Disorders in Parkinson's Disease.
37190574|a|The paradigm of the framing of Parkinson's disease (PD) has undergone significant revision in recent years, making this neurodegenerative disease a multi-behavioral disorder rather than a purely motor disease. PD affects not only the "classic" substantia nigra at the subthalamic nuclei level but also the nerve nuclei, which are responsible for sleep regulation. Sleep disturbances are the clinical manifestations of Parkinson's disease that most negatively affect the quality of life of patients and their caregivers. First-choice treatments for Parkinson's disease determine amazing effects on improving motor functions. However, it is still little known whether they can affect the quantity and quality of sleep in these patients. In this perspective article, we will analyze the treatments available for this specific clinical setting, hypothesizing a therapeutic approach in relation to neurodegenerative disease state.
