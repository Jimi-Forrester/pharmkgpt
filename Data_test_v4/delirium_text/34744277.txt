34744277|t|ANALGESIC EFFECT OF TRAMADOL IS NOT ALTERED BY POSTOPERATIVE SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION AFTER MAJOR ABDOMINAL SURGERY.
34744277|a|Tramadol is a commonly used analgesic in intensive care units (ICUs) for acute postoperative pain. Conversion of tramadol into active metabolites may be impaired in inflammatory states. Catechol-O-methyltransferase may influence pain. The aim of the study was to examine differences in the analgesic effect of tramadol between ICU patients with and without signs of systemic inflammation. Forty-three patients were admitted to ICU after a major abdominal surgery. The patients received a dose of 100 mg of tramadol intravenously every 6 hours during the first 24 hours after surgical procedure. Pain scores were measured by the Numeric Rating Scale before and 30 minutes after tramadol administration in awake patients. Systemic inflammation was considered when at least two of the following postoperative parameters were present in the first 24 hours of ICU admission: fever or hypothermia, tachycardia, pCO2 <4.3 kPa, white blood cells >12000/mm3 or <4000/mm3, or preoperative value of C-reactive protein (CRP) >50 mg/L or/and procalcitonin (PCT) >0.5 mg/L. Catechol-O-methyltransferase was analyzed postoperatively. Fifteen (34.8%) patients met the criteria for systemic inflammation. Tramadol was proven to be an effective analgesic for the treatment of postoperative pain regardless of the presence of systemic inflammation (p<0.05). Lower perception of pain before tramadol application was observed in patients with systemic inflammation, but the difference was not significant. A negative correlation was observed between the preoperative values of CRP and PCT and the analgesic effect of tramadol assessed at the second measurement point (r=-0.358, p=0.03, and r=-0.364, p=0.02, respectively). Catechol-O-methyltransferase variants were not in correlation with pain and opioid consumption. Based on our findings, tramadol is effective in lowering pain scores after major abdominal surgery irrespective of the presence of systemic inflammation.
