25573162|t|Heteromers of amyloid precursor protein in cerebrospinal fluid.
25573162|a|BACKGROUND: Soluble fragments of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) generated by alpha- and beta-secretases, sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta, have been postulated as promising new cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the capacity of these soluble proteins to assemble has not been explored and could be relevant. Our aim is to characterize possible sAPP oligomers that could contribute to the quantification of sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta in CSF by ELISA, as well as to characterize the possible presence of soluble full-length APP (sAPPf). RESULTS: We employed co-immunoprecipitation, native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation in sucrose density gradients to characterize sAPP oligomers in CSF. We have characterized the presence of sAPPf in CSF from NDC and AD subjects and demonstrated that all forms, including sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta, are capable of assembling into heteromers, which differ from brain APP membrane-dimers. We measured sAPPf, sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta by ELISA in CSF samples from AD (n = 13) and non-disease subjects (NDC, n = 13) before and after immunoprecipitation with antibodies against the C-terminal APP or against sAPPbeta. We demonstrated that these sAPP heteromers participate in the quantification of sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta by ELISA. Immunoprecipitation with a C-terminal antibody to remove sAPPf reduced by ~30% the determinations of sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta by ELISA, whereas immunoprecipitation with an APPbeta antibody reduced by ~80% the determination of sAPPf and sAPPalpha. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of sAPPf and sAPP heteromers should be taken into consideration when exploring the levels of sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta as potential CSF biomarkers.
