35928592|t|Reversible splenial lesion syndrome (RESLES): Two patients as study cases.
35928592|a|Reversible splenial injury syndrome (RESLES) is a rare clinicoradiological entity that defines a reversible lesion in the splenium of the callosum in magnetic resonance imaging. RESLES may be of infectious iatrogenic or metabolic origin. We report 2 cases of drug induced RESLES in our training. The presence of an isolated lesion of the corpus callosum in a context of polymedication by psychotropic drugs and the regression in less than 4 weeks suggests a toxic origin, in particular medicinal. The pathophysiology of these reversibles lesions of the splenium of callosum is not very clear, most often it is a phenomenon of vasogenic edema that is evoked, the clinical symptoms are very varied and nonspecific, and the prognosis is generally good in the absence of underlying disorder.
