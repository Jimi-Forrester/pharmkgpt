39001624|a|INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to explore the potential of whole brain white matter patterns as novel neuroimaging biomarkers for assessing cognitive impairment and disability in older adults. METHODS: We conducted an in-depth analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scans in 454 participants, focusing on white matter patterns and white matter inter-subject variability (WM-ISV). RESULTS: The white matter pattern ensemble model, combining MRI and amyloid PET, demonstrated a significantly higher classification performance for cognitive impairment and disability. Participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibited higher WM-ISV than participants with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and vascular dementia. Furthermore, WM-ISV correlated significantly with blood-based biomarkers (such as glial fibrillary acidic protein and phosphorylated tau-217 [p-tau217]), and cognitive function and disability scores. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that white matter pattern analysis has significant potential as an adjunct neuroimaging biomarker for clinical decision-making and determining cognitive impairment and disability. HIGHLIGHTS: The ensemble model combined both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and demonstrated a significantly higher classification performance for cognitive impairment and disability. Alzheimer's disease (AD) revealed a notably higher heterogeneity compared to that in subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, or vascular dementia. White matter inter-subject variability (WM-ISV) was significantly correlated with blood-based biomarkers (glial fibrillary acidic protein and phosphorylated tau-217 [p-tau217]) and with the polygenic risk score for AD. White matter pattern analysis has significant potential as an adjunct neuroimaging biomarker for clinical decision-making processes and determining cognitive impairment and disability.
