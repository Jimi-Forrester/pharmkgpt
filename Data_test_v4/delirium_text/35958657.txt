35958657|t|Altered voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity in right temporal lobe epilepsy as measured using resting-state fMRI and support vector machine analyses.
35958657|a|Background: Prior reports revealed abnormalities in voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) when analyzing neuroimaging data from patients with various psychiatric conditions, including temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Whether these VHMC changes can be leveraged to aid in the diagnosis of right TLE (rTLE), however, remains to be established. This study was thus developed to examine abnormal VMHC findings associated with rTLE to determine whether these changes can be used to guide rTLE diagnosis. Methods: The resultant imaging data of resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) analyses of 59 patients with rTLE and 60 normal control individuals were analyzed using VMHC and support vector machine (SVM) approaches. Results: Relative to normal controls, patients with rTLE were found to exhibit decreased VMHC values in the bilateral superior and the middle temporal pole (STP and MTP), the bilateral middle and inferior temporal gyri (MTG and ITG), and the bilateral orbital portion of the inferior frontal gyrus (OrbIFG). These patients further exhibited increases in VMHC values in the bilateral precentral gyrus (PreCG), the postcentral gyrus (PoCG), and the supplemental motor area (SMA). The ROC curve of MTG VMHC values showed a great diagnostic efficacy in the diagnosis of rTLE with AUCs, sensitivity, specificity, and optimum cutoff values of 0.819, 0.831, 0.717, and 0.465. These findings highlight the value of the right middle temporal gyrus (rMTG) when differentiating between rTLE and control individuals, with a corresponding SVM analysis yielding respective accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values of 70.59% (84/119), 78.33% (47/60), and 69.49% (41/59). Conclusion: In summary, patients with rTLE exhibit various forms of abnormal functional connectivity, and SVM analyses support the potential value of abnormal VMHC values as a neuroimaging biomarker that can aid in the diagnosis of this condition.
