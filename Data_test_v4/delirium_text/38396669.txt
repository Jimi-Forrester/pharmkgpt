38396669|t|Altered N6-Methyladenosine Modification Patterns and Transcript Profiles Contributes to Cognitive Dysfunction in High-Fat Induced Diabetic Mice.
38396669|a|N6-methyladenosine (m6A) constitutes the paramount post-transcriptional modification within eukaryotic mRNA. This modification is subjected to stimulus-dependent regulation within the central nervous system of mammals, being influenced by sensory experiences, learning processes, and injuries. The patterns of m6A methylation within the hippocampal region of diabetes cognitive impairment (DCI) has not been investigated. A DCI model was established by feeding a high-fat diet to C57BL/6J mice. m6A and RNA sequencing was conducted to profile the m6A-tagged transcripts in the hippocampus. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation with next-generation sequencing and RNA sequencing analyses yielded differentially m6A-modified and expressed genes in the hippocampus of DCI mice, which were enriched in pathways involving synaptic transmission and axonal guidance. Mechanistic analyses revealed a remarkable change in m6A modification levels through alteration of the mRNA expression of m6A methyltransferases (METTL3 and METTL14) and demethylase (FTO) in the hippocampus of DCI mice. We identified a co-mediated specific RNA regulatory strategy that broadens the epigenetic regulatory mechanism of RNA-induced neurodegenerative disorders associated with metabolic and endocrine diseases.
