39713290|t|Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of human periventricular white matter in vascular dementia.
39713290|a|Vascular dementia (VaD) refers to a variety of dementias driven by cerebrovascular disease and is the second leading cause of dementia globally. VaD may be caused by ischemic strokes, intracerebral hemorrhage, and/or cerebral small vessel disease, commonly identified as white matter hyperintensities on MRI. The mechanisms underlying these white matter lesions in the periventricular brain are poorly understood. In this study we perform an extensive transcriptomic analysis on human postmortem periventricular white matter lesions in patients with VaD with the goal of identifying molecular pathways in the disease. We find increased cellular stress responses in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells as well as transcriptional and translational repression in microglia in our dataset. We show that several genes identified by GWAS as being associated with white matter disease are differentially expressed in cells in VaD. Finally, we compare our dataset to an independent snRNAseq dataset of PVWM in VaD and a scRNAseq dataset on human iPSC-derived microglia exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). We identify the increase of the heat shock protein response as a conserved feature of VaD across celltypes and show that this increase is not linked to OGD exposure. Overall, our study is the first to show that increased heat shock protein responses are a common feature of lesioned PVWM in VaD and may represent a potential therapeutic target.
