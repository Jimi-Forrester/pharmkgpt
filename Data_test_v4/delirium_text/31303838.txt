31303838|t|The potential of antioxidant activity of methanolic extract of Coscinium fenestratum (Goetgh.) Colebr (Menispermaceae).
31303838|a|To explore the possible bioactive compounds and to study the antioxidant capacity of Coscinium fenestratum (Goetgh.) Colebr (Menispermaceae), the qualitative and quantitative phytochemical screening for various secondary metabolites were evaluated. Using the GC-MS analysis, a total number of 30 phytochemical compounds were predicted with their retention time, molecular weight, molecular formula, peak area, structure and activities. The most prevailing heterocyclic compound was Bis(2,4,6- triisopropylphenyl) phosphinicazide (6.70%). The antioxidant activity was evaluated by spectrophotometric methods using the reducing power assay and the DPPH  and ABTS + scavenging assays. The activity was determined to be increased in all the test samples with the increase in the volume of the extract. C. fenestratum possess a good source of many bioactive compounds that are used to prevent diseases linked with oxidative stress.
