34548475|t|Inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2) mediates microtubule polymerization in the brain by regulating alphaK40 acetylation of alpha-tubulin.
34548475|a|Acetylation of alpha-tubulin lysine 40 (alphaK40) contributes to microtubule (MT) stability and is essential for neuronal development and function, whereas excessive alphaK40 deacetylation is observed in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we identified inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2) as a novel MT-binding partner that interacts with alpha-tubulin and enhances alphaK40 acetylation, leading to MT polymerization in the neurons. Commensurate with our finding that the low levels of Id2 expression along with a reduced alphaK40 acetylation in the postmortem human AD patient and 5X-FAD, AD model mice brain, Id2 upregulation in the hippocampus of 5X-FAD, which exhibit high levels of Sirt2 expression, increased alphaK40 acetylation and reconstitutes axon growth. Hence our study suggests that Id2 is critical for maintaining MT stability during neural development and the potential of Id2 to counteract pathogenic Sirt2 activity in AD.
