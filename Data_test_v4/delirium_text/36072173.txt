36072173|t|Neurological Complications of COVID-19: A Review of the Literature.
36072173|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused the most unprecedented health crisis since the 1918 H1N1 pandemic. Whilst COVID-19 is traditionally considered to be a respiratory disease, it is important to understand that this virus has the potential to disseminate throughout the body causing multi-organ failure. Both peripheral and central neurological systems have been shown to be greatly affected. This review aims to look at the available literature published on COVID-19 and summarize the main neurological complications seen so far.
