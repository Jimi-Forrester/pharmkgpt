34520319|t|Sleep, circadian rhythm and gut microbiota: alterations in Alzheimer's disease and their potential links in the pathogenesis.
34520319|a|ABSTRATCIn recent years, emerging studies have observed gut microbiota (GM) alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD), even in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Further, impaired sleep and circadian patterns are common symptoms of AD, while sleep and circadian rhythm disruption (SCRD) is associated with greater beta-amyloid (Abeta) burden and AD risk, sometimes years before the clinical onset of AD. Moreover, reports have demonstrated that GM and its metabolites exhibit diurnal rhythmicity and the role of SCRD in dampening the GM rhythmicity and eubiosis. This review will provide an evaluation of clinical and animal studies describing GM alterations in distinct conditions, including AD, sleep and circadian disruption. It aims to identify the overlapping and distinctive GM alterations in these conditions and their contributions to pathophysiology. Although most studies are observational and use different methodologies, data indicate partial commonalities in GM alterations and unanimity at functional level. Finally, we discuss the possible interactions between SCRD and GM in AD pathogenesis, as well as several methodological improvements that are necessary for future research.
