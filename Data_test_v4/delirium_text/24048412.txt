24048412|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia. The amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide is the predominant candidate aetiological agent and is generated through the sequential proteolytic cleavage of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by beta (beta) and gamma (gamma) secretases. Since the cellular prion protein (PrP(c)) has been shown to regulate Abeta shedding, we investigated whether the cellular receptor for PrP(c), namely the 37 kDa/67 kDa Laminin Receptor (LRP/LR) played a role in Abeta shedding. Here we show that LRP/LR co-localises with the AD relevant proteins APP, beta- and gamma-secretase, respectively. Antibody blockage and shRNA knock-down of LRP/LR reduces Abeta shedding, due to impediment of beta-secretase activity, rather than alteration of APP, beta- and gamma-secretase levels. These findings indicate that LRP/LR contributes to Abeta shedding and recommend anti-LRP/LR specific antibodies and shRNAs as novel therapeutic tools for AD treatment.
