33920336|a|The potential of exosomes as biomarker resources for diagnostics and even for therapeutics has intensified research in the field, including in the context of Alzheimer s disease (AD). The search for disease biomarkers in peripheral biofluids is advancing mainly due to the easy access it offers. In the study presented here, emphasis was given to the bioinformatic identification of putative exosomal candidates for AD. The exosomal proteomes of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum and plasma, were obtained from three databases (ExoCarta, EVpedia and Vesiclepedia), and complemented with additional exosomal proteins already associated with AD but not found in the databases. The final biofluids' proteomes were submitted to gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and the exosomal Abeta-binding proteins that can constitute putative candidates were identified. Among these candidates, gelsolin, a protein known to be involved in inhibiting Abeta fibril formation, was identified, and it was tested in human samples. The levels of this Abeta-binding protein, with anti-amyloidogenic properties, were assessed in serum-derived exosomes isolated from controls and individuals with dementia, including AD cases, and revealed altered expression patterns. Identification of potential peripheral biomarker candidates for AD may be useful, not only for early disease diagnosis but also in drug trials and to monitor disease progression, allowing for a timely therapeutic intervention, which will positively impact the patient's quality of life.
