35799512|t|The regulatory role of Pin1 in neuronal death.
35799512|a|Regulated cell death predominantly involves apoptosis, autophagy, and regulated necrosis. It is vital that we understand how key regulatory signals can control the process of cell death. Pin1 is a cis-trans isomerase that catalyzes the isomerization of phosphorylated serine or threonine-proline motifs of a protein, thereby acting as a crucial molecular switch and regulating the protein functionality and the signaling pathways involved. However, we know very little about how Pin1-associated pathways might play a role in regulated cell death. In this paper, we review the role of Pin1 in regulated cell death and related research progress and summarize Pin1-related pathways in regulated cell death. Aside from the involvement of Pin1 in the apoptosis that accompanies neurodegenerative diseases, accumulating evidence suggests that Pin1 also plays a role in regulated necrosis and autophagy, thereby exhibiting distinct effects, including both neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects. Gaining an enhanced understanding of Pin1 in neuronal death may provide us with new options for the development of therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders.
