34692447|t|Effect of Different Loading Doses of Dexmedetomidine on Controlled Hypotension and the Incidence of Bradycardia During Rhinoplasty: A Clinical Trial.
34692447|a|Controlled hypotension, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg - 70 mmHg, provides a bloodless and visible surgical field during rhinoplasty. It has been shown that dexmedetomidine, an alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist, is a suitable choice in this regard. One of the disadvantages of this drug is the possibility of severe bradycardia during infusion. Therefore, we compared lower intravenous (IV) loading doses to determine whether the hypotensive effect of the drug was preserved and the bradycardia incidence decreased. In this randomized, double-blinded clinical trial, 81 patients aged 18 to 50 years with the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (ASA-PS) class I and II, scheduled for rhinoplasty randomly received 1.0, 0.9, and 0.8 microg/kg (named as groups 1.0, 0.9, and 0.8, respectively) of IV dexmedetomidine before the induction of anesthesia followed by infusion (0.3 - 0.7 microg/kg/h) during operation. The patients' heart rate (HR), MAP, the requirements for nitroglycerin (NTG) and extra fentanyl, as well as the incidence of bradycardia, were recorded. Bleeding and visibility of the surgical field were scored by the surgeon using a 6-point visual scale. MAPs, HRs, and consumption of NTG and extra fentanyl were similar in the studied groups. The surgical field was more visible and bloodless in group 1.0 compared to group 0.8 (P < 0.001); the differences were not significant between groups 1.0 and 0.9 (P = 0.605). The incidence (P = 0.027) and the severity of bradycardia (P = 0.017) were higher in the groups with higher loading doses. We concluded that dexmedetomidine is an acceptable agent to provide controlled hypotension. A loading dose of 0.9 microg/kg, but not 0.8 microg/kg, provides similar surgical field conditions as the dose of 1 microg/kg. Furthermore, despite the decrease in the incidence of bradycardia, the hypotensive effect of the drug is preserved.
