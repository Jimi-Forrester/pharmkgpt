37796142|a|The pathogenic complexity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) demands the development of multitarget-directed agents aiming at improving actual pharmacotherapy. Based on the cholinergic hypothesis and considering the well-established role of butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) in advanced stages of AD, the chemical structure of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor drug donepezil (1) was rationally modified for the design of new N-benzyl-piperidine derivatives (4a-d) as potential multitarget-direct AChE and BuChE inhibitors. The designed analogues were further studied through the integration of in silico and in vitro methods. ADMET predictions showed that 4a-d are anticipated to be orally bioavailable, able to cross the blood-brain barrier and be retained in the brain, and to have low toxicity. Computational docking and molecular dynamics indicated the formation of favorable complexes between 4a-d and both cholinesterases. Derivative 4a presented the lowest binding free energy estimation due to interaction with key residues from both target enzymes (-36.69 +- 4.47 and -32.23 +- 3.99 kcal/mol with AChE and BuChE, respectively). The in vitro enzymatic assay demonstrated that 4a was the most potent inhibitor of AChE (IC50 2.08 +- 0.16 microM) and BuChE (IC50 7.41 +- 0.44 microM), corroborating the in silico results and highlighting 4a as a novel multitarget-directed AChE/BuChE inhibitor.
