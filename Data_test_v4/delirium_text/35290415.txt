35290415|a|As explorations deepen, the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), from its emergence to metastasis and prognosis, has elicited extensive concern. LUSC-related miRNA and mRNA samples were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The data were initially screened and pretreated, and the R platform and series analytical tools were used to identify the specific and sensitive biomarkers. Seven miRNAs and 15 hub genes were found to be closely related to the overall survival of patients with LUSC. Determination of the expression of these miRNAs can help improve the overall survival of LUSC patients. The 15 hub genes correlated with overall survival (OS). The new miRNA markers were identified to predict the prognosis of LUSC. The findings of this study offer novel views on the evolution of precise cancer treatment approaches with high reliability.
