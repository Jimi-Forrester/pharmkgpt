22850312|a|The hipppocampus is a brain structure located deep in the temporal lobe and is notable for its susceptibility to neurotoxic stimuli. It plays a vital role in governing learning and memory. It has been shown to be damaged by variety of factors, e.g., hypoxia, hypoperfusion, hypoglycemia, stress, and seizures, and the list of such factors keeps growing with time. Recently, the role of vascular factors in Alzheimer's disease in causing significant hippocampal damage has started emerging. Vascular factors are known to cause cerebral microlesions and contribute to many more brain pathologies. Though evidence supporting their effects on causing regional brain atrophy is mixed, several studies are indicating that medial temporal lobe may be particularly vulnerable to the damage caused by cardiovascular risk factors. Considering the association between neurodegeneration and vascular factors, a more rigorous scientific evaluation of the correlation between these two has been suggested.
