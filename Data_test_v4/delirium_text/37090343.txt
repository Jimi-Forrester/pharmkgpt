37090343|t|Tunneled Fascia Iliaca Catheter Placement for Chronic Pain From Advanced Osteosarcoma.
37090343|a|The fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) is a regional anesthetic technique for hip and femoral surgery that blocks the femoral, obturator, and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves. We report the case of a middle-aged female patient who presented with excruciating left lower extremity pain secondary to metastatic left femur osteosarcoma. A FICB with the tunneled catheter was sterilely placed in the operating room as palliative therapy due to the difficulty in pain control, as the patient experienced severe somnolence with high-dose opioid therapy. Conventional techniques such as a femoral nerve block were also precluded due to difficult anatomy secondary to tumor compression. Near-total pain relief was achieved postoperatively and lasted over seven weeks until discharge. This case report demonstrates the unique use of the FICB as a primary pain management technique for the control of chronic lower extremity cancer pain.
