37832608|t|Role of Diet and Exercise in Aging, Alzheimer's Disease, and other Chronic Diseases.
37832608|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, characterized by memory loss and multiple cognitive impairments. Genetic mutations cause a small proportion (1-2%) of early-onset AD, with mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2). Major contributing factors of late-onset AD are ApoE4 genotype, traumatic brain injury, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular conditions, in addition to lifestyle factors, such as unhealthy diet and lack of physical exercise. Disease progression can be delayed and/or prevented to a greater extent by adopting healthy lifestyle with balanced and antioxidant enriched diet and daily exercise. The interaction and interplay of diet, exercise, age, and pharmacological interventions holds a crucial role in the progression, pathogenesis and management of AD and its comorbidities, including diabetes, obesity, hypertension and cardiovascular conditions. Antioxidant enriched diet contributes to brain health, glucose control, weight management, and cardiovascular well-being. Regular exercise removes toxins including free radicals and enhances insulin sensitivity, and supports cardiovascular function. In the current article, we discussed, the role of diet, and exercise in aging, AD and other conditions including diabetes, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular conditions. This article also highlights the impact of medication, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, and pharmacological interventions. These aspects were discussed in different races and ethnic groups in Texas, and the US.
