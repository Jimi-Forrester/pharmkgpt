Moreover, only a limited number of active compounds have so far been identified. This work aimed to investigate the anti-oxidative, anti-aggregation, and cytotoxic properties as well as profile the secondary metabolites in the lipophilic fraction of E. camaldulensis leaf extract (Lipo-Eucam) using UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). It was found that Lipo-Eucam possessed potent antioxidant properties against DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP with IC50 values of 31.46, 32.78, and 10.12 mug/mL, respectively. The fraction was able to attenuate metal-catalyzed oxidation of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05) and abrogated the aggregation of amyloidogenic BSA as revealed by the Congo red assay and transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, Lipo-Eucam demonstrated potent cytotoxic effects against MCF-7 (IC50 7.34 mug/mL) but was noncytotoxic at used concentrations against HEK-293 cells (IC50 > 80 mug/mL), suggestive of its selective anticancer properties. Spectrophotometric, UHPLC-MS, and GC-MS analysis revealed that Lipo-Eucam is rich in phenolics, flavonoids, terpenoids, volatile constituents, and a plethora of active metabolites, probably responsible for the observed activities. These findings indicate that Lipo-Eucam is endowed with pharmacologically relevant active principles with strong potential for use in the amelioration of disease conditions related to oxidative stress, protein aggregation, and breast cancer and therefore worthy of further investigations.
