11589422|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized pathologically by cholinergic deficits, amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, gliosis, and neuronal and synaptic loss. The primary therapeutic approach that has arisen from the pathological analysis of AD brain has been cholinergic augmentation by cholinesterase inhibitors, which modestly improve cognitive function. Research on the underlying pathophysiological dysfunction have focussed on AD-specific processes such as amyloid precursor protein, tau, and cerebral apolipoprotein E metabolism, and more general neurodegenerative processes such as inflammation, oxidation, excitotoxicity, and apoptosis. Rational neuroprotective approaches have led to recent trials of estrogen, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory medications in AD, and to the development of anti-amyloid strategies for delaying progression or preventing development of AD.
