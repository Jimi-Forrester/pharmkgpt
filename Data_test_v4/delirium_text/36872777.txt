36872777|t|Hypermethylation at CREBBP Is Associated with Cognitive Impairment in a Mexican American Cohort.
36872777|a|BACKGROUND: The aging Mexican American (MA) population is the fastest growing ethnic minority group in the US. MAs have a unique metabolic-related risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHW). This risk for cognitive impairment (CI) is multifactorial involving genetics, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Changes in environment and lifestyle can alter patterns and even possibly reverse derangement of DNA methylation (a form of epigenetic regulation). OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify ethnicity-specific DNA methylation profiles that may be associated with CI in MAs and NHWs. METHODS: DNA obtained from peripheral blood of 551 participants from the Texas Alzheimer's Research and Care Consortium was typed on the Illumina Infinium  MethylationEPIC chip array, which assesses over 850K CpG genomic sites. Within each ethnic group (N = 299 MAs, N = 252 NHWs), participants were stratified by cognitive status (control versus CI). Beta values, representing relative degree of methylation, were normalized using the Beta MIxture Quantile dilation method and assessed for differential methylation using the Chip Analysis Methylation Pipeline (ChAMP), limma and cate packages in R. RESULTS: Two differentially methylated sites were significant: cg13135255 (MAs) and cg27002303 (NHWs) based on an FDR p < 0.05. Three suggestive sites obtained were cg01887506 (MAs) and cg10607142 and cg13529380 (NHWs). Most methylation sites were hypermethylated in CI compared to controls, except cg13529380 which was hypomethylated. CONCLUSION: The strongest association with CI was at cg13135255 (FDR-adjusted p = 0.029 in MAs), within the CREBBP gene. Moving forward, identifying additional ethnicity-specific methylation sites may be useful to discern CI risk in MAs.
