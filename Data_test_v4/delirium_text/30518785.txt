30518785|t|BK channel blocker paxilline attenuates thalidomide-caused synaptic and cognitive dysfunctions in mice.
30518785|a|Thalidomide is a widely prescribed immunomodulatory drug (iMiD) for multiple myeloma, but causes reversible memory loss in humans. However, how thalidomide causes cognitive dysfunction at a cellular and molecular level has not been demonstrated. We studied the effect of thalidomide on synaptic functions and cognitive behaviors using a mouse model. Thalidomide led to cognitive deficits in learning behavior in a passive avoidance test and in a novel object recognition test, increased anxiety in an elevated plus maze test, and increased depressive behaviors in a tail suspension test. Interestingly, thalidomide elevated big- or large-conductance, calcium-activated K+ (BK) channel expression in the plasma membrane and BK channel activity in the hippocampus. Thalidomide also increased the paired pulse ratio of excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), which suggests a decreased probability of glutamate release. Furthermore, the changes in the paired pulse ratio and in BK channel activity were blocked by paxilline, a BK channel blocker. Finally, we found that thalidomide-induced cognitive dysfunctions were restored by paxilline treatment. These results suggest that thalidomide-mediated BK channel hyperfunction is responsible for the pathological mechanism of thalidomide-associated reversible memory loss.
