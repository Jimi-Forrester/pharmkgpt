31417264|t|Analgesia and sedation post-coronary artery bypass graft surgery: a review of the literature.
31417264|a|This review aimed to study the role of analgesia and sedation after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, regarding pain management, assisted respiration, overall postoperative health care, and hospitalization. Data were collected from Pubmed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases. The following terms were used for the search: "analgesia", "sedation", "coronary artery bypass grafting", CABG", and "opioids". Articles between the years 1988 and 2018 were evaluated. Several opioid and non-opioid analgesics used to relieve surgical pain are regarded as critical risk factors for developing pulmonary and cardiovascular complications in all kinds of thoracic surgery, especially CABG procedures. Effective pain management in post-CABG patients is largely dependent on effective pain assessment, type of sedatives and analgesics administered, and evaluation of their effects on pain relief. A significant challenge is to determine adequate amounts of administered analgesics and sedatives for postoperative CABG patients, because patients often order more sedatives and analgesics than needed. The pain management process is deemed successful when patients feel comfortable after surgery, with no negative side effects. However, postoperative pain management patterns have not included many modern methods such as patient-controlled analgesia, and postoperative pain management drugs are still limited to a restricted range of opioid and non-opioid analgesics.
