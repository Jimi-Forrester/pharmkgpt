6605494|a|We reviewed 1,669 patients who survived coronary artery bypass graft surgery between 1969 and 1981. A total of 75 cerebral complications were identified, including (1) altered mental state, (2) stroke, and (3) seizure in 64 patients (3.8%). Altered mental state (delirium, hypoxic-metabolic encephalopathy) occurred in 57 (3.4%). Postoperative arrhythmias were associated with an increased risk of altered mental state. Cerebral infarction occurred in 13 (0.8%). Patients who suffered stroke had a higher occurrence of carotid bruits and history of peripheral vascular disease. Seizures occurred in five patients (0.3%). Mortality in patients with a neurologic complication was 29%.
