37999250|t|Assessing the Biological Mechanisms Linking Smoking Behavior and Cognitive Function: A Mediation Analysis of Untargeted Metabolomics.
37999250|a|(1) Smoking is the most significant preventable health hazard in the modern world. It increases the risk of vascular problems, which are also risk factors for dementia. In addition, toxins in cigarettes increase oxidative stress and inflammation, which have both been linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). This study identified potential mechanisms of the smoking-cognitive function relationship using metabolomics data from the longitudinal Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP). (2) 1266 WRAP participants were included to assess the association between smoking status and four cognitive composite scores. Next, untargeted metabolomic data were used to assess the relationships between smoking and metabolites. Metabolites significantly associated with smoking were then tested for association with cognitive composite scores. Total effect models and mediation models were used to explore the role of metabolites in smoking-cognitive function pathways. (3) Plasma N-acetylneuraminate was associated with smoking status Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite 3 (PACC3) and Immediate Learning (IMM). N-acetylneuraminate mediated 12% of the smoking-PACC3 relationship and 13% of the smoking-IMM relationship. (4) These findings provide links between previous studies that can enhance our understanding of potential biological pathways between smoking and cognitive function.
