2812339|t|Memory and regional cerebral blood flow in mildly symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.
2812339|a|We performed SPECT perfusion imaging and memory testing with mildly and moderately demented Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and with healthy controls. All patients had memory abnormalities, but 5 of the 21 patients had neither temporal nor parietal perfusion abnormalities, indicating that temporoparietal blood flow may be normal at a point when memory is pathologic and the clinical diagnosis of AD is possible.
