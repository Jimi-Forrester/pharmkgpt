35971310|a|INTRODUCTION: The Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum begins with a long asymptomatic or preclinical stage, during which amyloid beta (Abeta) is accumulating for more than a decade prior to widespread cortical tauopathy, neurodegeneration, and manifestation of clinical symptoms. The AHEAD 3-45 Study (BAN2401-G000-303) is testing whether intervention with lecanemab (BAN2401), a humanized immunoglobulin 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that preferentially targets soluble aggregated Abeta, initiated during this asymptomatic stage can slow biomarker changes and/or cognitive decline. The AHEAD 3-45 Study is conducted as a Public-Private Partnership of the Alzheimer's Clinical Trial Consortium (ACTC), funded by the National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Eisai Inc. METHODS: The AHEAD 3-45 Study was launched on July 14, 2020, and consists of two sister trials (A3 and A45) in cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals ages 55 to 80 with specific dosing regimens tailored to baseline brain amyloid levels on screening positron emission tomography (PET) scans: intermediate amyloid ( 20 to 40 Centiloids) for A3 and elevated amyloid (>40 Centiloids) for A45. Both trials are being conducted under a single protocol, with a shared screening process and common schedule of assessments. A3 is a Phase 2 trial with PET-imaging end points, whereas A45 is a Phase 3 trial with a cognitive composite primary end point. The treatment period is 4 years. The study utilizes innovative approaches to enriching the sample with individuals who have elevated brain amyloid. These include recruiting from the Trial-Ready Cohort for Preclinical and Prodromal Alzheimer's disease (TRC-PAD), the Australian Dementia Network (ADNeT) Registry, and the Japanese Trial Ready Cohort (J-TRC), as well as incorporation of plasma screening with the C2N mass spectrometry platform to quantitate the Abeta 42/40 ratio (Abeta 42/40), which has been shown previously to reliably identify cognitively normal participants not likely to have elevated brain amyloid levels. A blood sample collected at a brief first visit is utilized to "screen out" individuals who are less likely to have elevated brain amyloid, and to determine the participant's eligibility to proceed to PET imaging. Eligibility to randomize into the A3 Trial or A45 Trial is based on the screening PET imaging results. RESULT: The focus of this article is on the innovative design of the study. DISCUSSION: The AHEAD 3-45 Study will test whether with lecanemab (BAN2401) can slow the accumulation of tau and prevent the cognitive decline associated with AD during its preclinical stage. It is specifically targeting both the preclinical and the early preclinical (intermediate amyloid) stages of AD and is the first secondary prevention trial to employ plasma-based biomarkers to accelerate the screening process and potentially substantially reduce the number of screening PET scans.
