26691807|a|The demographic transition in Brazil has led to substantial aging of the population and an increased prevalence of age-related diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The Brazilian Ministry of Health finances AD medication and, since 2002, a Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines (PCDT) for this condition have been made available. This study investigated the acquisition of medication for AD in the Integrated System of Administration of General Services (SIASG) database. A profile of purchases, expenditures and prices from 2008 to 2013 was prepared. All medication and forms of treatment of AD were investigated, including those not contained in the PCDT protocol. Unit prices were deflated to December 2013 by the IPCA (Brazilian Pricing Index). More than 47 million units of medication for AD were acquired and expenditures attained 90.1 million Brazilian reals. The purchase of the various administration routes of rivastigmine were in the forefront. Medication not listed in the protocol represented 3% of expenditures and purchases resulting from health litigation were negligible. Over the period, a reduction of corrected weighted average prices of PCDT and non-PCDT medication was observed.
