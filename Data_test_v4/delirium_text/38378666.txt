38378666|t|Endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response: emerging regulators in progression of traumatic brain injury.
38378666|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common trauma with high mortality and disability rates worldwide. However, the current management of this disease is still unsatisfactory. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms of TBI in depth to improve the treatment options. In recent decades, abundant evidence has highlighted the significance of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in advancing central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including TBI. ERS following TBI leads to the accumulation of unfolded proteins, initiating the unfolded protein response (UPR). Protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) are the three major pathways of UPR initiation that determine whether a cell survives or dies. This review focuses on the dual effects of ERS on TBI and discusses the underlying mechanisms. It is suggested that ERS may crosstalk with a series of molecular cascade responses, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, autophagy, and cell death, and is thus involved in the progression of secondary injury after TBI. Hence, ERS is a promising candidate for the management of TBI.
