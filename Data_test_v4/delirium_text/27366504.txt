27366504|t|The Incidence of Delirium at the Postoperative Intensive Care Unit in Adult Patients.
27366504|a|OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to determine the risk factors and the incidence of delirium in patients who were followed postoperatively in our surgical intensive care unit for 24 h using the confusion assessment method (CAM). METHODS: After obtaining approval from the ethics committee, 250 patients were included in the study. Patients who were operated under general anaesthesia or regional anaesthesia and followed in the surgical intensive care unit were evaluated by the Ramsay Sedation Scale on the first postoperative day. CAM was applied to the patients who had a Ramsey Sedation Score of <=4. Patients' age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores, preoperative risk factors, type of anaesthesia, operation time, intra-operative procedures, pain scores evaluated by the visual analogue scale (VAS) and postoperative analgesia methods were recorded. RESULTS: The incidence of delirium was found to be 18.4%. The average age of patients who developed delirium was greater than the others (68.8+-12.7 and 57.6+-12, p=0.001, respectively). It was observed that a one-unit increase in the ASA score resulted in a 3.3-fold increase in the risk of delirium. The incidence of delirium in patients undergoing regional anaesthesia was 34.6%, whereas it was 16.5% in patients receiving general anaesthesia (p=0.024). The existence of preoperative diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was shown to improve the development of delirium (p<0.05). Delirium incidence was significantly higher in patients who were administered meperidine for postoperative analgesia (p=0.013). The VAS scores of patients who developed delirium were found to be significantly higher (p=0.006). CONCLUSION: As a result, we found that older age, high ASA score, preoperative DM and COPD are important risk factors for the development of delirium. Regional anaesthesia, high postoperative pain scores and meperidine use were observed to be associated with the development of delirium. In the postoperative period, addition of CAM, a simple measurement technique, to the daily follow-up forms can provide the early recognition of delirium, which is often underdiagnosed. We think that identification and prevention of effective risk factors have the primary importance for postoperative delirium.
