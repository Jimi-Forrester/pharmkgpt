38819046|t|Nanomaterials-mediated lysosomal regulation: a robust protein-clearance approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
38819046|a|Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive accumulation of abnormal proteins, including amyloid plaques and intracellular tau tangles, primarily within the brain. Lysosomes, crucial intracellular organelles responsible for protein degradation, play a key role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Some studies have suggested a link between the dysregulation of the lysosomal system and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Restoring the normal physiological function of lysosomes hold the potential to reduce the pathological burden and improve the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Currently, the efficacy of drugs in treating Alzheimer's disease is limited, with major challenges in drug delivery efficiency and targeting. Recently, nanomaterials have gained widespread use in Alzheimer's disease drug research owing to their favorable physical and chemical properties. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in using nanomaterials (polymeric nanomaterials, nanoemulsions, and carbon-based nanomaterials) to enhance lysosomal function in treating Alzheimer's disease. This review also explores new concepts and potential therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease through the integration of nanomaterials and modulation of lysosomal function. In conclusion, this review emphasizes the potential of nanomaterials in modulating lysosomal function to improve the pathological features of Alzheimer's disease. The application of nanotechnology to the development of Alzheimer's disease drugs brings new ideas and approaches for future treatment of this disease.
