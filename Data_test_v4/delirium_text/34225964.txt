34225964|a|There is currently no effective treatment for the most common of the dementia disorders, Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been known for decades that the central cholinergic system is important for memory. The cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain with its cortical and hippocampal projections degenerate in AD and thus contribute to the cognitive decline characteristic of AD. This knowledge led to the development of the currently approved treatment for AD, with inhibitors of acetylcholine-esterase targeting the cholinergic system with beneficial but mild effects. In recent years, other approaches to influence the degenerating cholinergic system in AD focusing on nerve growth factor (NGF) have been undertaken. NGF is required for the survival and function of the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, the most important being the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM). Since there is a lack of NGF and its receptors in the AD forebrain, the hypothesis is that local delivery of NGF to the nbM could revive the cholinergic circuitry and thereby restore cognitive functions. Since NGF does not pass through the blood-brain barrier, approaches involving cerebral injections of genetically modified cells or viral vectors or implantation of encapsulated cells in the nbM in AD patients have been used. These attempts have been partially successful but also have limitations, which are presented and discussed here. In conclusion, these trials point to the importance of further development of NGF-related therapies in AD.
