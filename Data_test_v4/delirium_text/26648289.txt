26648289|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protective effect and related mechanism of baicalin in murine neuroblastoma N2a cells stably expressing human Swedish mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) (N2a/APPswe cells), a cellular model of Alzheimer' s disease (AD). METHODS: MTT assay was performed to observe the effect of baicalin (0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20) mumol/L on the viability of N2a/APPswe cells. After N2a/APPswe cells were incubated with (1, 5, 10) mumol/L baicalin for 48 hours, xanthine oxidase assay was used to test superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and thiobarbituric acid method to detect malondialdehyde (MDA) content in each group. Real-time quantitative PCR was applied to determine nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) mRNA, and Western blotting to examine protein levels of total Nrf2, nuclear Nrf2 and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) in N2a/APPswe cells exposed to different doses of baicalin. Immunofluorescence staining was also used to observe the distribution of Nrf2. RESULTS: We found that baicalin pretreatment increased cell viability. Compared with the control group (N2a/wt cells), SOD activity in N2a/APPswe cells significantly decreased, and MDA content significantly increased; but SOD activity was improved and MDA production was inhibited after pretreatment with baicalin, especially with 10 mumol/L bacalin. Both mRNA and total protein expression of Nrf2 were not significantly changed in baicalin treatment group compared with N2a/APPswe group, but the nuclear protein of Nrf2 distinctly increased after treatment with baicalin. In addition, baicalin decreased the level of nuclear NF-kappaB protein. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining revealed that baicalin promoted the translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus. CONCLUSION: Baicalin has the protection against oxidative stress via activation of Nrf2 in N2a/APPswe cells.
