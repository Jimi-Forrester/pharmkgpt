30267364|a|Psychiatric complications after subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) in Parkinson's disease patients are common. The aim of this study was to evaluate a possible role of cortical thickness, cortical and subcortical volume for neuropsychiatric complications after STN-DBS implantation surgery. Twenty-two Parkinson's disease patients underwent STN-DBS. Control group consisted of 18 healthy volunteers who were matched by age and gender. All Parkinson's disease patients and control subjects underwent neuropsychological assessment and brain MRI. Control group subjects had normal MRI and neurocognitive testing results. Seven (31.8%) Parkinson's disease patients developed neuropsychiatric complications (psychosis and delirium) after STN-DBS implantation surgery with full recovery in short follow up. Two Parkinson's disease patients were excluded from further analysis, because they did not match image processing and analysis quality control. Volumetric analysis showed significant differences in cortical thickness between STN-DBS patients with and without postoperative neuropsychiatric complications in 13 gyruses on the right hemisphere (superior frontal, caudal middle frontal, pars triangularis and opercularis, temporal lobe, superior and inferior parietal, supramarginal) and in 7 gyruses on the left hemisphere (caudal middle frontal, inferior and middle temporal, pre and postcentral, superior parietal and supramarginal). White matter volume analysis showed also its reduction in the left caudal middle frontal area. Moreover, white matter volume and surface area reduction implicating that this area can be the most important for postoperative neuropsychiatric complication risk. Study results suggest that neuropsychiatric complications are common in Parkinson's disease patients after STN-DBS implantation and can be associated with excitation of frontal-striatum-thalamus and temporal-parietal circuits.
