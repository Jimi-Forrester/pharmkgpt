She drew up a document, witnessed by her sister, that stated in the event of her suffering from any form of mental incapacity she would not wish to be fed or have any medical or nursing intervention. Some years later she began to suffer from the early signs of Alzheimer's disease. Her sister had died, but staff were aware that Mary still carried this living will on her person. She is now refusing all food. What is the law?
