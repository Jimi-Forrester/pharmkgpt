36838751|t|Unveiling the Pharmacological and Nanotechnological Facets of Daidzein: Present State-of-the-Art and Future Perspectives.
36838751|a|Herbal drugs have been attracting much scientific interest in the last few decades and nowadays, phytoconstituents-based research is in progress to disclose their unidentified medicinal potential. Daidzein (DAI) is the natural phytoestrogen isoflavone derived primarily from leguminous plants, such as the soybean and mung bean, and its IUPAC name is 4',7-dihydroxyisoflavone. This compound has received great attention as a fascinating pharmacophore with remarkable potential for the therapeutic management of several diseases. Certain pharmacokinetic properties of DAI such as less aqueous solubility, low permeability, and poor bioavailability are major obstacles restricting the therapeutic applications. In this review, distinctive physicochemical characteristics and pharmacokinetics of DAI has been elucidated. The pharmacological applications in treatment of several disorders like oxidative stress, cancer, obesity, cardiovascular, neuroprotective, diabetes, ovariectomy, anxiety, and inflammation with their mechanism of action are explained. Furthermore, this review article comprehensively focuses to provide up-to-date information about nanotechnology-based formulations which have been investigated for DAI in preceding years which includes polymeric nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carrier, polymer-lipid nanoparticles, nanocomplexes, polymeric micelles, nanoemulsion, nanosuspension, liposomes, and self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems.
