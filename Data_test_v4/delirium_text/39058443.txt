39058443|t|Delaying Brain Aging or Decreasing Tau Levels as Strategies to Prevent Alzheimer's Disease: In Memoriam of Mark A. Smith.
39058443|a|Aging is the main risk for neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease. In this short review, I will comment on how delaying brain aging through the addition of Yamanaka Factors or small compounds that bind to the folate receptor alpha, which promote the expression of the Yamanaka Factors or by the decrease tau levels in brain cells from older subjects could serve as strategies to prevent Alzheimer's disease.
