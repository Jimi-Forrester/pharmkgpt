34829816|a|Mitochondria provide energy to neurons through oxidative phosphorylation and eliminate Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) through Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1). Dysfunctional mitochondria, manifesting decreased activity of electron transport chain (ETC) complexes and high ROS levels, are involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. We hypothesized that neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction in AD is reflected in ETC and SOD1 levels and activity in plasma neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs). We immunoprecipitated NDEVs targeting neuronal marker L1CAM from two cohorts: one including 22 individuals with early AD and 29 control subjects; and another including 14 individuals with early AD and 14 control subjects. In the first cohort, we measured levels of complexes I, III, IV, ATP synthase, and SOD1; in the second cohort, we measured levels and catalytic activity of complexes IV and ATP synthase. AD individuals had lower levels of complexes I (p < 0.0001), III (p < 0.0001), IV (p = 0.0061), and V (p < 0.0001), and SOD1 (p < 0.0001) compared to controls. AD individuals also had lower levels of catalytic activity of complex IV (p = 0.0214) and ATP synthase (p < 0.0001). NDEVs confirm quantitative and functional abnormalities in ECT complexes and SOD1 previously observed in AD models and during autopsy, opening the way for using them as biomarkers for mitochondrial dysfunction in AD.
