34356349|t|Oxidative Stress and Cognitive Alterations Induced by Cancer Chemotherapy Drugs: A Scoping Review.
34356349|a|Cognitive impairment is one of the most deleterious effects of chemotherapy treatment in cancer patients, and this problem sometimes remains even after chemotherapy ends. Common classes of chemotherapy-based regimens such as anthracyclines, taxanes, and platinum derivatives can induce both oxidative stress in the blood and in the brain, and these effects can be reproduced in neuronal and glia cell cultures. In rodent models, both the acute and repeated administration of doxorubicin or adriamycin (anthracyclines) or cisplatin impairs cognitive functions, as shown by their diminished performance in different learning and memory behavioural tasks. Administration of compounds with strong antioxidant effects such as N-acetylcysteine, gamma-glutamyl cysteine ethyl ester, polydatin, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, and 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate sodium (MESNA) counteract both oxidative stress and cognitive alterations induced by chemotherapeutic drugs. These antioxidant molecules provide the scientific basis to design clinical trials in patients with the aim of reducing the oxidative stress and cognitive alterations, among other probable central nervous system changes, elicited by chemotherapy in cancer patients. In particular, N-acetylcysteine and MESNA are currently used in clinical settings and are therefore attracting scientific attention.
