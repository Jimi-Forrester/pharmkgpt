1895150|a|Parvalbumin (a calcium-binding protein)-immunoreactive (PV-Ir) neurons in the cerebral cortex were examined in 20 postmortem brains obtained from elderly controls and patients with Pick's disease (PD). The type of PV-Ir neurons and their distribution in control and PD brains were similar. The number of PV-Ir neurons in PD brains did not differ significantly from that in the control brains either. These findings suggested that PV-Ir neurons in the cortex are not affected in PD brains. A significant loss of PV-Ir neurons has already been reported in brains obtained from patients with Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD), and the present results suggest the possibility that the damage of PV-Ir neurons might be comparatively selective for ATD brains.
