33931669|t|Arginyltransferase (Ate1) regulates the RGS7 protein level and the sensitivity of light-evoked ON-bipolar responses.
33931669|a|Regulator of G-protein signaling 7 (RGS7) is predominately present in the nervous system and is essential for neuronal signaling involving G-proteins. Prior studies in cultured cells showed that RGS7 is regulated via proteasomal degradation, however no protein is known to facilitate proteasomal degradation of RGS7 and it has not been shown whether this regulation affects G-protein signaling in neurons. Here we used a knockout mouse model with conditional deletion of arginyltransferase (Ate1) in the nervous system and found that in retinal ON bipolar cells, where RGS7 modulates a G-protein to signal light increments, deletion of Ate1 raised the level of RGS7. Electroretinographs revealed that lack of Ate1 leads to increased light-evoked response sensitivities of ON-bipolar cells, as well as their downstream neurons. In cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), RGS7 was rapidly degraded via proteasome pathway and this degradation was abolished in Ate1 knockout MEF. Our results indicate that Ate1 regulates RGS7 protein level by facilitating proteasomal degradation of RGS7 and thus affects G-protein signaling in neurons.
