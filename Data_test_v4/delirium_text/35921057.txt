35921057|t|Adiponectin, the adiponectin paradox, and Alzheimer's Disease: Is this association biologically plausible?
35921057|a|Dementia, especially Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and vascular dementia, is a major public health problem that continues to expand in both economically emerging and hegemonic countries. In 2017, the World Alzheimer Report estimated that over 50 million people were living with dementia globally. Metabolic dysfunctions of brain structures such as the hippocampus and cerebral cortex have been implicated as risk factors for dementia. Several well-defined metabolic risk factors for AD include visceral obesity, chronic inflammation, peripheral and brain insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypercholesterolemia, and others. In this review, we describe the relationship between the dysmetabolic mechanisms, although still unknown, and dementia, particularly AD. Adiponectin (ADPN), the most abundant circulating adipocytokine, acts as a protagonist in the metabolic dysfunction associated with AD, with unexpected and intriguing dual biological functions. This contradictory role of ADPN has been termed the adiponectin paradox. Some evidence suggests that the adiponectin paradox is important in amyloidogenic evolvability in AD. We present cumulative evidence showing that AD and T2DM share many common features. We also review the mechanistic pathways involving brain insulin resistance. We discuss the importance of the evolvability of amyloidogenic proteins (APs), defined as the capacity of a system for adaptive evolution. Finally, we describe potential therapeutic strategies in AD, based on the adiponectin paradox.
