33617884|a|Aggregation of the circulating protein leukocyte-cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2) causes amyloidosis of LECT2 (ALECT2), one of the most prevalent forms of systemic amyloidosis affecting the kidney and liver. The I40V mutation is thought to be necessary but not sufficient for ALECT2, with a second, as-yet undetermined condition being required for the disease. EM, X-ray diffraction, NMR, and fluorescence experiments demonstrate that LECT2 forms amyloid fibrils in vitro in the absence of other proteins. Removal of LECT2's single bound Zn2+ appears to be obligatory for fibril formation. Zinc-binding affinity is strongly dependent on pH: 9-13 % of LECT2 is calculated to exist in the zinc-free state over the normal pH range of blood, with this fraction rising to 80 % at pH 6.5. The I40V mutation does not alter zinc-binding affinity or kinetics but destabilizes the zinc-free conformation. These results suggest a mechanism in which loss of zinc together with the I40V mutation leads to ALECT2.
