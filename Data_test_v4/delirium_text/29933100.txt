29933100|a|Elevated serum and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of S100beta, a protein predominantly found in glia, are associated with intracranial injury and neurodegeneration, although concentrations are also influenced by several other factors. The longitudinal association between serum S100beta concentrations and brain health in nonpathological aging is unknown. In a large group (baseline N = 593; longitudinal N = 414) of community-dwelling older adults at ages 73 and 76 years, we examined cross-sectional and parallel longitudinal changes between serum S100beta and brain MRI parameters: white matter hyperintensities, perivascular space visibility, white matter fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity (MD), global atrophy, and gray matter volume. Using bivariate change score structural equation models, correcting for age, sex, diabetes, and hypertension, higher S100beta was cross-sectionally associated with poorer general fractional anisotropy (r = -0.150, p = 0.001), which was strongest in the anterior thalamic (r = -0.155, p < 0.001) and cingulum bundles (r = -0.111, p = 0.005), and survived false discovery rate correction. Longitudinally, there were no significant associations between changes in brain imaging parameters and S100beta after false discovery rate correction. These data provide some weak evidence that S100beta may be an informative biomarker of brain white matter aging.
