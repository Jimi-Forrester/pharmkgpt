11142176|t|Screening and early diagnosis of dementia.
11142176|a|In current practice, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is often delayed for several years after the initial onset of symptoms. Earlier diagnosis is desirable for several reasons. It allows the patient, family, and clinician to plan more effectively for the future, reduces the likelihood of catastrophic events such as motor vehicle accidents, and permits more effective administration of medications to delay symptom progression. Early detection of dementia can improve the quality of life for the patient and the caregiver and ultimately reduce total care expenditures by delaying the time to nursing home admission and other costly outcomes.
