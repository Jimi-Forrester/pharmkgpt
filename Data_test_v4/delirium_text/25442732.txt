25442732|a|Emerging evidence has shown a consistent association between AF and risk of dementia, including Alzheimer s disease. It is likely that a constellation of various mechanisms combine to cause dementia in AF patients. Both AF and dementia share multiple common risk factors, and as such these may be targets of early prevention strategies to reduce risk. In patients with AF, choices regarding type and duration of anticoagulation as well as rhythm- and rate-control strategies can influence dementia risk.
