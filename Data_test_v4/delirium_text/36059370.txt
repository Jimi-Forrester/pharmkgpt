36059370|t|Case of Junctional Rhythm in the Setting of Acute Adrenal Insufficiency.
36059370|a|Primary adrenal insufficiency occurs when the production of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormones from the adrenal cortex decreases. Cardiovascular manifestations, although a rare sequela in acute adrenal insufficiency, include arrhythmias, heart failure and ischemia. Rapid identification and treatment are crucial as mortality can occur rapidly. We present a patient with no underlying adrenal dysfunction who presented with worsening renal function and subsequent development of acute adrenal insufficiency manifesting with hypothermia, hypotension, and junctional rhythm requiring vasopressor support along with hydrocortisone therapy.
