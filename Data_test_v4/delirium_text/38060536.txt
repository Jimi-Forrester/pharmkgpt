38060536|t|Time-dependent association between STOPP and START criteria and gastrointestinal bleeding in older patients using routinely collected primary care data.
38060536|a|PURPOSE: Only few studies have assessed the preventive effect of the STOPP/START criteria on adverse events. We aim to quantify 1) the association between nonadherence to STOPP/START criteria and gastrointestinal bleedings, and 2) the association between exposure to the potentially harmful START-medications and gastrointestinal bleedings. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study using routinely collected data of patients aged >= 65 years from the electronic health records (EHR) of 49 general practitioners (GPs) in 6 GP practices, from 2007 to 2014. The database is maintained in the academic research network database (AHA) of Amsterdam UMC, the Netherlands. METHODS: Gastrointestinal bleedings were identified using ICPC codes and free text inspections. Three STOPP and six START criteria pertaining to gastrointestinal bleedings were selected. Cox proportional hazards regression with time-dependent covariate analysis was performed to assess the independent association between nonadherence to the STOPP/START criteria and gastrointestinal bleedings. The analysis was performed with all criteria as a composite outcome, as well as separately for the individual criteria. RESULTS: Out of 26,576 participants, we identified 19,070 Potential Inappropriate Medications (PIM)/Potential Prescribing Omission (PPO) instances for 3,193 participants and 146 gastrointestinal bleedings in 143 participants. The hazard ratio for gastrointestinal bleedings of STOPP/STARTs, taken as composite outcome, was 5.45 (95% CI 3.62-8.21). When analysed separately, two out of nine STOPP/STARTs showed significant associations. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a significant positive association between nonadherence to the STOPP/START criteria and gastrointestinal bleeding. We emphasize the importance of adherence to the relevant criteria for gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be endorsed by decision support systems.
