24874322|a|OBJECTIVES: To study the degenerative and regenerative age-related changes in human hippocampus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An immunohistochemical investigation of the hippocampus was carried out in 50 people, aged 25-89 years, who died for different reasons not connected with the cerebral injury or pathology. Expression of the following markers was determined: tau-protein, GFAP, CD105/endoglin, E-selectin, NCAM, Cdk2. Statistical analysis was performed with the program package Biostat. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Gliogenesis and vasculogenesis processes were active in old and very old age. They may be conditioned by ischemic cerebral injuries and accompany the development of Alzheimer's disease.
