39387696|t|A mitochondria targeting, de novo designed, aggregation-induced emission probe for selective detection of neurotoxic amyloid-beta aggregates.
39387696|a|A striking issue is the scarcity of imaging probes for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. For the development of Abeta biomarkers, a mitochondria targeting, de novo designed, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) probe Cou-AIE-TPP+ is constructed by engineering the aromatic coumarin framework into the bridge of electron donor-acceptor-donor tethered with a lipophilic cationic triphenylphosphonium (TPP+) group. The synthesized Cou-AIE-TPP+ probe exhibits biocompatibility, noncytotoxicity, and a huge Stokes shift (124 nm in PBS). Cou-AIE-TPP+ has respectable fluorescence augmentation inside the aggregated Abeta40 in comparison with monomeric Abeta40 with a high binding affinity (Kd = 83 nM) to Abeta40 aggregates, is capable of detecting the kinetics of amyloid aggregation, and is superior to the gold standard probe thioflavin T. Fluorescence lifetime and brightness are also augmented when the probe Cou-AIE-TPP+ binds with Abeta aggregates in PBS. Cou-AIE-TPP+ (lambdaem 604 nm) selectively targets and images neuronal cell mitochondria, is useful to monitor mitochondrial morphology alteration and damage during Abeta40-induced neurotoxicity, recognizes neurotoxic Abeta fibrils, and is highly colocalized with thioflavin T, showing a decent Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.91 in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. These findings indicate that the mitochondria targeting, de novo designed, functional AIE-based solvatofluorochromic Cou-AIE-TPP+ probe is a promising switch on biomarkers for fluorescence imaging of Abeta aggregates and to monitor mitochondrial morphology change and dysfunction during Abeta-induced neurotoxicity, which may offer imperative direction for the advancement of compelling AIE biomarkers for targeted early stage Abeta diagnosis in the future.
