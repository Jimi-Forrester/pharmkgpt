26281812|t|Progressive Organ Failure After Ingestion of Wild Garlic Juice.
26281812|a|BACKGROUND: Wild garlic and related plants are increasingly sought after by fans of natural products. They can be confused with other plants containing colchicine and cause potentially fatal intoxications. CASE REPORT: We report a case of accidental poisoning by Colchicum autumnale, which was mistaken for wild garlic (Allium ursinum). The patient initially presented with mild gastrointestinal symptoms, but progressed rapidly to agranulocytosis, paraparesis, and delirium before the causative agent was identified. The laboratory tests revealed rhabdomyolysis, coagulopathy, alteration of liver tests, and prerenal azotemia. Botanical examination confirmed the incriminated plant (Colchicum autumnale). Serum and urine analysis confirmed the presence of colchicine. The patient required intensive support therapy, and she fully recovered within 8 weeks. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Colchicine poisoning should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with gastroenteritis after ingestion of wild garlic.
