38038376|a|Objective: The degree of aging in China is deepening, leading to cognitive decline and seriously affecting the health status of the elderly. This article explores the benefits of exergames in improving cognitive function in older adults through a literature review, with aim of contributing to the development of healthy aging. Methods: Using PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, dimensional spectrum, search for research papers from 2005 to April 2023 by using keywords such as a somatosensory game, cognitive function, execute function, working memory, aged and suppression control. PEDro Scale was used to check the quality of the literature. Results: A total of 16 papers were included in the review. Exergames improve the executive function of the elderly and support the relationship between exergames and cognitive performance in older adults. From a mechanistic perspective, somatosensory play promotes signal transduction of brain neurotrophin, thereby protecting the structure and function of neurons in specific brain regions and delays the decline of executive function in older adults as much as possible. Conclusions: It is recommended to use exergames as an intervention measure for the physical and mental health preservation of older adults. Suggest adopting personalised exergames in the future to explore the impact of cognitive and physical functions in elderly people, as well as measurable changes in brain structure.
