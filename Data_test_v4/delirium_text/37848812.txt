37848812|t|Serum sodium improvement: change in Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment parameters in geriatric patients with hyponatremia.
37848812|a|BACKGROUND: Hyponatremia presents with symptoms considered age-associated in the elderly. We assess the change in Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) parameters after hyponatremia improvement in hospitalized geriatric patients. METHODS: We took 100 hyponatremic and same number of eunatremic geriatric patients (> 60 years) who were comorbidity, presenting-complaints, and age-matched. Four CGA parameters were utilized, the new Hindi Mental State Examination (HMSE), Barthel's index of activities of daily living (ADL), Timed up and go Test (TUG), and handgrip strength by hand dynamometer (HG). We analyzed these at admission and discharge, and their relationship with change in sodium levels. RESULTS: Average age was 68.1 +- 5.8 years, with males constituting 75%. The CGA parameters demonstrated worse values amongst the hyponatremia than the normonatremia group. Severe hyponatremia group showed worse CGA scores in comparison with moderate and mild. With improvement in sodium level, the improvements in ADL, TUG, and HMSE scores were greater in the hyponatremia group (8.8 +- 10.1, 2.2 +- 2.5, and 1.7 +- 2.3 respectively) in comparison to the normonatremia reference group (4.7 +- 9.0, 1 +- 2.0, and 0.7 +- 1.3 respectively, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study is the first utilizing HMSE to assess change in cognitive ability with improvement in serum sodium levels in the Indian elderly. Hyponatremic patients show worse baseline CGA parameters, and hyponatremia severity correlates with worse motor and cognitive function. Improvement in the serum sodium level improves the CGA parameters. Correction of hyponatremia in the geriatric age group significantly impacts life quality.
