39416801|t|Robotic Pediatric Urologic Surgery-Clinical Anesthetic Considerations: A Comprehensive Review.
39416801|a|Minimally invasive robotic approaches have become standard in many institutions over the last decade for various pediatric urological procedures. The anesthetic considerations for common laparoscopic and robotic-assisted surgeries are similar since both require the insufflation of CO2 to adequately visualize the operative area. However, few studies exist regarding anesthesia for robotic procedures in children. We hypothesized that pediatric patients undergoing robotic urologic surgeries would require specific anesthetic strategies, especially given the inherently longer durations of these procedures. This study aimed to evaluate anesthetic considerations, current robotic procedures, optimal patient positioning, and port placement for robotic-assisted surgery in pediatric patients. A comprehensive literature review of all published manuscripts from PubMed, EMBASE database, and Google Scholar was performed, focusing on robotic procedures involving pediatric patients, anesthesia for pediatric urology patients, and related topics from 1996 to 2023. Forty published manuscripts were identified and reviewed in depth. In pediatric cases, insufflation pressures and volumes are lower due to the laxity of the abdominal wall. However, the increase in intra-abdominal pressure and absorption of CO2 may result in disproportionate changes in cardiopulmonary function. Specific patient positioning for robotic approaches may further compound these physiological changes. Correct patient positioning is essential to facilitate surgery optimally and safely. Understanding the physiological changes that can occur during a pediatric patient's robotic urologic surgery allows for safer anesthesia management.
