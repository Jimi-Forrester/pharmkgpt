30372687|t|Possible Role of the Polyglutamine Elongation in Evolution of Amyloid-Related Evolvability.
30372687|a|The polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, such as Huntington's disease and the spinocerebellar ataxias, are characterized by the accumulation of elongated polyQ sequences (epolyQ) and mostly occur during midlife. Considering that polyQ disorders have not been selected out in evolution, there might be important physiological functions of epolyQ during development and/or reproduction. In a similar context, the physiological functions of neurodegeneration-associated amyloidogenic proteins (APs), such as beta-amyloid in Alzheimer's disease and alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease, remain elusive. In this regard, we recently proposed that evolvability for coping with diverse stressors in the brain, which is beneficial for offspring, might be relevant to the physiological functions of APs. Given analogous properties of APs and epolyQ in terms of neurotoxic amyloid-fibril formation, the objective of this paper is to determine whether evolvability could also be applied to the physiological functions of epolyQ. Indeed, APs and epolyQ are similar in many ways, including functional redundancy of non-amyloidogenic homologues, hormesis conferred by the heterogeneity of the stress-induced protein aggregates, the transgenerational prion-like transmission of the protein aggregates via germ cells, and the antagonistic pleiotropy relationship between evolvability and neurodegenerative disease. Given that epolyQ is widely expressed from microorganisms to human brain, whereas APs are only identified in vertebrates, evolvability of epolyQ is considered to be much more primitive compared to those of APs during evolution. Collectively, epolyQ may be not only be important in the pathophysiology of polyQ diseases, but also in the evolution of amyloid-related evolvability.
