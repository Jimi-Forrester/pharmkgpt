METHODS: We enrolled 118 individuals aged >=65 years with mild cognitive impairment, who were followed up on from August 2015 to September 2019. All participants continuously wore an accelerometer sensor for 7 consecutive days every 3 months and received annual 11 C-Pittsburgh compound-B and 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET). Sleep and physical activity parameters were assessed using accelerometer sensor data and PET imaging was quantified using a standardized uptake-value ratio. Fifty-seven participants (48.3%) completed a lifestyle factor assessment and PET imaging over the 3-year period. A linear mixed-effects model was applied to examine the longitudinal association of sleep and physical activity parameters with PET imaging over the 3-year period, controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: Sleep efficiency was inversely associated with amyloid uptake in the frontal lobe. Although sleep duration was positively associated with global amyloid uptake, particularly in the frontal lobe, their impact was extremely small. However, physical activity parameters were not significantly associated with the 11 C-Pittsburgh compound-B-uptake. Furthermore, sleep and physical activity parameters were not significantly associated with cortical glucose metabolism. INTERPRETATION: Lower sleep efficiency could be an early symptom of greater brain amyloid burden at the mild cognitive impairment stage. Therefore, the assessment of sleep may be useful for identifying individuals at higher risk for brain amyloid burden. Future longer term observational studies are required to confirm these findings.
