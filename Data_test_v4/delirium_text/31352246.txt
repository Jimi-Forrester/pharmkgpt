31352246|t|Triazole derivatives as inhibitors of Alzheimer's disease: Current developments and structure-activity relationships.
31352246|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a well known neurodegenerative disorder alarming millions of people worldwide and the subsequent epidemiological statistics highlights the implication of the disease. AD is a multi-factorial disease, a variety of single-target directed drugs that have reached clinical trials have unsuccessful. Hence, various factors associated without set of AD have been considered in targeted drug discovery and development. Triazoles are five-membered heterocyclic scaffold due to their broad range of biological activities. The present review focuses on the recent developments in the area of medicinal chemistry to explore the diverse chemical structures of potential inhibitors of Alzheimer's disease and also look at its structure-activity relationships (SAR) studies of bioactive compounds for future discovery of suitable drug candidates. The prominence has been given on the major advancements in the medicinal brochure of this pharmacophore for the period during 2012-2019.
