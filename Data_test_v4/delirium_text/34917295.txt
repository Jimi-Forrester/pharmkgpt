METHODS: Young and old rats received daily FAE and RE for 3 months. Using the Passive Avoidance (PA) test, we evaluated the learning and memory of the rats by Step-Through Latency (STL) score. We measured the Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx), Catalase (CATA), Malondialdehyde (MDA) enzymes levels, and Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) in the hippocampus. RESULTS: FAE could significantly increase the STL score (P<0.001) among old rats similar to the rosemary extract consumption. The SOD, GPx, and CATA enzyme activities and the level of TAC significantly increased by the treatments (exercise: P<0.001 for SOD and TAC and P<0.05 for CATA, exercise/rosemary: P<0.001 for all enzymes, and rosemary: P<0.01 for SOD and TAC). Furthermore, the MDA level significantly decreased by the treatments (exercise and exercise/rosemary: P<0.001, rosemary: P<0.01). The partial Pearson test revealed the significant positive correlations between the score of STL (day 2) with the SOD (P<0.01) and TAC (P<0.05) levels and negative correlations between the MDA level and STL score in both days (P<0.05 for the first day and P<0.001 for the second day). CONCLUSION: Similar to the rosemary extract, FAE could increase the working memory and antioxidants activity in old rats in 3 months.
