25475212|a|INTRODUCTION: Appropriate management of analgo-sedation in the intensive care unit (ICU) is associated with improved patient outcomes. Our objectives were: a) to describe utilization of analgo-sedation regimens and strategies (assessment using scales, protocolized analgo-sedation and daily sedation interruption (DSI)) and b) to describe and compare perceptions challenging utilization of these strategies, amongst physicians and nurses. METHODS: In the 101 adult ICUs in Belgium, we surveyed all physicians and a sample of seven nurses per ICU. A multidisciplinary team designed a survey tool based on a previous qualitative study and a literature review. The latter was available in paper (for nurses essentially) and web based (for physicians). Topics addressed included: practices, perceptions regarding recommended strategies and demographics. Pre-testing involved respondents' debriefings and test re-test reliability. Four reminders were sent. RESULTS: Response rate was 60% (898/1,491 participants) representing 94% (95/101) of all hospitals. Protocols were available to 31% of respondents. Validated scales to monitor pain in patients unable to self-report and to monitor sedation were available to 11% and 75% of respondents, respectively. Frequency of use of sedation scales varied (never to hourly). More physicians than nurses agreed with statements reporting benefits of sedation scales, including: increased autonomy for nurses (82% versus 68%, P < 0.001), enhancement of their role (84% versus 66%, P < 0.001), aid in monitoring administration of sedatives (83% versus 68%, P < 0.001), and cost control (54% versus 29%, P < 0.001). DSI was used in less than 25% of patients for 75% of respondents. More nurses than physicians indicated DSI is contra-indicated in hemodynamic instability (66% versus 53%, P < 0.001) and complicated weaning from mechanical ventilation (47% versus 29%, P < 0.001). Conversely, more physicians than nurses indicated contra-indications including: seizures (56% versus 40%, P < 0.001) and refractory intracranial hypertension (90% versus 83%, P < 0.001). More nurses than physicians agreed with statements reporting DSI impairs patient comfort (60% versus 37%, P < 0.001) and increases complications such as self-extubation (82% versus 69%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Current analgo-sedation practices leave room for improvement. Physicians and nurses meet different challenges in using appropriate analgo-sedation strategies. Implementational interventions must be tailored according to profession.
