34988303|a|Patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) experience worsening axial symptoms with disease progression, which can negatively affect quality of life. Previous phase 2 and 3 clinical trials conducted in Japan showed that zonisamide improved parkinsonism in patients with DLB. In the present study, we performed a post hoc analysis of pooled data from the previous phase 2 and 3 trials to examine the effect of zonisamide on axial symptoms in this patient group. In our pooled analysis, the primary outcome was the change from baseline to 12 weeks in axial symptom score, measured as the sum of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III items relevant to gait/balance/midline function. A total of 498 patients were included in this analysis. Zonisamide 25 mg and 50 mg significantly reduced the axial symptom score at week 12 compared with placebo (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively, by mixed model of repeated measures). Our findings indicate that zonisamide may improve axial symptoms in DLB with parkinsonism and, thus, may potentially reduce the risk of falls and improve quality of life in this vulnerable patient population.
