39005956|t|Nanoparticles in Periodontitis Therapy: A Review of the Current Situation.
39005956|a|Periodontitis is a disease of inflammation that affects the tissues supporting the periodontium. It is triggered by an immunological reaction of the gums to plaque, which leads to the destruction of periodontal attachment structures. Periodontitis is one of the most commonly recognized dental disorders in the world and a major factor in the loss of adult teeth. Scaling and root planing remain crucial for managing patients with persistent periodontitis. Nevertheless, exclusive reliance on mechanical interventions like periodontal surgery, extractions, and root planning is insufficient to halt the progression of periodontitis. In response to the problem of bacterial resistance, some researchers are committed to finding alternative therapies to antibiotics. In addition, some scholars focus on finding new materials to provide a powerful microenvironment for periodontal tissue regeneration and promote osteogenic repair. Nanoparticles possess distinct therapeutic qualities, including exceptional antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, immunomodulatory capacities, and the promotion of bone regeneration ability, which made them can be used for the treatment of periodontitis. However, there are many problems that limit the clinical translation of nanoparticles, such as toxic accumulation in cells, poor correlation between in vitro and in vivo, and poor animal-to-human transmissibility. In this paper, we review the present researches on nanoparticles in periodontitis treatment from the perspective of three main categories: inorganic nanoparticles, organic nanoparticles, and nanocomposites (including nanofibers, hydrogels, and membranes). The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive and recent update on nanoparticles-based therapies for periodontitis. The conclusion section summarizes the opportunities and challenges in the design and clinical translation of nanoparticles for the treatment of periodontitis.
