36348564|a|The incidence of carbamate insecticide poisoning has increased gradually in recent years, and anticholinergic drugs are the specific antidotes. In 2020, the Peking University Third Hospital admitted a patient with carbamate insecticide poisoning, whose main clinical manifestations were dizziness, vomiting and blurred vision. During the treatment with penehyclidine hydrochloride, the patient developed delirium. This paper retrospectively analyzed the clinical data and treatment process of the patient to improve people's understanding of the side effects of penhyclidine hydrochloride in the treatment of insecticide poisoning.
