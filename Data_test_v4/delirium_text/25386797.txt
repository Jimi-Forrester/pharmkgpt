25386797|a|There is a perennial need to extend geriatrics knowledge and expertise to primary care providers to meet the unique needs of older patients. Reaching the target population of providers in an effective manner presents challenges for educators and evaluation of education programs. Gaps in a previous dissemination of an Assessment Guide for delirium, dementia, and depression were addressed through a multimodal strategy to reach a greater proportion of the intended audience, primary care clinicians, and to further evaluate the clinical impact of this learning resource. Sixty-five health care providers completed a forced choice online questionnaire. The majority of respondents were primary care providers (62.5%) who used the Assessment Guide in clinical activities such as patient assessment and patient education. Semistructured interviews with selected key informants (N = 16) provided examples of clinical impact such as improved diagnosis and changes in medication.
