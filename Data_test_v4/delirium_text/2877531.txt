2877531|t|[Structure of the anxious-delusional syndrome of schizophrenic patients during treatment with anxiolytics].
2877531|a|To study a correlation between anxiety and delirium, 50 schizophrenic patients with the anxiety-delirious syndrome were treated with anxiolytics (leponex and phenazepam). The results were evaluated with the help of a special graded scale. The first control group consisted of 20 patients with vascular and organic psychoses with the anxiety-delirious syndrome who were treated by phenazepam. The second control group was composed of 20 schizophrenics with analogous symptomatology treated by traditional neuroleptics (haloperidol and tisercin). In many patients reduction of anxiety closely and directly correlated with that of delirium, which evidenced the leading role of anxiety in the structure of the syndrome in those patients. It has been demonstrated that in patients of this group treatment with antianxiety drugs is more effective than that with conventional neuroleptics. The diazepam test is proposed as a method of predicting the effect of anxiolytic therapy.
