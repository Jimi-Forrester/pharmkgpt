34423248|a|BACKGROUND: A papillary fibroelastoma of the aortic valve has been reported as a rare cause of myocardial ischaemia. An advanced combined interventional and surgical approach leading to sufficient therapy for the patient is presented in this case report. CASE SUMMARY: A 56-year-old female patient presented in an emergency room of a hospital with an acute coronary syndrome. Over 1.5 years, recurrent stable angina had been known in the patient and significant coronary artery disease has already been ruled out in a previous coronary angiogram. The patient was immediately transferred to the catheter laboratory due to cardiogenic shock where a drug-eluting stent was implanted to, firstly, recanalize the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and, secondly, to protect the left main ostium from obstruction by an echocardiographic-proven mass. During subsequent deterioration of haemodynamics caused by decreasing left ventricular function and acute severe mitral insufficiency, firstly an intra-aortic balloon pump and secondly a veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was established through the femoral vessels. The patient was transferred to our cardiac surgery unit and was successfully operated utilizing a valve-sparing technique by extracting the tumour mass from the left coronary cusp and extracting the stent carefully from the LMCA. Histology revealed a papillary fibroelastoma. CONCLUSION: A papillary fibroelastoma of the aortic valve with intermittent obstruction of the coronary arteries requires surgical therapy. Interventional recanalization and extracorporeal support might be useful strategies to ensure the patient's safety as a bridge to surgery.
