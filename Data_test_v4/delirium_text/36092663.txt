36092663|t|Comprehensive review of alpha-carboline alkaloids: Natural products, updated synthesis, and biological activities.
36092663|a|alpha-carboline (9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole), contains a pyridine ring fused with an indole backbone, is a promising scaffold for medicinal chemistry. In recent decades, accumulating evidence shows that alpha-carboline natural products and their derivatives possess diverse bioactivities. However, hitherto, there is no comprehensive review to systematically summarize this important class of alkaloids. In this perspective, this paper represents the first review to provide a comprehensive description of alpha-carbolines including natural products, updated literature of synthesis, and their diverse biological activities. Their biological activities including antitumor, anti-microbial, anti-Alzheimer's disease, anti-atherosclerosis, and antioxidant activities were hilighted. And the targets and the main structure activity relationships (SARs) will be presented. Finally, challenges and future directions of this class of compounds will be discussed. This review will be helpful in understanding and encouraging further exploration for this group of alkaloids.
