38398848|t|A Cohort Study of the Influence of the 12-Component Modified Japanese Diet Index on Oral and Gut Microbiota in the Japanese General Population.
38398848|a|The Japanese diet is a healthy dietary pattern, and the oral or gut microbiota have been identified as the main factors underlying the beneficial effects of the Japanese diet. However, epidemiological studies on Japanese dietary patterns calculated from daily eating habits in the general population yielded inconsistent findings. This study aimed to determine the association between the 12-component modified Japanese Diet Index (mJDI12) and the oral and gut microbiota in the general population of a rural area in Japan. After propensity-score matching, 396 participants (198 each in the low and high mJDI12 groups) were picked out. One year after the follow up survey, we reclassified the subjects and compared the low and high mJDI12 groups again. Participants with a high mJDI12 had a higher relative abundance of butyric acid-producing bacteria in their gut microbiota. Moreover, the significantly higher dietary fiber intake in the high mJDI12 group suggested that the high intake of dietary fiber contributed to an increase in butyric acid-producing bacteria in the gut. In contrast, in individuals with a high mJDI12, only Allpprevotella was decreased in the oral microbiota. Thus, the Japanese dietary pattern can have beneficial effects by improving the oral and gut microbiota.
