31062326|t|The Roles of Apolipoprotein E, Lipids, and Glucose in the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease.
31062326|a|Although the mechanisms by which Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurs remains unclear, it is widely accepted that both genetic and nongenetic components contribute to the pathogenesis of AD, especially the sporadic form of the disease. Nongenetic risk factors include diabetes and dyslipidemia, which are associated with impaired glucose and lipid metabolism, respectively. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), one of the major lipid carriers in the brain, is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. Several studies indicate that ApoE isoforms differentially affect not only lipid metabolism but also glucose metabolism or related pathways, suggesting that these risk factors contribute to the pathogenesis of AD through some common mechanisms. In this chapter, we discuss the roles of ApoE, lipids, and glucose in the pathogenesis of AD by considering their potential interactions.
