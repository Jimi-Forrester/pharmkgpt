25446575|a|Increasing evidence suggests that 17beta-estradiol, a sex hormone, is synthesized by neurons. In addition, 17alpha-estradiol, the stereoisomer of 17beta-estradiol, is reported to be the dominant form in the male mouse brain. However, probably because the method to detect these isomers requires unusual and precise experimental design, the presence of this endogenous 17alpha-estradiol has not been reported subsequently and the actual role is therefore not well elucidated. We first quantified the estradiol level in hippocampal extracts using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. As a result, 17alpha-estradiol was found in all of the male rats tested, while that of 17beta-estradiol was detected only in a certain subset. The estrogen-biosynthesis inhibitor letrozole decreased the expression of the major presynaptic GABA synthesizing enzyme GAD65 in cultured neurons and the effect was abrogated by exogenously supplied 17alpha-estradiol. Next, injection of the inhibitor into the brain reduced the 17alpha-estradiol level, indicating its biogenesis in the brain. Under the same conditions, immuno-staining of GAD65 was also decreased. Furthermore, the inhibitor treatment increased anxiety index of rats in the open field and this was ameliorated by the addition of 17alpha-estradiol. We showed that 17alpha-estradiol was generated in the brain and acted as a regulator of inhibitory neurotransmission as well as behavior. These results may have implications for a variety of diseases, such as the menopausal depression and Alzheimer's disease that have been reported to be related to estrogen levels.
