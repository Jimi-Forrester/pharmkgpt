37079778|a|Evaluating potential therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) depends on use of biomarkers for appropriate subject selection and monitoring disease progression. Biomarkers that predict onset of clinical symptoms are particularly important for AD because they enable intervention before irreversible neurodegeneration occurs. The amyloid-beta-tau-neurodegeneration (ATN) classification system is currently used as a biological staging model for AD and is based on three classes of biomarkers evaluating amyloid-beta (Abeta), tau pathology and neurodegeneration or neuronal injury. Promising blood-based biomarkers for each of these categories have been identified (Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio, phosphorylated tau, neurofilament light chain), and this matrix is now being expanded toward an ATN(I) system, where "I" represents a neuroinflammatory biomarker. The plasma ATN(I) system, together with APOE genotyping, offers a basis for individualized evaluation and a move away from the classic "one size fits all" approach toward a biomarker-driven individualisation of therapy for patients with AD.
