36733547|t|The Rationale for Using Corticosteroids in COVID-19 Encephalopathy: Lessons From a Case Report With Evidence From Literature.
36733547|a|The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus primarily affects the pulmonary system, but neurological manifestations and complication of COVID-19 has been reported in abundance in the literature. We present a case of a middle-aged Caucasian male who was brought to the emergency department for altered mental status. His chief complaints were neurological rather than respiratory. A positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasal swab confirmed the diagnosis. Brain imaging showed mildly dilated ventricles with no other acute findings. As the patient did not require oxygen, he was treated with remdesivir alone without corticosteroids, which is also a precipitating factor of psychosis but, unfortunately, thickly used in practice. That led to remarkable results in full recovery without exposing the patient to steroid therapy. We strongly believe that remdesivir alone is sufficient in treating COVID-19-induced encephalopathy in a patient who does not require oxygen, and evidence supports this practice.
