37587507|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programme following liver transplantation and to further clarify the safety and clinical application value of an ERAS programme. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 250 patients who underwent liver transplant at Beijing You'an Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University between March 2019 and December 2021 was conducted. According to different perioperative management methods, patients were divided into a control group (120 cases) and an ERAS group (130 cases). Postoperative safety indicators, efficacy indicators and economic indicators were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the safety indicators between the two groups. The ERAS group showed significantly lower results compared with the control group in terms of ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pressure injury of oral and nasal mucosa, postoperative pain score 5 days after surgery and the incidence of delirium, whereas the Barthel score 10 days after surgery was significantly higher. There was no significant difference between the two groups in skin pressure injury or the Subjective Global Assessment grade 10 days after surgery. The length of intensive care unit stay, the total length of stay after surgery and the 10-day medical expenses after surgery were significantly lower in the ERAS group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: The application of an ERAS programme after liver transplantation can effectively promote the postoperative recovery of patients and reduce medical costs. Studies have shown that the ERAS programme has important application value in improving the postoperative quality of life and reducing the economic burden of patients after liver transplantation. This programme provides a new concept for related clinical improvement and application.
