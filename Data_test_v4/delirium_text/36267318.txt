36267318|a|Objective: This research is designed to probe into the influence of Narcotrend- (NT-) assisted anesthesia in-depth monitor on cognitive impairment of elderly patients under general anesthesia (GA). Methods: One hundred and forty-four elderly patients with GA in our hospital from October 2020 to April 2021 were randomized into two groups, namely, NT group (supervised anesthesia under NT monitoring) and group C (anesthesia according to doctors' experience). The heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and central venous pressure (CVP) were recorded before surgery (T0), at the beginning of surgery (T1), at the end of surgery (T2), and 1 day after surgery (T3). Serum of patients was obtained at these four time points for measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and cortisol (Cor) levels using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The alterations in cognitive function pre- and post-anesthesia were assessed using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), and adverse events (AEs) during anesthesia recovery, postoperative recovery, and dosage of anesthetics were recorded. Results: At T1 and T2, MAP was higher and CVP was lower in NT group, versus group C. NT group presented higher CRP, IL-6, and Cor than group C at T1-T3. MMSE scores were higher in TN group than in group C at 12, 24, and 48 h after surgery. The incidence rates of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and total AEs in group C were noticeably higher than those in NT group. Compared with group C, the time of anesthesia recovery, extubation, and postanesthesia care unit (PACU) residence in NT group reduced remarkably. Conclusions: NT has little effect on the physical condition of elderly patients under GA, and can reduce the dosage of narcotic drugs and promote the recovery of patients from anesthesia, which has high clinical value.
