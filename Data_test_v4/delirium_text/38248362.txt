38248362|t|Patterned Sensory Enhancement, a Music Rehabilitation Therapy for Elderly Patients with Neuromotor Deficit during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Pilot Study.
38248362|a|(1) Background: The Patterned Sensory Enhancement (PSE) technique refers to a music-based rehabilitation therapy strategy used in neurological pathologies. (2) Methods: This study aims at developing a music-drill protocol for recovery in elderly patients with neuromuscular degenerative pathologies. Each music drill is based on a number of specific music-composition parameters. The conclusions represent suggestions for further enhancing the PSE technique through collaborations between the rehabilitation team and the musicians involved due to the importance of the music stimuli used as a therapy. (3) Results: The music-composition parameters used in this study relate to the existence of music homogeneity factors such as the key signature and rhythm; the importance of the major scale and the tonal system in general; the obvious music suggestions of movement, repetition or absence of movement; the importance of rhythm; the introduction of musical instruments in order to harmonize the music material as much as possible; the connection between PSE music along with patients' musical taste and the musical recording as a therapy during patient outcare; (4) Conclusions: The therapy efficiency was observed by measurements taken before and after the therapeutic intervention by means of a Takei dynamometer. The present study asserts that for a patient undergoing the PSE technique, the researcher should compose personalized music material adapted to each patient's peculiarities.
