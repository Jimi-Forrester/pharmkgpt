2766394|a|The cholinomimemtic substance 7-methoxyacrine was administered to eight patients, incl. 5 patients with tardive dyskinesias after neuroleptic drugs. In all patients an europhorizing effect was recorded, all five patients with tardive dyskinesias improved markedly after a single dose, in one female patient after repeated administration symptoms of tardive dyskinesia were eliminated. The incidence of side effects is minimal. Based on our modest experience we consider 7-methoxyacrine an important extension of therapeutic possibilities, in particular in tardive dyskinesias. The authors plan to test 7-methoxyacrine also in other indications, in particular in Alzheimer's disease and in side-effects caused by psychopharmaceutical preparations.
