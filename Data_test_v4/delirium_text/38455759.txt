38455759|t|Alzheimer's disease: In silico study of rosemary diterpenes activities.
38455759|a|The global surge in Alzheimer's disease poses a significant public health concern. In response, we study the efficacy of carnosic acid and related abietane-type diterpenes extracted from rosemary as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors. Our analyses, using in silico techniques, encompassed all the compounds within this extract. Through molecular docking, we explored how these compounds interact with the active site of the AChE protein. The docking scores, ranging from -5.560 Kcal/mol to -7.270 Kcal/mol, indicate robust binding affinities. Assessment of the ADME/T (Adsorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) properties and pharmacokinetics of these compounds reveal favorable profiles for all the tested substances. These encouraging results suggest the potential of these compounds as candidates for further development to prevent and/or treat Alzheimer's disease. Among these compounds, we find rosmanol as the most likely candidate for further research and clinical trials to validate their efficacy.
