37879110|t|Stereoselective Synthesis, Pro-resolution, and Anti-inflammatory Actions of RvD5n-3 DPA.
37879110|a|The methyl ester of resolvin D5n-3 DPA, a lipid mediator biosynthesized from the omega-3 fatty acid n-3 docosapentaenoic acid, was stereoselectively prepared in 8% yield over 12 steps (longest linear sequence). The key steps for the introduction of the two stereogenic secondary alcohols were an organocatalyzed oxyamination and the Midland Alpine borane reduction. For the assembly of the carbon chain, the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction and the Takai olefination were utilized. The physical properties, including retention time in liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectra, of the synthetic material were matched against material from human peripheral blood and mouse infectious exudates. Synthetic RvD5n-3 DPA, obtained just prior to biological experiments, displayed potent leukocyte-directed activities, upregulating the ability of neutrophils and macrophages to phagocytose bacteria, known as hallmark bioactions of specialized pro-resolving endogenous mediators.
