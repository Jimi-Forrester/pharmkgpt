32295075|a|Accumulating evidence points to a link between circadian clock dysfunction and the molecular events that drive tumorigenesis. Here, we investigated the connection between the circadian clock and the hallmarks of cancer in an in vitro model of colorectal cancer (CRC). We used a cross-platform data normalization method to concatenate and compare available microarray and RNA-sequencing time series data of CRC cell lines derived from the same patient at different disease stages. Our data analysis suggests differential regulation of molecular pathways between the CRC cells and identifies several of the circadian and likely clock-controlled genes (CCGs) as cancer hallmarks and circadian drug targets. Notably, we found links of the CCGs to Huntington's disease (HD) in the metastasis-derived cells. We then investigated the impact of perturbations of our candidate genes in a cohort of 439 patients with colon adenocarcinoma retrieved from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The analysis revealed a correlation of the differential expression levels of the candidate genes with the survival of patients. Thus, our study provides a bioinformatics workflow that allows for a comprehensive analysis of circadian properties at different stages of colorectal cancer, and identifies a new association between cancer and HD.
