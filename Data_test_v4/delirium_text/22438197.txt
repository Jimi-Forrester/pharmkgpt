22438197|t|Neuroendocrinology-based therapy for Alzheimer's disease.
22438197|a|The nervous system interacts directly with the endocrine system to control a plethora of central nervous system (CNS) functions. Metabolic and reproductive hormones are known to be important in the maintenance of neuronal health and their fluctuations are important for CNS aspects ranging from sleep and appetite regulation to cognitive function. This review will summarize and critically evaluate how age-related changes in sex and metabolic hormones modulate affect cognitive function and the implications of targeting the neuroendocrinological system as a therapeutic strategy in Alzheimer's disease.
