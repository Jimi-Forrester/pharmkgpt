36399251|t|Direct and Indirect Effects of Filamin A on Tau Pathology in Neuronal Cells.
36399251|a|In Alzheimer disease (AD), Tau, an axonal microtubule-associated protein, becomes hyperphosphorylated, detaches from microtubules, accumulates, and self-aggregates in the somatodendritic (SD) compartment. The accumulation of hyperphosphorylated and aggregated Tau is also seen in other neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-Tau). Previous studies reported a link between filamin A (FLNA), an actin-binding protein found in the SD compartment, and Tau pathology. In the present study, we further explored this link. We confirmed the interaction of Tau with FLNA in neuroblastoma 2a (N2a) cells. This interaction was mediated by a domain located between the 157 and 383 amino acids (a.a.) of Tau. Our results also revealed that the overexpression of FLNA resulted in an intracellular accumulation of wild-type Tau and Tau mutants (P301L, V337M, and R406W) in N2a cells. Tau phosphorylation and cleavage by caspase-3 but not its aggregation were increased upon FLNA overexpression in N2a cells. In the parietal cortex of AD brain, insoluble FLNA was increased compared to control brain, but it did not correlate with Tau pathology. Interestingly, Tau binding to microtubules and F-actin was preserved upon FLNA overexpression in N2a cells. Lastly, our results revealed that FLNA also induced the accumulation of annexin A2, a Tau interacting partner involved in its axonal localization. Collectively, our data indicated that in Tauopathies, FLNA could contribute to Tau pathology by acting on Tau and annexin A2.
