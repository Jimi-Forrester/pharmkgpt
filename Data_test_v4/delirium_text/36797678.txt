36797678|t|Economic outcomes associated with diagnosed behavioral symptoms among patients with dementia in the United States: a health care claims database analysis.
36797678|a|BACKGROUND: Behavioral symptoms are common in patients with dementia. However, there is limited evidence of their economic burden. Among commercially insured patients with dementia in the United States, this study assessed the prevalence of diagnosed behavioral symptoms and whether healthcare resources utilization and costs were associated with these symptoms. METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted using the IBM  MarketScan  Commercial Claims and Encounters and Medicare Supplemental database from October 1, 2015, to September 30, 2019. Diagnoses of dementia and behavioral symptoms were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Modification codes. To test differences in patient characteristics among those with and without diagnosed behavioral symptoms, t-tests were used for continuous variables, and chi-square tests were used for categories. Generalized linear models were used to compare healthcare resource utilization and costs between patients with and without diagnosed behavioral symptoms, adjusted for baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 62,901 patients with dementia included in the analysis, 16.5% had diagnosed behavioral symptoms 12 months post dementia diagnosis. Patients with diagnosed behavioral symptoms used more health care resources (mean annual pharmacy visits per patient: 39.83 vs. 33.08, mean annual outpatient visits per patient: 24.20 vs. 16.94, mean annual inpatient visits per patient: 0.98 vs. 0.47, mean annual ER visits per patient: 2.45 vs. 1.21) and incurred higher cost of care than those without diagnosed behavioral symptoms (mean annual total health care costs per patients: $63,268 versus $33,383). Inpatient care was the most significant contributor to total costs (adjusted annual mean cost per patient: $28,195 versus $12,275). CONCLUSION: Behavioral symptoms were significantly associated with higher healthcare resource utilization and costs among patients with dementia. Further research is warranted to address the unmet medical needs of this patient population.
