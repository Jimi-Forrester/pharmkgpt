28819639|a|Glutamate theories of schizophrenia suggest that the disease is associated with a loss of NMDA receptors, specifically on GABAergic parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PVIs), leading to changes in the excitation-inhibition balance in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Oxidative stress contributes to the loss of PVI and the development of schizophrenia. Here, we investigated whether the glutathione precursor N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) can prevent changes in synaptic transmission at pyramidal cells and PVIs that result from developmental NMDAR blockade and how these changes are related to mitochondrial dysfunction in the PFCs of mice. Perinatal treatment with ketamine induced persistent changes in the reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione (glutathione disulfide) ratio in the medial PFC, indicating long-lasting increases in oxidative stress. Perinatal ketamine treatment also reduced parvalbumin expression, and it induced a decline in mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as elevations in mitochondrial superoxide levels. At the level of synaptic function ketamine reduced inhibition onto layer 2/3 pyramidal cells and increased excitatory drive onto PVI, indicating long-lasting disruptions in the excitation-inhibition balance. These changes were accompanied by layer-specific alterations in NMDAR function in PVIs. All of these changes were mitigated by coadministration of NAC. In addition, NAC given only during late adolescence was also able to restore normal mitochondria function and inhibition at pyramidal cells. These results show that ketamine-induced alterations in PFC physiology correlate with cell type-specific changes in mitochondria function. The ability of NAC to prevent or restore these changes supports the usefulness of antioxidant supplementation in the treatment of schizophrenia.
