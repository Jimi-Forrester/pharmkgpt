35558463|a|Malignant glioma remains one of the most challenging diseases to treat because of the invasive growth of glioma cells and the existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which blocks drug delivery to the brain. New strategies are urgently needed to overcome these shortcomings and improve the outcomes. Ultrasound represents a promising noninvasive and reversible BBB opening approach and the related sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is rapidly emerging. This study aims to explore the ultrasound parameters for BBB opening and the cell killing effect of SDT in human glioma U373 cells by using a recently reported sonosensitizer, sinoporphyrin sodium (DVDMS). The in vitro BBB model indicated that SDT caused a time-dependent permeability increase, which peaked at 2 h post treatment and then recovered gradually. The results of toxicology tests showed significant U373 cell viability loss and apoptosis increase after DVDMS-SDT, accompanied by enhanced cleaved-caspase-3 level and DNA fragmentation, in which reactive oxygen species (ROS) were a major triggering intermediate during DVDMS-SDT. Furthermore, DVDMS-SDT produced DNA damage and the underlying mechanisms were evaluated, in order to provide a fundamental basis for DVDMS-SDT application in glioma therapy. The findings indicated that the DNA molecules could be temporarily regulated by SDT and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which increased the difficulty of cellular self-repair, thus aggravating cell apoptosis and inhibiting glioma cell invasive growth. Therefore, this study supports the use of SDT as an alternative approach for glioma therapy.
