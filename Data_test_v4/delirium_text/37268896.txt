37268896|a|BACKGROUND: The purpose of the Korean Hip Fracture Registry (KHFR) Study is to establish a nationwide, hospital-based prospective cohort study of adults with hip fracture to explore the incidence and risk factors of second osteoporotic fractures for a Fracture Liaison Service (FLS) model. METHODS: The KHFR, a prospective multicenter longitudinal study, was launched in 2014. Sixteen centers recruited participants who were treated for hip fracture. The inclusion criteria were patients, who were treated for proximal femur fracture due to low-energy trauma and aged 50 or more at the time of injury. Until 2018, 5,841 patients were enrolled in this study. Follow-up surveys were conducted annually to determine occurrence of second osteoporotic fracture, and 4,803 participants completed at least one follow-up survey. DISCUSSION: KHFR is a unique resource of individual level on osteoporotic hip fracture with radiological, medical, and laboratory information including DXA (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry), bone turnover marker, body composition, and hand grip strength for future analyses for FLS model. Modifiable factors for mortality after hip surgery is planned to be identified with nutritional assessment and multi-disciplinary interventions from hospitalization to follow-ups. The proportions of femoral neck, intertrochanteric, and subtrochanteric fractures were 517 (42.0%), 730 (53.6%), and 60 (4.4%), respectively, from 2014 to 2016, which was similar in other studies. Radiologic definition of atypical subtrochanteric fracture was adopted and 17 (1.2%) fractures among 1,361 proximal femoral fractures were identified. Internal fixation showed higher reoperation rate compared to arthroplasty in unstable intertrochanteric fractures (6.1% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.046) with no significant difference in mortality. The KHFR plans to identify outcomes and risk factors associated with second fracture by conducting a 10-year cohort study, with a follow-up every year, using 5,841 baseline participants. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Present study was registered on Internet-based Clinical Research and Trial management system (iCReaT) as multicenter prospective observational cohort study (Project number: C160022, Date of registration: 22th, Apr, 2016).
