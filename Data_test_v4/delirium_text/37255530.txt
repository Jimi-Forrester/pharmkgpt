37255530|t|Exercise-Induced Autophagy Ameliorates Motor Symptoms Progressivity in Parkinson's Disease Through Alpha-Synuclein Degradation: A Review.
37255530|a|This study reviews the molecular mechanism of exercise-induced autophagy/mitophagy and its possible mechanism in delaying motor symptoms progressivity in Parkinson's disease (PD). Relevant articles obtained from PubMed and EBSCOhost were reviewed. After analyzing the articles, it was found that autophagy can be induced by exercise and can possibly be activated through the AMPK-ULK1 pathway. Mitophagy can also be induced by exercise and can possibly be activated through PINK1/Parkin pathway and AMPK-dependent pathway. Moreover, exercise-induced autophagy can decrease the accumulation of toxic alpha-synuclein aggregates in PD and therefore can delay motor symptoms progressivity.
