35431881|t|The Combined Use of Neuropsychiatric and Neuropsychological Assessment Tools to Make a Differential Dementia Diagnosis in the Presence of "Long-Haul" COVID-19.
35431881|a|The longer term neurocognitive/neuropsychiatric consequences of moderate/severe COVID-19 infection have not been explored. The case herein illustrates a complex web of differential diagnosis. The onset, clinical trajectory, treatment course/response, serial neuroimaging findings, and neuropsychological test data were taken into account when assessing a patient presenting 8 months post-COVID-19 (with premorbid attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, diabetes mellitus, mood difficulties, and a positive family history of vascular dementia). Her acute COVID-19 infection was complicated by altered mental status associated with encephalopathy and bacterial pneumonia. After recovery from COVID-19, the patient continues to experience persisting cognitive and emotive difficulties despite an ongoing psychopharmacotherapy regimen (16 + years), psychotherapy (15 + sessions), and speech-language pathology SLP; 2 x week/for 12 weeks). The purpose of her most recent and comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation was to determine the presence/absence of neurocognitive disorder. The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian woman. Cognitive screening was completed 3 months post-acute COVID-19 as part of an SLP evaluation, and a full neuropsychological evaluation was conducted 8 months post-COVID-19 recovery on an outpatient basis (in person). The patient had serial neuroimaging. Initial neurological evaluation during acute COVID-19 included unremarkable brain computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging. However, follow-up CT (without contrast) revealed, in part, "asymmetric perisylvian atrophy on the left." Full neuropsychological evaluation at 8 months post-COVID-19 recovery revealed a dysexecutive syndrome characterized by language dysfunction and affective theory-of-mind deficit, consistent with dementia. There is need for careful use of differential diagnosis in COVID-19 patients with multiple risk factors that make them more susceptible to long-term neurological complications post-COVID-19. Differential diagnosis should involve multidisciplinary assessment (e.g., neuropsychology, SLP, neurology, and psychiatry).
