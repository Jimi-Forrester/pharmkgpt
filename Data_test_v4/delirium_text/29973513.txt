29973513|t|C. elegans-An Emerging Model to Study Metal-Induced RAGE-Related Pathologies.
29973513|a|The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a multi-ligand receptor, is mostly associated with promoting inflammation and oxidative stress. In addition to advanced glycation end products (AGEs), its ligands include High mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB-1), S-100 proteins and beta-sheet fibrils. The effects of several metals and metalloids on RAGE expression and activation have been recently studied: in vivo and in vitro exposure to methylmercury, selenium, zinc, manganese, and arsenic was associated with a variety of RAGE-related alterations and behavioral impairments, which are mostly dependent upon the administration procedure (local vs. systemic) and age during exposure. Recently, C. elegans has been proposed as a potential novel model for studying RAGE-related pathologies; preliminary data regarding such model and its potential contribution to the study of metal-induced RAGE-related pathologies are discussed.
