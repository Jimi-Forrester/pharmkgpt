29213830|t|Very late-onset behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia.
29213830|a|Current concepts regarding frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) have evolved rapidly in recent years. Genetically determined FTLD cohorts have broadened our knowledge pertaining to its clinical presentation, neuroimaging findings and demographics. In this study we present a case report of a patient diagnosed with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia diagnosis in her nineties during hospital admission for a ground-level fall. We believe this case reinforces the pervasive nature of this clinical entity, and may contribute to an increased awareness of this diagnostic possibility in late-onset dementia.
