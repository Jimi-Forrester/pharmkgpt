39028951|t|Self-Blinking Thioflavin T for Super-resolution Imaging.
39028951|a|Thioflavin T (ThT) is a typical dye used to visualize the aggregation and formation of fibrillar structures, e.g., amyloid fibrils and peptide nanofibrils. ThT has been considered to produce stable fluorescence when interacting with aggregated proteins. For single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM)-based optical super-resolution imaging, a photoswitching/blinking fluorescence property is required. Here we demonstrate that, in contrast to previous reports, ThT exhibits intrinsic stochastic blinking properties, without the need for blinking imaging buffer, in stable binding conditions. The blinking properties (photon number, blinking time, and on-off duty cycle) of ThT at the single-molecule level (for ultralow concentrations) were investigated under different conditions. As a proof of concept, we performed SMLM imaging of ThT-labeled alpha-synuclein fibrils measured in air and PBS buffer.
