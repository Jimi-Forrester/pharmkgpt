39075627|t|Nutritional therapy for the prevention of post-intensive care syndrome.
39075627|a|Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) is a triad of physical, cognitive, and mental impairments that occur during or following the intensive care unit (ICU) stay, affecting the long-term prognosis of the patient and also the mental health of the patient's family. While the severity and duration of the systemic inflammation are associated with the occurrence of ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW), malnutrition and immobility during the treatment can exacerbate the symptoms. The goal of nutrition therapy in critically ill patients is to provide an adequate amount of energy and protein while addressing specific nutrient deficiencies to survive the inflammatory response and promote recovery from organ dysfunctions. Feeding strategy to prevent ICU-AW and PICS as nutrition therapy involves administering sufficient amounts of amino acids or proteins later in the acute phase after the hyperacute phase has passed, with specific attention to avoid energy overfeeding. Physiotherapy can also help mitigate muscle loss and subsequent physical impairment. However, many questions remain to be answered regarding the potential role and methods of nutrition therapy in association with ICU-AW and PICS, and further research is warranted.
