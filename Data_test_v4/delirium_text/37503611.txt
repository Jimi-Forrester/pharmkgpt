37503611|t|NAD+, Axonal Maintenance, and Neurological Disease.
37503611|a|SIGNIFICANCE: The remarkable geometry of the axon exposes it to unique challenges for survival and maintenance . Axonal degeneration is a feature of peripheral neuropathies, glaucoma, and traumatic brain injury, and an early event in neurodegenerative diseases. Since the discovery of Wallerian degeneration (WD), a molecular program that hijacks NAD+ metabolism for axonal self-destruction, the complex roles of NAD+ in axonal viability and disease have become research priority. RECENT ADVANCES: The discoveries of the protective WldS and of SARM1 activation as the main instructive signal for WD have shed new light on the regulatory role of NAD+ in axonal degeneration in a growing number of neurological diseases. SARM1 has been characterized as a NAD+ hydrolase and sensor of NAD+ metabolism. The discovery of regulators of NMNAT2 proteostasis in axons, the allosteric regulation of SARM1 by NAD+ andNMN, and the existence of clinically relevant windows of action of these signals has opened new opportunities for therapeutic interventions, including SARM1 inhibitors and modulators of NAD+ metabolism. CRITICAL ISSUES: Events upstream and downstream of SARM1 remain unclear. Furthermore, manipulating NAD+ metabolism, an overdetermined process crucial in cell survival, for preventing the degeneration of the injured axon may be difficult and potentially toxic. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: There is need for clarification of the distinct roles of NAD+ metabolism in axonal maintenance as contrasted to WD. There is also need to better understand the role of NAD+ metabolism in axonal endangerment in neuropathies, diseases of the white matter, and the early stages of CNS neurodegenerative diseases.
