31171765|t|Abeta oligomers promote oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation via integrin beta1 and Fyn kinase signaling.
31171765|a|Alzheimer s disease (AD) is characterized by a progressive cognitive decline that correlates with the levels of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) oligomers. Strong evidences connect changes of oligodendrocyte function with the onset of neurodegeneration in AD. However, the mechanisms controlling oligodendrocyte responses to Abeta are still elusive. Here, we tested the role of Abeta in oligodendrocyte differentiation, maturation, and survival in isolated oligodendrocytes and in organotypic cerebellar slices. We found that Abeta peptides specifically induced local translation of 18.5-kDa myelin basic protein (MBP) isoform in distal cell processes concomitant with an increase of process complexity of MBP-expressing oligodendrocytes. Abeta oligomers required integrin beta1 receptor, Src-family kinase Fyn and Ca2+/CaMKII as effectors to modulate MBP protein expression. The pharmacological inhibition of Fyn kinase also attenuated oligodendrocyte differentiation and survival induced by Abeta oligomers. Similarly, using ex vivo organotypic cerebellar slices Abeta promoted MBP upregulation through Fyn kinase, and modulated oligodendrocyte population dynamics by inducing cell proliferation and differentiation. Importantly, application of Abeta to cerebellar organotypic slices enhanced remyelination and oligodendrocyte lineage recovery in lysolecithin (LPC)-induced demyelination. These data reveal an important role of Abeta in oligodendrocyte lineage function and maturation, which may be relevant to AD pathogenesis.
