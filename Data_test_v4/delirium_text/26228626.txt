26228626|t|A prospective study on blood Abeta levels and the cognitive function of patients with hemodialysis: a potential therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease.
26228626|a|To obtain the proof of concept of a novel therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD), we conducted two prospective studies with hemodialysis patients who had amyloid beta protein (Abeta) removed from their blood three times a week. One major pathological change in the brain associated with AD is Abeta deposition, mainly 40 amino acids Abeta1-40 and 42 amino acids Abeta1-42. Impaired Abeta clearance is proposed to be one cause of increased Abeta in the AD brain. Thus, we hypothesized that an extracorporeal removal system of Abeta from the blood may remove brain Abeta and be a useful therapeutic strategy for AD. In the first prospective study, plasma Abeta levels and the cognitive function of 30 hemodialysis patients (65-76 years old) were evaluated at baseline as well as 18 or 36 months after. Although plasma Abeta1-40 levels either decreased or remained unchanged, levels of Abeta1-42 either remained unchanged or increased at the second time point. Mini-Mental State Examination scores of most subjects increased or were maintained at the second time point. Abeta1-40 influx into the blood correlated with MMSE at the second time point. In the second prospective study, five patients (51-84 years old) with renal failure were evaluated before and after the initiation of hemodialysis. Plasma Abeta levels decreased, while cognitive function improved after initiating blood Abeta removal. Therefore, long-term hemodialysis, which effectively removes blood Abeta, might alter Abeta influx and help maintain cognitive function.
