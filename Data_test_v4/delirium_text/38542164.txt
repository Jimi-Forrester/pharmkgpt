38542164|t|Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase 3: Unravelling Its Biological Function and Significance in Oncology.
38542164|a|Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP3) is vital in regulating several biological processes. TIMP3 exerts antitumour effects via matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-dependent and MMP-independent pathways. Due to promoter methylation and miRNA binding, TIMP3 expression has been observed to decrease in various cancers. Consequently, the migration and invasion of cancer cells increases. Conflicting results have reported that expression levels of TIMP3 in primary and advanced cancers are higher than those in healthy tissues. Therefore, the role of TIMP3 in cancer biology and progression needs to be elucidated. This review provides an overview of TIMP3, from its biological function to its effects on various cancers. Moreover, gynaecological cancers are discussed in detail. TIMP3 has been associated with cervical adenocarcinoma as well as cancer development in serous ovarian cancer and breast cancer metastasis. However, the relationship between TIMP3 and endometrial cancers remains unclear. TIMP3 may be a useful biomarker for gynaecological cancers and is a potential target for future cancer therapy.
