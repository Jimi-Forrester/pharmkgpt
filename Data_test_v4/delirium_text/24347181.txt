24347181|a|To investigate aberrant genome-wide CpG methylation patterns in cortex brain tissue of APP/PS1 mice and as compared to controls, which allows for identification of novel disease-associated genes. This study investigates the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of the cortex from APP/PS1 transgenic mice and control mice using the Roche NimbleGen chip platform. Functional analysis was then conducted by Ingenuity Pathways Analysis system. The methylated DNA fragments in the genome of each sample were enriched by MeDIP and the whole-genome interrogations were hybridized to the Roche NimbleGen Human DNA Methylation 3x720 K CpG Island Plus RefSeq Promoter Array that cover 15,980 CpG islands and 20,404 reference gene promoter regions of the entire human genome. Analysis reveals 2346 CpG sites representing 485 unique genes as potentially associated with AD disease status pending confirmation in additional study. At the same time, these hyper-methylated genes display familial aggregation. An impairment of the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) signaling pathway has been demonstrated to be specific to the AD brain and, particularly, to the early phase of the disease, supporting a role for epigenetic change of TGF-beta1 in AD pathology. In future research, we will focus on TGF-beta1, as it appeared to be the most promising candidate for AD.
