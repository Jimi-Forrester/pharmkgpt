35323931|t|Nontransgenic Guinea Pig Strains Exhibit Hallmarks of Human Brain Aging and Alzheimer's Disease.
35323931|a|Older age is the primary risk factor for most chronic diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Current preclinical models to study brain aging and AD are mainly transgenic and harbor mutations intended to mirror brain pathologies associated with human brain aging/AD (eg, by increasing production of the amyloid precursor protein, amyloid beta [Abeta], and/or phosphorylated tau, all of which are key pathological mediators of AD). Although these models may provide insight on pathophysiological processes in AD, none completely recapitulate the disease and its strong age-dependence, and there has been limited success in translating preclinical results and treatments to humans. Here, we describe 2 nontransgenic guinea pig (GP) models, a standard PigmEnTed (PET) strain, and lesser-studied Dunkin-Hartley (DH) strain, that may naturally mimic key features of brain aging and AD in humans. We show that brain aging in PET GP is transcriptomically similar to human brain aging, whereas older DH brains are transcriptomically more similar to human AD. Both strains/models also exhibit increased neurofilament light chain (NFL, a marker of neuronal damage) with aging, and DH animals display greater S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100beta), ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1), and Abeta and phosphorylated tau-which are all important markers of neuroinflammation-associated AD. Collectively, our results suggest that both the PET and DH GP may be useful, nontransgenic models to study brain aging and AD, respectively.
