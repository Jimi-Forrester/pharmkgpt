30295038|t|The Role of Gender in Shame, Hostility, and Aggression Experienced by Caregivers for Patients With Dementia.
30295038|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the differences between male and female caregivers for patients with dementia in the way they experience various psychosocial parameters such as shame, hostility, and aggression. The sample included 55 caregivers of patients with moderate and severe dementia, whereas the average age was 51 years. Female caregivers were found to experience significantly higher levels of external shame, measured by Other As Shamer scale, than male caregivers, t (53) = 2.54, P < .01. A significant difference was also found between the female and male caregivers regarding their recorded levels of internal shame, measured by Experience of Shame Scale, with female caregivers experiencing more internal shame than their male counterparts, t (53) = 2.11, P < .01. However, no significant differences were found in hostility and aggression between males and females. These results demonstrate the existence of gender differences in the levels of shame experienced by care providers for patients with dementia.
