37553699|a|BACKGROUND: Pre-procedural fasting to reduce aspiration risk is usual care prior to surgery requiring anesthesia. Prolonged fasting, however, can result in dehydration and may adversely affect patient experience and outcomes. Previous studies suggest that providing a supplemental beverage to patients undergoing cardiac and a variety of other surgical procedures improves patients' subjective assessment of thirst and hunger and potentially decreases the need for inotrope and vasopressor therapy. Less is known, however, about the effects of ad libitum clear liquids up to 2 h prior to surgery. METHODS: Adult patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or arrhythmia ablation were randomized (1:1) to ad libitum clear liquids up to 2 h prior to their procedure vs. nil per os (NPO) after midnight (control group, usual care). The primary endpoint was a composite satisfaction score that included patient-reported thirst, hunger, headache, nausea, lightheadedness, and anxiousness prior to surgery. The incidence of case-delay was recorded. Intraoperative vasopressor administration, changes in creatinine, anti-emetic use, and hospital length of stay (LOS) were recorded. Safety endpoints including aspiration were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 200 patients were randomized and 181 patients were included in the final analysis. Overall, 92% of patients were ASA class III or IV and 23% of patients had NYHA class III or IV symptoms. Groups were well balanced with no significant differences in age, sex or baseline cardiac or renal disease. The composite satisfaction score (primary endpoint) was not significantly different between groups (Ad libitum median = 12, IQR = [6, 17], vs Standard NPO median = 10, IQR = [5, 15], [95% CI = [-1, 4]). No significant differences between the two groups were observed in any of the individual survey questions (thirst, hunger, headache, nausea, lightheadedness, anxiousness). No significant differences between groups were observed for intra-operative vasopressor use, changes in creatinine, rescue anti-emetic use or hospital LOS. There were no case delays attributed to the intervention. There were no cases of suspected aspiration. CONCLUSION: No adverse events or case delays were observed in the ad libitum clears group. No significant benefit, however, was observed in patient satisfaction or any of the pre-specified secondary endpoints in patients randomized to ad libitum clear liquids up to 2 h prior to their procedure.
