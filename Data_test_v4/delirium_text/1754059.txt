1754059|t|Monoamine oxidase B in brains from patients with Alzheimer's disease: a biochemical and autoradiographical study.
1754059|a|In vitro quantitative autoradiography using [3H]L-deprenyl, an irreversible and preferential inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B, was performed to investigate the localization of the enzyme in brains from senile dementia of Alzheimer type and control cases. Brains from three male patients with the clinical diagnosis of senile dementia of Alzheimer type and from three male control patients, without any known clinical history of neurological disorder, were obtained at autopsy. Cryosections of 100 microns thickness were mounted on gelatinized glass plates and dried over desiccant for one week at -20 degrees C. The sections were incubated with 10 nM [3H]L-deprenyl for 1 h and then exposed to film for four weeks. The autoradiographs were analysed by computer-assisted densitometry. Monoamine oxidase-B activities were also estimated in 1% homogenates from 10 different regions, using 10 microM beta-[ethyl-14C]phenylethylamine, in order to study the consonance between the autoradiographical and biochemical techniques. Both [3H]L-deprenyl binding and monoamine oxidase-B activities in senile dementia of Alzheimer type were higher than in the controls in all brain regions studied. The increase was highest in the white matter (about 70%) and in the order of 20-50% in the various gray matter regions. A high correlation coefficient (r approximately 0.9) was obtained between [3H]L-deprenyl binding and monoamine oxidase-B activity, both in the senile dementia of Alzheimer type and in the control brains.
