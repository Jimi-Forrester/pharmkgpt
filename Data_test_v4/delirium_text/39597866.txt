39597866|t|Correlation Between Reduced Daily Living Competence and the Risk of Postoperative Delirium in Orthopedics and Trauma Surgery.
39597866|a|Background/Objectives: Postoperative delirium is a prevalent and serious complication among elderly patients following surgical procedures. Prior research indicates that reduced competence in daily living, as evidenced by limitations in performing Activities of Daily Living (ADL), is directly associated with reduced patient mobility. This study aimed to investigate the potential role of preoperative mobility as a risk factor for the development of postoperative delirium. Methods: To assess preoperative mobility, a comprehensive geriatric evaluation of daily living competence was conducted. This included the Katz Index of Independence in ADL, which assessed basic daily activities over the preceding 14 days, and the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADL). Postoperatively, delirium monitoring was performed twice daily for seven days using validated delirium screening tools, including the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale, the Confusion Assessment Method, and the 4ATest. Results: A significant correlation was observed between the incidence of delirium and the IADL scores in all patients, with p < 0.001 for men and p = 0.001 for women. Among emergency patients, the Katz Index scores significantly differed between those who developed delirium and those who did not (p = 0.015). Additionally, a significant correlation was found between the Katz Index and the incidence of delirium in both groups (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The findings of this study emphasize the necessity of preoperative geriatric assessment using tools such as the Katz Index or IADL to identify patients at risk of delirium. The results confirm the importance of enhanced postoperative monitoring for potential delirium. For elective patients, prehabilitation should be considered when reduced daily living competence is identified. For emergency patients, immediate postoperative interventions, including intensive mobilization and orthogeriatric co-management, are recommended.
