16597524|t|Voting rights for older Americans with dementia: implications for health care providers.
16597524|a|As the population of the United States ages, the prevalence of dementias such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) will increase. With this demographic shift, some older registered voters will lack the cognitive ability to weigh the variables involved in voting and making an informed decision at the ballot. Ramifications of this situation have only recently been considered. Medical and legal procedures to delineate the capacity to vote are lacking in our national policy and are in need of an overhaul. Caution must be taken to avoid indiscriminant disenfranchisement of people with dementia. Health care providers play a pivotal role in supporting older adults with dementia who exercise their voting rights. The purpose of this article is to discuss issues related to voting and older adults with dementia. Implications for gerontological health care providers are presented.
