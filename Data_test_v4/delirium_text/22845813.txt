22845813|t|Myocardial revascularization for the elderly: current options, role of off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and outcomes.
22845813|a|The increase in life expectancy has confronted cardiac surgery with a rapidly growing population of elderly patients requiring surgical myocardial revascularization. Recent advances in surgical and anesthetic techniques and improvements in postoperative care have made coronary artery bypass grafting an established therapeutic option for the treatment of coronary artery disease in this group of patients. However, conventional coronary artery bypass grafting on cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with significant risk and related morbidity and mortality in the elderly. In recent years off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting has emerged as a safe and less invasive strategy for surgical myocardial revascularization. Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting by avoiding the deleterious effects of cardiopulmonary bypass can offer potential benefits to elderly patients requiring surgical myocardial revascularization. This review article provides an overview of the age-related cardiovascular changes, epidemiology of coronary artery disease in the elderly and focuses on outcomes of surgical myocardial revascularization with special emphasis on the impact of off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery in the elderly.
