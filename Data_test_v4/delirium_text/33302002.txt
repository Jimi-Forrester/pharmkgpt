33302002|a|The current study aimed to investigate the effects of a Namaste care program on the quality of life of 25 women with late-stage Alzheimer's disease. The program was implemented two hours daily and four days per week for six months in a nursing facility, Tehran, Iran. Women's quality of life was measured using the Persian version of the Quality of Life in Late-Stage Dementia scale before and after the program implementation. After a six-month intervention with the Namaste care program, the total score of quality of life significantly decreased (17.79 +- 1.10 at the end of trial compared with 24.67 +- 1.62 at baseline, P = 0.01), indicating improved quality of life. This effect was obtained after controlling for demographic variables and comorbidities. Hence, it seems that the Namaste care program might be an effective supportive method to improve the quality of life of women with late-stage Alzheimer's disease in Iranian culture. However, further large-sample studies are needed to investigate the generalizability of the findings.
