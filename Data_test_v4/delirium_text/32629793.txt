32629793|t|Hydroxytyrosol Inhibits Protein Oligomerization and Amyloid Aggregation in Human Insulin.
32629793|a|Hydroxytyrosol (HT), one of the main phenolic components of olive oil, has attracted considerable interest for its biological properties, including a remarkable antioxidant and anti-inflammatory power and, recently, for its ability to interfere with the amyloid aggregation underlying several human diseases. We report here a broad biophysical approach and cell biology techniques that allowed us to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which HT affects insulin amyloid aggregation and the related cytotoxicity. Our data show that HT is able to fully inhibit insulin amyloid aggregation and this property seems to be ascribed to the stabilization of the insulin monomeric state. Moreover, HT completely reverses the toxic effect produced by amyloid insulin aggregates in neuroblastoma cell lines by fully inhibiting the production of toxic amyloid species. These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of olive oil polyphenols, including HT, may arise from multifunctional activities and suggest possible a application of this natural compound in the prevention or treatment of amyloid-associated diseases.
