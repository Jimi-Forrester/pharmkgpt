29350074|a|Objectives The serum concentration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was compared among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), patients with essential tremor (ET), and healthy participants, and its association with clinical features of PD and ET was assessed. Methods Demographic and clinical data were collected from 60 patients with PD at different clinical stages, 60 patients with ET, and 60 controls. All participants' serum BDNF concentrations were measured. Their motor abilities and activity were assessed by the Unified PD Rating Scale and the Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) staging scale. Results Serum BDNF was significantly lower in patients with PD than in patients with ET and controls. BDNF decreased only in the early disease stages (H-Y stages I and II), but increased markedly in the advanced stages (H-Y stages III-V). There was no significant difference between patients with ET and controls. The BDNF concentration was negatively correlated with age at PD onset and positively associated with disease duration, severity of PD symptoms, and treatment with L-DOPA. Conclusions A low serum BDNF concentration may serve as a biomarker in the early stages of PD, whereas a high concentration with PD progression may be due to treatment with L-DOPA in the advanced stages.
