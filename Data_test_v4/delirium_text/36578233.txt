36578233|a|Using two imaging modalities, that is, Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) the present study tested associations between cortical amyloid-beta (Abeta) burden and fornix microstructural changes with cognitive deficits in early Alzheimer's disease (AD), namely deficits in working memory (1-back) processing of visual object categories (faces, places, objects, bodies and verbal material). Second, we examined cortical Abeta associations with fornix microstructure. Seventeen early AD patients and 17 healthy-matched controls were included. Constrained spherical deconvolution-based tractography was used to segment the fornix and a control tract the central branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (CB-SLF) previously implicated in working memory processes. Standard uptake value ratios (SUVR) of Abeta were extracted from 45 cortical/subcortical regions from the AAL atlas and subject to principal component analysis for data reduction. Patients exhibited (i) impairments in cognitive performance (ii) reductions in fornix fractional anisotropy (FA) and (iii) increases in a component that loaded highly on cortical Abeta. There were no group differences in CB-SLF FA and in a component loading highly on subcortical Abeta. Partial correlation analysis in the patient group showed (i) positive associations between fornix FA and performance for all the visual object categories and (ii) a negative association between the cortical Abeta component and performance for the object categories but not for the remaining classes of visual stimuli. A subsequent analysis showed a positive association between overall cognition (performance across distinct 1-back task conditions) with fornix FA but no association with cortical Abeta burden, in keeping with influential accounts on early onset AD. This indicates that the fornix degenerates early in AD and contributes to deficits in working memory processing of visual object categories; though it is also important to acknowledge the importance of prospective longitudinal studies with larger samples. Overall, the effect sizes of fornical degeneration on visual working memory appeared stronger than the ones related to amyloid burden.
