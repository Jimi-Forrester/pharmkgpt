34144048|t|Estimating Prognosis and Frailty in Persons Aged >=75 Years in the Emergency Department: Further Validation of Dynamic Silver Code.
34144048|a|OBJECTIVES: To assess concurrent validity of the Dynamic Silver Code (DSC), a tool based on administrative data that predicts prognosis in older adults accessing the emergency department (ED), in terms of association with markers of poor functional and cognitive status. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were obtained in the AIDEA study, which enrolled a cohort of >=75-year-old patients, accessing the ED of 2 hospitals in Florence, Italy. METHODS: The DSC score and classes (I to IV, corresponding to an increasing risk of death) were obtained from administrative data. Information on health and functional status prior to ED access were collected from face-to-face, direct, or proxy interviews. The 4AT test was administered to screen for possible delirium. Bivariate comparisons of the prevalence of each functional and cognitive marker across 4 DSC classes were performed. Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess the multivariable risk of being in II, III, or IV DSC class vs I. RESULTS: Among 3358 participants (mean age 83 years, men 44%), 32.9%, 30.3%, 19.5%, and 17.2% were in DSC class I, II, III, and IV. Preadmission abnormal functional and cognitive conditions, and delirium in the ED, were increasingly more common from DSC class I through IV (P < .001). In particular, the prevalence of total inability to walk increased from 2.9% (class I) to 23.4% (class IV). In multivariable analyses, this was the strongest predictor of being in progressively worse DSC classes, whereas feeling of exhaustion, reporting of serious falls, weight loss, and severe memory loss or diagnosis of dementia gave some contribution. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The ability of the DSC to predict survival in older persons appears to rely on its prevailing association with markers of functional impairment. These results may support clinical use of the tool.
