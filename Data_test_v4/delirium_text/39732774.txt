39732774|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium, a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by acute disruptions in attention and awareness, significantly impacts children in Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs), leading to prolonged hospitalization, increased infection risk, and dependence on mechanical ventilation. Despite growing recognition, its true burden and risk factors in children remain poorly understood. This prospective cohort study investigated the prevalence, characteristics, and potential therapeutic targets for delirium in 890 children admitted to a tertiary PICU between January and December 2022. Delirium was screened every 12 hours using the validated Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD). We analyzed data on demographics, comorbidities, medications, interventions, and clinical outcomes to identify associations with the development of delirium. Our study revealed a high prevalence of delirium, affecting 69.4% (95% CI: 66.33-72.3) of admitted children. Notably, infants were disproportionately affected, accounting for 33.5% of delirium cases. Respiratory diagnoses were significantly associated with delirium (78.6%), while oncology cases had the lowest prevalence (29.4%). Opioid use was identified as a risk factor, increasing the risk of delirium by 45.2%. Furthermore, 97.6% of children with withdrawal syndrome also experienced delirium, highlighting a strong association between these conditions. Delirium was significantly associated with longer PICU stays, and all 20 mortalities during the study period occurred in delirious patients. The adjusted odds ratios from multi-level regression modeling further elucidated the risk factors associated with the development of delirium. This study demonstrates a high prevalence of delirium in PICUs, with infants and those with respiratory diagnoses being particularly vulnerable. Opioid use and withdrawal syndrome emerged as risk factors. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these associations and develop targeted interventions to prevent, manage, and improve outcomes for children suffering from delirium in critical care settings.
