38633190|a|Background: Canned fish products are widely consumed in Egypt, particularly for protein-rich meals that are quick to prepare and low in calories. Canned fish products are contaminated with toxic metals from the fish itself or from canning materials during processing. Aim: To determine the residual levels of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), aluminum (Al), and Tin (Sn) in some canned fish products obtained from retail shops in Mansoura, Egypt. Furthermore, noncarcinogenic health risks evaluation for the Egyptian population due to hazardous metal oral intake. Methods: One hundred canned fish products (20 each of herring, mackerel, salmon, sardine, and tuna) were collected from May to September 2023, and canned fish products were obtained from Mansoura city markets in Egypt. Samples were digested in a solution composed of 60% nitric acid and 40% perchloric acid, and then an atomic absorption spectrophotometer was used for the detection of selected toxic metals. Results: It was found that the residual level of hazardous metals exceeded the acceptability level established in the European Union for Pb, Cd, and Hg by 20%, 10%, and 10%, 15%, 5%, and 20%, 35%, 30%, and 45%, 25%, 25%, and 40%, in examined herring, mackerel, sardine, and tuna, respectively. In contrast, all salmon samples were accepted for Pb and Hg, and only 5% were not accepted due to a higher Cd level than the maximum permissible limit. The average estimated daily intake of (EDI) is below the tolerable daily intakes (TDIs) for all metals. Comparatively, the EDI of Hg was 0.265 microg/kg body weight (B.W) exceeded TDIs 0.228 microg/kg B.W. The hazard index for canned tuna and sardines is more than one. Conclusion: Canned fish products are contaminated with a variety of toxic metals, especially sardine and tuna. Therefore, it is advised to decrease the consumption rate of such fish products.
