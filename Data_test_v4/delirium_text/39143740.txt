39143740|a|AIM: To develop standardized diagnostic criteria for 'infection-triggered encephalopathy syndrome (ITES)' and five specific clinical syndromes of ITES. METHOD: The draft definitions were based on existing criteria, standardized, and discussed by a panel of international experts using nominal group technique over 18 months to achieve consensus. All criteria use the same format: (1) presence of infection/fever; (2) clinical features including encephalopathy; (3) neuroradiological features on magnetic resonance imaging; (4) exclusion of other causes. RESULTS: We first highlighted differences between ITES and infectious and autoimmune encephalitis, which is the most important differential diagnosis. Consensus was achieved to define five specific ITESs: acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and late reduced diffusion; acute necrotizing encephalopathy; mild encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion; acute fulminant cerebral oedema; and acute shock with encephalopathy and multiorgan failure. Two further conditions that are currently classified as epilepsy syndromes but have similar features to ITES, namely febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome and hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy syndrome, are also discussed. INTERPRETATION: The consensus definition is expected to improve awareness of this disease concept, provide diagnostic framework, and facilitate future international research and clinical trials.
