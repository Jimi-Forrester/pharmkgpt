35895239|a|This quality improvement study assessed the effectiveness of an orthogeriatric service regarding fracture care and outcomes in terms of time to surgery, length of hospital stay, postoperative pain score improvement, depression and treatment decisions. The findings showed a significant reduction in time to surgery and mean length of stay following the implementation of orthogeriatric services (OGS). INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease prevalent amongst the elderly, more commonly females, and puts them at increased risk of fragility fractures. OGS are recommended as a model of best practice for primary and secondary fracture care. METHODS: This quality improvement study, conducted in our facility at Ain Shams University Hospital, Cairo, aimed to determine the effectiveness of an orthogeriatric service. We compared fracture care and outcomes before and after the implementation of OGS in terms of time to surgery, length of hospital stay, degree of postoperative pain score improvement, depression and treatment decisions. We included 128 patients aged 60 and above presenting to the emergency department with a fracture. RESULTS: We found a significant reduction in the median time to surgery in the post-OGS group (p < 0.001) and a significant decrease in the mean length of stay in favour of the post-OGS group (p < 0.001). However, no significant difference was found between the two groups regarding the number of patients treated operatively, degree of postoperative pain improvement or susceptibility to depression. CONCLUSION: Since the orthogeriatric service began, preliminary data have been encouraging, with significant reductions in time to surgery and length of stay. This along with preoperative medical optimisation and collaborative discharge recommendations has improved overall patient outcomes even though more research is needed.
