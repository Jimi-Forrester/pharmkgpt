38173265|a|OBJECTIVE: Little is known about who is involved and what factors influence changes in antidementia medications for older adults living in nursing homes. The study sought to describe factors associated with initiation and discontinuation of antidementia medications in nursing home residents with dementia. DESIGN: National survey of nursing homes with >=30 beds; homes with dementia units were oversampled. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home administrators [eg, Directors of Nursing (DoNs)]. METHODS: In 2022, 1293 homes were surveyed (response rate: 26.6%, n = 340). Weighted analyses provided nationally representative results corrected for nonresponse (n = 14,455). RESULTS: DoNs reported that people always/almost always involved in antidementia medication decisions included nursing home prescriber (84.4%), nursing staff (33.2%), family (23.4%), resident (13.8%), community primary care provider (12.1%), and dementia specialist (5.8%). DoNs reported that antidementia medications were much more likely to be initiated if residents (55.8%) and family members (53.2%) wanted antidementia medications, a dementia specialist was involved (51.9%), resident had aggressive behaviors (44.8%), resisted care (31.6%), or had severe physical/cognitive impairment (22.3%). DoNs reported that antidementia medications were much more likely to be discontinued with dementia specialist involvement (46.5%), progression to severe impairment (39.2%), hospice involvement (31.5%), <6 months' prognosis (28.5%), emergence of aggressive behaviors (25.2%), or resisting care (19.0%) and much less likely to be discontinued if residents (30.2%) and family (27.3%) were reluctant to discontinue. One in 6 homes reported that residents had no immediate family/caregivers usually or almost always/always. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: DoNs report that family/caregivers and dementia specialists have significant influence on antidementia medication decisions in nursing homes, but many residents lack their involvement. Real-world evidence on the risks and benefits of antidementia medications in nursing homes is needed to inform clinical guidance about appropriate use of antidementia medications in nursing homes.
