30987727|t|Reduction of aluminum ion neurotoxicity through a small peptide application - NAP treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
30987727|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in late life. It is difficult to precisely diagnose AD at early stages, making biomarker search essential for further developments. The objective of this study was to identify protein biomarkers associated with aluminum ions toxicity (AD-like toxicity) in a human neuroblastoma cell model, SH-SY5Y and assess potential prevention by NAP (NAPVSIPQ). Complete proteomic techniques were implemented. Four proteins were identified as up-regulated with aluminum ion treatment, CBP80/20-dependent translation initiation factor (CTIF), Early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1), Leucine-rich repeat neuronal protein 4 (LRRN4) and Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit beta (PI3KR2). Of these four proteins, EEA1 and PI3KR2 were down-regulated after NAP-induced neuroprotective activity in neuroblastoma cells. Thus, aluminum ions may increase the risk for neurotoxicity in AD, and the use of NAP is suggested as a treatment to provide additional protection against the effects of aluminum ions, via EEA1 and PI3KR2, associated with sorting and processing of the AD amyloid precursor protein (APP) through the endosomal system.
