38826646|t|Neurophysiological and other features of working memory in older adults at risk for dementia.
38826646|a|Theta-gamma coupling (TGC) is a neurophysiological process that supports working memory. Working memory is associated with other clinical and biological features. The extent to which TGC is associated with these other features and whether it contributes to working memory beyond these features is unknown. Two-hundred-and-three older participants at risk for Alzheimer's dementia-98 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 39 with major depressive disorder (MDD) in remission, and 66 with MCI and MDD (MCI + MDD)-completed a clinical assessment, N-back-EEG, and brain MRI. Among them, 190 completed genetic testing, and 121 completed [11C] Pittsburgh Compound B ([11C] PIB) PET imaging. Hierarchical linear regressions were used to assess whether TGC is associated with demographic and clinical variables; Alzheimer's disease-related features (APOE epsilon4 carrier status and beta-amyloid load); and structural features related to working memory. Then, linear regressions were used to assess whether TGC is associated with 2-back performance after accounting for these features. Other than age, TGC was not associated with any non-neurophysiological features. In contrast, TGC (beta = 0.27; p = 0.006), age (beta = - 0.29; p = 0.012), and parietal cortical thickness (beta = 0.24; p = 0.020) were associated with 2-back performance. We also examined two other EEG features that are linked to working memory-theta event-related synchronization and alpha event-related desynchronization-and found them not to be associated with any feature or performance after accounting for TGC. Our findings suggest that TGC is a process that is independent of other clinical, genetic, neurochemical, and structural variables, and supports working memory in older adults at risk for dementia.
