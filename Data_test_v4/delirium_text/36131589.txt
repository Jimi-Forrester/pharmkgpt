36131589|a|Effective chemotherapy for clinical treatment of brain diseases is still lacking due to the poor penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The aim of this study was to construct a folate modified pterostilbene (Pt) loaded polymeric micellar delivery system (F-Pt/M) with mPEG-PCL as carrier material to aim at penetrating the BBB for brain tissue targeting via receptor-mediated endocytosis. In this study, F-Pt/M was prepared using thin-film hydration method and then optimized by response surface methodology (RSM) with the entrapment efficiency (EE), drug loading (DL) and hydrodynamic diameter (HD) as indexes. The average hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of optimal F-Pt/M were 133.2 nm and 24.6 mV, respectively. DL (18.3%) and EE (98.6%) made the solubility of Pt in water about 25 times higher than that of crude Pt. Results of DSC evaluation revealed that drugs were successfully encapsulated inside the polymeric micelles. TEM images showed that homogeneous spherical micellar structures with a narrow size distribution were developed. The release result in vitro showed that F-Pt/M presented sustained release behavior compared to control free Pt solution. Compared to non-targeted Pt/M, F-Pt/M had a significantly higher cytotoxicity against FR-overexpressing A172 cells. In vitro cellular uptake tests illustrated that the micellar delivery system could significantly improve the accumulation of drugs in target cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. BBB penetration value (P) of F-Pt/M was about 4 folds higher than that of free Pt group. In addition, drug targeting index (DTI) was calculated to determine targeting of F-Pt/M to the brain which was found to be 4.89, implying improved brain targeting was achieved. Hence, the developed F-Pt/M exhibited great potential for delivering more drug molecules across the BBB for the treatment of brain diseases.
