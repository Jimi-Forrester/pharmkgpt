7746367|a|The relationship between anosognosia of memory deficit, intrusions and 'frontal' functions was investigated in 12 Alzheimer (DAT) patients, 12 depressed patients and 24 normal controls. DAT and depressed patients could not be dissociated according to the proportion of intrusion they produced in memory tasks. However, regardless of their clinical diagnosis, patients with anosognosia produced significantly more intrusions than patients without anosognosia, and anosognosia of memory deficit was positively and strongly correlated to the tendency to produce intrusions. By contrast, there was no correlation between intrusions, anosognosia and patients' performance on frontal tasks except for Verbal Fluency. Whereas anosognosia of memory deficit seems indispensable for intrusions, frontal dysfunction must not be considered a necessary condition for intrusions or anosognosia.
