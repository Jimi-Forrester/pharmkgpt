35853346|a|BACKGROUND: Histopathological evidence of cerebral vascular amyloid beta accumulation is the gold standard to diagnose cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Neuroimaging findings obtained with CT and MRI can suggest the presence of CAA when histopathology is lacking. We explored the role of amyloid PET in patients with lobar intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) as this may provide molecular evidence for CAA as well. METHODS: In this retrospective, monocenter analysis, we included consecutive patients with non-traumatic lobar ICH who had undergone amyloid PET. We categorized patients according to amyloid PET status and compared demographics and neuroimaging findings. We calculated sensitivity and specificity of the simplified Edinburgh criteria and amyloid PET with probable modified Boston criteria as reference standard, as well as sensitivity and specificity of the simplified Edinburgh and modified Boston criteria with amyloid PET status as molecular marker for presence or absence of CAA. RESULTS: We included 38 patients of whom 24 (63%) were amyloid PET positive. Amyloid PET positive patients were older at presentation (p = 0.004). We observed no difference in prevalence of subarachnoid hemorrhages, fingerlike projections or microbleeds between both groups, but cortical superficial siderosis (p = 0.003) was more frequent in the amyloid PET positive group. In 5 out of 38 patients (13%), the modified Boston criteria were not fulfilled due to young age or concomitant vitamin K antagonist use with INR > 3.0. With the modified Boston criteria as reference standard, there was no difference in sensitivity nor specificity between the simplified Edinburgh criteria and amyloid PET status. With amyloid PET status as reference standard, there was also no difference in sensitivity nor specificity between the simplified Edinburgh and modified Boston criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Amyloid PET was positive in 63% of lobar ICH patients. Under certain circumstances, patients might not be diagnosed with probable CAA according to the modified Boston criteria and in these cases, amyloid PET may be useful. Accuracy to predict CAA based on amyloid PET status did not differ between the simplified Edinburgh and modified Boston criteria.
