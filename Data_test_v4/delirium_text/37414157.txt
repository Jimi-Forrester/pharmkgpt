37414157|a|The ageing process begins at birth. It is a life-long process, and its exact origins are still unknown. Several hypotheses attempt to describe the normal ageing process, including hormonal imbalance, formation of reactive oxygen species, DNA methylation & DNA damage accumulation, loss of proteostasis, epigenetic alterations, mitochondrial dysfunction, senescence, inflammation, and stem cell depletion. With increased lifespan in elderly individuals, the prevalence of age-related diseases including, cancer, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, Alzheimer's, Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, Parkinson's, and other mental illnesses are increased. These increased age-related illnesses, put tremendous pressure & burden on caregivers, family members, and friends who are living with patients with age-related diseases. As medical needs evolve, the caregiver is expected to experience an increase in duties and challenges, which may result in stress on themselves, and impact their own family life. In the current article, we assess the biological mechanisms of ageing and its effect on body systems, exploring lifestyle and ageing, with a specific focus on age-related disorders. We also discussed the history of caregiving and specific challenges faced by caregivers in the presence of multiple comorbidities. We also assessed innovative approaches to funding caregiving, and efforts to improve the medical system to better organize chronic care efforts, while improving the skill and efficiency of both informal and formal caregivers. We also discussed the role of caregiving in end-of-life care. Our critical analysis strongly suggests that there is an urgent need for caregiving in aged populations and support from local, state, and federal agencies.
