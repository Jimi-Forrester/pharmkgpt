37976791|a|BACKGROUND: The cingulate island sign (CIS) ratio is a diagnostic adjunct for differentiating dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from Alzheimer's disease (AD). A recent study showed that the CIS ratio in DLB changed depending on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. We aimed to evaluate whether the diagnostic performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the CIS ratio for differentiating DLB from AD changes depending on the MMSE score. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with DLB and 26 amyloid-positive patients with AD, who underwent 18F-FDG PET and completed an MMSE examination, were classified into three groups according to MMSE scores: Group A (MMSE >24), Group B (20 <= MMSE <=24), and Group C (MMSE <20). In each group, we compared the CIS ratio between patients with DLB and AD and conducted receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to calculate the sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Within Group B, the CIS ratio in DLB was significantly higher than that in AD (p = 0.0005), but not within Groups A (p = 0.5117) and C (p = 0.8671). ROC curve analyses showed that the sensitivities and specificities of the CIS ratio for differentiating DLB from AD were 66.7% and 77.8% in Group A, 91.7% and 100.0% in Group B, and 75.0% and 66.7% in Group C, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that the diagnostic performance of the CIS ratio for differentiating DLB from AD changes depending on the MMSE score, with higher sensitivity and specificity at MMSE scores of 20-24.
