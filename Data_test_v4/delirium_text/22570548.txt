22570548|t|Is this a new type of primary prosopagnosia, both progressive and apperceptive?
22570548|a|Prosopagnosia, the inability to recognize faces, has a history going back to Charcot and Hughlings-Jackson, but was first named by Bodamer in 1947. Its anatomical loci are still unclear. However, progressive prosopagnosia is normally linked to right dominant temporal lobe atrophy, and diagnosed as part of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Here we report a case of prosopagnosia linked to posterior cortical atrophy. Although case reports of posterior cortical atrophy-prosopagnosia do already exist, it is normally described as an accessory symptom. The interest of our own posterior cortical atrophy patient, possibly the first such case, is that he had a rare apperceptive type of prosopagnosia unrelated to the associative, frontotemporal lobar degeneration-type.
