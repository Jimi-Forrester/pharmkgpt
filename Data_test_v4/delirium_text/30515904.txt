30515904|t|Syntrophins entangled in cytoskeletal meshwork: Helping to hold it all together.
30515904|a|Syntrophins are a family of 59 kDa peripheral membrane-associated adapter proteins, containing multiple protein-protein and protein-lipid interaction domains. The syntrophin family consists of five isoforms that exhibit specific tissue distribution, distinct sub-cellular localization and unique expression patterns implying their diverse functional roles. These syntrophin isoforms form multiple functional protein complexes and ensure proper localization of signalling proteins and their binding partners to specific membrane domains and provide appropriate spatiotemporal regulation of signalling pathways. Syntrophins consist of two PH domains, a PDZ domain and a conserved SU domain. The PH1 domain is split by the PDZ domain. The PH2 and the SU domain are involved in the interaction between syntrophin and the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC). Syntrophins recruit various signalling proteins to DGC and link extracellular matrix to internal signalling apparatus via DGC. The different domains of the syntrophin isoforms are responsible for modulation of cytoskeleton. Syntrophins associate with cytoskeletal proteins and lead to various cellular responses by modulating the cytoskeleton. Syntrophins are involved in many physiological processes which involve cytoskeletal reorganization like insulin secretion, blood pressure regulation, myogenesis, cell migration, formation and retraction of focal adhesions. Syntrophins have been implicated in various pathologies like Alzheimer's disease, muscular dystrophy, cancer. Their role in cytoskeletal organization and modulation makes them perfect candidates for further studies in various cancers and other ailments that involve cytoskeletal modulation. The role of syntrophins in cytoskeletal organization and modulation has not yet been comprehensively reviewed till now. This review focuses on syntrophins and highlights their role in cytoskeletal organization, modulation and dynamics via its involvement in different cell signalling networks.
