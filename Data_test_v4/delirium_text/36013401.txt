36013401|t|The Case for Early Use of Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists in Obstructive Sleep Apnea Patients with Comorbid Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome.
36013401|a|Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have high rates of co-occurring type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obesity, stroke, congestive heart failure, and accelerated atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. These conditions frequently require multiple medications, raising the risk of polypharmacy, adverse drug-drug and drug-disease interactions, decreased quality of life, and increased healthcare cost in these patients. The current review of extant literature presents evidence supporting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) as one pharmacologic intervention that provides a "one-stop shop" for OSA patients because of the multiple effects GLP-1RA has on comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases) that commonly co-occur with OSA. Examples of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists approved by the FDA for diabetes (some of which are also approved for obesity) are liraglutide, exenatide, lixisenatide, dulaglutide, semaglutide, and albiglutide. Prescribing of GLP-1RAs to address these multiple co-occurring conditions has enormous potential to reduce polypharmacy, cost, and adverse drug events, and to improve quality of life for patients living with OSA and diabetes. We thus strongly advocate for increased and early use of GLP-1RA in OSA patients with co-occurring diabetes and other cardiometabolic conditions common in OSA.
