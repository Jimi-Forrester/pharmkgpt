33804048|a|Advanced age is the greatest risk factor for aging-related brain disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the detailed mechanisms that mechanistically link aging and AD remain elusive. In recent years, a mitochondrial hypothesis of brain aging and AD has been accentuated. Mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is a mitochondrial response to intramitochondrial and intracellular stresses. mPTP overactivation has been implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction in aging and AD brains. This review summarizes the up-to-date progress in the study of mPTP in aging and AD and attempts to establish a link between brain aging and AD from a perspective of mPTP-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction.
