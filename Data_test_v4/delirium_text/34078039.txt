34078039|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebral blood flow (CBF) has direct effects on neuronal function and neurocognitive disorders. Oxidative stress from abdominal aortic surgery is important in the pathophysiology of CBF impairment. We investigated the effect of edaravone on the pial arteriolar diameter changes induced by abdominal aortic surgery and the involvement of the endothelium in the changes. METHODS: The closed cranial window technique was used in rabbits to measure changes in pial arteriolar diameter after the unclamping of abdominal aortic cross-clamping with an intravenous free radical scavenger, edaravone (control group [n = 6], edaravone 10 mug/kg/min [n = 6], 100 mug/kg/min [n = 6]). Pial vasodilatory responses to topical application of acetylcholine (ACh) into the cranial window were investigated before abdominal aortic cross-clamping and after unclamping with intravenous administration of edaravone (control group [n = 6], edaravone 100 mug/kg/min [n = 6]). RESULTS: Aortic unclamping-induced vasoconstriction was significantly attenuated by continuous infusion of edaravone at 100 mug/kg/min. Topical ACh after unclamping did not produce any changes in pial arteriolar responses in comparison to before aortic cross-clamping in the control or edaravone groups. The changes in the response to topical ACh after unclamping in the saline and edaravone groups did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Free radicals during abdominal aortic surgery might have contracted cerebral blood vessels independently of endothelial function in rabbits. Suppression of free radicals attenuated the sustained pial arteriolar vasoconstriction after aortic unclamping. Thus, the free radical scavenger might have some brain protective effect that maintains CBF independently of endothelial function.
