37511751|t|Orthogeriatric Assessment of the Elderly Patient with Fragility Hip Fracture: Preliminary Results of a Prospective Study.
37511751|a|Nowadays, more studies deal with "OrthoGeriatrics", for the co-management of elderly patients suffering fractures, from the admission to the discharge and beyond. For the first time at Cagliari University Hospital, we introduced an orthogeriatric service, in which trained geriatricians stay in orthopedic unit alongside trained orthopedics. The primary aim of the study was to analyze the rate of death and rehospitalization in elderly femur-fractured people of 65 or more years of age, identifying possible predictive factors. The secondary aim of the study was to analyze the recovery of daily living autonomies during the months following surgery. To reach the aim, we designed a prospective study, which is currently ongoing. We evaluated femur-fractured patients aged 65 years or more with a comprehensive geriatric assessment before surgery. The most common fractures were lateral hip ones, treated with osteosynthesis. Cognitive-affective, functional, and nutritional status, mood, and comorbidities were less impaired than in the outpatient service of the same hospital devoted to frail elderly. Pain control was excellent. A significantly low delirium incidence was found. More than a third of the sample were recognized as frail (according to the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe-Frailty Instrument (SHARE-FI)), and over a third of the sample were identified as a moderate-high risk of hospitalization and death (according to Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI)). Overall mortality rate was 13.87%, and rehospitalization rate was 11.84%. Frail people were more likely to die than non-frail (HR: 5.64), and pre-frail ones (HR: 3.97); similarly, high-risk patients were more likely to die than low-risk (HR: 8.04), and moderate-risk ones (HR: 5.46). Conversely, neither SHARE-FI nor MPI predicted rehospitalization. Creatinine (OR: 2.66, p = 0.003) and folate (OR: 0.75, p = 0.03) levels were independently associated with death and rehospitalization, respectively. Finally, the patients did recover the lost autonomies later, 6 months after surgery. Our study demonstrated that SHARE-FI and MPI are reliable tools to predict mortality in an orthogeriatric setting, and that creatinine and folate levels should also be measured given their independent association with negative outcomes.
