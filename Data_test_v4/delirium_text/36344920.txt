METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of CT and MR imaging data of the brain in 40 patients with hydrogen sulfide poisoning in our hospital. There were four main imaging manifestations. Patients were clinically graded according to the central nervous system symptom scores of the Poisoning Severity Score (PSS) and staged according to the gas inhalation time segment. Based on clinical symptom grading, the frequencies and proportions of four imaging signs that occurred in each group were counted, their development trends were analyzed, and the correlations of imaging features with clinical grading and prognosis were calculated. RESULTS: Forty patients were divided into minor, moderate and severe clinical grades and classified into four stages. In patients with minor and moderate clinical grading, only one patient suffered from generalized brain edema at stage 1, with a good prognosis. Patients with severe clinical grade showed the highest probability of presenting with the four imaging signs. The imaging signs were correlated with the severe clinical grade and a poor prognosis (P = 0.000, R = 0.828; P = 0.000, R = 0.858). CONCLUSION: In patients with the severe clinical grade, generalized brain edema and symmetrical hypodensity/abnormal signals in the bilateral basal ganglia and around the lateral ventricles were the main findings and were shown to persist. The presence of imaging signs can assist in the clinically effective evaluation of clinical symptom grade.
