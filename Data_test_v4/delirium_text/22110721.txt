22110721|a|Mitochondrial trafficking deficits have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Ser/Thre kinase GSK3beta is believed to play a fundamental role in AD pathogenesis. Given that GSK3beta substrates include Tau protein, here we studied the impact of GSK3beta on mitochondrial trafficking and its dependence on Tau protein. Overexpression of GSK3beta in neurons resulted in an increase in motile mitochondria, whereas a decrease in the activity of this kinase produced an increase in mitochondria pausing. These effects were dependent on Tau proteins, as Tau (-/-) neurons did not respond to distinct GSK3beta levels. Furthermore, differences in GSK3beta expression did not affect other parameters like mitochondria velocity or mitochondria run length. We conclude that GSK3B activity regulates mitochondrial axonal trafficking largely in a Tau-dependent manner.
