38159159|t|Investigating the potential clinical impact of periodontitis on the progression of Alzheimer's disease: a prospective cohort study.
38159159|a|OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the effect of periodontitis and current occlusal relationship on the progression rate of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Ninety Alzheimer's patients, who were divided into three groups as Stage I (n=42), Stage II (n=29), and Stage III (n=19), based on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, were included in the study. Cognitive status of the patients was evaluated with Standardized Mini-Mental Test (SMMT) at baseline and repeated 6 months later. Clinical periodontal examinations were recorded and occlusal relationship status was classified according to the Eichner Index. RESULTS: Of 90 Alzheimer's patients, 65 were toothed individuals with periodontitis and 25 were edentulous individuals without active periodontal disease. Stage II and Stage III toothed Alzheimer's patients had higher percentage of bleeding on probing (BOP%) and clinical attachment level (CAL) values than Stage I patients (p<0.05). Stage III Alzheimer's patients had significantly higher probing pocket depth (PPD) values than Stage I individuals (p<0.05). DeltaSMMT values showed positive correlation with BOP% (r=0.308, p=0.013) and PPD (r=0.275, p=0.027). Among the evaluated parameters, being in the AD Stage II-Stage III, having periodontitis and age variable had significant effects on DeltaSMMT levels (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Within the limits of our study, it can be concluded that periodontitis may increase the severity and also accelerate the progression rate of AD. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These results are precious to show the necessity of proper oral hygiene activities and regular dental visits in patients with toothed AD. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered and approved by clinical trials (NCT05807100).
