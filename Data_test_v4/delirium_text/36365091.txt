36365091|t|Employ of Anthocyanins in Nanocarriers for Nano Delivery: In Vitro and In Vivo Experimental Approaches for Chronic Diseases.
36365091|a|Anthocyanins are among the best-known phenolic compounds and possess remarkable biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antidiabetic effects. Despite their therapeutic benefits, they are not widely used as health-promoting agents due to their instability, low absorption, and, thus, low bioavailability and rapid metabolism in the human body. Recent research suggests that the application of nanotechnology could increase their solubility and/or bioavailability, and thus their biological potential. Therefore, in this review, we have provided, for the first time, a comprehensive overview of in vitro and in vivo studies on nanocarriers used as delivery systems of anthocyanins, and their aglycones, i.e., anthocyanidins alone or combined with conventional drugs in the treatment or management of chronic diseases.
