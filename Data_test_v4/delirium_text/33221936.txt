33221936|t|Psychological and neuropsychiatric implications of COVID-19.
33221936|a|COVID-19 infections have spread quickly, resulting in massive healthcare burden to societies worldwide. The most urgent interventions needed in the present climate include epidemiological measures to reduce the spread of infection, efficient treatment of patients with severe illness to reduce mortality rates, as well as development of diagnostic tests. Alongside this, the acute, medium, and long-term mental-health consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak for patients, their family members, medical professionals, and the public at large should not be underestimated. Here, we draw on evidence from previous coronavirus outbreaks (i.e., SARS, MERS) and emerging evidence from China, Europe, Asia and the US to synthesize the current knowledge regarding the psychological and neuropsychiatric implications of the COVID-19 pandemic.
