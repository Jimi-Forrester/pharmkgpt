29713173|t|Significant association of BDNF rs6265 G>A polymorphism with susceptibility to epilepsy: a meta-analysis.
29713173|a|INTRODUCTION: Previously published articles have suggested that BDNF rs6265 G>A polymorphism is a potential risk factor for epilepsy. However, the results were not consistent. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis to explore the association between BDNF rs6265 G>A polymorphism and epilepsy risk. Four online databases were searched, and related studies were reviewed from their inception up to June 20, 2017. ORs and corresponding 95% CIs were used to calculate the associations of each genetic model. Overall, 10 case-control publications involving 9,512 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. RESULTS: Significant associations were found between BDNF rs6265 G>A polymorphism and epilepsy (A vs G: OR=0.88, 95% CI=0.83-0.94, P<0.01, I2=0%; GA vs GG: OR=0.88, 95% CI=0.79-0.97, P=0.01, I2=0%; AA vs GG: OR=0.79, 95% CI=0.70-0.90, P<0.01, I2=0%; GA+AA vs GG: OR=0.85, 95% CI=0.77-0.94, P<0.01, I2=0%; AA vs GG+GA: OR=0.85, 95% CI=0.76-0.95, P=0.01, I2=0%). Subgroup analysis also showed similar results in an Asian population. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis indicated that BDNF rs6265 G>A polymorphism might be involved in epilepsy susceptibility, especially in the Asian population.
