39205591|a|The study aimed to investigate the effect of the aqueous extract of the chamomile plant on oxidative stress induced by procyclidine in rats. 30 rats were randomly divided into five groups, with 6 rats in each group. The first group was given distilled water only, while the second group was administered procyclidine (1 mg/kg body weight) in three doses daily for a period of 60 days. The third group was given procyclidine in the same doses as the second group for 30 days. Afterward, they were administered an aqueous extract of chamomile (300 mg/kg) for another 30 days. The fourth group was administered the aqueous extract (300 mg/kg) for 30 days. Subsequently, they were given procyclidine in the same doses as the second group for another 30 days. On the other hand, the fifth group was administered the aqueous extract of chamomile (300 mg/kg) for a period of 60 days to investigate the potential effects of the extract. Afterward, blood samples were drawn to measure various biological parameters, including Total Oxidant Status (TOS), Malondialdehyde (MDA), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Transaminase (ALT), and Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Finally, an anatomical study was conducted on the kidneys, brain, and liver to enhance the research. The results displayed a significant increase in the levels of TOS, MDA, AST, ALT enzymes, and Ach-E activity in the second group compared to the first group. Groups 3 and 4 significantly decreased compared to the second group based on the same standards. In regard to Group 5, there are no significant moral differences between it and Group 1. Finally, this study demonstrated the importance of using chamomile extract as an antioxidant and its potential in cancer prevention against the oxidative stress induced by excessive doses of procyclidine.
