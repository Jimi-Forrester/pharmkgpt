39245832|a|ABSTRACT: Communication is an essential aspect of care for all patients but is especially important for individuals with Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. Nurses who care for persons living with dementia (PwD), as well as family members and caregivers, need understanding of verbal and nonverbal communication techniques and approaches that are effective throughout the stages of dementia. Spiritual assessment and care also are critical. This article provides evidence-based and biblical examples for communication as a healing art in caring for PwD.
