38335409|a|Investigating the applying effects of the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) in the perioperative period of elderly lung cancer patients undergoing the surgery. We randomly selected 98 elderly patients with lung cancer who were admitted to our hospital and underwent surgery from January 2022 to September 2023 as study subjects. The control group received conventional care during the perioperative period, and the intervention group received ERAS-guided care measures. The differences in perioperative-related indices, pulmonary function, pain level, inflammatory factors, and postoperative complication rates between these 2 groups were compared. The postoperative extubation time, the activity time since getting out of bad and hospital stay were lower in the observation group than those in the control group (P  < .05). At 3 days postoperatively, the FEV1, forced vital capacity and maximum ventilation volume of these 2 groups were lower than those of their same groups before surgery, and those of the observation group were higher than those of the control group (P  < .05). At 3 days postoperatively, the numerical rating scale in both groups were lower than those of their same groups at 6 hours postoperatively, and the numerical rating scale of the observation group was lower than that of the control group (P  < .05). At 3 days postoperatively, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, and CRP in both groups were higher than those in their same groups before surgery, and those of the observation group was lower than those of the control group (P  < .05). The incidence of postoperative complications in the observation group was lower than that in the control group (P  < .05). ERAS applied in the perioperative period of elderly lung cancer patients undergoing surgery can shorten the hospital stay, promote the postoperative recovery on pulmonary function, alleviate inflammation, and reduce the risk of postoperative complications.
