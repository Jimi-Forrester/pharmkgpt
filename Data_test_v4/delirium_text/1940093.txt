1940093|a|The relationship of behavioral disturbances in Alzheimer's disease to disease severity, age at onset, and the presence of extrapyramidal signs was investigated in three studies. Five categories of behavior disturbance were ascertained through structured interview with the patient's primary caregiver: apathy, agitation, psychotic symptoms, disinhibition, and irritability. In Study 1, measures of disease severity accounted for 42% of the variance in the Apathy scale but less than 20% of the variance in the remaining scales. In Study 2, the presence of extrapyramidal signs was associated with increased Apathy and moderated the association between disease severity and the Psychotic Symptoms and Irritability scales. In Study 3, age at onset was associated with the Agitation scale and moderated the association between disease severity and the Apathy, Psychotic Symptoms, and Irritability scales. The findings are discussed in terms of the clinical heterogeneity within Alzheimer's disease, the possible biological bases of these behavioral disturbances, and the psychometric issues pertinent to their measurement.
