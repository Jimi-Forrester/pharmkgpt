29879605|a|BACKGROUND: Depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are co-morbid conditions. Neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported as prodromal symptoms of AD-like dementia and soluble forms of beta amyloid peptide (Abeta), the main constituent of insoluble plaques typical of AD brains, have been implicated in such an effect. We have previously shown that intracerebral injection of Abeta can evoke a depressive-like state in rats, accompanied by neurochemical and neuroendocrine alterations reminiscent of depressive symptoms in humans. AD and depression are crucially linked by neuroinflammation and cyclooxygenase II (COX-2) enzyme involvement is an intriguing field of research. Indeed, its pharmacological inhibition has shown both antidepressant and Abeta modulating effects. METHODS: Male rats were exposed to sub-chronic celecoxib (15 mg/kg/day sc for 8 days), a selective COX-2 inhibitor or vehicle (saline), starting from the day before central intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta peptide (5microL of 4 microM solution or vehicle for sham). Animals were tested for depressive-like behaviour by using the forced swimming test paradigm and prefrontal serotonin (5-HT) content and plasma Abeta levels were further evaluated. RESULTS: We found that celecoxib treatment prevented the pro-depressive effects induced by Abeta. Moreover, it also prevented the reduction in 5-HT content in prefrontal cortex of Abeta-treated rats and decreased their plasma Abeta levels. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data indicate that celecoxib could be a suitable pharmaceutical tool for the treatment of depressive state related to increased Abeta levels.
