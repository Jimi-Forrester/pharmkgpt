30386821|a|INTRODUCTION: Methods for efficiently identifying cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are a critical unmet need. The goal of this work was to validate novel online study partner (SP)-reported outcomes to identify cognitive decline in older adults. METHODS: In older adults enrolled in the Brain Health Registry, we analyzed associations between SP-reported cognitive decline, measured by the Everyday Cognition Scale, and either (1) participant cognition, assessed by Cogstate Brief Battery or (2) participant-reported diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or AD. RESULTS: We found strong associations between SP-reported Everyday Cognition Scale and both Cogstate scores and participant diagnosis. The associations were cognitive domain specific, dependant on participant diagnosis, and were stronger in spouse dyads and those who knew each other longer. DISCUSSION: Collecting SP-reported data online from a large cohort is feasible. Results support the construct validity of our approach, which has the potential to facilitate clinical AD and aging research.
