27013205|t|Abeta40 has a subtle effect on Abeta42 protofibril formation, but to a lesser degree than Abeta42 concentration, in Abeta42/Abeta40 mixtures.
27013205|a|Recent findings suggest that the senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease may contain soluble amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) fibril precursors along with insoluble fibrils. These soluble Abeta species, including oligomers and protofibrils, have been well-studied in vitro and are formed via non-covalent self-assembly of Abeta monomers. While both 40- and 42-residue forms of Abeta are observed in the human body, the majority of the Abeta aggregation work has been conducted on Abeta42 or Abeta40 separately, with relatively few investigations of mixtures. In order to study the effect of different combinations of Abeta40 and Abeta42 on protofibril formation, mixtures of either dry solid peptide, or purified Abeta40 and Abeta42 monomer solutions were mixed together and protofibril/monomer distributions were quantified. Increases in the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio increased protofibril formation but the presence of Abeta40 in the mixed Abeta solutions had a significant negative impact on protofibril formation compared to equivalent solutions of pure Abeta42. Protofibril size was less affected, but beta-sheet structure increased with protofibrils formed from higher Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio solutions. Direct measurement of Abeta42/Abeta40 ratios by C-terminal-selective ELISA found very little Abeta40 incorporated into protofibrils. The cumulative data emphasizes the critical importance of Abeta42, yet establishes Abeta40 as a regulator of Abeta42 aggregation.
