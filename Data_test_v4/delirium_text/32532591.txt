32532591|t|Brain pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of 11C-labeled isoproterenol in rodents.
32532591|a|INTRODUCTION: Isoproterenol is a non-selective beta receptor agonist, which is a drug approved for bradycardia and bronchial asthma in many countries. Recently, isoproterenol has been reported to have the potential as a drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting the aggregation of tau protein. Isoproterenol is a highly potent drug causing increases in heart rates even when its plasma concentration is very low. Thus, it is critical to know if potentially effective therapeutic levels of isoproterenol can be achieved, maintaining safe plasma levels without any untoward pharmacological effects. The purpose of the study is to investigate the brain pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of 11C-labeled isoproterenol in rodents. METHODS: We performed positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging and biodistribution studies of [11C]isoproterenol. 120-min scans with arterial blood sampling were performed in rats. Additionally, plasma and brain homogenates were analyzed with radio-HPLC to characterize its metabolite profiles. As a measure of [11C]isoproterenol brain uptake, total distribution volumes were determined by a pharmacokinetic compartment model. Biodistribution of [11C]isoproterenol was investigated in mice at six-time points from 1-min to 90-min after injection. RESULTS: We found a modest brain uptake of [11C]isoproterenol. Its brain pharmacokinetics showed that the concentration of isoproterenol in the brain at equilibrium was about two-fold higher than in the plasma (total distribution volumes 2.0 +- 0.2 cm3/mL). Only unmetabolized isoproterenol was detected in the brain at 30 min after injection, although isoproterenol was rapidly metabolized in plasma. The biodistribution study showed that isoproterenol and its metabolite are excreted mainly via the urinary system. CONCLUSIONS, ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT CARE: In this study, we have shown that rat brain concentrations of isoproterenol are only two-fold of that in plasma at equilibrium. If the brain pharmacokinetics are similar in the human brain, it may be difficult to achieve potentially therapeutic levels of this drug safely in humans. Further studies appear warranted to investigate the brain pharmacokinetics in humans with PET using [11C]isoproterenol.
