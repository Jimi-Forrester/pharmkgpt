36383328|t|The Dialogue Between Neuroinflammation and Adult Neurogenesis: Mechanisms Involved and Alterations in Neurological Diseases.
36383328|a|Adult neurogenesis occurs mainly in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles. Evidence supports the critical role of adult neurogenesis in various conditions, including cognitive dysfunction, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Several factors can alter adult neurogenesis, including genetic, epigenetic, age, physical activity, diet, sleep status, sex hormones, and central nervous system (CNS) disorders, exerting either pro-neurogenic or anti-neurogenic effects. Compelling evidence suggests that any insult or injury to the CNS, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), infectious diseases, or neurodegenerative disorders, can provoke an inflammatory response in the CNS. This inflammation could either promote or inhibit neurogenesis, depending on various factors, such as chronicity and severity of the inflammation and underlying neurological disorders. Notably, neuroinflammation, driven by different immune components such as activated glia, cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen species, can regulate every step of adult neurogenesis, including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, survival of newborn neurons, maturation, synaptogenesis, and neuritogenesis. Therefore, this review aims to present recent findings regarding the effects of various components of the immune system on adult neurogenesis and to provide a better understanding of the role of neuroinflammation and neurogenesis in the context of neurological disorders, including AD, PD, ischemic stroke (IS), seizure/epilepsy, TBI, sleep deprivation, cognitive impairment, and anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors. For each disorder, some of the most recent therapeutic candidates, such as curcumin, ginseng, astragaloside, boswellic acids, andrographolide, caffeine, royal jelly, estrogen, metformin, and minocycline, have been discussed based on the available preclinical and clinical evidence.
