19501712|a|Presently, compelling evidence indicates that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a vascular disorder with neurodegenerative consequences and should be treated as such. A substantial body of evidence including epidemiological, pharmacotherapeutic, and neuroimaging studies support the concept of AD as a vascular disorder or vasocognopathy that initiates as brain hypoperfusion, creating a neuronal energy crisis. The neuronal energy crisis provokes the cellular and molecular changes that characterize this dementia. In this brief review, the many vascular-related risk factors to AD including some that are preventable or amenable to treatment are discussed. Considerable human data now point in a new direction for guiding future research into AD. This new research direction should open a window of opportunity for decisive management and treatment of this devastating disorder.
