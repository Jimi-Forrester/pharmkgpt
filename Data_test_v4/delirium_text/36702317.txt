36702317|t|Liquid-liquid phase separation of protein tau: An emerging process in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
36702317|a|Metabolic reactions within cells occur in various isolated compartments with or without borders, the latter being known as membrane-less organelles (MLOs). The MLOs show liquid-like properties and are formed by a process known as liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). MLOs contribute to different molecules interactions such as protein-protein, protein-RNA, and RNA-RNA driven by various factors, such as multivalency of intrinsic disorders. MLOs are involved in several cell signaling pathways such as transcription, immune response, and cellular organization. However, disruption of these processes has been found in different pathologies. Recently, it has been demonstrated that protein aggregates, a characteristic of some neurodegenerative diseases, undergo similar phase separation. Tau protein is known as a major neurofibrillary tangles component in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This protein can undergo phase separation to form a MLO known as tau droplet in vitro and in vivo, and this process can be facilitated by several factors, including crowding agents, RNA, and phosphorylation. Tau droplet has been shown to mature into insoluble aggregates suggesting that this process may precede and induce neurodegeneration in AD. Here we review major factors involved in liquid droplet formation within a cell. Additionally, we highlight recent findings concerning tau aggregation following phase separation in AD, along with the potential therapeutic strategies that could be explored in this process against the progression of this pathology.
