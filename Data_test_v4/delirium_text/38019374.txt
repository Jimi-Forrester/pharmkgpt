38019374|a|Most scholars believe that amyloid-beta (Abeta) has the potential to induce apoptosis, stimulate an inflammatory cascade, promote oxidative stress and exacerbate the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the deposition of Abeta in AD. At approximately 6 months of age, APP/PS1 double transgenic mice gradually exhibit the development of plaques, as well as spatial and learning impairment. Notably, the hippocampus is specifically affected in the course of AD. Herein, 6-month-old APP/PS1 double transgenic mice were utilized, and the differentially expressed (DE) proteins in the hippocampus were identified and analyzed using 4D label-free quantitative proteomics technology and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). Compared to wild-type mice, 29 proteins were upregulated and 25 proteins were downregulated in the AD group. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of biological processes (BP) indicated that the DE proteins were mainly involved in 'ribosomal large subunit biogenesis'. Molecular function (MF) analysis results were primarily associated with '5.8S rRNA binding' and 'structural constituent of ribosome'. In terms of cellular components (CC), the DE proteins were mainly found in 'polysomal ribosome', 'cytosolic large ribosomal subunit', 'cytosolic ribosome', and 'large ribosomal subunit', among others. Furthermore, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis demonstrated that the results were mainly enriched in the 'Ribosome signaling pathway'. The key target proteins identified were ribosomal protein (Rp)l18, Rpl17, Rpl19, Rpl24, Rpl35, and Rpl6. The PRM verification results were consistent with the findings of the 4D label-free quantitative proteomics analysis. Overall, these findings suggest that Rpl18, Rpl17, Rpl19, Rpl24, Rpl35, and Rpl6 may have potential therapeutic value for the treatment of AD by targeting Abeta.
