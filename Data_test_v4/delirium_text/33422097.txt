33422097|a|BACKGROUND: Microglia are highly motile phagocytic cells in the healthy brain with surveillance and clearance functions. Although microglia have been shown to engulf cellular debris following brain insult, less is known about their phagocytic function in the absence of injury. Propofol can inhibit microglial activity, including phagocytosis. Milk fat globule epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8), as a regulator of microglia, plays an essential role in the phagocytic process. However, whether MFG-E8 affects the alteration of phagocytosis by propofol remains unknown. METHODS: Microglial BV2 cells were treated with propofol, with or without MFG-E8. Phagocytosis of latex beads was evaluated by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. MFG-E8, p-AMPK, AMPK, p-Src, and Src levels were assessed by western blot analysis. Compound C (AMPK inhibitor) and dasatinib (Src inhibitor) were applied to determine the roles of AMPK and Src in microglial phagocytosis under propofol treatment. RESULTS: The phagocytic ability of microglia was significantly decreased after propofol treatment for 4 h (P < 0.05). MFG-E8 production was inhibited by propofol in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Preadministration of MFG-E8 dose-dependently (from 10 to 100 ng/ml) reversed the suppression of phagocytosis by propofol (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the decline in p-AMPK and p-Src levels induced by propofol intervention was reversed by MFG-E8 activation (P < 0.05). Administration of compound C (AMPK inhibitor) and dasatinib (Src inhibitor) to microglia blocked the trend of enhanced phagocytosis induced by MFG-E8 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal the intermediate role of MFG-E8 between propofol and microglial phagocytic activity. Moreover, MFG-E8 may reverse the suppression of phagocytosis induced by propofol through the regulation of the AMPK and Src signaling pathways.
