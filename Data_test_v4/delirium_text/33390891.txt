33390891|a|Background and Purpose: Adenosine dysregulation is associated with the occurrence of the epilepsy and equilibrative nucleoside transporters-1 (ENT-1) functions as an important regulator of extracellular adenosine in the brain. This study was aimed to prove the anti-epileptic effect of BBB permeable ENT-1 inhibitors, JMF1907 and J4, on animal models of various epilepsy, and the mechanisms that are involved. Experimental Approach: Maximal electroshock seizure (MES), pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizure and kindling models were used as mouse models of generalized tonic-clonic epilepsy, generalized myoclonic epilepsy, and partial epilepsy, respectively. The epilepsy frequency, duration, and Racine score were evaluated. Whole-cell recordings were made from the hippocampal dentate granule cells by using a patch-clamp technique in the brain slice of the mice. Key Results: In MES, JMF1907 at a dose of 5 mg kg-1 was efficacious in decreasing hindlimb extension, while J4 did not decrease hindlimb extension until a higher dose (10 mg kg-1). Both JMF1907 and J4 were more potent in lengthening onset latency than ethosuximide (ETH) in PTZ-induced myoclonic epilepsy model, whereas ETH had better effects on the Racine score. In kindling model, JMF1907 and J4 at a dose of 1 mg kg-1 had effects on seizure frequency and duration, and the effects of JMF1907 were comparable with those of carbamazepine. Both JMF1907 and J4 can reduce the glutamatergic spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) frequency. The maximal inhibition was about 50% for JMF1907 at a concentration of 1 mug L-1, whereas J4 only inhibited 40% of sEPSCs frequency at a dose of 10 mug L-1. Conclusion and Implications: ENT-1 inhibitors, JMF1907 and J4, showed anti-epileptic effects in different epilepsy models and the effects involved pre-synaptic neuronal modulation.
