31485126|a|Neuro psychiatric illnesses are commonly recognised these days in the intensive care especially with the increasing aging population and more intensive care admissions. However they are still inadequately diagnosed and treated disease entities as a majority of these patients do not seek the help of specialists psychiatrists Of course the number of drugs used in psychiatry has explosively increased in recent years. As a corollary to this, the phenomenon of drug- drug interaction between psychiatric drugs and other drugs has come to the forefront. Drug- drug interaction (DDI)) is the response (pharmacological or clinical) of altered drug effects or increase in adverse effects when two or more drugs are used simultaneously1,2 This effect may be different from the usual action of the individual drugs when used alone. Potential drug- drug interaction (PDDI) are those where theoretically there may be an interaction between the drugs but have not clinically occurred.1,2. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Shobhana A.
