36859642|a|One of the consequences of mining is the release of heavy metals into the environment, especially water bodies. Phytoremediation of areas contaminated by heavy metals using Vetiver grass and Indian mustard is cost-effective and environmentally friendly. This study aimed at enhancing remediation of heavy metal contaminated water through the simultaneous hybrid application of clay minerals (attapulgite and bentonite) and Vetiver grass or Indian mustard. A 21-day greenhouse experiment was carried out to investigate the effectiveness of the clay minerals to improve heavy metal phytoremediation. The highest accumulation of aluminium (Al) by Vetiver grass was 371.8 mg/kg in the BT2.5VT treatment, while for Mn, the highest accumulation of 34.71 mg/kg was observed in the AT1VT treatment. However, Indian mustard showed no significant uptake of heavy metals, but suffered heavy metal toxicity despite the addition of clay minerals. From this study, it was evident that bentonite added at 2.5% (w/v) could improve the phytoremediation capacity of Vetiver grass for Al and Mn polluted water. The current laboratory-scale findings provided a basis for field trials earmarked for remediation in a post-mining coal environment in South Africa. This remediation approach can also be adopted in other places.
