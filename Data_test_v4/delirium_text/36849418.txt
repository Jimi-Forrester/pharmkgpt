36849418|t|Tip60's Novel RNA-Binding Function Modulates Alternative Splicing of Pre-mRNA Targets Implicated in Alzheimer's Disease.
36849418|a|The severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression involves a complex interplay of genetics, age, and environmental factors orchestrated by histone acetyltransferase (HAT)-mediated neuroepigenetic mechanisms. While disruption of Tip60 HAT action in neural gene control is implicated in AD, alternative mechanisms underlying Tip60 function remain unexplored. Here, we report a novel RNA binding function for Tip60 in addition to its HAT function. We show that Tip60 preferentially interacts with pre-mRNAs emanating from its chromatin neural gene targets in the Drosophila brain and this RNA binding function is conserved in human hippocampus and disrupted in Drosophila brains that model AD pathology and in AD patient hippocampus of either sex. Since RNA splicing occurs co-transcriptionally and alternative splicing (AS) defects are implicated in AD, we investigated whether Tip60-RNA targeting modulates splicing decisions and whether this function is altered in AD. Replicate multivariate analysis of transcript splicing (rMATS) analysis of RNA-Seq datasets from wild-type and AD fly brains revealed a multitude of mammalian-like AS defects. Strikingly, over half of these altered RNAs are identified as bona-fide Tip60-RNA targets that are enriched for in the AD-gene curated database, with some of these AS alterations prevented against by increasing Tip60 in the fly brain. Further, human orthologs of several Tip60-modulated splicing genes in Drosophila are well characterized aberrantly spliced genes in human AD brains, implicating disruption of Tip60's splicing function in AD pathogenesis. Our results support a novel RNA interaction and splicing regulatory function for Tip60 that may underly AS impairments that hallmark AD etiology.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently emerged as a hotbed for RNA alternative splicing (AS) defects that alter protein function in the brain yet causes remain unclear. Although recent findings suggest convergence of epigenetics with co-transcriptional AS, whether epigenetic dysregulation in AD pathology underlies AS defects remains unknown. Here, we identify a novel RNA interaction and splicing regulatory function for Tip60 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that is disrupted in Drosophila brains modeling AD pathology and in human AD hippocampus. Importantly, mammalian orthologs of several Tip60-modulated splicing genes in Drosophila are well characterized aberrantly spliced genes in human AD brain. We propose that Tip60-mediated AS modulation is a conserved critical posttranscriptional step that may underlie AS defects now characterized as hallmarks of AD.
