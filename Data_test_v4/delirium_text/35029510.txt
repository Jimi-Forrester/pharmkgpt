35029510|a|Both Curcuma longa (CL) and Citrus junos Tanaka (CJ) have been used to treat various diseases due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidative stress activities. In this study, we investigated the ameliorative effect of the combination of CL extract and CJ extract (CCC) against beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide-induced neurological damage. CCC prevented neurocytotoxicity in vitro. In addition, it was confirmed that abnormal alternation behavior and memory impairment caused by Abeta peptide were reversed by treatment with CCC. Furthermore, CCC treatment led to recovery of the cholinergic system and reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidative damage defense system. CCC induced expressions of cyclic-adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB)-responsive element-binding protein and brain-derived neurotrophic factor were confirmed as was the significantly improved processing in the hippocampus of the mouse Abeta peptides. Accordingly, these results suggest that CCC can prevent and/or reverse neurocytotoxicity and cognitive deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
