37626736|t|Using Stems to Bear Fruit: Deciphering the Role of Alzheimer's Disease Risk Loci in Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Microglia.
37626736|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder globally. In people aged 65 and older, it is estimated that 1 in 9 currently live with the disease. With aging being the greatest risk factor for disease onset, the physiological, social and economic burden continues to rise. Thus, AD remains a public health priority. Since 2007, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 80 genomic loci with variants associated with increased AD risk. Although some variants are beginning to be characterized, the effects of many risk loci remain to be elucidated. One advancement which may help provide a patient-focused approach to tackle this issue is the application of gene editing technology and human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). The relatively non-invasive acquisition of cells from patients with known AD risk loci may provide important insights into the pathological role of these risk variants. Of the risk genes identified, many have been associated with the immune system, including ABCA7, CLU, MEF2C, PICALM and TREM2-genes known to be highly expressed in microglia. This review will detail the potential of using hiPSC-derived microglia to help clarify the role of immune-associated genetic risk variants in AD.
