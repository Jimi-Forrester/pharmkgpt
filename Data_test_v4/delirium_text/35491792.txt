35491792|a|Few studies have examined an association between mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). For this reason, we compared an AD dementia group with an mTBI history (n = 10) to a matched AD control group (n = 20) on measures of cognitive function, cerebral glucose metabolism, and markers of amyloid and tau deposition. Only a trend and medium-to-large effect size for higher phosphorylated and total tau was identified for the mTBI group. A history of mTBI may be associated with greater tau in AD, indicating a potential pathway for increasing risk for AD, though further evaluation with larger samples is needed.
