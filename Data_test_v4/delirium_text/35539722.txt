35539722|t|Synthesis and characterization of amino glucose-functionalized silica-coated NiFe2O4 nanoparticles: a heterogeneous, new and magnetically separable catalyst for the solvent-free synthesis of pyrano[3,2-c]chromen-5(4H)-ones.
35539722|a|A novel, efficient and one-pot multi-component procedure for the synthesis of simple pyrano[3,2-c]chromen-5(4H)-ones or pyrazolyl pyrano[3,2-c]chromen-5(4H)-ones via reaction of aryl aldehydes, acetophenones and 4-hydroxycoumarin promoted by amino glucose-functionalized silica-coated NiFe2O4 nanoparticles under solvent-free conditions without using any other harmful organic reagents was reported. The structure of this nanoparticle was characterized by transmission electron microscopies, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies. The catalyst could easily be separated from the reaction mixture by using an external magnetic field and it was reusable. The high purity of the desired products, eco-friendliness, short reaction time and easy workup procedure can be mentioned as the other advantages of this method.
