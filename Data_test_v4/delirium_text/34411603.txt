34411603|a|The microbiota-gut-brain axis has emerged as a focal point of biomedical research. Alterations of gut microbiota are involved in not only various immune/inflammatory disorders but also neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The initial stage of the involvement of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of AD may be the dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Gut microbiota-derived products in the circulation can worsen the BBB integrity, easily cross the disrupted BBB and enter the brain to promote pathological changes in AD. In this review, we first summarize the current evidence of the associations among gut microbiota, AD, and BBB integrity. We then discuss the mechanism of gut microbiota on BBB dysfunction with a focus on bacteria-derived lipopolysaccharide and exosomal high-mobility group box 1. Novel insights into the modification of the BBB as an intervention approach for AD are highlighted as well.
