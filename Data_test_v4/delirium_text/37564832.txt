37564832|a|Background and Aims: Sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB) given as injection provides excellent perioperative analgesia during palatoplasty. Our objectives were to assess the effect of transmucosal SPGB on anesthetic requirements, intraoperative hemodynamics, recovery time, and emergence delirium in children undergoing palatoplasty. Material and Methods: This prospective, randomized study was conducted in 30 children with cleft palate undergoing palatoplasty, divided into two equal groups. After induction and intubation, patients in Group B received bilateral SPGB using cotton-tipped applicators soaked in 2% lignocaine, which were passed through both the nares, and the distal tip was positioned just superior to middle turbinate and anterior to pterygopalatine fossa and sphenopalatine ganglion. In Group C, saline-soaked cotton applicators were used. All patients received general anesthesia as per a standardized protocol. Intraoperative heart rate, mean arterial pressure, the requirement of anesthetics, extubation time, and emergence delirium were compared. Results: Compared with Group C, patients in Group B had significantly lower sevoflurane consumption (17.2 +- 2.6 vs. 27.5 +- 5.0mL, P < 0.001) and fentanyl consumption (2.2 +- 0.5 vs. 3.2 +- 0.6 mu/kg, P < 0.001).The extubation time was significantly shorter in Group B (3.9 +- 0.7 vs. 9.5 +- 1.6 minutes, P < 0.001). PAED (Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scale) scores at 5and 10 minutes were significantly higher in Group C (P < 0.001). Intraoperative heart rate was significantly higher in Group C. Group C had significantly higher mean arterial pressure at 15, 60, and 75 minutes. Conclusion: Preoperative, SPGB administered by mucosal application of local anesthetic significantly reduced sevoflurane and fentanyl requirements, with stable hemodynamics, quicker recovery, and less emergence delirium in children undergoing palatoplasty.
