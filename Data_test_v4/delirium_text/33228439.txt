33228439|t|Selective autophagy: the rise of the zebrafish model.
33228439|a|Selective autophagy is a specific elimination of certain intracellular substrates by autophagic pathways. The most studied macroautophagy pathway involves tagging and recognition of a specific cargo by the autophagic membrane (phagophore) followed by the complete sequestration of targeted cargo from the cytosol by the double-membrane vesicle, autophagosome. Until recently, the knowledge about selective macroautophagy was minimal, but now there is a panoply of links elucidating how phagophores engulf their substrates selectively. The studies of selective autophagy processes have further stressed the importance of using the in vivo models to validate new in vitro findings and discover the physiologically relevant mechanisms. However, dissecting how the selective autophagy occurs yet remains difficult in living organisms, because most of the organelles are relatively inaccessible to observation and experimental manipulation in mammals. In recent years, zebrafish (Danio rerio) is widely recognized as an excellent model for studying autophagic processes in vivo because of its optical accessibility, genetic manipulability and translational potential. Several selective autophagy pathways, such as mitophagy, xenophagy, lipophagy and aggrephagy, have been investigated using zebrafish and still need to be studied further, while other selective autophagy pathways, such as pexophagy or reticulophagy, could also benefit from the use of the zebrafish model. In this review, we shed light on how zebrafish contributed to our understanding of these selective autophagy processes by providing the in vivo platform to study them at the organismal level and highlighted the versatility of zebrafish model in the selective autophagy field.Abbreviations: AD: Alzheimer disease; ALS: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Atg: autophagy-related; CMA: chaperone-mediated autophagy; CQ: chloroquine; HsAMBRA1: human AMBRA1; KD: knockdown; KO: knockout; LD: lipid droplet; MMA: methylmalonic acidemia; PD: Parkinson disease; Tg: transgenic.
