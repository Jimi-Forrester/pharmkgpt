34327633|a|Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 has been reported as a psychobiotic to improve mental health through the gut-brain axis in experimental animal models. To explore its mechanism of action in the gut, this study aimed to analyze the effects of L. plantarum PS128 ingestion on naive and loperamide (Lop)-induced constipation mice. We found that, in the two mouse models, the weight, number, and water content of feces in the L. plantarum PS128 group were higher than those in the vehicle control group. Histological observation revealed that L. plantarum PS128 increased the level of colonic mucins including the major mucin MUC2. In addition, the charcoal meal test showed that L. plantarum PS128 significantly increased the small intestine transit in naive mice, but not in the Lop-treated mice. Since intestinal serotonin has been found to modulate motility, we further analyzed the expression of genes related to serotonin signal transduction in the small intestine of naive mice. The results showed that L. plantarum PS128 significantly altered the expression levels of Tph1, Chga, Slc6a4, and Htr4, but did not affect the expression levels of Tph2, Htr3a, and Maoa. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry revealed that L. plantarum PS128 significantly increased the number of serotonin-containing intestinal cells in mice. Taken together, our results suggest that L. plantarum PS128 could promote intestinal motility, mucin production, and serotonin signal transduction, leading to a laxative effect in mice.
