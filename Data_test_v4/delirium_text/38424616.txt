38424616|t|Preoperative endothelial dysfunction for the prediction of acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass: a pilot study based on a second analysis of the MONS study.
38424616|a|BACKGROUND: Up to 42% of patients develop acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery. The aim of this study was to describe the relationship between preoperative microcirculatory function and postoperative AKI after cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). METHODS: The prospective observational cohort MONS enrolled 60 patients scheduled for valvular (n = 30, 50%) or coronary (n = 30, 50%) surgery using CPB. Preoperative microcirculation was assessed during preoperative consultation from January 2019 to April 2019 at the University Hospital of Angers, France, using endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent reactivity tests on the forearm (iontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), respectively). Skin blood flow was measured by laser speckle contrast imaging. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of AKI according to the KDIGO classification during the hospital stay. RESULTS: Forty-three (71.7%) patients developed AKI during the in-hospital follow-up, and 15 (25%) were classified as KDIGO stage 1, 20 (33%) KDIGO stage 2, and 8 (13%) KDIGO stage 3. Regarding preoperative microcirculation, a higher peak amplitude of vasodilation in response to iontophoresis of ACh was found in patients with postoperative occurrence of AKI (35 [20-49] vs 23 [9-44] LSPU, p = 0.04). Iontophoresis of SNP was not significantly different according to AKI occurrence (34 [22-49] vs 36 [20-50] LSPU, p = 0.95). In a multivariable model, the preoperative peak amplitude at iontophoresis of ACh was independently associated with postoperative AKI (OR 1.045 [1.001-1.092], p = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: The preoperative peak amplitude of endothelium-dependent vasodilation is independently associated with the postoperative occurrence of AKI.
