29132662|a|Delirium is all the more frequent and serious when it occurs in a nursing home. A study was carried out to assess the current practices of general practitioners in the management of delirium in a nursing home in order to identify the issues involved and to suggest areas for improvement. The doctors identified three main difficulties: the management of behavioural disorders, the conditions of practice of a private practitioner in a healthcare institution and the relations with the different caregivers of the nursing home.
