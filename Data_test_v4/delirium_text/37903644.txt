37903644|t|Fine Particulate Matter and Parkinson Disease Risk Among Medicare Beneficiaries.
37903644|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Numerous studies suggest that environmental exposures play a critical role in Parkinson disease (PD) pathogenesis, and large, population-based studies have the potential to advance substantially the identification of novel PD risk factors. We sought to study the nationwide geographic relationship between PD and air pollution, specifically PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter <2.5 micrometers), using population-based, United States (U.S.) Medicare data. METHODS: We conducted a population-based geographic study of Medicare beneficiaries aged 66-90 geocoded to U.S. counties and zip+4. We used integrated nested Laplace approximation to create age, sex, race, smoking, and healthcare utilization adjusted relative risk (RR) at the county-level for geographical analyses with PM2.5 as the primary exposure of interest. We also performed an individual-level analysis using logistic regression with cases and controls with zip+4 centroid PM2.5. We adjusted a priori for the same covariates and verified no confounding by indicators of socioeconomic status or neurologist density. RESULTS: Among 21,639,190 Medicare beneficiaries, 89,390 had incident PD in 2009. There was a nationwide association between average annual PM2.5 and PD risk whereby the RR for PD was 56% (95% CI 47%-66%) greater for those exposed to the median level of PM2.5 compared to those with the lowest level of PM2.5. This association was linear up to 13 mug/m3 corresponding to a 4.2% (95% CI 3.7%-4.8%) greater risk of PD for each additional mug/m3 of PM2.5 (ptrend<0.0001). We identified a region with high PD risk in the Mississippi-Ohio River Valley, where the risk for PD was 19% greater compared to the rest of the nation. The strongest association between PM2.5 and PD was found in a region with low PD risk in the Rocky Mountains. PM2.5 was also associated with PD in the Mississippi-Ohio River Valley where the association was relatively weaker, due to a possible ceiling effect at average annual PM2.5 levels of ~13 mug/m3. DISCUSSION: State-of-the-art geographic analytic techniques revealed an association between PM2.5 and PD that varied in strength by region. A deeper investigation into the specific subfractions of PM2.5 may provide additional insight into regional variability in the PM2.5-PD association.
