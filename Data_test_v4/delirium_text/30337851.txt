30337851|a|Spinal cord injury (SCI) can have a significant impact on an individual's life. Herein, we discuss how resveratrol improves SCI by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway. Evidences show resveratrol suppresses NF-kappaB signaling pathway to exert its beneficial effects on various diseases. NF-kappaB signaling pathway plays a significant role in the pathophysiological mechanisms of SCI including increase in inflammation, augmentation of damage caused by free radicals and lipid peroxidation as well as facilitation of apoptosis and axonal demyelination. We also discuss mechanisms between resveratrol and NF-kappaB signaling pathway in the wake of SCI, which can be potential targets for resveratrol to treat SCI.
