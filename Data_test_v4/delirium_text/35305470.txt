35305470|t|Integration-free induced pluripotent stem cell line derived from a 62-years-old male donor with APOE-epsilon4/epsilon4 alleles.
35305470|a|The epsilon4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE4) continues to be the strongest genetic risk factor associated with sporadic Alzheimer's disease since its discovery compared to the most common epsilon3 allele. Nevertheless, there is a lack of APOE4-mutant human neuronal models in vitroor in vivo. Hence, we presented an iPSC line of an APOE-epsilon4/epsilon4 alleles carrier, a male donor suffering from Alzheimer's disease combined with cerebral infarction. The established iPSC line showed standard characteristics of pluripotency. Collectively, the present study provides a useful resource to reveal the phenotype and explore the mechanism of APOE4 related Alzheimer's disease.
