29679667|t|Systemic delivery of BACE1 siRNA through neuron-targeted nanocomplexes for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
29679667|a|beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a key enzyme to cleave the amyloid precursor protein to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reducing BACE1 expression in central neuron through RNA interference technology shows great promise to overcome AD. However, to obtain an efficient and neurons-specific delivery of siRNA against BACE1 through systemic administration remains challenging. Here, we design and prepare siRNA nano-carriers based on PEGylated poly(2-(N,N-dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) (PEG-PDMAEMA) modified with both the CGN peptide for blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and the Tet1 peptide for neuron-specific binding. The nanocomplexes CT/siRNA, composed of CGN-PEG-PDMAEMA and Tet1-PEG-PDMAEMA at a weight ratio of 1:1, display a good stability in the blood and do not lead to hemolysis at N/P = 10. The internalization of nanocomplexes in neuron cells relies on clathrin-mediated endocytosis and micropinocytosis, while caveolae-mediated endocytosis plays a major role in entrance of CT/siRNA into cerebral capillary endothelial cell bEnd.3. The nanocomplexes successfully escape from lysosomes and enter in the cytoplasm of the neuron cells, inducing effective gene silence (about 50% decrease in BACE1 mRNA levels) and reversing Abeta25-35 oligomer-induced synaptic injury. After caudal vein injection in mice, CT/siRNA display higher brain accumulation than unmodified nanocomplexes (brain drug targeting index = 2.62), and colocalize with neurons or locate nearby. In APP/PS1 transgenic mice, the nanocomplexes significantly decrease BACE1 mRNA and the amyloid plaques, suppress phosphorylated tau protein levels, as well as promote hippocampal neurogenesis. Noticeably, administration of the nanocomplexes restores the cognitive performance of the AD transgenic mice to the level of wild-type control without significant adverse effects on myelination. Our results demonstrate the CT/siRNA nanocomplexes capable of specifically directing BACE1 siRNA to brain neurons with great potential for AD therapy.
