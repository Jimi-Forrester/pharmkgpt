22717612|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers are heterogeneous and instable compounds of variable molecular weight. Flow cytometry and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based methods allow the simultaneous detection of Abeta oligomers with low and high molecular weight in their native form. We evaluated whether an estimate of different species of Abeta oligomers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with or without dilution with RIPA buffer could be more useful in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) than the measurement of Abeta42 monomers, total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau). Increased t-tau (p < 0.01) and p-tau (p < 0.01), and decreased Abeta42 (p < 0.01), were detected in the CSF of patients with AD (n = 46), compared to patients with other dementia (OD) (n = 35) or with other neurological disorders (OND) (n = 56). In native CSF (n = 137), the levels of Abeta oligomers were lower (p < 0.05) in AD than in OD and OND patients; in addition, the ratio Abeta oligomers/p-tau was lower in AD than in OD (p < 0.01) and OND (p < 0.05) patients, yielding a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 64%. However, in CSF diluted with RIPA (n = 30), Abeta oligomers appeared higher (p < 0.05) in AD than in OND patients, suggesting they become partially disaggregated and more easily detectable after RIPA. In conclusion, FRET analysis in native CSF is essential to correctly determine the composition of Abeta oligomers. In this experimental setting, the simultaneous estimate of low and high molecular weight Abeta oligomers is as useful as the other biomarkers in the diagnosis of AD. The low amount of Abeta oligomers detected in native CSF of AD may be inversely related to their levels in the brain, as occurs for Abeta monomers, representing a biomarker for the amyloid pathogenic cascade.
