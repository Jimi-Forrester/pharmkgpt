16229859|a|Non-enzymatic glycation is implicated in the development of various diseases such as Alzheimer's and diabetes mellitus. However, it is also observed during the physiologic process of aging. There is considerable interest in the contribution of oxidative stress to diabetes mellitus. An increase in the generation of reactive oxygen species can occur by non-enzymatic glycation and glucose autoxidation. Both of these processes lead to the formation of AGEs (Advanced glycation end-products) that contribute to the irreversible modification of enzymes, proteins, lipids and DNA. In this study, the effect of chronic hyperglycemia on the antioxidant system of diabetic rats was evaluated. The working hypothesis is that the loss of glucose homeostasis reduces the capacity to respond to oxidative damage. The enzymatic activities of CAT (catalase), GPx (gluthatione peroxidase), GR (gluthatione reductase) and GSH (reduced gluthatione) were increased in the blood of healthy rats subjected to endurance training, whereas, in diabetic rats the activities of CAT, GPx and GR were unaltered by similar training. SOD showed low activity in endurance-trained rats. The administration of aminoguanidine (an inhibitor of glycation reactions) in the drinking water increased the activities of CAT, GPx and GR, suggesting that glycation may be responsible for the partial inactivation of these enzymes. These results indicate that the association of hyperglycemia with strenuous physical exercise may induce cellular damage by impairing the antioxidant defense system.
