32793411|a|Legionnaires' disease is a form of atypical community-acquired pneumonia usually caused by Legionella pneumophilia, which is typically associated with exposure to tower cooling or water systems. In Australia, Legionnaires' disease is more commonly caused by Legionella longbaechae, which is typically associated with exposure to soil or compost materials, and the presence of Legionella pneumophilia is less recognized. We report a sporadic case of Legionnaires' disease caused by Legionella pneumophilia serogroup 1 that was contracted following exposure to potting mix and topsoil.
