36565333|a|BACKGROUND: Sepsis has a complex pathogenesis in which the uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response triggered by infection leads to vascular barrier disruption, microcirculation dysfunction and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Numerous recent studies reveal that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) acts as a "molecular scissor" playing a pivotal role in the inflammatory response during sepsis by regulating proteolysis by cleaving various membrane protein substrates, including proinflammatory cytokines, cadherins and Notch, which are involved in intercellular communication. ADAM10 can also act as the cellular receptor for Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin, leading to lethal sepsis. However, its substrate-specific modulation and precise targets in sepsis have not yet to be elucidated. METHODS: We performed a computer-based online search using PubMed and Google Scholar for published articles concerning ADAM10 and sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: In this review, we focus on the functions of ADAM10 in sepsis-related complex endothelium-immune cell interactions and microcirculation dysfunction through the diversity of its substrates and its enzymatic activity. In addition, we highlight the posttranslational mechanisms of ADAM10 at specific subcellular sites, or in multimolecular complexes, which will provide the insight to intervene in the pathophysiological process of sepsis caused by ADAM10 dysregulation.
