39834963|t|Re-optimizing the Time Frame for Classifying Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis: An Unmet Need.
39834963|a|Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare and complex form of stroke, representing a small percentage of all stroke cases. The disease's clinical presentation is highly variable, involving a wide range of medical specialists due to its diverse manifestations. Over the past decade, significant advancements in understanding CVT have been made, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent vaccination efforts. Current classification systems of CVT, which categorize the disease as acute, subacute, or chronic based on symptom onset, vary significantly in their criteria and practical relevance. Key challenges include aligning these time-based classifications with real-world delays in diagnosis and treatment, as well as understanding the timing and nature of complications such as raised intracranial pressure and the need for decompressive procedures. Radiological studies of clot morphology provide additional insights, suggesting that clot characteristics may indicate the recanalization potential and influence treatment strategies. However, the relationship between clot recanalization and clinical outcomes remains debated. A comprehensive classification that integrates clinical, radiological, and prognostic parameters could aid in better managing CVT and improving patient outcomes.
