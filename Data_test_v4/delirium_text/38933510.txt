38933510|a|According to a study from World Health Organization's Global Burden of Disease, mental and neurological disorders have accounted for 13% of global diseases in recent years and are on the rise. Neuropsychiatric conditions or neuroinflammatory disorders are linked by the presence of an exaggerated immune response both peripherally and in the central nervous system (CNS). Cognitive dysfunction (CD) encompasses a complex group of diseases and has frequently been described in the field of autoimmune diseases, especially in multiple non-CNS-related autoimmune diseases. Recent studies have provided various hypotheses regarding the occurrence of cognitive impairment in autoimmune diseases, including that abnormally activated immune cells can disrupt the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to trigger a central neuroinflammatory response. When the BBB is intact, autoantibodies and pro-inflammatory molecules in peripheral circulation can enter the brain to activate microglia, inducing CNS inflammation and CD. However, the mechanisms explaining the association between the immune system and neural function and their contribution to diseases are uncertain. In this review, we used clinical statistics to illustrate the correlation between CD and autoimmune diseases that do not directly affect the CNS, summarized the clinical features and mechanisms by which autoimmune diseases trigger cognitive impairment, and explored existing knowledge regarding the link between CD and autoimmune diseases from the perspective of the field of neuroimmunology.
