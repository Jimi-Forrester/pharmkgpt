37009459|a|Background: Previous studies reported inconsistent results regarding association between diabetes mellitus (DM), prediabetes and risk, disease progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). The meta-analysis was made to investigate association between DM, prediabetes and risk, disease progression of PD. Methods: Literatures investigating association between DM, prediabetes and risk, disease progression of PD were searched in these databases: PubMed and Web of Science. Included literatures were published before October 2022. STATA 12.0 software was used to compute odds ratios (ORs)/relative risks (RRs) or standard mean differences (SMDs). Results: DM was associated with a higher risk of PD, compared to non-diabetic participants with a random effects model (OR/RR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.12-1.35, I 2 = 90.4%, p < 0.001). PD with DM (PD-DM) was associated with a faster motor progression compared to PD without DM (PD-noDM) with a fixed effects model (RR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.47-2.34, I 2 = 47.3%, p = 0.091). However, meta-analysis for comparison in change rate of United Rating Scale (UPDRS) III scores from baseline to follow-up time between PD-DM and PD-noDM reported no difference in motor progression between PD-DM and PD-noDM with a random effects model (SMD = 2.58, 95% CI = -3.11 to 8.27, I 2 = 99.9%, p < 0.001). PD-DM was associated with a faster cognitive decline compared to PD-noDM with a fixed effects model (OR/RR = 1.92, 95% CI 1.45-2.55, I 2 = 50.3%, p = 0.110). Conclusions: In conclusion, DM was associated with a higher risk and faster disease decline of PD. More large-scale cohort studies should be adopted to evaluate the association between DM, prediabetes and PD.
