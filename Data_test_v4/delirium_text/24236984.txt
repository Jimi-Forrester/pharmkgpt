24236984|a|OBJECTIVE: Literature favours the in vitro neuroprotective role of caffeic acid, a naturally derived polyphenolic compound. This study was aimed to investigate the role of caffeic acid in experimental model of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Firstly, caffeic acid was tested for in vitro anticholinesterase potential using rat brain homogenate. Later, in vivo antidementia activity of caffeic acid was assessed against aluminium chloride (AlCl3 )-induced dementia in rats. Behavioural (Morris water maze test) and brain biochemical parameters (acetylcholinesterase (AChE), catalase, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity, glutathione (GSH) and nitrite levels) were assessed to correlate the cognitive function with cholinergic transmission and oxidative stress. KEY FINDINGS: Rats administered with caffeic acid showed improved cognitive function in Morris water maze test. The antidementia activity of caffeic acid was confirmed by the reduction in brain AChE activity and nitrite levels. Further, caffeic acid corrected the diminished level of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, GSH and GST in brain. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest the antidementia activity of caffeic acid against AlCl3 -induced dementia in rats. The outcome of present study offers a wider scope to screen caffeic acid against neurodegeneration associated disorders.
