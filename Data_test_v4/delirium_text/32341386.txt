32341386|a|To investigate (1) the effects of indoor incense burning upon cognition over 3 years; (2) the associations between indoor incense burning with the brain's structure and functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN); and (3) the interactions between indoor incense burning and vascular disease markers upon cognitive functions. Community older adults without stroke or dementia were recruited (n = 515). Indoor incense use was self-reported as having burnt incense at home >= weekly basis over the past 5 years. Detailed neuropsychological battery was administered at baseline (n = 227) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment at baseline and year 3 (n = 515). MRI structural measures and functional connectivity of the DMN were recorded at baseline. Demographic and vascular risk factors and levels of outdoor pollutants were treated as covariates. Indoor incense burning was associated with reduced performance across multiple cognitive domains at baseline and year 3 as well as decreased connectivity in the DMN. It interacted with diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and white matter hyperintensities to predict poorer cognitive performance. Indoor incense burning is (1) associated with poorer cognitive performance over 3 years; (2) related to decreased brain connectivity; and (3) it interacts with vascular disease to predispose poor cognitive performance.
