33150261|t|Insufficient Postoperative Rehabilitation in Patients with Both Proximal Femoral Fracture and Antecedent Mental Illness.
33150261|a|INTRODUCTION: Though a combination of proximal femoral fracture and mental illness is likely, the management of this combination is not well established. The aim of this study was to clarify the current disposition of acute care and rehabilitation for patients with this combination of conditions at our institution. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 192 patients hospitalized in the psychiatric ward who present with a proximal femoral fracture and an antecedent mental illness. We investigated walking ability prior to injury and after surgery, at discharge from our institution, using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score. RESULTS: Although patients in the psychiatric ward demonstrated postoperative hospital stays approximately 10 days longer than those in the orthopedic ward, more than half of the patients in the psychiatric ward were discharged from our institution with a functional level of complete dependence for walking ability. In addition, nearly 90% of the patients studied were transferred to a psychiatric hospital where no physical therapy or rehabilitation was provided to the inpatients. CONCLUSIONS: At our institution, patients with proximal femoral fracture and antecedent mental illness tended to be discharged with complete dependence in walking ability, often to a psychiatric hospital without physical therapy or rehabilitation. We hope this paper will draw attention to the need for rehabilitation in these patients.
