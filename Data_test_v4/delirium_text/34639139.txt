34639139|a|Oxygen in the atmosphere is a crucial component for life-sustaining aerobic respiration in humans. Approximately 95% of oxygen is consumed as energy and ultimately becomes water; however, the remaining 5% produces metabolites called activated oxygen or reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are extremely reactive. Skin, the largest organ in the human body, is exposed to air pollutants, including diesel exhaust fumes, ultraviolet rays, food, xenobiotics, drugs, and cosmetics, which promote the production of ROS. ROS exacerbate skin aging and inflammation, but also function as regulators of homeostasis in the human body, including epidermal keratinocyte proliferation. Although ROS have been implicated in various skin diseases, the underlying mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. Current knowledge on ROS-related and oxidative stress-related skin diseases from basic research to clinical treatment strategies are discussed herein. This information may be applied to the future treatment of skin diseases through the individual targeting of the ROS generated in each case via their inhibition, capture, or regulation.
