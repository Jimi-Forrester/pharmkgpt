33177021|a|OBJECTIVE: To establish a cell model mimicking Alzheimer's disease (AD) by knocking down SORL1 gene and compare the viability, apoptosis, and expressions of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in this model with a traditional Alzheimer's disease cell model. METHODS: A traditional cell model of AD was established by inducing N2a cells with Abeta25-35, and the optimal Abeta25-35 concentration was determined by assessing the cell viability changes. Another cell model of AD was established by transfecting N2a cells with SORL1-shRNA lentiviral vector, and SORL1 expression in the transfected cells were detected using Western blotting and qRT-PCR. With wild-type N2a cells without any treatment and cells transfected with a scramble shRNA as the control groups, the two cell models were examined for cell viability with MTT assay, cell apoptosis with flow cytometry, and TNF-alpha and IL -1beta levels in the culture supernatant with ELISA. RESULTS: The two cell models of AD showed obviously decreased viability and increased cell apoptosis compared with the untreated control cells or cells transfected with a scramble shRNA (P < 0.05); no significant difference was found in the cell viability and apoptosis rate between the two AD cell models or between the two control groups (P>0.05). Significantly increased expressions of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta were observed in both of the two cell models compared with their respective control groups (P < 0.05) without significant differences between the two cell models or between the two control groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A new AD cell model similar to Abeta25-35-induced AD model can be established by SORL1 knockdown in N2a cells.
