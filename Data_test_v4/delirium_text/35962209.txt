35962209|a|BACKGROUND: The effect of delirium on cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) is unknown. This retrospective study was to examine the effect of delirium on CPX at discharge in aged patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: This study included seventy patients aged 70 or older undergoing cardiac valve surgery, who entered our ICU and were discharged from our hospital between June 2016 and July 2018. All patients received active exercise by our rehabilitation team from the first postoperative day and were performed a CPX on a cycle ergometer before discharge. The anaerobic threshold oxygen uptake and the slope of the relationship between carbon dioxide output and minute ventilation were examined. We obtained the patient's data, including patient's characteristics, cardiac function, anesthesia data, laboratory data, ICU data, and length of ICU and hospital stay. Data were analyzed by unpaired t test or Fisher's exact test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of the 70 patients, 21 patients experienced delirium during ICU stay. The delirium group needed longer administration of sedatives and longer ICU stay and showed higher CRP value and lower renal function but similar cardiopulmonary function before discharge from our hospital compared with the non-delirium group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a history of delirium during ICU showed higher CRP value and lower renal function before discharge, but the CPX values at discharge were not significantly affected by delirium.
