37501064|t|Analysis of the relationship between EEG burst suppression and poor prognosis in children under general anaesthesia: study protocol for a prospective, observational, single-centre study.
37501064|a|BACKGROUND: Emergence delirium (ED) in children refers to the immediate postoperative period when children experience decreased perception of their surroundings, accompanied by disorientation and altered perception. Burst suppression (BS) is recognised as periods longer than 0.50 s during which the EEG does not exceed approximately + 5.0 mV, which is an electroencephalographic state associated with profound inactivation of the brain. Our primary objective was to determine the association between BS on electroencephalogram (EEG) under general anaesthesia with postoperative wake-up delirium and multiple adverse outcomes, such as prolonged awakening and extubation. METHODS: In this prospective, observational cohort study at Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China, children aged 6 months to 9 years who underwent surgery under general anaesthesia and underwent EEG monitoring between January 2022 and January 2023 were included. Patients' prefrontal EEGs were recorded intraoperatively as well as analysed for the occurrence and duration of BS and scored postoperatively for delirium by the PAED scale, with a score of no less than 10 considered as having developed wake-up delirium. DISCUSSION: This study identified a relationship between EEG BS and postoperative awakening delirium under general anaesthesia in children and provides a novel preventive strategy for postoperative awakening delirium and multiple adverse outcomes in paediatric patients.
