34277671|a|Background: To explore the epidemiology, clinical features, risk indicators, and long-term outcomes of neurological complications caused by veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 60 adult patients who underwent V-A ECMO support in our unit from February 2012 to August 2020. These patients were separated into the neurological complications group (NC group) and the non-neurological complications group (nNC group). The differences in basic data and ECMO data between the two groups were compared. The data of long-term neurological prognosis were collected by telephone follow-up. Results: Thirty-nine patients (65.0%) had neurological complications. There were significant differences between the two groups in terms of median age, hypertension, median blood urea nitrogen, median troponin I (TNI), median lactic acid, pre-ECMO percutaneous coronary intervention, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, median peak inspiratory pressure, median positive end expiratory pressure, and median fresh frozen plasma (P < 0.05). The median Intensive Care Unit length of stay (ICU LOS), 28-day mortality, median post-ECMO vasoactive inotropic score, non-pulsate perfusion (NP), and median ECMO duration of the NC group were significantly higher than those of the nNC group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that TNI (P = 0.043), CRRT (P = 0.047), and continuous NP > 12 h (P = 0.043) were independent risk indicators for neurological complications in patients undergoing ECMO. Forty-four patients (73.3%) survived after discharge, and 38 patients (63.3%) had Cerebral Performance Category score of 1-2. And there were significant differences between the two groups in long-term neurological outcomes after discharge for 6 months (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The incidence of neurological complications was higher in patients undergoing V-A ECMO and was closely related to adverse outcomes (including ICU LOS and 28-day mortality). TNI, CRRT, and continuous NP > 12 h were independent risk indicators for predicting neurological complications in ECMO supporting patients. And the neurological complications of patients during ECMO support had significant adverse effect on long-term surviving and neurological outcomes of patients after discharge for 6 months.
