38339689|t|Non-Athletic Cohorts Enrolled in Longitudinal Whole-Body Electromyostimulation Trials-An Evidence Map.
38339689|a|Whole-body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) can be considered as a time-efficient, joint-friendly, and highly customizable training technology that attracts a wide range of users. The present evidence map aims to provide an overview of different non-athletic cohorts addressed in WB-EMS research. Based on a comprehensive systematic search according to PRISMA, eighty-six eligible longitudinal trials were identified that correspond with our eligibility criteria. In summary, WB-EMS research sufficiently covers all adult age categories in males and females. Most cohorts addressed (58%) were predominately or exclusively overweight/obese, and in about 60% of them, diseases or conditions were inclusion criteria for the trials. Cohorts specifically enrolled in WB-EMS trials suffer from cancer/neoplasm (n = 7), obesity (n = 6), diabetes mellitus (n = 5), metabolic syndrome (n = 2), nervous system diseases (n = 2), chronic heart failure (n = 4), stroke (n = 1), peripheral arterial diseases (n = 2), knee arthrosis (n = 1), sarcopenia (n = 3), chronic unspecific low back pain (n = 4), and osteopenia (n = 3). Chronic kidney disease was an eligibility criterion in five WB-EMS trials. Finally, three studies included only critically ill patients, and two further studies considered frailty as an inclusion criterion. Of importance, no adverse effects of the WB-EMS intervention were reported. In summary, the evidence gaps in WB-EMS research were particular evident for cohorts with diseases of the nervous and cerebrovascular system.
