6711351|t|Delirium tremens and related clinical states: changes in calcium and inorganic phosphate concentrations in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.
6711351|a|Calcium and inorganic phosphate were measured in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 11 patients during impending delirium tremens (grade 2) and in nine patients with fully developed delirium tremens (grade 3). The initial sampling of blood and CSF was performed at admission before treatment was initiated. The blood sampling was repeated daily until recovery and at this time a second lumbar puncture was also performed. In grade 3 patients the plasma calcium concentration showed a transient increase after admission; in grade 2 patients the plasma calcium concentration was also somewhat elevated. The changes in plasma calcium concentration after admission correlated significantly with the changes in blood alcohol concentration. In grade 3 patients the CSF calcium concentration decreased between admission and recovery, this possibly relating to an increased cerebral binding capacity in the post intoxication period. No statistically significant changes were seen in either of the diagnostic categories as far as plasma inorganic phosphate concentrations are concerned. CSF inorganic phosphate concentration decreased in a fashion correlated with CSF alcohol concentration and, finally, CSF inorganic phosphate at admission was somewhat lower in grade 3 patients as compared to grade 2, this possibly reflecting a more severe disturbance of cerebral metabolism in grade 3 patients. Essentially, grade 3 patients had lower CSF concentrations of both calcium and inorganic phosphate as compared to grade 2 patients and thus there may exist real differences in the metabolism of these two ions when a severe withdrawal reaction (grade 2) is compared to fully developed delirium tremens (grade 3).
