35255205|t|Small Oligomers of Abeta42 Protein in the Bulk Solution with AlphaFold2.
35255205|a|Aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta42) protein is one hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, and the conformations of the smallest Abeta42 oligomers are largely unknown. Here, we explore the application of the deep learning AlphaFold2 method to the structure determination of Abeta42 monomers up to hexamers. The results shed light on the early Abeta42 aggregation steps in the bulk solution.
