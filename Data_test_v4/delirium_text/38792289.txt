38792289|t|Safe Management of Adverse Effects Associated with Prescription Opioids in the Palliative Care Population: A Narrative Review.
38792289|a|In the palliative care population, prescription opioids are often considered viable pain relief options. However, in this complex patient population, the adverse effects of opioid medications should be identified and managed without delay. Common adverse effects can include constipation, nausea, somnolence, dizziness, vomiting, and pruritus. Less common adverse effects can include potentially lethal respiratory depression and cardiovascular effects. Critical aspects of safe opioid prescribing are recognition of side effects and knowledge of effective management strategies; prompt management is necessary for uninterrupted pain relief. Most complications are managed with general approaches such as dose reduction, opioid rotation, alternate routes of administration, and symptomatic management. The only opioid-induced complication for which US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments currently exist is constipation. Treating laxative-refractory opioid-induced constipation (OIC) with peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs), which block gastrointestinal opioid receptors, can restore gastrointestinal motility and fluid secretion. This narrative review discusses key complications of prescription opioid treatment and their management in the palliative care setting.
