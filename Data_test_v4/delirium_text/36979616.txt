36979616|t|Label-Free Long-Term Methods for Live Cell Imaging of Neurons: New Opportunities.
36979616|a|Time-lapse light microscopy combined with in vitro neuronal cultures has provided a significant contribution to the field of Developmental Neuroscience. The establishment of the neuronal polarity, i.e., formation of axons and dendrites, key structures responsible for inter-neuronal signaling, was described in 1988 by Dotti, Sullivan and Banker in a milestone paper that continues to be cited 30 years later. In the following decades, numerous fluorescently labeled tags and dyes were developed for live cell imaging, providing tremendous advancements in terms of resolution, acquisition speed and the ability to track specific cell structures. However, long-term recordings with fluorescence-based approaches remain challenging because of light-induced phototoxicity and/or interference of tags with cell physiology (e.g., perturbed cytoskeletal dynamics) resulting in compromised cell viability leading to cell death. Therefore, a label-free approach remains the most desirable method in long-term imaging of living neurons. In this paper we will focus on label-free high-resolution methods that can be successfully used over a prolonged period. We propose novel tools such as scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) or digital holography microscopy (DHM) that could provide new insights into live cell dynamics during neuronal development and regeneration after injury.
