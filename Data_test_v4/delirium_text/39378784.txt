39378784|t|Prion protein prevents the inhibition of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel by Tau peptide K18 oligomers.
39378784|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a tauopathy characterized by the deposition of amyloid aggregates of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein and amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in the brain. Nevertheless, a soluble, oligomeric forms of Tau and Abeta are considered to be the most neurotoxic species responsible for neurodegenerative processes in AD. The mechanism of action of these oligomers remains largely unclear. Previously, we demonstrated the inhibition of the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (BKCa) by Abeta. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the effect of Tau protein on the BKCa activity. Furthermore, since prion protein (PrP) interacts with Tau and the N-terminal fragment of PrP, called N1, can be neuroprotective in tauopathies, we checked whether N1 can also act at the level of BKCa channel. In the studies we used monomers, oligomers and amyloid fibrils of aggregation-prone Tau fragment, called K18, carrying tauopathy-associated mutation - deletion of Lys280 (K18Delta280). Additionally, to induce formation of neurotoxic oligomers, K18Delta280 was phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA). The activity of the plasma membrane BKCa of hippocampal neurons was recorded using single-channel patch-clamp technique in both inside-out and outside-out modes, exposing the cytosolic or extracellular surface of the membrane, respectively. In the outside-out mode - performing the extracellular application of the neurotoxic oligomers of phosphorylated K18Delta280, we observed a significant and concentration-dependent decrease in the probability of opening (Po) of BKCa. The Po of BKCa was fully recovered after washing the oligomers out. In the case of the inside-out patch-clamp configuration, we found that the Po of BKCa was not affected by the oligomers. In contrast to the oligomers, the monomers and amyloid fibrils of K18Delta280 had no effect on the channel activity, analyzed in inside-out as well as outside-out modes. Noteworthy, upon incubation with N1, the oligomers did not inhibit BKCa channel. The BKCa channel inhibition, dependent on the outside-out membrane orientation, implies specific interaction of the oligomers with the extracellular part of the channel. Moreover, our results suggest that N1 can convert the neurotoxic oligomers of Tau into a form which is not able to inhibit the channel, and indicate novel possible neuroprotective mechanism of PrP action in AD and other tauopathies.
