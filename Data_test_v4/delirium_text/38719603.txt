38719603|t|The incidence and influencing factors of in-hospital frailty progression following transcatheter aortic valve implantation.
38719603|a|Objective Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are generally older and frailty is therefore an important clinical issue. The baseline degree of frailty is associated with the prognosis in patients undergoing TAVI; however, the incidence of in-hospital frailty progression and its influencing factors have not yet been elucidated. Methods This observational, single-center study retrospectively evaluated 281 patients who underwent TAVI. The degree of frailty at baseline and discharge was evaluated using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). In-hospital frailty progression was defined as an increase of at least one level in the CFS score at discharge from baseline, and predictors of frailty progression were assessed. Results The median baseline CFS score was 4.0 (interquartile range: 3.0-4.0). In-hospital frailty progression was observed in 49 patients (17.4%). No significant differences were observed in age, sex, comorbidities, or surgical risk scores between patients with and without frailty progression. Patients with frailty progression experienced stroke more frequently during hospitalization than those without (12.2% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.001). A multivariable logistic analysis showed that in-hospital stroke was a significant predictor of frailty progression (odds ratio, 10.7; 95% confidence interval: 2.34-49.2, p = 0.002). Patients with frailty progression had a longer hospital stay than those without frailty progression [7.0 (4.0-17.0) vs. 4.0 (4.0-8.0) days, p = 0.001]. Conclusions In-hospital frailty progression was not uncommon in patients undergoing TAVI. Stroke incidence was a significant influencing factor in frailty progression, whereas baseline comorbidities and surgical risks were not.
