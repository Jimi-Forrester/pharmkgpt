36583504|t|Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells: Novel cell therapy for hematological malignancies.
36583504|a|Over the last decade, the emergence of several novel therapeutic approaches has changed the therapeutic perspective of human malignancies. Adoptive immunotherapy through chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T), which includes the engineering of T cells to recognize tumor-specific membrane antigens and, as a result, death of cancer cells, has created various clinical benefits for the treatment of several human malignancies. In particular, CAR-T-cell-based immunotherapy is known as a critical approach for the treatment of patients with hematological malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), multiple myeloma (MM), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). However, CAR-T-cell therapy of hematological malignancies is associated with various side effects. There are still extensive challenges in association with further progress of this therapeutic approach, from manufacturing and engineering issues to limitations of applications and serious toxicities. Therefore, further studies are required to enhance efficacy and minimize adverse events. In the current review, we summarize the development of CAR-T-cell-based immunotherapy and current clinical antitumor applications to treat hematological malignancies. Furthermore, we will mention the current advantages, disadvantages, challenges, and therapeutic limitations of CAR-T-cell therapy.
