39595507|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This systematic and bibliographic review examines publications in the field of dementia and video game research from 2004 to 2023. The main objective is to assess developments and trends in video game technology for dementia care and detection. METHODS: The PubMed database was the primary source for publications. PRISMA guidelines were applied to structure this review. Ten variables were defined, investigated, and split into three main categories: bibliographic, medical, and technical. RESULTS: The results were synthesized using a quantitative approach to reduce bias through interpretation. Of 209 initial results, 77 publications have been included in the investigation. More studies focus on rehabilitation over assessment and detection of dementia. Clinical trials are typically conducted with limited participants. The most populated trials rarely enrol over 300 subjects. On average, around 38 subjects were enrolled in the trials. These studies are commonly supervised by a trainer or technology specialist, suggesting a technology gap in familiarity in the trial demographic. CONCLUSIONS: Most interventions assessed were custom-designed applications with a specific outcome, focusing on physical activity and cognitive exercises. As the first of its kind, this publication focuses on the technical aspects of applied technologies and development methods. Using video games to treat and detect patients with cognitive impairments like dementia can benefit healthcare professionals, caretakers, and patients.
