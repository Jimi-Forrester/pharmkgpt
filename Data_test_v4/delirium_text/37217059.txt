37217059|t|Molecular insights into the inhibition of early stage of Abeta peptide aggregation and destabilization of Alzheimer's Abeta protofibril by dipeptide D-Trp-Aib: A molecular modelling approach.
37217059|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide aggregates rapidly into the soluble oligomers, protofibrils and fibrils to form senile plaques, a neurotoxic component and pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Experimentally, it has been demonstrated the inhibition of an early stages of Abeta aggregation by a dipeptide D-Trp-Aib inhibitor, but its molecular mechanism is still unclear. Hence, in the present study, we used molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the molecular mechanism of inhibition of an early oligomerization and destabilization of preformed Abeta protofibril by D-Trp-Aib. Molecular docking study showed that the D-Trp-Aib binds at the aromatic (Phe19, Phe20) region of Abeta monomer, Abeta fibril and hydrophobic core of Abeta protofibril. MD simulations revealed the binding of D-Trp-Aib at the aggregation prone region (Lys16-Glu22) resulted in the stabilization of Abeta monomer by pi-pi stacking interactions between Tyr10 and indol ring of D-Trp-Aib, which decreases the beta-sheet content and increases the alpha-helices. The interaction between Lys28 of Abeta monomer to D-Trp-Aib could be responsible to block the initial nucleation and may impede the fibril growth and elongation. The loss of hydrophobic contacts between two beta-sheets of Abeta protofibril upon binding of D-Trp-Aib at the hydrophobic cavity resulted in the partial opening of beta-sheets. This also disrupts a salt bridge (Asp23-Lys28) leading to the destabilization of Abeta protofibril. Binding energy calculations revealed that van der Waals and electrostatic interactions maximally favours the binding of D-Trp-Aib to Abeta monomer and Abeta protofibril respectively. The residues Tyr10, Phe19, Phe20, Ala21, Glu22, Lys28 of Abeta monomer, whereas Leu17, Val18, Phe19, Val40, Ala42 of protofibril contributing for the interactions with D-Trp-Aib. Thus, the present study provides structural insights into the inhibition of an early oligomerization of Abeta peptides and destabilization of Abeta protofibril, which could be useful to design novel inhibitors for the treatment of AD.
