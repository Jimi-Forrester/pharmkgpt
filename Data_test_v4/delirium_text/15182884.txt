15182884|a|The interaction of bedside and basic science has led to the identification ofa short list of pathological proteins as causal in Alzheimer's disease. AI3P has received the most attention, and work with animal models has reinforced the evidence that overproduction of ABP causes cognitive impairments. Animal models are now being used to discover and develop unique therapeutics directed at reversing the deleterious effects of ABP. These models strongly suggest that established Alzheimer's disease might be reversible, not just preventable. Animal models are also demonstrating that other peptides and proteins can enhance or impair cognitive function. These peptides and proteins add further to the list of possible therapeutic candidates. Approaches such as these, and not the commercial antiaging remedies that have no scientific basis, will eventually provide medicine for memory enhancement.
