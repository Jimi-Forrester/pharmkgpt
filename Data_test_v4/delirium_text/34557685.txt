34557685|t|Sudden Cardiac Arrest Secondary to Early Repolarization Syndrome.
34557685|a|A healthy 41-year-old man sustained cardiac arrest secondary to ventricular fibrillation. An extensive ischemic, structural, and genetic evaluation did not identify an attributable pathologic condition. Electrocardiograms were notable for early repolarization pattern. Here we review the diagnosis, prevalence, and prognostic significance of the early repolarization syndrome on sudden cardiac death. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
