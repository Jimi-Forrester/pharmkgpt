33907404|a|INTRODUCTION: The incidence of Alzheimer's disease is on the rise, early detection of cognitive impairment of the elderly is very important. In traditional Chinese medicine, constitution is related to the susceptibility of the human body to diseases. Based on the theory of constitution of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the human population can be classified into 9 constitutions. However, little is known about the characteristics of medical constitution and related biomarkers in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: We measured the TCM Constitution of 214 subjects by using the Constitution in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire (CCMQ). MMSE and MoCA were used to assess cognitive function. The subjects were divided into mild cognitive impairment group (MCI, n = 152) and normal control group (NC, n = 62). The levels of serum Hcy and serum/urine 8-iso-PGF 2alpha were determined. RESULTS: 1) It was found that there was a significant difference in constitution types between MCI and NC. There were significant differences in MMSE and MoCA score, serum Hcy and serum/urine 8-iso-PGF 2a levels between the two groups. 2) In logistic regression analysis, the variables with statistical significance were TCM Constitution of Yang-Deficient, Phlegm-Dampness, Blood-Stasis and abnormal increase of Hcy (OR>1). 3) The MoCA scores had a positive correlation with the MMSE. A statistically significant inverse association was found between serum Hcy, blood and urine 8-iso-PGF 2a and scores of cognitive assessment in MCI. CONCLUSION: Constitution types (Yang-Deficient, Phlegm-Dampness and Blood-Stasis) and abnormal serum Hcy elevation can be used as risk factors for MCI. MoCA scores can serve to detect MCI at early stage. Serum/urine 8-iso-PGF 2alpha has a certain relationship with MCI. Higher levels of serum/urine 8-iso-PGF 2alpha are more likely to be associated with MCI risk.
