30478269|a|Plasma neurofilament light (NFL) has been proposed as a blood-based biomarker for neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and parkinsonian disorders. However, the relationship between plasma NFL and cognitive decline in dementia due to Parkinson's disease (PD) remains to be elucidated. In this research, 119 AD, 56 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 26 non-demented PD (PDND), and 23 Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) patients, as well as 59 cognitively healthy controls (HC) were recruited. Each subject underwent a battery of neuropsychological testing. Plasma NFL levels were measured in duplicate using an NF-Light assay and transferred onto the Simoa platform with a home-brew kit. Plasma NFL was significantly increased in the AD group, compared with the control, MCI, PDND, and PDD groups. Plasma NFL was significantly higher in the PDD group, compared with the PDND group. High plasma NFL correlated with poor cognition in AD and PD, but not with motor symptoms in PD. Plasma NFL may represent a biomarker of cognitive decline in AD and PD, with more specificity for AD.
