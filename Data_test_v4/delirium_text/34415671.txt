34415671|t|Urinary albumin creatinine ratio associated with postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery: A prospective observational study.
34415671|a|INTRODUCTION: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption contributes to postoperative delirium, but cost-effective and non-invasive assessment of its permeability is not practicable in the clinical settings. Urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR), reflecting systemic vascular endothelial dysfunction, may be a prognostic and predictive factor associated with postoperative delirium. The aim was to analyze the relationship between UACR and postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through stratified random sampling, a cohort of 408 individuals aged 60 years and older scheduled for elective non-cardiac surgery were included between February and August 2019 in the single-center, prospective, observational study. The presence of delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) or Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) on the day of surgery, at 2 h after the surgery ending time and on the first 3 consecutive days with repeated twice-daily, with at least 6-h intervals between assessments. Urine samples were collected on one day before surgery, and 1st day and 3rd day after surgery. The primary outcome was the presence of postoperative delirium, and association of the level of UACR with postoperative delirium was evaluated with unadjusted/adjusted analyses and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Postoperative delirium was observed in 26.75% (107 of 400) of patients within 3 days post-surgery. UACR-Pre (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.14-1.49, p < 0.001), UACR-POD1 (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.13-1.27, p < 0.001), and UACR-POD3 (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.08-1.20, p < 0.001) between the delirium and non-delirium groups show a significant difference, even after adjusting for age, education levels, and other factors. CONCLUSION: As the marker of endothelial dysfunction, the high perioperative UACR value may be linked to the postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery.
