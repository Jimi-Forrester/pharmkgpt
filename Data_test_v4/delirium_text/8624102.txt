8624102|a|One of the hallmark pathologic characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders is deposition of the 39-42 amino acid amyloid beta-protein (A beta) in the walls of cerebral blood vessels. The cerebrovascular A beta deposits in these disorders are associated with degenerating smooth muscle cells in the vessel wall which have been implicated in the expression of the amyloid beta-protein precursor (A beta PP) and formation of A beta. We have established primary cultures of human cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells as a model for investigating the cellular pathologic processes involved in the cerebral amyloid angiopathy of AD and related disorders. Recently, we have shown that A beta 1-42, the predominant pathologic cerebrovascular form of A beta, causes extensive cellular degeneration that is accompanied by a striking increase in the levels of cellular A beta PP, potentially amyloidogenic carboxyl terminal A beta PP fragments, and soluble A beta peptide in the cultured human cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells. Together, these studies provide evidence that A beta contributes to the onset and progression of the cerebrovascular pathology associated with AD and related disorders and suggests the mechanism involves a molecular cascade with a novel product-precursor relationship that results in the adverse production and accumulation of A beta.
