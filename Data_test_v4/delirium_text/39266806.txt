39266806|a|Neurodegenerative disorder refers to malfunctioning of neurons their degradation leading to death of neurons. Among various neurodegenerative disorders APHD (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's Disease) are particularly concerning due to their progressive and debilitating nature. The therapeutic agent used for treatment and management of APHD often show unsatisfactory clinical outcome owing to poor solubility and limited permeability across blood brain barrier (BBB). The nose-to brain delivery can overcome this BBB challenge as it can transport drug directly to brain though olfactory pathways bypassing BBB. Additionally, the nanotechnology has emerged as a cutting-edge methodology to address this issue and specifically mucoadhesive micro/nanoemulsion can improve the overall performance of the drug when administered intranasally. Beyond the therapy neurotechnology has emerged as are revolutionary AI-driven BCI (Brain computer interface) aimed to restore independence in patients with function loss due to neuron degeneration/death. A promising BCI Neuralink has been recently explored for clinical trials and results revealed that a quadriplegia bearing person with implanted Neuralink chip was able to perform few normal functions of daily routine such as playing online games, text messaging, reading, and learning foreign languages online through accessing the particular websites. This review will discuss the fundamental concepts of neurodegeneration, application of micro/nanoemulsion through intranasal route and integration of neurotechnology for the management and treatment of APHD.
