9553957|a|A clinical trial in patients with Alzheimer's disease has indicated that frequent intramuscular (i.m.) treatment with desferrioxamine (DFO) slows progression of the disease. Confirmatory trials have not been carried out, partly because of the rigors of twice daily intramuscular injections over a period of 2 years, even though the initial report gave promising results. The aim of the present study was to determine an optimal DFO treatment protocol in an animal model exhibiting Alzheimer's-like intraneuronal protein aggregates, previously shown to be partially reversed by such treatment. New Zealand white rabbits were injected intracisternally with either aluminum (Al) maltolate or with saline on day 0. Intramuscular injections of DFO were given to selected rabbits for 2 days prior to sacrifice on days 4, 6 or 8. Bielschowsky's silver impregnation demonstrated widespread neurofibrillary degeneration (NFD) in neuronal cell bodies and neurites of brain and spinal cord from Al-treated rabbits. Monoclonal antibodies Tau-2, AT8, PHF-1 and Alz-50, all of which characteristically stain neurofibrillary tangles associated with Alzheimer's disease, strongly labeled the Al-induced NFD. The number of positive neurons and staining intensities were much less in rabbits treated with Al and subsequently with DFO, than in animals only given Al. Control rabbit receiving intracisternal saline were negative for NFD. The results of quantitative immunohistochemistry using image analysis confirmed that immunostaining densities with all tau mAbs were higher in Al-treated than in Al-DFO-treated or in saline-treated controls. Furthermore, it appears that hyperphosphorylation of tau does not make this protein resistant to degradation once Al has been removed by DFO treatment. The effectiveness of only two days of DFO treatment in reversing Al-induced neurofibrillary degeneration suggests that further clinical trials of DFO for treatment of Alzheimer's disease should be attempted using much less frequent administration of DFO than in the initial study (Crapper McLachlan et al., 1991).
