25413509|a|BACKGROUND: Hypersexuality is defined as an increase in libido. It is often confounded with sexual disinhibition and inappropriate sexual behavior directed against oneself or against others. It is described in 2.9 to 8% of patients living at home and in 3.8 to 7% of patients in institutions. The pathophysiology of hypersexuality is complex. Several brain areas are involved. The psychological factors are also important. We found it useful to present a clinical case of a patient who presented with symptoms of hypersexuality and to discuss the diagnosis and the management. METHODS: Data collection was based on the case of a patient hospitalized in the Department of Psychosomatic medicine in CHU Mont-Godinne - Yvoir - Belgium in February 2013. For the literature review, we used the database PubMed with the following keywords: hypersexuality, dementia. A total of 40 articles were selected for this study. RESULTS: The patient had symptoms of hypersexuality, and hyperorality in the context of delirium induced by benzodiazepine withdrawal. A blood test and brain imaging were normal. She was put under risperidone 2 mg with complete resolution of symptoms within a few days. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of Kluver-Bucy syndrome in the context of a minor neurocognitive disorder was retained. Management is mainly non-pharmacological using behavioral techniques. The education of the patient, his partner and caregivers are essential. Pharmacotherapy is sometimes necessary. It is reserved as a last resort because of the serious side effects of the drugs used.
