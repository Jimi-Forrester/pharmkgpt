38217550|t|The risk of developing dementia in the COVID-19 pandemic; a cohort study.
38217550|a|OBJECTIVES: The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on cognitive decline are not fully understood. Higher social activity and relationships have been associated with decreased risk of dementia. We hypothesised that risk of transition to dementia would increase after the start of the first national lockdown. METHODS: We obtained data from the Brains for Dementia (BDR) cohort, which has collected roughly annual data on 3726 older adults with and without dementia since 2008. Data continued to be collected during the lockdowns, although by telephone and/or video call instead of in person. Individuals diagnosed with dementia at study entry were excluded from this study as were individuals with only one visit. Cognitive status was classified using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score. Poisson regression with cubic splines to account for differences in age was used to compare the incidence of dementia before and after March 1st 2020. RESULTS: Out of 2242 individuals, 208 individuals developed dementia before and 50 developed dementia after 01/03/20. The incidence rate ratio of developing dementia after 01/03/20 was 0.847 (0.538-1.335) p = 0.570. In our secondary analysis we found that the positive association between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia incidence decreased after 1/3/20 (interaction effect p = 0.031). CONCLUSION: The incidence of dementia as defined using the CDR global score did not change significantly after the first lockdown began, but we found evidence that lockdown decreased the positive association between MCI and dementia incidence. This may reflect that individuals were progressing to dementia more rapidly and thus missing the MCI stage or that assessing patients over the phone made diagnosing MCI more challenging.
