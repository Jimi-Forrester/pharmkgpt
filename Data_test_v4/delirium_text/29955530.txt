29955530|t|Management of serious cardiac adverse effects of antipsychotic medications.
29955530|a|The use of antipsychotic medications has now expanded to multiple mental health conditions beyond schizophrenia. This has increased the overall population exposure to these medications, which have been associated with both metabolic changes and adverse cardiovascular effects. QTc prolongation, torsades de pointes, sudden cardiac death, myocarditis, and cardiomyopathy are all very real concerns that clinicians face on a regular basis. One must take these risks into consideration when selecting antipsychotic therapy and also when determining whether therapeutic changes and adjustments are necessary. This review examines a number of cardiac-associated concerns, the role that antipsychotics may play in contributing to these adverse events, and suggested management interventions.
