32857486|a|INTRODUCTION: The early recognition and management of the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are important to inform treatment decisions. Current BPSD screening tools are time-consuming and require advanced skills, limiting their application in routine clinical practice. An easier and quicker tool for use by nonphysician healthcare personnel is needed. METHODS: A 14-item, Thai-language, BPSD scoring system for dementia (BPSD-T) was developed, based on clinical surveys and modifications after a pilot study. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), BPSD-T, Thai Mental State Examination (TMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), and Barthel Index were performed. BPSD-T and NPI scores were compared, and test validity and reliability were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 168 people with dementia (mean age, 80.7 +- 6.7 years) and their primary caregivers were recruited. A total of 105 (62.5%) subjects were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 31 (18.5%) with AD with small-vessel disease. The Global CDR was 0.5-1 for 73.8% of subjects, and 2-3 for 26.2%. The BPSD-T content validity index was 0.80-0.98, with high inter-rater and test-retest reliability. Confirmatory factor analysis showed the goodness of fit of 5 clusters of BPSD-T included a psychomotor syndrome (aggression, irritability, delusions, insomnia), an affective syndrome (apathy, repeating, anxiety, depression), a psychosis syndrome (misidentification, hallucinations), a behavior syndrome (hoarding, rummaging, wandering), and a euphoria syndrome (euphoria). Convergent validity showed a high correlation of the frequency score (r = 0.66) and caregiver distress score (r = 0.76) with the NPI. The BPSD-T score was significantly higher with more severe dementia. The average completion time for the BPSD-T (230.9 +- 65.5 s) was significantly less than that for NPI (506 +- 196.9 s; p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: BPSD-T is a quick, reliable, and valid test to evaluate BPSD from the common dementia subtypes and severity, with a good correlation with the NPI. Its application in routine clinical practice will enable earlier recognition, targeted intervention, improved quality of care, and reduced caregiver burden.
