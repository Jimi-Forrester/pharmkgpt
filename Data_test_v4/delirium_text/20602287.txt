20602287|t|A spatial pattern analysis of beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition in the temporal lobe in Alzheimer's disease.
20602287|a|To determine the factors influencing the distribution of -amyloid (Abeta) deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the spatial patterns of the diffuse, primitive, and classic A deposits were studied from the superior temporal gyrus (STG) to sector CA4 of the hippocampus in six sporadic cases of the disease. In cortical gyri and in the CA sectors of the hippocampus, the Abeta deposits were distributed either in clusters 200-6400 microm in diameter that were regularly distributed parallel to the tissue boundary or in larger clusters greater than 6400 microm in diameter. In some regions, smaller clusters of Abeta deposits were aggregated into larger 'superclusters'. In many cortical gyri, the density of Abeta deposits was positively correlated with distance below the gyral crest. In the majority of regions, clusters of the diffuse, primitive, and classic deposits were not spatially correlated with each other. In two cases, double immunolabelled to reveal the Abeta deposits and blood vessels, the classic Abeta deposits were clustered around the larger diameter vessels. These results suggest a complex pattern of Abeta deposition in the temporal lobe in sporadic AD. A regular distribution of Abeta deposit clusters may reflect the degeneration of specific cortico-cortical and cortico-hippocampal pathways and the influence of the cerebral blood vessels. Large-scale clustering may reflect the aggregation of deposits in the depths of the sulci and the coalescence of smaller clusters.
