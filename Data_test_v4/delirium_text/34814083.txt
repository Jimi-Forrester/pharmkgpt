34814083|t|Redox regulation of DUBs and its therapeutic implications in cancer.
34814083|a|Reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as a double-edged sword in cancer, where low levels of ROS are beneficial but excessive accumulation leads to cancer progression. Elevated levels of ROS in cancer are counteracted by the antioxidant defense system. An imbalance between ROS generation and the antioxidant system alters gene expression and cellular signaling, leading to cancer progression or death. Post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and SUMOylation, play a critical role in the maintenance of ROS homeostasis by controlling ROS production and clearance. Recent evidence suggests that deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs)-mediated ubiquitin removal from substrates is regulated by ROS. ROS-mediated oxidation of the catalytic cysteine (Cys) of DUBs, leading to their reversible inactivation, has emerged as a key mechanism regulating DUB-controlled cellular events. A better understanding of the mechanism by which DUBs are susceptible to ROS and exploring the ways to utilize ROS to pharmacologically modulate DUB-mediated signaling pathways might provide new insight for anticancer therapeutics. This review assesses the recent findings regarding ROS-mediated signaling in cancers, emphasizes DUB regulation by oxidation, highlights the relevant recent findings, and proposes directions of future research based on the ROS-induced modifications of DUB activity.
