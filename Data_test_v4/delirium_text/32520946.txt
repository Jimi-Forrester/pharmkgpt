32520946|a|BACKGROUND: Mild Behavioural Impairment (MBI), an "at risk" state for incident cognitive declin, is characterized by late onset, sustained neuropsychiatric symptoms of any severity which cannot be accounted for by other formal medical and psychiatric nosology. There is no study related to MBI from India. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this cross-sectional observational study 124 subjects 60 years and above were recruited between March 2017 to October 2018, from memory clinic of department of Geriatric medicine with memory or behavioural complains. Subjects with major neurocognitive impairment (CDR score of 1 or more), major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and impaired activities of daily living (ADL) were excluded. Subjects with Mild Cognitive impairment (MCI) (CDR- 0.5), and Subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) (CDR- 0) were included. Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) was used to identify the presence of NPS. The ISTAART-MBI (International Society of Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment-Alzheimer's Association) diagnostic criteria was used to diagnose MBI. All the participants underwent a geriatric assessment using standardised screening. The objectives of this study was to determine the frequency of mild behavioural impairment (MBI), and its domains, in MCI or SCI and its association with comorbidities and geriatric syndromes. The mean age of the participants was 69.21, 71.77% (89) were male and 28.23% (35) were female. 41.13% (51) of these individuals were diagnosed with MBI. The MBI and non MBI group differed significantly in marital status, cognitive status and MCI subtype. The proportion of domains involved are as follows: decreased motivation 60.78%(31), emotional dysregulation 54.90% (28), impulse dyscontrol 68.63% (35), social inappropriateness 21.57%(11), abnormal perception 2 (3.93%). Presence of multi-morbidity, and diabetes, were statistically significant between the groups. CONCLUSION: This study presents the first clinic-based prevalence estimates of MBI from Asia. Findings indicate a relatively high prevalence of MBI in predementia clinical states, impulse dyscontrol was the most commonly involved MBI domain. Multimorbidity, diabetes, urinary incontinence were other determinants of MBI.
