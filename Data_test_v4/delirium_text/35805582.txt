35805582|t|Recording of Chronic Diseases and Adverse Obstetric Outcomes during Hospitalizations for a Delivery in the National Swiss Hospital Medical Statistics Dataset between 2012 and 2018: An Observational Cross-Sectional Study.
35805582|a|The prevalence of chronic diseases during pregnancy and adverse maternal obstetric outcomes in Switzerland has been insufficiently studied. Data sources, which reliably capture these events, are scarce. We conducted a nationwide observational cross-sectional study (2012-2018) using data from the Swiss Hospital Medical Statistics (MS) dataset. To quantify the recording of chronic diseases and adverse maternal obstetric outcomes during delivery in hospitals or birthing centers (delivery hospitalization), we identified women who delivered a singleton live-born infant. We quantified the prevalence of 23 maternal chronic diseases (ICD-10-GM) and compared results to a nationwide Danish registry study. We further quantified the prevalence of adverse maternal obstetric outcomes (ICD-10-GM/CHOP) during the delivery hospitalization and compared the results to existing literature from Western Europe. We identified 577,220 delivery hospitalizations, of which 4.99% had a record for >=1 diagnosis of a chronic disease (versus 15.49% in Denmark). Moreover, 13 of 23 chronic diseases seemed to be substantially under-recorded (8 of those were >10-fold more frequent in the Danish study). The prevalence of three of the chronic diseases was similar in the two studies. The prevalence of adverse maternal obstetric outcomes was comparable to other European countries. Our results suggest that chronic diseases are under-recorded during delivery hospitalizations in the MS dataset, which may be due to specific coding guidelines and aspects regarding whether a disease generates billable effort for a hospital. Adverse maternal obstetric outcomes seemed to be more completely captured.
