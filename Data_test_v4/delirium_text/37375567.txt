37375567|a|BACKGROUND: There is a lack of research on the effects of cannabidiol (CBD) on health-related fitness, physical activity, cognitive health, psychological wellbeing, and concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) in healthy individuals. CBD has potential anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. METHODS: This study aimed to investigate the effects of 8 weeks of CBD on the above-mentioned measures in healthy individuals. Forty-eight participants were randomized into two groups receiving either oral capsules of 50 mg of CBD or a calorie-matched placebo daily. Participants completed pre- and post-intervention assessments, including blood draws, body composition, fitness, physical activity, and self-reported surveys. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between groups regarding body composition, aerobic fitness, muscular strength, physical activity, cognitive health, psychological wellbeing, and resting CRP concentrations. However, the placebo group experienced a decline in mean peak power and relative peak power compared to the CBD group. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that 8 weeks of CBD supplementation may prevent declines in anaerobic fitness over time. However, long-term CBD supplementation may not be beneficial for altering measures of health-related fitness, mental health, and inflammation in healthy individuals.
