28204825|a|Oxidative stress-induced cell injury has been linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Morroniside is an antioxidant derived from the Chinese herb Shan-Zhu-Yu. The present study investigated the neuroprotective effect of morroniside against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced cell death in SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells. H2O2 increased cell apoptosis, as determined by flow cytometry and Hoechst 33342 staining. This effect was reversed by pretreatment with morroniside at concentrations of 1-100 microM. The increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and lipid peroxidation induced by H2O2 was also abrogated by morroniside. H2O2 induced a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, increased caspase-3 activity, and caused downregulation of B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and upregulation of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) expression. These effects were blocked by morroniside pretreatment. Thus, morroniside protects human neuroblastoma cells against oxidative damage by inhibiting ROS production while suppressing Bax and stimulating Bcl-2 expression, thereby blocking mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. These results indicate that morroniside has therapeutic potential for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
