38130871|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative neurological illness with insidious onset. Due to the complexity of the pathogenesis of AD and different pathological changes, the clinical phenotypes of dementia are diverse, and these pathological changes also interact with each other. Therefore, it is of great significance to search for biomarkers that can diagnose these pathological changes to improve the ability to monitor the course of disease and treat the disease. The pathological mechanism hypothesis with high recognition of AD mainly includes the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) around neurons and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, which results in the development of neuronal fiber tangles (NFTs) and mitochondrial dysfunction. AD is an irreversible disease; currently, there is no clinical cure or delay in the disease process of drugs, and there is a lack of effective early clinical diagnosis methods. AD patients, often in the dementia stages and moderate cognitive impairment, will seek medical treatment. Biomarkers can help diagnose the presence or absence of specific diseases and their pathological processes, so early screening and diagnosis are crucial for the prevention and therapy of AD in clinical practice. beta-amyloid deposition (A), tau pathology (T), and neurodegeneration/neuronal damage (N), also known as the AT (N) biomarkers system, are widely validated core humoral markers for the diagnosis of AD. In this paper, the pathogenesis of AD related to AT (N) and the current research status of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood related biomarkers were reviewed. At the same time, the limitations of humoral markers in the diagnosis of AD were also discussed, and the future development of humoral markers for AD was prospected. In addition, the contents related to mitochondrial dysfunction, prion virology and intestinal microbiome related to AD are also described, so as to understand the pathogenesis of AD in many aspects and dimensions, so as to evaluate the pathological changes related to AD more comprehensively and accurately.
