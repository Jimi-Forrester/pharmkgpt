32394109|t|Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms that Predict Cognitive Decline or Impairment in Cognitively Normal Middle-Aged or Older Adults: a Meta-Analysis.
32394109|a|Epidemiological studies have revealed that behavioral and psychological (or non-cognitive) symptoms are risk factors for cognitive decline in older adults. This study aimed to systematically review the literature and determine which behavioral and psychological symptoms are most predictive of future cognitive decline among individuals with no pre-existing cognitive impairments. The selected studies included middle-aged or older adults without cognitive impairments. The predictors were assessed using behavioral and psychological questionnaires, or diagnostic interviews, to identify non-cognitive symptoms or psychiatric clinical conditions. The follow-up period was at least one year, and the design of the selected studies was either retrospective or prospective. This study compared individuals with and without non-cognitive manifestations and resulted in one of three outcomes: (a) a score change on a cognitive measure, (b) a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, or (c) a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or dementia. Four online databases were searched for eligible studies from the database inception to January 17, 2017: MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (OVID), PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Pooled effect sizes were estimated using a random-effect model. Higgins I2, the Q statistic, and tau-squared were used to quantify the observed heterogeneity between the studies. Results indicate that depression and sleep duration (long and short) were the most consistent associations between behavioral or psychological symptoms and cognitive decline. This meta-analysis supports the need to assess behavioral and psychological symptoms in cognitively intact older adults to identify those who are at risk for cognitive decline.
