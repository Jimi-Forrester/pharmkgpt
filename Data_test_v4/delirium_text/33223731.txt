33223731|t|Adjunctive dexmedetomidine for treatment of delirium tremens: Case report and brief review.
33223731|a|Alcohol withdrawal delirium (delirium tremens [DT]) is a medical emergency. Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A agonists (benzodiazepines [BZDs]) are the mainstay of treatment. Resistant alcohol withdrawal requires adjunctive medications along with BZDs and supportive care. DT is associated with significant autonomic dysfunction (sympathetic hyperactivity). Dexmedetomidine is a selective a2-adrenergic receptor agonist which reduces sympathetic over-activity and agitation in delirious patients. We present a case of alcohol withdrawal delirium (DT) who responded well to adjunctive dexmedetomidine infusion resulting in reduced sympathetic activity and reduced dose requirement of BZDs.
