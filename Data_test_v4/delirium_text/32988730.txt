32988730|a|The effect of systemic corticosteroids on clinical outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains controversial. While the use of corticosteroids raises concerns regarding delayed viral clearance, secondary infections, and long-term complications that can lead to increased mortality, corticosteroids have the potential to reduce mortality if used appropriately. Herein, we report good outcomes in two patients with COVID-19 who received systemic corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy. An 83-year-old man with hypertension and smoking history and a 62-year-old man with a drinking habit were transferred to our hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19. The patients developed general malaise and loss of appetite with persistent high fever. Despite the prescription of antiviral drugs, their hypoxemia progressed rapidly. However, after the introduction of systemic corticosteroids, their symptoms improved as the fever decreased, and their hypoxemia gradually improved. These results suggest that some patients with COVID-19 may benefit from the appropriate use of systemic corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy.
