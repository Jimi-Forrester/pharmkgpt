37174640|t|Exploration of the Gut Microbiome in Thai Patients with Major Depressive Disorder Shows a Specific Bacterial Profile with Depletion of the Ruminococcus Genus as a Putative Biomarker.
37174640|a|Maes et al. (2008) published the first paper demonstrating that major depressive disorder (MDD) is accompanied by abnormalities in the microbiota-gut-brain axis, as evidenced by elevated serum IgM/IgA to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria, such as Morganella morganii and Klebsiella Pneumoniae. The latter aberrations, which point to increased gut permeability (leaky gut), are linked to activated neuro-immune and oxidative pathways in MDD. To delineate the profile and composition of the gut microbiome in Thai patients with MDD, we examined fecal samples of 32 MDD patients and 37 controls using 16S rDNA sequencing, analyzed alpha- (Chao1 and Shannon indices) and beta-diversity (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity), and conducted linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) analysis. Neither alpha- nor beta-diversity differed significantly between MDD and controls. Rhodospirillaceae, Hungatella, Clostridium bolteae, Hungatella hathewayi, and Clostridium propionicum were significantly enriched in MDD, while Gracillibacteraceae family, Lutispora, and Ruminococcus genus, Ruminococcus callidus, Desulfovibrio piger, Coprococcus comes, and Gemmiger were enriched in controls. Contradictory results have been reported for all these taxa, with the exception of Ruminococcus, which is depleted in six different MDD studies (one study showed increased abundance), many medical disorders that show comorbidities with MDD, and animal MDD models. Our results may suggest a specific profile of compositional gut dysbiosis in Thai MDD patients, with increases in some pathobionts and depletion of some beneficial microbiota. The results suggest that depletion of Ruminococcus may be a more universal biomarker of MDD that may contribute to increased enteral LPS load, LPS translocation, and gut-brain axis abnormalities.
