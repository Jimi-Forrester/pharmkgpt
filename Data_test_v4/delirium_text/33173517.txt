33173517|a|Background: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials was to investigate the effects of perioperative sleep disturbances on postoperative delirium (POD). Methods: Authors searched for studies (until May 12, 2020) reporting POD in patients with sleep disturbances following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: We identified 29 relevant trials including 55,907 patients. We divided these trials into three groups according to study design: Seven retrospective observational trials, 12 prospective observational trials, and 10 randomized controlled trials. The results demonstrated that perioperative sleep disturbances were significantly associated with POD occurrence in observational groups [retrospective: OR = 0.56, 95% CI: [0.33, 0.93], I 2 = 91%, p for effect = 0.03; prospective: OR = 0.27, 95% CI: [0.20, 0.36], I 2 = 25%, p for effect < 0.001], but not in the randomized controlled trial group [OR = 0.58, 95% CI: [0.34, 1.01], I 2 = 68%, p for effect = 0.05]. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's test. We used a one-by-one literature exclusion method to address high heterogeneity. Conclusions: Perioperative sleep disturbances were potential risk factors for POD in observational trials, but not in randomized controlled trials.
