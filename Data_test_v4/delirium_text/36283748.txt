36283748|t|Series of virtual light therapy interventions for fatigue: a feasibility pilot study protocol for a series of personalised (N-of-1) trials.
36283748|a|INTRODUCTION: Fatigue is one of the most commonly recorded patient symptoms that can result in deficits in aspects of psychomotor functioning, cognition, work performance and mood. Research shows that bright light and dim light therapy may be an efficacious way to reduce symptoms of fatigue. Still, the feasibility, scalability, individual treatment effects and adverse event heterogeneity of these treatments are unknown. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The current study evaluates the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of a series of personalised (N-of-1) interventions for virtual delivery of bright light therapy and dim light therapy versus usual care treatment for fatigue in 60 participants. We hypothesise that this study will provide valuable information about implementing virtual, N-of-1 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for fatigue. It will also offer results about determining participants' ratings of usability and satisfaction with the virtual, personalised intervention delivery system; evaluating participants' improvement of fatigue symptoms; and, in the long term, identify ways to integrate N-of-1 light therapy trials into patient care. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial was approved by the Northwell Health Institutional Review Board. The trial results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. All publications resulting from this series of personalised trials will follow the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials extension for N-of-1 trials CENT 2015 reporting guidelines. REGISTRATION DETAILS: This trial is registered in www. CLINICALTRIALS: gov (number NCT04707846). TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04707846.
