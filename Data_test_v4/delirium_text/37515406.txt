37515406|a|Many proteins that self-assemble into amyloid and amyloid-like fibres can adopt diverse polymorphic forms. These forms have been observed both in vitro and in vivo and can arise through variations in the steric-zipper interactions between  -sheets, variations in the arrangements between protofilaments, and differences in the number of protofilaments that make up a given fibre class. Different polymorphs arising from the same precursor molecule not only exhibit different levels of toxicity, but importantly can contribute to different disease conditions. However, the factors which contribute to formation of polymorphic forms of amyloid fibrils are not known. In this work, we show that in the presence of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine, a highly abundant lipid in the plasma membrane of neurons, the aggregation of alpha-synuclein is markedly accelerated and yields a diversity of polymorphic forms under identical experimental conditions. This morphological diversity includes thin and curly fibrils, helical ribbons, twisted ribbons, nanotubes, and flat sheets. Furthermore, the amyloid fibrils formed incorporate lipids into their structures, which corroborates the previous report of the presence of alpha-synuclein fibrils with high lipid content in Lewy bodies. Thus, the present study demonstrates that an interface, such as that provided by a lipid membrane, can not only modulate the kinetics of alpha-synuclein amyloid aggregation but also plays an important role in the formation of morphological variants by incorporating lipid molecules in the process of amyloid fibril formation.
