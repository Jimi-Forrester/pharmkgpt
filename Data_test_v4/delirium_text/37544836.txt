This study examined impairments in self-assessments of cognitive performance, assessed with traditional neuropsychological assessments and novel virtual reality tests among older persons with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: One hundred twenty-two participants (82 persons with HIV; 79 MCI+) completed a traditional neuropsychological battery, DETECT virtual reality cognitive battery, and self-reported their general cognitive complaints, depressive symptoms, and perceptions of DETECT performance. Relationships between DETECT performance and self-assessments of performance were examined as were the correlations between general cognitive complaints and performance. These relations were evaluated across HIV and MCI status, considering the associations of depressive symptoms, performance, and self-assessment. RESULTS: We found no effect of HIV status on objective performance or self-assessment of DETECT performance. However, MCI+ participants performed worse on DETECT and traditional cognitive tests, while also showing a directional bias towards overestimation of their performance. MCI- participants showed a bias toward underestimation. Cognitive complaints were reduced compared to objective performance in MCI+ participants. Correlations between self-reported depressive symptoms and cognitive performance or self-assessment of performance were nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS: MCI+ participants underperformed on neuropsychological testing, while overestimating performance. Interestingly, MCI- participants underestimated performance to approximately the same extent as MCI+ participants overestimated. Practical implications include providing support for persons with MCI regarding awareness of limitations and consideration that self-assessments of cognitive performance may be overestimated. Similarly, supporting older persons without MCI to realistically appraise their abilities may have clinical importance.
