28123725|t|Assessing the feasibility of clinicopathological features of hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients over 80 years of age.
28123725|a|The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinicopathological features, benefits and problems associated with hepatic resection of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients aged >=80 years. Between 2006 and 2013, hepatic resection was performed in 395 hepatocellular carcinoma patients, including 351 patients aged <80 years and 44 patients aged >=80 years. Clinicopathological examination revealed that the tumor size was significantly larger among patients of >=80 years of age. However, recurrence-free and cumulative survival rates were similar between the two age groups. The occurrence of post-operative complications was an independent risk factor for survival among patients >=80 years of age. In addition, the albumin level was identified as a risk factor for post-operative complications. The post-operative transition towards an improvement in the albumin level in the >=80 years group was significantly lower compared with the <80 years group. It was revealed that hepatic resection was feasible for elderly patients. However, the post-operative improvement in the albumin levels was less marked among patients >=80 years of age, and lower albumin levels were associated with post-operative complications and prognosis. Therefore, elderly patients undergoing hepatic resection should receive peri-operative management including special nutrition.
