35685889|t|Insight Into Biological Targets and Molecular Mechanisms in the Treatment of Arsenic-Related Dermatitis With Vitamin A via Integrated in silico Approach.
35685889|a|Exposure to arsenic (As), an inorganic poison, may lead to skin lesions, including dermatitis. Vitamin A (VA), a fat-soluble vitamin essential for mucous membrane integrity, plays a key role in skin protection. Although the beneficial actions of VA are known, the anti-As-related dermatitis effects of VA action remain unclear. Hence, in this study, we aimed to interpret and identify the core target genes and therapeutic mechanisms of VA action in the treatment of As-related dermatitis through integrated in silico approaches of network pharmacology and molecular docking. We integrated the key VA-biological target-signaling pathway-As-related dermatitis networks for identifying core drug targets and interaction pathways associated with VA action. The network pharmacology data indicated that VA may possess potential activity for treating As-related dermatitis through the effective regulation of core target genes. An enrichment analysis in biological processes further revealed multiple immunoregulation-associated functions, including interferon-gamma production and negative regulation of T-cell activation and production of molecular mediator of immune response. An enrichment analysis in molecular pathways mainly uncovered multiple biological signaling, including natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, autophagy, apoptosis, necroptosis, platelet activation involved in cell fate, and immunity regulations. Molecular docking study was used to identify docked well core target proteins with VA, including Jun, tumor protein p53 (TP53), mitogen-activated protein kinase-3 (MAPK3), MAPK1, and MAPK14. In conclusion, the potential use of VA may suppress the inflammatory stress and enhance the immunity against As-related dermatitis. In the future, VA might be useful in the treatment of dermatitis associated with As through multi-targets and multi-pathways in clinical practice.
