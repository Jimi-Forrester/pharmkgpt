37830621|t|An Overview of the Role of Furin in Type 2 Diabetes.
37830621|a|Post-translational modifications (PTMs) play important roles in regulating several human diseases, like cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic disorders. Investigating PTMs' contribution to protein functions is critical for modern biology and medicine. Proprotein convertases (PCs) are irreversible post-translational modifiers that have been extensively studied and are considered as key targets for novel therapeutics. They cleave proteins at specific sites causing conformational changes affecting their functions. Furin is considered as a PC model in regulating growth factors and is involved in regulating many pro-proteins. The mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is another key player in regulating cellular processes and its dysregulation is linked to several diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D). The role of furin in the context of diabetes has been rarely explored and is currently lacking. Moreover, furin variants have altered activity that could have implications on overall health. In this review, we aim to highlight the role of furin in T2D in relation to mTOR signaling. We will also address furin genetic variants and their potential effect on T2D and beta-cell functions. Understanding the role of furin in prediabetes and dissecting it from other confounding factors like obesity is crucial for future therapeutic interventions in metabolic disorders.
