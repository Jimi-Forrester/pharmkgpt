26440661|a|Patients with severe stage of dementia present several psycho-behavioral disorders, caused by an altered perception of their environment and a feeling of isolation. Most of them are bedridden because of the advanced stage of Alzheimer's disease which causes cognitive dysfunctions and physical disorders, including coordination movement problems. Consequently, their freedoms of movement are limited as well as the quality of their communication. In this study, a new care support using activities on the ground is proposed to compensate for the massive cognitive and psychological losses and enhance their communication skills. The results of this study show that ground activities seem to be a promising way to reduce psycho-behavioral disorders and recreate communication link of the patients presenting with a severe stage of dementia.
