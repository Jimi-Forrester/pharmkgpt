33631839|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide aggregates are linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Posttranslationally pyroglutamylated Abeta (pEAbeta) occurs in AD brains in significant quantities and is hypertoxic, but the underlying structural and aggregation properties remain poorly understood. Here, the structure and aggregation of Abeta1-40 and pEAbeta3-40 are analyzed separately and in equimolar combination. Circular dichroism data show that Abeta1-40 , pEAbeta3-40 , and their combination assume alpha-helical structure in dry state and transition to unordered structure in aqueous buffer. Abeta1-40 and the 1:1 combination gradually acquire beta-sheet structure while pEAbeta3-40 adopts an alpha-helix/beta-sheet conformation. Thioflavin-T fluorescence studies suggest that the two peptides mutually inhibit fibrillogenesis. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy identifies the presence of beta-turn and alpha-helical structures in addition to beta-sheet structure in peptides in aqueous buffer. The kinetics of transitions from the initial alpha-helical structure to beta-sheet structure were resolved by slow hydration of dry peptides by D2 O vapor, coupled with isotope-edited FTIR. These data confirmed the mutual suppression of beta-sheet formation by the two peptides. Remarkably, pEAbeta3-40 maintained a significant fraction of alpha-helical structure in the combined sample, implying a reduced beta-sheet propensity of pEAbeta3-40 . Altogether, the data imply that the combination of unmodified and pyroglutamylated Abeta peptides resists fibrillogenesis and favors the prefibrillar state, which may underlie hypertoxicity of pEAbeta.
