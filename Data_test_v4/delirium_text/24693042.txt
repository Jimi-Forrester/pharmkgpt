24693042|a|The investigations on sources and viability of stem cells are important as stem cell transplantation has shown promising results in diseases like leukemias and lymphomas. Umbilical cord blood samples were collected in a closed aseptic system. The samples were diluted with phosphate buffered saline, treated with ficol and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for the recovery of progenitor stem cells.The stem cells were cryopreserved with different media Containing DMSO, patient's serum and human albumin.The viability of the cells was studied by dye exclusion method. Suitable media are necessary for optimal cryoprotection and prevention of cryoinjury DMSO is essential for improved cryopreservation and post-thaw quality. The addition of a protein additive also provides a protective effect. The medium containing DMSO, DMEM and patient's serum proved to be the most effective for cryopreservation and viability as high as 82.4% was achieved after one year. The unique findings of the present study are that the addition of patient's serum enhances the cryoprotection and cord blood stem cells can be stored at -20 C for the duration up to two months instead of the requirement of storage at ultralow temperature at -186 C.
