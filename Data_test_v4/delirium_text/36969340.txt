36969340|a|Background: Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has demonstrated efficacy in treating gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, such as Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). GI dysfunction is a frequent and occasionally dominating symptom of progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS). However, it is not known whether FMT has clinical efficacy for PSP-RS. Methods: This 36-week, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 2 clinical trial was performed at a university tertiary referral hospital in China. From August 15 2021 to December 31 2021, a total of 68 newly diagnosed patients with PSP-RS (male 40 [59%], female 28 [41%]) who had never received any antiparkinsonian medications were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either healthy donor FMT (n = 34, FMT group) or a mixture of 0.9% saline and food colouring (E150c) as sham transplantation (n = 34, placebo group) through transendoscopic enteral tubing (TET). Two days after oral antibiotics, participants received 1 week of transplantation. After an interval of 4 weeks, retransplantation was performed. Then, the last transplantation was given after another interval of 4 weeks, and the participants were followed up for 24 weeks (week 36). Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: ChiCTR-2100045397. Findings: Among 68 patients who were randomised (mean age, 67.2 (SD 5.1); 40 [59%] were male, 28 [41%] were female), 63 participants completed the trial. Efficacy analyses were performed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set. At week 16, the mean PSP Rating Scale (PSPRS) scores (the primary outcome) improved from 40.1 (SD 7.6) to 36.9 (SD 5.9) in the FMT group, whereas the scores changed from 40.1 (SD 6.9) to 41.7 (SD 6.2) in the placebo group, for a treatment benefit of 4.3 (95% CI, 3.2-5.4) (P < 0.0001). After 3-cycle intervention, symptoms of constipation, depression, and anxiety (the secondary outcome) improved significantly at week 16 in the FMT group compared with the placebo group, the majority of which were maintained at the 24-week follow-up (week 36). Interpretation: Our findings suggest that, compared with placebo, FMT treatment significantly improved motor and nonmotor symptoms in patients with PSP-RS, as well as reduced intestinal inflammation and enhanced the intestinal barrier by regulating the intestinal microbiota composition.
