39609333|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands out as the foremost prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by a complex etiology. Various mechanisms have been proposed to elucidate its onset, encompassing amyloid-beta (Abeta) toxicity, tau hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress and reactive gliosis. The hallmark of AD comprises Abeta and tau aggregation. These misfolded protein aggregates trigger the activation of glial cells, primarily microglia. Microglial cells serve as a major source of inflammatory mediators and their cytotoxic activation has been implicated in various aspects of AD pathology. Activated microglia can adopt M1 or M2 phenotypes, where M1 promotes inflammation by increasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and M2 suppresses inflammation by boosting anti-inflammatory factors. Overexpressed pro-inflammatory cytokines include interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in adjacent brain regions. Furthermore, microglial signaling pathways dysregulated in AD are myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (Myd 88), colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) and dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2), which alter the physiology. Despite numerous findings, the causative role of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in AD remains elusive. This review concisely explores cellular and molecular mechanisms of activated microglia and their correlation with AD pathogenesis. Additionally, it highlights promising therapeutics targeting microglia modulation, currently undergoing preclinical and clinical studies, for developing effective treatment for AD.
