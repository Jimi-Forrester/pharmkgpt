37373409|t|The Protective Effect of Nutraceuticals on Hepatic Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in Wistar Rats.
37373409|a|Nutraceuticals are bioactive compounds present in foods, utilized to ameliorate health, prevent diseases, and support the proper functioning of the human body. They have gained attention due to their ability to hit multiple targets and act as antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, and modulators of immune response and cell death. Therefore, nutraceuticals are being studied to prevent and treat liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). This study evaluated the effect of a nutraceutical solution formed by resveratrol, quercetin, omega-3 fatty acid, selenium, ginger, avocado, leucine, and niacin on liver IRI. IRI was performed with 60 min of ischemia and 4 h of reperfusion in male Wistar rats. Afterward, the animals were euthanized to study hepatocellular injury, cytokines, oxidative stress, gene expression of apoptosis-related genes, TNF-alpha and caspase-3 proteins, and histology. Our results show that the nutraceutical solution was able to decrease apoptosis and histologic injury. The suggested mechanisms of action are a reduction in gene expression and the caspase-3 protein and a reduction in the TNF-alpha protein in liver tissue. The nutraceutical solution was unable to decrease transaminases and cytokines. These findings suggest that the nutraceuticals used favored the protection of hepatocytes, and their combination represents a promising therapeutic proposal against liver IRI.
