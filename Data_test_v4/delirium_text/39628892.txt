39628892|t|Memories and mimics: unveiling the potential of FDG-PET in guiding therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative cognitive disorders.
39628892|a|Fluorodeoxyglucose F18 (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can help clinicians pursue the differential diagnosis of various neurodegenerative diseases. It has become an invaluable diagnostic tool in routine clinical practice in conjunction with computed tomography (CT) imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and biomarker studies. We present a single-institution case series and systematic literature review, showing how FDG-PET imaging has helped physicians diagnose neurodegenerative diseases and their mimickers and how patient care was amended. A single institution analysis and comprehensive literature search were completed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. These medical subjects' headings (MeSH) terms were used: "FDG-PET" AND "dementia" OR "Alzheimer's" OR "neurodegeneration" OR "frontotemporal dementia" OR "atypical parkinsonian syndrome" OR "primary progressive aphasia" OR "lewy body dementia." The inclusion criteria included studies with uncertain diagnoses of neurocognitive disease resolved with FDG-PET, PET/MRI, or PET/CT hybrid imaging. A literature search resulted in 3,976 articles. After considering inclusion and exclusion criteria, 14 case reports and 1 case series were selected, representing 19 patients. The average age of patients was 70.8 years (range: 54-83 years). Five of the 19 patients were females. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) had the highest propensity for being misidentified as another neurodegenerative disease, followed by Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Without accurate molecular imaging, neurodegenerative diseases may be missed or misdiagnosed. Our single-institution case series and literature review demonstrate how FDG-PET brain imaging can be used to correct and clarify preexisting clinical diagnoses of neurodegenerative disease.
