36079921|a|Current evidence on the impact of Mediterranean diet (MeDi) on white matter hyperintensity (WMH) trajectory is scarce. This study aims to examine whether greater adherence to MeDi is associated with less accumulation of WMH. This population-based longitudinal study included 183 cognitively intact adults aged 20-80 years. The MeDi score was obtained from a self-reported food frequency questionnaire; WMH was assessed by 3T MRI. Multivariable linear regression was used to estimate the effect of MeDi on WMH change. Covariates included socio-demographic factors and brain markers. Moderation effects by age, gender, and race/ethnicity were examined, followed by stratification analyses. Among all participants, WMH increased from baseline to follow-up (mean difference [follow-up-baseline] [standard deviation] = 0.31 [0.48], p < 0.001). MeDi adherence was negatively associated with the increase in WMH (beta = -0.014, 95% CI = -0.026--0.001, p = 0.034), adjusting for all covariates. The association between MeDi and WMH change was moderated by age (young group = reference, p-interaction[middle-aged x MeDi] = 0.075, p-interaction[older x MeDi] = 0.037). The association between MeDi and WMH change was observed among the young group (beta = -0.035, 95% CI = -0.058--0.013, p = 0.003), but not among other age groups. Moderation effects by gender and race/ethnicity did not reach significance. Greater adherence to MeDi was associated with a lesser increase in WMH over time. Following a healthy diet, especially at younger age, may help to maintain a healthy brain.
