22394254|a|Assessment of activities of daily living is an important element in the diagnosis of dementia, with research suggesting a link between functional ability and cognition. We investigated the relationship between self- and informant ratings of instrumental activities of daily living (iADL) and verbal executive functioning in early-stage dementia. A total of 96 people with early-stage Alzheimer's disease or vascular or mixed dementia and their carers completed the Functional Activities Questionnaire; people with dementia also completed a test of letter fluency. Letter fluency was associated with self-ratings of iADL, while informant ratings of iADL were associated with the age and Mini-Mental State Examination score of the person with dementia. Self-ratings of perceived functioning suggested significantly less impairment than informant ratings. Those with impaired letter fluency rated themselves as having greater difficulties in iADLs than those who performed better. People with early-stage dementia vary in their subjective level of awareness of their iADL functioning, and difficulties with language production may contribute to better awareness of iADL impairments.
