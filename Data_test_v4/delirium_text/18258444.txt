18258444|a|Exercise is a treatment paradigm that can ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer disease (AD) and AD mouse models. Since exercise is also known to alter the peripheral immune response, one potential mechanism for the cognitive improvement following exercise may be by modulating the inflammatory repertoire in the central nervous system. We investigated the effects of voluntary exercise in the Tg2576 mouse model of AD at a time-point at which pathology has already developed. Inflammatory mRNA markers are increased in sedentary Tg2576 mice versus non-transgenic controls. We demonstrate that short-term voluntary wheel running improved spatial learning in aged transgenic mice as compared to sedentary Tg2576 controls. Inflammatory profiles of the Tg2576 and non-transgenic mice were different following exercise with the non-transgenic mice showing a broader response as compared to the Tg2576. Notably, exercising Tg2576 exhibited increases in a few markers including CXCL1 and CXCL12, two chemokines that may affect cognition.
