29267291|a|BACKGROUND: Despite on-going advances in medical treatment, the burden of disease of pneumonia remains high. We aimed to determine the association of the qSOFA score with in-hospital mortality, length of hospitalisation, and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) in patients with pneumonia. Further, in a subgroup analysis, the outcomes were compared for qSOFA in comparison to other risk scores, including the CURB-65 and SIRS scores. METHODS: In a retrospective analysis, admission data from the ED of the Bern University Hospital, Switzerland, were screened to identify patients admitted for pneumonia. In addition to clinical characteristics, qSOFA and CURB-65 scores and SIRS criteria were assessed and evaluated with respect to the defined study outcomes. RESULTS: 527 patients (median age 66 IQR 50-76) were included in this study. The overall in-hospital mortality was 13.3% (n = 70); 22.0% (n = 116) were transferred to the ICU. The median length of hospitalisation was 7 days (IQR 4-12). In comparison to qSOFA-negative patients, qSOFA-positive patients had increased odds ratios for in-hospital mortality (OR 2.6, 95%:1.4, 4.7, p<0.001) and ICU admission (3.5, 95% CI: 2.0. 5.8, p<0.001) and an increased length of stay (p<0.001). For ICU admission, the specificity of qSOPA-positivity (>=2) was 82.1% and sensitivity 43.0%. For in-hospital mortality, the specificity of qSOPA-positivity (<=2) was 88.9% and sensitivity 24.4%. In the subgroup analysis (n = 366). The area under the receiver operating curve for ICU admission was higher for qSOFA than for the CURB-65 score (p = 0.013). The evaluated scores did not differ significantly in their prognostication of in-hospital mortality (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The qSOFA score is associated with in-hospital mortality, ICU admission and length of hospitalisation in ED patients with pneumonia. Subgroup analysis revealed that qSOFA is superior to CURB-65 in respect to prognostication of ICU admission.
