31877815|t|Antifungal, Antitumoral and Antioxidant Potential of the Danube Delta Nymphaea alba Extracts.
31877815|a|This study aimed to explore for the first time the biological properties such as antifungal, antitumoral and antioxidant of Danube Delta Nymphaea alba (N. alba) leaf and root methanolic extracts. The toxicity studies of N. alba extracts showed no inhibitory effect on wheat seed germination by evaluating the most sensitive physiological parameters (Germination %, Germination index, Vigor index) and using confocal laser scanning microscopy images. The analyzed extracts were found to have high antifungal activity against Candida glabrata with MIC values of 1.717 microg/mL for leaf and 1.935 microg/mL for root. The antitumor activity of the both extracts against A2780/A2780cisR ovarian, LNCaP prostate and MCF-7 breast cancer cells was promising with IC50 values ranging from 23-274 microg/mL for leaf and 18-152 microg/mL for root, and the combination of N. alba extracts with cisplatin showed a synergistic effect (coefficient of drug interaction <1). The antioxidant properties were assessed by beta-carotene bleaching, ABTS and FRAP assays and cyclic voltammetry. Quercetin, the most prominent antioxidant, was quantified in very good yields by spectroelectrochemical assay.
