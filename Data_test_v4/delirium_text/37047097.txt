37047097|t|The Role of Post-Translational Modifications in Regulation of NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation.
37047097|a|Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and subsequent formation of active caspase-1 as well as the maturation of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and gasdermin D (GSDMD), mediating the occurrence of pyroptosis and inflammation. Aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation causes a variety of diseases. Therefore, the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway is a target for prevention and treatment of relative diseases. Recent studies have suggested that NLRP3 inflammasome activity is closely associated with its post-translational modifications (PTMs). This review focuses on PTMs of the components of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the resultant effects on regulation of its activity to provide references for the exploration of the mechanisms by which the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated and controlled.
