6136637|t|The neurochemistry of Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia.
6136637|a|At this time we seem to be on the verge of opening two new fields of research on Alzheimer's disease. To treat the symptoms of this condition, an understanding of the factors regulating acetylcholine synthesis will be very important. Because of the vast amount of work on this neurotransmitter over the last 30 years, rapid progress in this area should be made. However, to truely conquer Alzheimer's disease, we need to learn what it is that attacks and apparently destroys the cholinergic neurons. While this second point may take a little more time to unravel, the work will be both exciting and very worth while.
