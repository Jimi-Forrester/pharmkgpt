15709484|t|Clusterin and Alzheimer's disease.
15709484|a|Clusterin (apolipoprotein J) is a ubiquitous multifunctional glycoprotein with the capability to interact with a broad spectrum of molecules, among them the Alzheimer's Abeta peptide. Due to its co-localization with fibrillar deposits in systemic and cerebral amyloid disorders, clusterin is also considered an amyloid-associated protein. Although no genuine function has been attributed to this protein so far, it has been implicated in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes, a role that may vary according to the protein maturation, sub-cellular localization, and the presence of certain tissue- or cell-specific factors. This review focuses on the importance of clusterin in health and disease conditions, with particular emphasis in its role in Abeta amyloidosis and other disorders of protein folding.
