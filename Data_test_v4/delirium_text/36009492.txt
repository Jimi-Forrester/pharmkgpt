36009492|a|More than 100 protostane triterpenoids have been isolated from the dried rhizomes of Alisma species, designated Alismatis rhizoma (AR), commonly used in Asian traditional medicine to treat inflammatory and vascular diseases. The main products are the alisols, with the lead compounds alisol-A/-B and their acetate derivatives being the most abundant products in the plant and the best-known bioactive products. The pharmacological effects of Ali-A, Ali-A 24-acetate, Ali-B, Ali-B 23-acetate, and derivatives have been analyzed to provide an overview of the medicinal properties, signaling pathways, and molecular targets at the origin of those activities. Diverse protein targets have been proposed for these natural products, including the farnesoid X receptor, soluble epoxide hydrolase, and other enzymes (AMPK, HCE-2) and functional proteins (YAP, LXR) at the origin of the anti-atherosclerosis, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-fibrotic, and anti-proliferative activities. Activities were classified in two groups. The lipid-lowering and anti-atherosclerosis effects benefit from robust in vitro and in vivo data (group 1). The anticancer effects of alisols have been largely reported, but, essentially, studies using tumor cell lines and solid in vivo data are lacking (group 2). The survey shed light on the pharmacological properties of alisol triterpenoids frequently found in traditional phytomedicines.
