35932573|a|This study explores the association between psychiatric symptoms following COVID-19 and demographic, disease-related and premorbid clinical confounders. Global cognition, depression, anxiety and PTSD features were assessed in 152 post-COVID-19 patients, subdivided into being at risk for brain disorders or not. In both groups, clinically meaningful depression, anxiety and PTSD symptoms were mildly-to-moderately frequent (4-45%). No demographic or clinical variables predicted psychiatric measures (except for lower age predicting higher anxiety levels). Depression, anxiety and PTSD measures were associated among each other. Hence, depression-, anxiety- and PTSD-spectrum disturbances in COVID-19 survivors are likely to be unassociated with disease-related and premorbid features.
