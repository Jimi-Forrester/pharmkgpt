25010778|a|Extracellular and intracellular accumulation of amyloid beta 1-42 peptide in different states of aggregation has been involved in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease. However, the precise mechanisms involved in amyloid beta peptide neurotoxicity have not been fully understood. There exists a wide variety of studies demonstrating the binding of amyloid beta peptide to a great variety of macromolecules and that such associations affect the cellular functions. This type of association involves proteins and receptors anchored to the plasma membrane of neurons or immune cells of the central nervous system as well as intracellular proteins that can alter intracellular transport, activate signaling pathways or affect proper mitochondrial function. In this review, we present some examples of such associations and the role played by these interactions, which are generally involved in the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease.
