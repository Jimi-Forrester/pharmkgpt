38068368|t|Comparison of Remimazolam-Flumazenil versus Propofol for Recovery from General Anesthesia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
38068368|a|(1) Purpose: to systematically evaluate the recovery following sedation and anesthesia with remimazolam combined with flumazenil in comparison to propofol. (2) Methods: Electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, were systematically searched from their inception up to 22 October 2023. Included in this analysis were randomized controlled trials (RCT) that compared remimazolam-flumazenil with propofol for the recovery from sedation and anesthesia in adults. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Pooled risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using either fixed-effects or random-effects models, and the results were visualized in forest plots. (3) Results: Nine RCTs involving 745 patients who underwent general anesthesia in three different countries were included. Compared to propofol, the remimazolam-flumazenil combination shortened the emergence time (MD = -4.34 min, 95% CI = [-6.88, -1.81], p = 0.0008, low certainty), extubation time (MD = -4.26 min, 95% CI = [-6.81, -1.7], p = 0.0011, low certainty), and the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) stay (MD = -4.42 min, 95% CI = [-7.45, -1.38], p = 0.0044, low certainty), while reducing the incidence of respiratory depression (RR = 0.2, 95% CI = [0.04, 0.89], p = 0.03, high certainty) after general anesthesia. However, this combination was associated with a higher incidence of re-sedation (RR = 4.15, 95% CI = [1.31, 13.13], p = 0.01, moderate certainty). (4) Conclusions: Based on the existing evidence, the combination of remimazolam and flumazenil accelerates recovery from general anesthesia and lowers the risk of respiratory depression compared to propofol. However, it is important to consider the higher risk of re-sedation when using this combination in clinical practice. Due to limitations in the quality of the evidence, it is advisable to interpret the results of meta-analyses with caution.
