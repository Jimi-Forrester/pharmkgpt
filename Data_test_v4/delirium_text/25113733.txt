25113733|a|A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify randomized trials involving continuous dopaminergic stimulation (CDS) in PD patients with motor complications. Difference between n groups was assessed by partitioning heterogeneity and using the chi2 distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom, where n equals the number of groups. We looked for publication bias using funnel plotting, Egger's test and Begg's test. Twenty Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) were included. The results showed that CDS could evidently improve the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part II (p < 0.0001), part III (P < 0.00001) and UPDRS total score (p < 0.00001). There was also a statistical discrepancy in off time reduction (p < 0.00001) and prolongation of on time (p < 0.00001) by the CDS therapy compared with control groups. Meanwhile, the results of this study showed obvious side effects in the CDS therapy compared with the placebo, especially at the expense of increased dyskinesia (23.4% vs 11.7%). The present study showed that CDS was beneficial in the treatment of PD patients with motor complications. But the incidence of the side events is more common than placebo.
