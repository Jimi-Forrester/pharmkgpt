39828109|a|Postoperative delirium (POD) is a prevalent complication following cardiac surgery, characterized by acute brain dysfunction observed in critically ill patients. Despite the significant impact of POD, there is currently no established treatment. Recent research has suggested that modulation of cholinergic neurotransmission and alpha2-adrenergic receptors may offer a therapeutic strategy for managing delirium during critical illness. This study employs bibliometric analysis to examine the emerging evidence on the role of dexmedetomidine, an alpha2-receptor agonist drug, in the prevention and treatment of POD. A systematic bibliometric analysis was conducted to identify and evaluate the literature on the use of dexmedetomidine in relation to POD. The study period spanned from 2006 to 2022, and the search was conducted in the Web of Science (WOS) database, focusing on relevant references. The analysis included the examination of the most frequent keywords, research trends, and frontiers to provide a comprehensive overview of the field. The bibliometric analysis revealed 160 research papers on the topic, indicating a significant increase in research output over the past decades. The field distribution, knowledge structure, and research topic evolution were identified as key areas of exploration. The analysis also highlighted the emergence of new topics and trends in the study of POD and its management. This bibliometric analysis provides a robust framework for understanding the current state of research on dexmedetomidine's efficacy in managing POD. It highlights the need for continued investigation and underscores the potential of this pharmacological approach to improve patient outcomes following cardiac surgery.
