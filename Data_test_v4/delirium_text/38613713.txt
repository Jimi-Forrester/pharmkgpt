38613713|t|Synthesis and Characterization of Zn(II) Complex of 4-chloro-2-(((2-phenoxyphenyl)imino)methyl)phenol and its Biological Efficacies: DNA Interaction, ADMET, DFT and Molecular Docking Study.
38613713|a|Condensing 2-phenoxyaniline with 5-chlorosalicyldehyde under reflux conditions, a 4-chloro-2-(((2-phenoxyphenyl)imino)methyl)phenol Schiff base has been Synthesized. A zinc complex was synthesized by combining the ligand in a 1:1 molar ratio with zinc sulphateheptahydrate. Mass spectroscopy, NMR, infrared, and elemental analysis were used to characterize the ligand and zinc complex. By measuring the molar conductance, the non-electrolytic character of the complex was confirmed. The zinc ion is coordinated in a pentadentate manner, according to an IR and NMR investigation. Viscosity measurements, absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy were utilized to examine the complex's interaction with CT (calf thymus) DNA. Furthermore, the ligand and complex's ADMET characteristics were ascertained through the use of ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) study. Calculation of the different electronic parameters of the optimized structure through Density Functional Theory (DFT) indicated the stability of the Zn(II) complex. Molecular docking study reflected the future opportunity for the consideration of Zn(II) complex to fight against Alzheimer and Glaucoma diseases.
