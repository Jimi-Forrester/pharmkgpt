33601227|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the longitudinal relationship in insomnia symptoms over time with incident memory problems and dementia diagnoses among U.S. adults aged 65 years and older. METHODS: Secondary analyses were performed on 9518 elderly participants (>=65 years) who completed the 2006 wave of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and were followed-up to determine if insomnia symptom scores (2006-2014) were associated with time-to-onset of [1] physician-diagnosed "memory-related disease", "Alzheimer's disease" and/or "dementia, senility or any other serious memory impairment" and [2] diagnosis of dementia based on HRS-specific criteria. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed adjusting for socio-demographic, lifestyle, and health characteristics. RESULTS: In fully adjusted models, severe insomnia symptoms were associated with increased risk of physician-diagnosed memory problems. Individuals reporting any change (increase or decrease) in insomnia symptoms during the 2006-2010 period were more likely to be diagnosed with dementia based on HRS criteria. Finally, those who experienced an increase in the severity of insomnia symptoms over time exhibited 41-72% increased risks of physician-diagnosed memory problems and 45-58% increased risks of dementia diagnosis based on HRS criteria. CONCLUSIONS: When severe insomnia symptoms increased over time, physician-diagnosed memory problems and dementia diagnoses also increased among U.S. elderly people over a 10-year follow-up period. More studies are required to confirm these findings using large prospective cohort designs and validated tools.
