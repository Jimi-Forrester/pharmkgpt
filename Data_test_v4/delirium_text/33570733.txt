33570733|a|Alzheimer's disease affects daily routine due to loss of memory and decline in cognition. In vitro data showed acetylcholine esterase inhibition activity of Malva neglecta but no in vivo evidence is available. The current study aims to investigate the anti-Alzheimer's activity of Malva neglecta methanolic extract in the AlCl3-induced Alzheimer disease rats' model. Thirty Wistar rats were divided into six groups and respective doses were given orally for 21 days. Behavioural observations were recorded and biochemical analysis was performed on brain homogenate. Improvement in memory and cognition was noted in treated rats as compared to disease control. A dose-dependent decrease (0.530 +- 0.009 at 200 mg/kg, 0.212 +- 0.007 at 400 mg/kg, 0.173 +- 0.005 at 600 mg/kg) in AChE activity was noted in the treatment groups with reference to disease control value (1.572 +- 0.013). This decrease in AChE activity is linked with an increase in acetylcholine in the brain which plays a key role in retaining memory. Oxidative stress biomarkers; GSH (66.77 +- 0.01 at 600 mg/kg), SOD (26.60 +- 0.10 at 600 mg/kg), CAT (21.46 +- 0.01 at 600 mg/kg) levels were increased with a decrease in MDA (103.33 +-0.49 at 600 mg/kg) level in a dose-dependently manner in the treatment groups as compared to disease control respective values. It is concluded that Malva neglecta could ameliorate Alzheimer's symptoms possibly by decreasing AChE activity and oxidative stress.
