38158990|a|AIM: To clarify the relationship between the clinical and psychopathological features of mental disorders, clinical and laboratory manifestations of activity and the nature of the course of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 119 patients - 98 (82.4%) women, mean age 36.5+-12.4 years (M+-SD) - with a reliable diagnosis of SLE (EULAR/ACR 2019 criteria), 51 (29.5%) of them - with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome - APS (International criteria of 2006). RESULTS: Among patients with SLE a high frequency of anxiety-depressive spectrum disorders (ADSD) and cognitive impairment (CI) was revealed. There was an association of greater severity of depression with high SLE activity index, acute/subacute onset of the disease course according to the classification of V.A. Nasonova, relapsing-remitting and chronic active current disease activity patterns of SLE according to the classification of S. Barr - M. Petri. Anxiety disorders were associated with subacute onset and relapsing-remitting disease activity patterns of SLE and were not associated with SLE activity index. Bipolar disorder was detected more often in patients with chronic SLE. Acute psychosis/delirium was associated with acute onset of SLE. Organic CI was associated with APS, chronic onset and long quiescent disease activity patterns of SLE. The episindrome and schizotypal disorder in patients with SLE are more often caused by concomitant APS. CONCLUSION: Patients with high SLE activity index should be of particular concern to rheumatologists regarding the diagnosis of depressive disorders. Patients with concomitant APS need timely diagnosis and treatment of CI and episindrome in order to improve the prognosis of the disease and the overall quality of life.
