22054058|t|Synthesis of monomeric derivatives to probe memoquin's bivalent interactions.
22054058|a|Eight monomeric congeners, related to the multitarget lead candidate memoquin, were prepared and evaluated at multiple targets to determine their profile against Alzheimer's disease. 2-4 bind to AChE with similar low nanomolar affinities and function as effective inhibitors of amyloid aggregation. The most potent monovalent ligand 2 also inhibits BACE-1 in vitro and APP metabolism in primary chicken telencephalic neurons.
