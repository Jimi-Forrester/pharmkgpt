37925002|t|Network pharmacology-based analysis of Jin-Si-Wei on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
37925002|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Jin-Si-Wei (JSW), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, have cognitive enhancing effect and delay the memory decline in an animal model of AD, which has been reported. However, the therapeutic mechanism of JSW in the treatment of AD remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to verify the pharmacodynamics of JSW in the treatment of AD, and to explore its potential mechanism based on network pharmacology, molecular docking and experimental validation both in vitro and in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the underlying mechanism of JSW against AD was investigated by the integration of network pharmacology. Then, the core pathways and biological process of JSW were verified by experiment, including behavioral test and pathological and biochemical assays with 6-month-old APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 transgenic (APP/PS1) mice in vivo and verified with Abeta1-42-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells in vitro. At last, molecular docking was used to show the binding activity of each active ingredient to the core genes of JSW treatment in AD. RESULTS: A Drug-Ingredient-Target network was established, which included 363 ingredients and 116 targets related to the JSW treatment of AD. The main metabolic pathway of JSW treatment for AD is neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway, and biological processes are mainly involved in Abeta metabolic process. In vivo experiments, compared with APP/PS1 mice, the cognitive and memory ability of mice was significantly improved after JSW administration. In brain tissue of APP/PS1 mice, JSW could increase the contents of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1), enkephalinase (NEP) and Acetyl choline (ACh), and decrease the contents of Abeta1-42, amyloid precursor protein (APP) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), decrease the vitality of cholinesterase (AChE) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Besides, JSW could increase alpha-secretase expression and decrease beta/gamma-secretase expression, and improve the number and morphology of synapses in CA1 region of the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. In vitro experiments, Drug-Containing Serum (JSW-serum) has a neuroprotective effect by reducing the apoptosis on Abeta1-42-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells. Molecular docking results showed that 2-Isopropyl-8-methylphenanthrene-3,4-dione had strong binding activity with PTGS2, which maybe a potential ingredient for the treatment of AD. CONCLUSIONS: JSW improves AD in APP/PS1 mice, and this therapeutic effect may be achieved in part by altering the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway.
