36923008|t|Autoclave treatment fails to completely inactivate DLB alpha-synuclein seeding activity.
36923008|a|Synucleinopathies are characterized by the deposition of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) aggregates in brain tissue. Pathological alpha-syn aggregates propagate in a prion-like manner and display prion-like biochemical properties. Using RT-QuIC, we measured alpha-syn seeding activity from brains of Dementia with Lewy body (DLB) patients post autoclave. Here, we show that autoclaving at 121  C removes one to two log10 of alpha-syn seeding activity but the remaining 50% seeding dose (SD50) is more than 107/mg tissue. DLB brain samples autoclaved at 132  C still revealed an SD50 of approximately 106/mg tissue. Our data suggest that DLB alpha-syn seeds are incompletely inactivated by standard autoclave, thus highlighting the need for evaluating laboratory procedures that fully inactivate them.
