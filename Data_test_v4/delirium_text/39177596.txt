39177596|a|Background: Gantenerumab is an anti-amyloid-beta immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody for subcutaneous (SC) administration. The efficacy and safety of low-dose (105 mg or 225 mg) gantenerumab were investigated in Marguerite RoAD (MR; NCT02051608), a Phase III, double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled study in participants with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. Following a preplanned futility analysis of the SCarlet RoAD study (NCT01224106), MR was converted into an open-label extension (OLE). Objective: The DB study aimed to assess the efficacy of gantenerumab compared with placebo from baseline to Week 104 in participants with mild AD dementia. Following conversion to an OLE, this objective became exploratory, as the OLE assessed the long-term safety and tolerability of SC gantenerumab at doses of up to 1,200 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) in OLE participants. Methods: Eligible DB study participants were offered the opportunity to receive gantenerumab up-titrated to 1,200 mg Q4W. Safety and tolerability were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), physical and neurologic examinations, and adverse event monitoring. Results: Overall, 225 participants were rolled over from the DB part of MR and received >=1 gantenerumab dose in the OLE. The median treatment duration was 123 weeks. Fifty-nine (26.2%) and 41 (18.2%) participants had amyloid-related imaging abnormality (ARIA)-edema and ARIA-hemorrhage MRI findings, respectively. ARIA findings were manageable with MRI monitoring and dose intervention; most were asymptomatic. There were no unexpected safety findings. Conclusions: SC gantenerumab at doses of up to 1,200 mg Q4W were well tolerated in participants with mild AD dementia.
