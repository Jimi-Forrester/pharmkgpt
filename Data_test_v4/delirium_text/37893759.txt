37893759|a|Influenza is an acute respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus, in response to which vaccines and antiviral drugs are administered. In recent years, the antiviral effects of plants and foods have garnered attention. This review is the first to summarize the therapeutic properties of wild watermelon (Citrullus lanatus var. citroides) against influenza from a phytochemical viewpoint. Wild watermelon is a wild plant with significant potential as a therapeutic candidate in antiviral strategies, when focused on its multiple anti-influenza functionalities. Wild watermelon juice inhibits viral growth, entry, and replication. Hence, we highlight the possibility of utilizing wild watermelon for the prevention and treatment of influenza with stronger antiviral activity. Phytochemicals and phytoestrogen (polyphenol, flavonoids, and prenylated compounds) in wild watermelon juice contribute to this activity and inhibit various stages of viral replication, depending on the molecular structure. Wild plants and foods closely related to the original species contain many natural compounds such as phytochemicals, and exhibit various viral growth inhibitory effects. These natural products provide useful information for future antiviral strategies.
