35142053|a|INTRODUCTION: Multiple positron emission tomography (PET) tracers are available for amyloid imaging, posing a significant challenge to consensus interpretation and quantitative analysis. We accordingly developed and validated a deep learning model as a harmonization strategy. METHOD: A Residual Inception Encoder-Decoder Neural Network was developed to harmonize images between amyloid PET image pairs made with Pittsburgh Compound-B and florbetapir tracers. The model was trained using a dataset with 92 subjects with 10-fold cross validation and its generalizability was further examined using an independent external dataset of 46 subjects. RESULTS: Significantly stronger between-tracer correlations (P < .001) were observed after harmonization for both global amyloid burden indices and voxel-wise measurements in the training cohort and the external testing cohort. DISCUSSION: We proposed and validated a novel encoder-decoder based deep model to harmonize amyloid PET imaging data from different tracers. Further investigation is ongoing to improve the model and apply to additional tracers.
