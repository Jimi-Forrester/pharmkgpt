24671632|a|Curcumin from Curcuma longa may exert putative neuroprotective properties in the brain. Impaired mitochondrial function is implicated in Alzheimer's disease and the presence of the apolipoprotein (APO) E4 genotype, which is a risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, may aggravate mitochondrial malfunction. Here, we report that in the brain of 16-month-old APOE4-targeted replacement mice, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations were significantly lower than in APOE3 mice. A 3-month dietary supplementation of 0.2 % curcumin numerically increased ATP concentrations in APOE3 and significantly in APOE4 mice compared to the respective controls. Curcumin significantly induced the transcription of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) in APOE3, but not in APOE4 mice. Moreover, PPARgamma coactivator (PGC)-1alpha and guanine-adenine repeat binding protein alpha (GABPa) mRNA was only increased in APOE3 mice. Consistent with these observations, protein expression of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, especially of complex IV, also appeared to be increased in APOE3 mice. In conclusion, we provide evidence that curcumin affects mitochondrial function and gene and protein expression in the murine brain despite its low bioavailability and carriers of the Alzheimer's disease-risk genotype APOE4 may be less responsive to dietary curcumin than APOE3 carriers.
