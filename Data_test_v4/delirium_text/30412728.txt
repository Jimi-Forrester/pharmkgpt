30412728|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease, is diagnosed by impaired learning and memory in elderly individuals. Tectochrysin (TEC) is a flavonoid compound isolated from Alpinia Oxyphylla Miq., which has been traditionally used for the treatment of diarrhea, salivation, diuresis and dementia. In our study, model mice with AD induced by intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta1-42 were used to determine the role of TEC on memory retrieval. The results revealed that AD mice received intracerebroventricular injection of TEC (140 microg/kg) showed improved spatial memory performance and down-regulated expressions of beta-secretase and accumulation of Abeta1-42 in brain tissues. TEC also decreased the concentration of malondialdehyde and total cholinesterase, and increased activities of both antioxidant superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in hippocampal and cortex. In addition, Abeta1-42 induced injury of neurons in hippocampal CA1 layer was rehabilitated in TEC treated mice. These findings highlight the beneficial role of TEC in amnestic mice induced by Abeta1-42 through the down-regulation of Abeta1-42 accumulation, oxidative stress, and total cholinesterase. Our study indicated a therapeutic potential of TEC in the treatment of AD.
