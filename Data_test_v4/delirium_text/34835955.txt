34835955|t|Multivariate Analysis Reveals That Unsubstituted beta-Ring and C8-Keto Structures Are Important Factors for Anti-Inflammatory Activity of Carotenoids.
34835955|a|Carotenoids are natural lipophilic pigments with substantial health benefits. Numerous studies have demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activities of carotenoids, especially toward lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory responses. As such, there are few reports on the evaluation and comparison of the anti-inflammatory activities of carotenoids against inflammation induced by other stimuli. In this study, we used pathogen-associated molecular patterns, proinflammatory cytokines, degenerated proteins, and chemical irritants as inflammatory inducers to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activities of eight different carotenoids. Each carotenoid showed characteristic anti-inflammatory activities; thus, we conducted a multivariate analysis to clarify the differences among them. Unsubstituted beta-ring (i.e., provitamin A) and C8-keto structures of carotenoids were found to be crucial for their inhibitory effects on the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B and interferon regulatory factors, respectively. Furthermore, we found that beta-carotene and echinenone treatment increased intracellular retinoid levels in monocytes and that the retinoids showed the similar activities to beta-carotene and echinenone. Taken together, the intake of both provitamin A and C8-keto carotenoids (e.g., siphonaxanthin and fucoxanthin) might be effective in improving the inflammatory status of individuals. A multivariate analysis of anti-inflammatory activities is a useful method for characterizing anti-inflammatory compounds.
