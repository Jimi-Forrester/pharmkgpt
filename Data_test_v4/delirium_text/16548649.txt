Early diagnosis and intervention is important to enhance quality of life, as well as prevent costly nursing home admissions. Pharmacists can be used to assist in the selection and management of medications. SETTING: In the state of Florida, Memory Disorder Clinics are one approach to assist in the diagnostic process not only of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but also other causes of dementia. These clinics also provide community resources for caregivers and families. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: The clinics provide services such as memory screenings, caregiver education, workshops for health professionals, and training for students in the allied health professions. PRACTICE INNOVATION: The clinic at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital utilizes clinical pharmacists to provide medication evaluations and education as a part of their services. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The pharmacists' involvement has allowed an opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration on the management and education of AD, other dementias, and the associated behavioral, psychiatric, and medical disorders. RESULTS: In the first six years of the clinic's existence, 408 evaluations were performed, with recommendations concerning medications. Almost 2,000 individuals have received medication evaluations through screenings. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists have valuable skills to assist in the management of diagnosis and management of dementia.
