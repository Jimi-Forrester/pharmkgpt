38887335|t|When Blood Cell Counts Matter: Hypereosinophilic Syndrome as a Rare Cause of Ischemic Strokes.
38887335|a|Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a rare condition characterized by elevated eosinophil counts (>1.5 x 109 on two consecutive measurements), which are of myeloid clonal in origin or are driven by excess cytokines. One subtype of HES exhibits the Fip1-like 1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (FIP1L1-PDGFRA) fusion gene, a gain-of-function mutation resulting in a hyperactive tyrosine kinase. HES, especially the FIP1L1-PDGFRA variant, exhibits an excellent response to chemotherapy with imatinib. In this report, we present a 38-year-old patient with no contributory past medical history who experienced sudden-onset fatigue, ataxia, visual changes, and headaches. He was found to have multiple small acute infarcts in his cerebrum and cerebellum. A stroke work-up, including transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), and computed tomography angiography (CTA), did not yield insight into the origin of his infarcts. On CBC, he was consistently hypereosinophilic, and a bone marrow biopsy revealed hypercellularity and the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene, confirming the diagnosis of HES. The patient was treated first with methylprednisolone and then imatinib with excellent response. It appears that, in our patient, strokes were not of a thromboembolic nature but rather due to hypercoagulability. In this report, we advocate for considering HES and emphasize the importance of revisiting basic laboratory studies such as a CBC if the standard stroke workup fails to elucidate the mechanism behind ischemic strokes with an embolic pattern.
