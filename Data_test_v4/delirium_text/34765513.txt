34765513|a|Terminalia chebula (T.chebula) fruit is referred as "King of Medicines" in Tibet and is listed as a key plant in "Ayurvedic Materia Medica" due to its diverse pharmacological activity. The present study was aimed to investigate the comorbid antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects of ethanol extract from T.chebula fruit using experimental behavioral tests in mice. In addition, the study explored the effects of extract on monoamine oxidase -A (MAO-A) levels in mouse brain. Two doses of the T.chebula extract (100 or 200 mg/kg, p.o.) were treated continuously for fifteen days to mice. Regarding antidepressant-like effects, the treatment of T.chebula extract at both dose (100 or 200 mg/kg, p.o.) levels resulted with significant (p < 0.001) reduction in duration of immobility time and increase in swimming time as compared to control group in forced swimming test. Moreover, both doses declined the duration of immobility time in the tail suspension test and increased the number of crossing in the center area using open-field test. Additionally, the dose 200 mg/kg treatment showed a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in MAO-A activity in mouse brain. For anxiolytic activity, both doses significantly (p < 0.001) improved the time spent in open arm and the number of head dips in elevated plus maze test. The higher duration of time spent in light chamber and higher number of crossing between the light and dark chambers by extract treatment in light-dark box test also supported the anxiolytic behavior. The obtained results supported the antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects of ethanol extract of T.chebula in mice.
