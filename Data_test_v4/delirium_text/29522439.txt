29522439|a|BACKGROUND: Minimal Hepatic Encephalopathy (MHE) is characterized by an impairment of social interaction, emotional behavior, sleep disorders, physical and mental symptoms, and diminished Quality of Life (QoL). The aim of our study is evaluating the potential liver health promoting a perspective of Resveratrol (RV) activities and evaluate whether RV treatment may improve health related quality of life (HRQL) and reduce depression and anxiety in patients with MHE. METHODS: We evaluated depression using the Beck Depression Inventory test, anxiety with State-trait anxiety inventory test, quality of life through SF-36 test, and ammonia serum levels in 70 MHE patients that were randomized into two groups. RESULTS: In the comparison between RV group and placebo group we observed a decrease in Back Depression Inventory (BDI) (p < 0.001), in State-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) (p < 0.001), and improve in physical function (p < 0.001), in role physical (p < 0.05), in body pain (p < 0.05), in general health (p < 0.001), in vitality (p < 0.05), and in social function (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Resveratrol showed efficacy in the treatment of depression, anxiety, and ammonia serum levels, and improved the quality of life Of MHE patients.
