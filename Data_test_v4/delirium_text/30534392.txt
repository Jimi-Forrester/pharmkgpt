30534392|a|AIM: Is it feasible to implement a programme to screen for depression in patients admitted to the hospital for diabetes complications and use the electronic medical record to notify providers of their patient's depression score and give suggestions for medication and counselling? DESIGN: A feasibility study was conducted with patients hospitalized with diabetes and depression in the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, United States. METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes were screened for depression. The healthcare provider was notified via the electronic medical record about the patients' depression scores. The provider discussed options for management of depression with the patient and initiated treatment. RESULTS: The process of screening for depression at admission, notifying the provider by way of electronic medical record that the patient screened positive for depression with suggestions for medication and counseling was feasible and acceptable to providers and patients.
