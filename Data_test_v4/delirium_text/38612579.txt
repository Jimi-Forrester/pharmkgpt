38612579|t|Neurofilament Light Chains in Systemic Amyloidosis: A Systematic Review.
38612579|a|Peripheral and autonomic neuropathy are common disease manifestations in systemic amyloidosis. The neurofilament light chain (NfL), a neuron-specific biomarker, is released into the blood and cerebrospinal fluid after neuronal damage. There is a need for an early and sensitive blood biomarker for polyneuropathy, and this systematic review provides an overview on the value of NfL in the early detection of neuropathy, central nervous system involvement, the monitoring of neuropathy progression, and treatment effects in systemic amyloidosis. A literature search in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science was performed on 14 February 2024 for studies investigating NfL levels in patients with systemic amyloidosis and transthyretin gene-variant (TTRv) carriers. Only studies containing original data were included. Included were thirteen full-text articles and five abstracts describing 1604 participants: 298 controls and 1306 TTRv carriers or patients with or without polyneuropathy. Patients with polyneuropathy demonstrated higher NfL levels compared to healthy controls and asymptomatic carriers. Disease onset was marked by rising NfL levels. Following the initiation of transthyretin gene-silencer treatment, NfL levels decreased and remained stable over an extended period. NfL is not an outcome biomarker, but an early and sensitive disease-process biomarker for neuropathy in systemic amyloidosis. Therefore, NfL has the potential to be used for the early detection of neuropathy, monitoring treatment effects, and monitoring disease progression in patients with systemic amyloidosis.
