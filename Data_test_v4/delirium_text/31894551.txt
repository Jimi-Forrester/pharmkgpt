31894551|t|Role of Frailty on Risk Stratification in Cardiac Surgery and Procedures.
31894551|a|The number of older people candidates for interventional cardiology, such as PCI but especially for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) , would increase in the future. Generically, the surgical risk, the amount of complications in the perioperative period, mortality and severe disability remain significantly higher in the elderly than in younger. For this reason it's important to determine the indication for surgical intervention, using tools able to predict not only the classics outcome (length of stay, mortality), but also those more specifically geriatrics, correlate to frailty: delirium, cognitive deterioration, risk of institutionalization and decline in functional status. The majority of the most used surgical risks scores are often specialist-oriented and many variables are not considered. The need of a multidimensional diagnostic process, focused on detect frailty, in order to program a coordinated and integrated plan for treatment and long term follow up, led to the development of a specific geriatric tool: the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA). The CGA has the aim to improve the prognostic ability of the current risk scores to capture short long term mortality and disability, and helping to resolve a crucial issue providing solid clinical indications to help physician in the definition of on interventional approach as futile. This tool will likely optimize the selection of TAVI older candidates could have the maximal benefit from the procedure.
