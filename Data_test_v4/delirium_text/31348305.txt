31348305|t|Thalamic and cerebellar hypoperfusion in single photon emission computed tomography may differentiate multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy.
31348305|a|Neuroimaging in the context of examining atypical parkinsonian tauopathies is an evolving matter. Positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) bring tools, which may be reasonable in supplementary examination, however, cannot be interpreted as a criterion standard for correct diagnosis. The aim of this observational study was to assess the differentiating potential of perfusion SPECT in 3 types of atypical parkinsonisms: multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), corticobasal syndrome (CBS), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). The study was carried out using the comparison of standard deviations of perfusion in patients from these 3 groups. Data obtained from 10 patients with clinical diagnosis MSA-P, 14 patients with CBS and 21 patients with PSP, which were analyzed using Tukey honest significant difference post-hoc test, revealed significant differences of perfusion P < .05 between MSA-P and PSP within the cerebellum and thalamus. No significant differences between CBS and PSP were observed.
