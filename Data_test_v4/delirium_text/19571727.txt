19571727|a|The availability of effective treatments for severe Alzheimer disease (AD) has accentuated the need for brief, simple tools to evaluate treatment response in busy clinical settings for patients with advanced dementia. To develop such a tool, data on 875 patients from 4 double-blind-randomized studies of donepezil in severe AD [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 0 to 12 inclusive] were pooled and analyzed to identify Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) items, which are sensitive to change over time. Eight of the 51 SIB items were chosen based on effect sizes and relative ease of administration. The resulting SIB-8 was then applied to a validation data set (not used to generate the short form) to characterize its usefulness. The items, Month, Months of Year, Write Name, Sentence, Fluency, Confrontational Naming-Spoon, Using Spoon-Photograph, and Digit Span, were sensitive to change with treatment (P<0.0001) and easy to administer. Baseline SIB-8 scores were correlated with baseline MMSE and full-scale SIB scores, and provided a good distribution of scores in patients at the lower end of the MMSE. The SIB-8 is a brief (< or =3 min) assessment for patients with severe AD that is sensitive to change and able to detect treatment response.
