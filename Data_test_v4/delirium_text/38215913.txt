38215913|a|The field of dementia research has witnessed significant developments in our understanding of neurodegenerative disorders, with a particular focus on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). Dementia, a collection of symptoms arising from the degeneration of brain cells, presents a significant healthcare challenge, especially as its prevalence escalates with age. This abstract delves into the complexities of these disorders, the role of biomarkers in their diagnosis and monitoring, as well as emerging neurophysiological insights. In the context of AD, anti-amyloid therapy has gained prominence, aiming to reduce the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques in the brain, a hallmark of the disease. Notably, Leqembi recently received full FDA approval, marking a significant breakthrough in AD treatment. Additionally, ongoing phase 3 clinical trials are investigating novel therapies, including Masitinib and NE3107, focusing on cognitive and functional improvements in AD patients. In the realm of FTD, research has unveiled distinct neuropathological features, including the involvement of proteins like TDP-43 and progranulin, providing valuable insights into the diagnosis and management of this heterogeneous condition. Biomarkers, including neurofilaments and various tau fragments, have shown promise in enhancing diagnostic accuracy. Neurophysiological techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), have contributed to our understanding of AD and FTD. TMS has uncovered unique neurophysiological signatures, highlighting impaired plasticity, hyperexcitability, and altered connectivity in AD, while FTD displays differences in neurotransmitter systems, particularly GABAergic and glutamatergic circuits. Lastly, ongoing clinical trials in anti-amyloid therapy for AD, such as Simufilam, Solanezumab, Gantenerumab, and Remternetug, offer hope for individuals affected by this devastating disease, with the potential to alter the course of cognitive decline. These advancements collectively illuminate the evolving landscape of dementia research and the pursuit of effective treatments for these challenging conditions.
