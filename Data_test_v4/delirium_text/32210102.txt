32210102|t|DNA Methylation in Neurodegenerative and Cerebrovascular Disorders.
32210102|a|DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism by which methyl groups are added to DNA, playing a crucial role in gene expression regulation. The aim of the present study is to compare methylation status of healthy subjects with that of patients with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or Cerebrovascular diseases. We also analyze methylation status of a transgenic Alzheimer's disease mouse model (3xTg-AD). Our results show that both global methylation (n = 141) and hydroxymethylation (n = 131) levels are reduced in DNA samples from buffy coats of patients with neurodegenerative disorders and age-related cerebrovascular disease. The importance of methylation and hydroxymethylation reduction is stressed by the finding that DNMT3a mRNA levels are also downregulated in buffy coats of patients with Dementia (n = 25). Global methylation is also reduced in brain, liver and serum samples of 3xTg-AD vs. wild type mice, such as DNMT3a mRNA levels that are also decreased in the brain of 3xTg-AD (n = 10). These results suggest that the use of global methylation and hydroxymethylation levels, together with the study of DNMT3a expression, could be useful as a new diagnostic biomarker for these prevalent disorders.
