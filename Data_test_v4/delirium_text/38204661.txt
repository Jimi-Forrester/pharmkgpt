38204661|a|Objective: Pleural adhesions (PLAs) have been shown to be a possible risk factor for air leak after lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), but the relevance of PLA for lung function outcome remains unclear. We analyzed our LVRS cohort for the influence of PLA on short-term (ie, prolonged air leak) and long-term outcomes. Methods: Retrospective observational cohort study with 187 consecutive patients who underwent LVRS from January 2016 to December 2019. PLA were defined as relevant if they were distributed extensively at the dorsal pleura; were present in at least at 2 areas, including the dorsal pleura; or present extensively at the mediastinal pleura. In patients with bilateral emphysema, bilateral LVRS was performed preferentially. The objectives were to quantify the association of PLA and rate of prolonged air leak (chest tube >7 days), and the association of PLA with postoperative exacerbations and with forced expiratory volume in 1 second 3 months postoperatively. The associations were quantified with odds ratios for binary outcomes, and with between-group differences for continuous outcomes. To account for missing observations, 100-fold multiple imputation was used. Results: PLAs were found in 46 of 187 patients (24.6%). There was a 32.6% rate of prolonged air leak (n = 61), mean chest tube time was 7.84 days. A total of 94 (50.3%) LVRSs were unilateral and 93 were bilateral. There was evidence for an association between PLA and the rate of prolonged air leak (odds ratio, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.36 to 5.89; P = .006). There was no evidence for an association between PLA and postoperative exacerbations (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.5 to 2.45; P = .79). There was no evidence for an association between PLA and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (estimate -1.52; 95% CI -5.67 to 2.63; P = .47). Both unilateral and bilateral LVRS showed significant postoperative improvements in forced expiratory volume in 1 second by 27% (8.43 units; 95% CI, 3.66-13.12; P = .0006) and by 28% (7.87 units; 95% CI, 4.68-11.06; P < .0001) and a reduction in residual volume of 15% (-33.9 units; 95% CI, -56.37 to -11.42; P = .003) and 15% (-34.9 units; 95% CI, -52.57 to -17.22; P = .0001), respectively. Conclusions: Patients should be aware of potential prolongation of hospitalization due to PLA. However, there might be no relevant influence of PLA on lung function outcomes.
