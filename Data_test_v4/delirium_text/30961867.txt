30961867|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is estimated to be afflicting over 55 millions of individual worldwide in 2018-19 for which no suitable clinical therapeutic measures have been developed so far. Thus, there is an urgent need to explore novel therapeutic strategies using nanodelivery of drugs and agents either alone or in combination for superior neuroprotection in AD and enhanced quality of life of the affected individuals. There are reports that AD is often associated with diminished neurotrophic factors and neprilysin together with enhancement of phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) within the brain and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Thus, studies aiming to enhance neurotrophic factors and neprilysin together with neutralizing p-Tau within the central nervous system (CNS) may alleviate brain pathology in AD. In this review these strategies are discussed using nanotechnological approaches largely based on our own investigations in relation to current literature in the field.
