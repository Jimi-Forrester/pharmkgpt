32845149|t|How Monoamine Oxidase A Decomposes Serotonin: An Empirical Valence Bond Simulation of the Reactive Step.
32845149|a|The enzyme-catalyzed degradation of the biogenic amine serotonin is an essential regulatory mechanism of its level in the human organism. In particular, monoamine oxidase A (MAO A) is an important flavoenzyme involved in the metabolism of monoamine neurotransmitters. Despite extensive research efforts, neither the catalytic nor the inhibition mechanisms of MAO enzymes are currently fully understood. In this article, we present the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulation of the rate-limiting step for the serotonin decomposition, which consists of hydride transfer from the serotonin methylene group to the N5 atom of the flavin moiety. Free-energy profiles of the reaction were computed by the empirical valence bond method. Apart from the enzymatic environment, the reference reaction in the gas phase was also simulated, facilitating the estimation of the catalytic effect of the enzyme. The calculated barrier for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction of 14.82 +- 0.81 kcal mol-1 is in good agreement with the experimental value of 16.0 kcal mol-1, which provides strong evidence for the validity of the proposed hydride-transfer mechanism. Together with additional experimental and computational work, the results presented herein contribute to a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanism of MAO A and flavoenzymes in general, and in the long run, they should pave the way toward applications in neuropsychiatry.
