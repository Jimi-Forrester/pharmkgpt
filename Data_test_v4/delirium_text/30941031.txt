30941031|t|Astrocyte Heterogeneity: Impact to Brain Aging and Disease.
30941031|a|Astrocytes, one of the largest glial cell population in the central nervous system (CNS), play a key function in several events of brain development and function, such as synapse formation and function, control of neurotransmitters release and uptake, production of trophic factors and control of neuronal survival. Initially described as a homogenous population, several evidences have pointed that astrocytes are highly heterogeneous, both morphologically and functionally, within the same region, and across different brain regions. Recent findings suggest that the heterogeneity in the expression profile of proteins involved in astrocyte function may predict the selective vulnerability of brain regions to specific diseases, as well as to the age-related cognitive decline. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes, either in aging as well as in brain disease are scarce. Neuroinflammation, a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases and aging, is reported to have a dubious impact on glial activation, as these cells release pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, anti-oxidants, free radicals, and neurotrophic factors. Despite the emerging evidences supporting that reactive astrocytes have a duality in their phenotype, neurotoxic or neuroprotective properties, depending on the age and stimuli, the underlying mechanisms of their activation, cellular interplays and the impact of regional astrocyte heterogeneity are still a matter of discussion. In this review article, we will summarize recent findings on astrocyte heterogeneity and phenotypes, as well as their likely impact for the brain function during aging and neural diseases. We will focus on the molecules and mechanisms triggered by astrocyte to control synapse formation in different brain regions. Finally, we will discuss new evidences on how the modulation of astrocyte phenotype and function could impact the synaptic deficits and glial dysfunction present in aging and pathological states.
