38306884|a|Neurodegenerative disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, afflict millions globally, posing a significant public health challenge. Despite extensive research, a critical hurdle in effectively treating neurodegenerative diseases is the lack of neuroprotective drugs that can halt or reverse the underlying disease processes. In this work, we took advantage of the neuroprotective properties of the neuropeptide glycyl-l-prolyl-l-glutamic acid (Glypromate) for the development of new peptidomimetics using l-pipecolic acid as a proline surrogate and exploring their chemical conjugation with relevant active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) via a peptide bond. Together with prolyl-based Glypromate conjugates, a total of 36 conjugates were toxicologically and biologically evaluated. In this series, the results obtained showed that a constrained ring (l-proline) at the central position of the peptide motif accounts for enhanced toxicological profiles and biological effects using undifferentiated and differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, it was shown that biased biological responses are API-dependent. Conjugation with (R)-1-aminoindane led to a 38-43% reduction of protein aggregation induced by Abeta25-35 (10 muM), denoting a 3.2-3.6-fold improvement in comparison with the parent neuropeptide, with no significative difference between functionalization at alpha and gamma-carboxyl ends. On the other hand, the best-performing neuroprotective conjugate against the toxicity elicited by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 125 muM) was obtained by conjugation with memantine at the alpha-carboxyl end, resulting in a 2.3-fold improvement of the neuroprotection capacity in comparison with Glypromate neuropeptide. Altogether, the chemical strategy explored in this work shows that the neuroprotective capacity of Glypromate can be modified and fine-tuned, opening a new avenue for the development of biased neurotherapeutics for CNS-related disorders.
