36765306|a|BACKGROUND: To investigate health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children with postoperative delirium (POD) after surgical repair of ventricular septal defects (VSDs). METHODS: A total of 109 patients were enrolled and assigned to the POD group (n = 47) and the non-POD group (n = 62). HRQOL was assessed by the PedsQLTM 3.0 Cardiac Module at discharge, and at the three- and six-month postoperative follow. RESULTS: Significant differences were detected in age, operation time, CPB time, mechanical ventilation duration, and length of ICU stay between the two groups, whereas sex and the VSD size did not significantly differ between groups. In terms of "cardiac heart problems and treatment" and "treatment-II", the HRQOL scores of the non-POD group were significantly better than those of the POD group. In terms of "perceived physical appearance" and "treatment anxiety", the POD group had significantly higher scores than the non-POD group at discharge and at the three-month postoperative follow-up. In terms of "cognitive problems" and "communication", the occurrence of POD still affected HRQOL at three months postoperatively, but the effect was significantly reduced at six months postoperatively. In terms of "total scores", both groups scored increasingly higher over time. The non-POD group had higher scores at discharge and three months postoperatively than the POD group, but no significant difference persisted at six months postoperatively. CONCLUSION: During the follow-up period, the HRQOL of the children with POD after surgical repair of VSD was inferior to that of the children without POD at discharge and three months postoperatively. However, the HRQOL did not differ between the two groups at six months postoperatively.
