34012826|a|BACKGROUND: Use of intranasal (IN) dexmedetomidine for procedural sedation has been reported in recent years. Good patient selection is important to ensure high success rates. We aimed to identify factors that influence the successful use of IN dexmedetomidine in non-invasive investigations. METHODS: All paediatric patients who received IN dexmedetomidine for investigations between 01 July 2019 to 01 July 2020 were included. Baseline demographics, time to reach adequate sedation level, duration of sedation, dose, indications for sedation and need for rescue sedatives were recorded. Procedures were classified into "long" or "short" according to completion time. Successful sedation was defined by completion of investigations by IN dexmedetomidine alone. RESULTS: Of 105 patients included, median age was 20.0 months, and median weight 11.0 kg. Magnetic resonance imaging (56, 53.3%) was the most common indication. Sixty (57.1%) were successfully sedated using IN dexmedetomidine alone. Automated auditory brainstem response, computerised tomography and mercaptoacetyltriglycine-3 renogram scans had the highest success rate (83.3%, 83.3%, and 100% respectively). On multivariate analysis, short procedures had an adjusted odds ratio of 5.30 (95% CI: 1.69-16.61; P=0.004) compared to long procedures. CONCLUSIONS: IN dexmedetomidine is effective for procedural sedation for paediatric patients. The most important predictor for sedation success was indication of sedation and duration of procedures.
