35216357|t|Regulatory Roles of the N-Terminal Intrinsically Disordered Region of Modular Src.
35216357|a|Src, the prototype of Src family kinases (SFKs), is a modular protein consisting of SH4 (SH4) and unique (UD) domains in an N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR), and SH3, SH2, and kinase (KD) folded domains conserved among SFKs. Src functions as a pleiotropic signaling hub in proliferating and post-mitotic cells, and it is related to cancer and neurological diseases. However, its regulatory mechanism is unclear because the existing canonical model is derived from crystallographic analyses of folded constructs lacking the IDR. This work reviews nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of partially structured lipid-binding segments in the flexible UD and the fuzzy intramolecular complex (FIMC) comprising IDR and SH3 domains, which interacts with lipid membranes and proteins. Furthermore, recently determined IDR-related Src characteristics are discussed, including dimerization, SH4/KD intramolecular fastener bundling of folded domains, and the sorting of adhesive structures. Finally, the modulatory roles of IDR phosphorylation in Src activities involving the FIMC are explored. The new regulatory roles of IDRs are integrated with the canonical model to elucidate the functions of full-length Src. This review presents new aspects of Src regulation, and provides a future direction for studies on the structure and function of Src, and their implications for pathological processes.
