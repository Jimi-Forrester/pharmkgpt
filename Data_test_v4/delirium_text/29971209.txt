29971209|t|Uremic pruritus and associated factors in hemodialysis patients: A multi-center study.
29971209|a|BACKGROUND: Uremic pruritus is a common and disturbing problem in hemodialysis patients. Although its pathogenesis is not completely understood, it is thought to be multifactorial. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors of uremic pruritus in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: A total of 249 patients from four dialysis centers were included in this study. Data were collected using a questionnaire, the visual analogue scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. We investigated whether socio-demographic and biochemical parameters were correlated to uremic pruritus. RESULTS: Pruritus was present in 53.4% of the hemodialysis patients. The mean visual analogue scale severity was 6.47 +- 1.56. Patients with white blood cell (WBC) counts > 6.7 x 103/muL had 1.73 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.360-2.888; P = 0.036) more pruritus than did those with WBC counts < 6.7 x 103/muL. Patients with dry skin were 0.2 times (95% CI, 0.070-0.182; P = 0.028) more likely to suffer from very severe pruritus than were those with normal skin. CONCLUSION: Uremic pruritus remains a serious problem in dialysis patients. The WBC level and presence of dry skin are thought to be among its causes. Therefore, data regarding the possible risk factors of uremic pruritus must be followed closely in patients at risk.
