36157832|a|BACKGROUND: Children are a unique patient population. Anesthesia for pediatric abdominal surgery has long been achieved mainly with intravenous amiodarone and propofol alone or combined with other anesthetics. The incidence of complications and postoperative adverse reactions is relatively high owing to the imperfect development of various protocols for children. Choosing the most appropriate anesthesia program is an important means of reducing adverse reactions. AIM: To explore the clinical value of propofol combined with lidocaine-assisted anesthesia in pediatric surgery. METHODS: A total of 120 children who underwent abdominal surgery at our hospital from January 2016 to March 2018 were selected and divided into groups A and B using the random number table method, with 60 patients in each group. Group B received ketamine for anesthesia, while group A received ketamine, propofol, and lidocaine. The pre- and postoperative heart rate (HR); mean arterial pressure (MAP); arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2); serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and cortisol (Cor) levels; restlessness score during the recovery period [Paediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scale (PAED)]; and adverse reactions were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The HR, MAP, and SpO2 Level at five minutes before initiating anesthesia were compared between groups A and B, and the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). At 10 and 20 minutes after anesthesia initiation, the HR and MAP were lower in group A compared with group B (P < 0.05). The differences in preoperative serum ACTH, IL-6, and Cor levels between groups A and B were not statistically significant (P > 0.05); however, the postoperative serum ACTH, IL-6, and Cor levels in group A were lower compared with group B (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the visual analog scale scores of group A at 2 h and 8 h postoperative were lower than those in group B, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The mean PAED score in group A was lower than that in group B (P < 0.05), and the incidence of restlessness in group A was 23.33% lower than that in group B (36.67 %) (P < 0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions was lower in group A than in group B (6.25% vs 16.25%). CONCLUSION: The anesthetic effect of propofol combined with lidocaine and ketamine in pediatric surgery was better than that of ketamine alone, and had less influence on hemodynamics and pediatric stress response indices, lower incidence of restlessness in the recovery period, and lower incidence of adverse reactions.
