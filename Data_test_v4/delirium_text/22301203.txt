22301203|a|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To examine the predictive value of social support in postoperative delirium. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Postoperative recovery room and orthopedic surgery department. PATIENTS: 106 consecutive patients undergoing a planned orthopedic surgery with general anesthesia. MEASUREMENTS: All patients completed questionnaires to assess depressive mood (the Beck Depression Inventory) and social support (Sarason's Social Support Questionnaire) during the preanesthesia visit. Postoperative delirium symptoms were assessed daily using the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale. Demographic, clinical, and biological data, including anesthesia procedure, were recorded. MAIN RESULTS: Controlling for various potential confounders through multivariate binary logistic regression, postoperative delirium was independently predicted by satisfaction with social support, but neither by depressive mood nor the number of supportive persons. Other significant predictors were the preoperative use of benzodiazepines, age, and type of surgery. CONCLUSION: Patients who report low satisfaction with social support may present with a particular vulnerability to postoperative delirium, even after controlling for physical confounding variables and depressive mood.
