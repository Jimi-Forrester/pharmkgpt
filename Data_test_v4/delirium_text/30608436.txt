30608436|t|Dural tear is associated with an increased rate of other perioperative complications in primary lumbar spine surgery for degenerative diseases.
30608436|a|Prospective case-control study.This study used a prospective multicenter database to investigate whether dural tear (DT) is associated with an increased rate of other perioperative complications.Few studies have had sufficient data accuracy and statistical power to evaluate the association between DT and other complications owing to a low incidence of occurrence.Between 2012 and 2017, 13,188 patients (7174 men and 6014 women) with degenerative lumbar diseases underwent primary lumbar spine surgery. The average age was 64.8 years for men and 68.7 years for women. DT was defined as a tear that was detected intraoperatively. Other investigated intraoperative surgery-related complications were massive hemorrhage (>2 L of blood loss), nerve injury, screw malposition, cage/graft dislocation, surgery performed at the wrong site, and vascular injury. The examined postoperative surgery-related complications were dural leak, surgical-site infection (SSI), postoperative neurological deficit, postoperative hematoma, wound dehiscence, screw/rod failure, and cage/graft failure. Information related to perioperative systemic complications was also collected for cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, renal and urological diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, postoperative delirium, and sepsis.DTs occurred in 451/13,188 patients (3.4%, the DT group). In the DT group, dural leak was observed in 88 patients. After controlling for the potentially confounding variables of age, sex, primary disease, and type of procedure, the surgery-related complications that were more likely to occur in the DT group than in the non-DT group were SSI (odds ratio [OR] 2.68) and postoperative neurological deficit (OR 3.27). As for perioperative systemic complications, the incidence of postoperative delirium (OR 3.21) was significantly high in the DT group.This study demonstrated that DT was associated with higher incidences of postoperative SSI, postoperative neurological deficit, and postoperative delirium, in addition to directly DT-related dural leak.
