32128829|a|PURPOSE: Delirium is an acute neuropsychiatric disorder and is a common and serious complication during hospitalization for older people. This study evaluated the value of an advanced practice nurse (APN)-led delirium consultation service on patient outcomes DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of 137 patients over 65 years, hospitalized between 2012 and 2015 in a tertiary care setting in Switzerland, who underwent orthopedic surgery and experienced delirium. FINDINGS: Of the 137 eligible patients, 53 received the delirium consultation service and 84 received the standard care. The group receiving "early" delirium consultation experienced significantly reduced delirium severity over the course of time and the shortest length of stay. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The APN-led delirium consultation service had a positive effect on patient outcomes.
