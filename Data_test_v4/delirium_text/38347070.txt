38347070|a|This study aims to assess the prevalence of geriatric syndromes and identify factors associated with multiple geriatric syndromes in community-dwelling older adults in China. We utilized a convenience sampling method to recruit older adults and from one rural and one urban community in Chengdu, China, from October 2022 to March 2023. A total of 706 older adults aged 60 years or older were included. Ten geriatric syndromes were investigated including two mental disorders: depressive symptoms, cognitive impairment; and eight somatic disorders: pain, falls, sleep disturbance, constipation, polypharmacy, multimorbidity, malnutrition and frailty. Multiple geriatric syndromes were defined as an individual having two or more geriatric syndromes. The data obtained were analysed using descriptive statistics. The independent risk factors for multiple geriatric syndromes were assessed using a logistic regression model. This study found that 90.5% of the participants had at least one geriatric syndrome, with 72.8% experiencing multiple geriatric syndromes. The top four geriatric syndromes in our study were polypharmacy (58.5%), malnutrition/at risk of malnutrition (43.1%), multimorbidity (42.1%), and frailty/prefrailty (34.3%). Of the older adults, 368(52.1%) had only somatic disorders, 18(2.5%) had only mental disorders and 253 (35.8%) had somatic-mental disorders. According to the logistic regression analysis, residence, age, marriage, BMI, and self-related health were significantly associated with multiple geriatric syndromes among older adults. This study highlights that multiple geriatric syndromes are prevalent among community-dwelling older adults in China, and underscores the significance of certain demographic factors in their occurrence. Future longitudinal studies are needed to establish the temporal relationship between multiple geriatric syndromes and these demographic factors, as well as to explore causal relationships and effective prevention strategies for geriatric syndrome.
