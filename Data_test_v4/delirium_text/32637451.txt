32637451|t|Circular RNAs: Promising Molecular Biomarkers of Human Aging-Related Diseases via Functioning as an miRNA Sponge.
32637451|a|Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a new class of noncoding single-stranded RNAs that differ from linear microRNAs (miRNAs), since they form covalently closed loop structures without free 3' poly(A) tails or 5' caps. circRNAs are the competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) by binding to miRNA through miRNA response elements (MREs) (i.e., "miRNA sponge"), thereby reducing the quantity of miRNA available to target mRNA, subsequently promoting mRNA stability or protein expression, which involves the initiation and progress of human diseases. Owing to these features of abundance, stability, conservative property, and tissue and stage specificity, widely distributing in the extracellular space and in various bodily fluids, circRNAs can be considered as potential biomarkers for various diseases. Here, we reviewed the promising circRNAs being disease biomarkers, focused on their regulatory function by acting as miRNA sponges, and described their roles in cancer, cardiovascular or neurodegenerative diseases, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and other human aging-related diseases, which provide a new direction for pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of human aging-related diseases.
