23686571|a|PURPOSE: To examine accreditation from nursing homes accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) and whether this is associated with improved rehabilitation care. DESIGN: Cross-sectional association of CARF accreditation and quality. METHODS: Comparison of the short-stay quality measures (influenza and pneumococcal vaccination; pain; delirium; pressures sores; five-star quality and health inspection scores) between the sample of 246 CARF-accredited homes compared with the 15,393 nursing homes in the 2010 On-Line Survey Certification of Automated Records (OSCAR). FINDINGS: CARF-accredited nursing homes demonstrate better quality with regard to the short-stay quality measures. CONCLUSIONS: Approaches beyond traditional regulation and governmental inspections are necessary to improve the quality of care in nursing homes. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: During a patient's rehabilitation stay, minimizing iatrogenic complications is paramount. Given the findings of this study, it is unfortunate that very few nursing homes are CARF accredited.
