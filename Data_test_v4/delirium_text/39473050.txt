39473050|t|Oral Health Literacy and Patient Education Practices Among Non-Dental Professionals in Chongqing, China: A Cross-Sectional Study.
39473050|a|BACKGROUND Preventing oral diseases is a critical aim in maintaining general health. Non-dental professionals (NDPs) should understand oral health-related knowledge to help patients maintain oral and general health. We investigated the oral health knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes of NDPs regarding patient education and intersectoral collaborations for oral health. MATERIAL AND METHODS For this cross-sectional study, a web-based questionnaire of 36 questions was designed to collect characteristics, oral health knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes of spreading oral health knowledge. A total of 406 NDPs, including 166 doctors and 240 nurses, at 3 randomly selected hospitals in Chongqing, China, were included. Data were collected electronically and statistically analyzed using the chi-square test. RESULTS Only 35.96% and 39.41% of respondents disagreed with "extraction can cause loosening of adjacent tooth" and "tooth loss is a natural part of aging", respectively. Of the respondents, 92.12% were aware of oral healthcare needs before pregnancy; 67.48% agreed with cleaning the gums before the eruption of children's teeth; only 57.14% and 56.16% knew the start time of dental cleaning for children and the relatively safe period of dental treatment for pregnant women, respectively; 73.40% of respondents were interested in oral health knowledge, and they mainly consulted dental professionals; 95.56% agreed with intersectoral collaborations for oral health; and 68.47% thought to conduct oral health education in the future. CONCLUSIONS NDPs knew about common oral health knowledge; however, the oral healthcare knowledge for special groups was insufficient. NDPs should improve their ability to educate the public on oral health and establish intersectoral collaborations.
