34250934|t|Agitation in Dementia: Real-World Impact and Burden on Patients and the Healthcare System.
34250934|a|BACKGROUND: At least 90%of patients with dementia experience behavioral or neuropsychiatric symptoms including agitation, psychotic symptoms, apathy, depression, and sleep disturbances. Agitation has been reported to be experienced by 60%of patients with mild cognitive impairment and 76%of patients with Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the impact of agitation in patients with dementia on healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and healthcare costs. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of physician-reported patient data from a point-in-time survey. Patients included were aged>=50 years, with early cognitive impairment or dementia. Agitated and non-agitated patients were compared. Regression analyses assessed the relationship of agitation score (calculated from number/severity of agitation symptoms) with outcomes, with covariates including age and Mini-Mental State Examination score. Sensitivity analyses compared patients with 0 and>=2 agitation symptoms following propensity score matching on the base-case covariates. RESULTS: Data were included for 1,349 patients (agitated, n = 693; non-agitated, n = 656). Based on regression analyses, agitation score was correlated with proportion of patients with professional caregivers (p < 0.01), institutionalized (p < 0.01), hospitalized in a psychiatric ward (p < 0.05), and receiving an antipsychotic/antidepressant (both p < 0.001); number of consultations with a healthcare professional (HCP), psychiatrist, or psycho-geriatrician; number and cost of hospitalizations (p < 0.01); cost of HCP consultations (p < 0.001); and total direct healthcare costs (p < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses generally supported the base-case analysis. CONCLUSION: Agitation in dementia is associated with increased HCRU and healthcare costs. Effective therapies are needed to address agitation in dementia, with the potential to alleviate patient impact, HCRU, and healthcare costs.
