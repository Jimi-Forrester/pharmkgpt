38073390|t|A Meta-Analysis on Presynaptic Changes in Alzheimer's Disease.
38073390|a|BACKGROUND: A key aspect of synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is loss of synaptic proteins. Previous publications showed that the presynaptic machinery is more strongly affected than postsynaptic proteins. However, it has also been reported that presynaptic protein loss is highly variable and shows region- and protein-specificity. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this meta-analysis was to provide an update on the available literature and to further characterize patterns of presynaptic protein loss in AD. METHODS: Systematic literature search was conducted for studies published between 2015-2022 which quantified presynaptic proteins in postmortem tissue from AD patients and healthy controls. Three-level random effects meta-analyses of twenty-two identified studies was performed to characterize overall presynaptic protein loss and changes in specific regions, proteins, protein families, and functional categories. RESULTS: Meta-analysis confirmed overall loss of presynaptic proteins in AD patients. Subgroup analysis revealed region specificity of protein loss, with largest effects in temporal and frontal cortex. Results concerning different groups of proteins were also highly variable. Strongest and most consistently affected was the family of synaptosome associated proteins, especially SNAP25. Among the most severely affected were proteins regulating dense core vesicle exocytosis and the synaptic vesicle cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm previous literature related to presynaptic protein loss in AD patients and provide further in-depth characterization of most affected proteins and presynaptic functions.
