33551791|a|The long-term prognosis of cognitive function in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the long-term prognosis of cognitive function in patients with iNPH, as well as the factors related to it. It included 48 patients with iNPH who were treated with cerebrospinal fluid shunting between January 2015 and December 2017 at Osaka Medical College Hospital, with follow-up evaluation of their cognitive function for >2 years. Cognitive function was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) preoperatively and at 3 months, 1 and 2 years post-operatively. The mean MMSE score (22.4 +- 5.4 preoperatively) improved at 3 months [23.8 +- 5.0 (p = 0.0002)] and 1 year [23.7 +- 4.8 (p = 0.004)] post-operatively. At 2 years post-operatively, they were able to maintain their preoperative level (22.6 +- 5.3). The patients were classified in to the cognitive decline group [11 (23%) patients; a decrease in the MMSE score by >= 2 points 2 years after surgery] and the maintenance/improvement group [37 (77%) patients]. Univariate and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed for the two groups to identify factors associated with cognitive prognosis. In both groups, the patients who were younger (p = 0.009) or had milder symptoms (p = 0.035) had a better long-term prognosis of cognitive function. The cutoffs for age and disease severity (idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus grading scale; INPHGS) were 78 years (area under the curve = 0.77) and 5 points (area under the curve = 0.71), respectively. In conclusion, most patients (77%) were able to improve and maintain cognitive function for at least 2 years after surgery. The fact that disease severity and age are associated with cognitive prognosis suggests that early iNPH intervention is desirable to improve cognitive prognosis.
