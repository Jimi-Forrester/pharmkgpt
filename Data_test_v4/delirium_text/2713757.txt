2713757|a|In postmortem brains of Alzheimer patients, statistically significant decreases in histamine levels were observed in the frontal (45%), temporal (20%), and occipital cortices (38%) and in the caudate nucleus (25%). Histidine levels were decreased in the frontal (15%), temporal (21%), and occipital cortices (30%) and in the caudate nucleus (25%); the decrease was statistically significant in the last two brain regions. Histamine was determined by the double isotope technique, and histidine was determined fluorometrically by a fluorescamine method. The data indicate that brain histamine regulation is altered in Alzheimer's disease.
