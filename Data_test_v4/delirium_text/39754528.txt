39754528|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Numerous precipitating factors and etiologies merge into the pathophysiology of this condition which can be marked by agitation and psychosis. Judicious use of antipsychotic medications such as intravenous haloperidol reduces these symptoms and distress in critically ill individuals. AIMS: This study aimed to develop a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for the antipsychotic medication haloperidol; estimate plasma and unbound interstitial brain concentrations for repetitive haloperidol administrations used in hyperactive delirium treatment; determine dopamine receptor occupancy and antagonism under these conditions; and correlate these results with Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) scores and the risk of developing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPSs). METHODS: The PBPK model for single and repetitive administrations of peroral and intravenous haloperidol was developed with PK-Sim software. The pharmacodynamic (PD) model for RASS scores with haloperidol unbound interstitial brain concentration passed as the regressor was developed with the MonolixSuite 2021R platform. RESULTS: Peak haloperidol plasma and unbound interstitial brain concentrations following a single 2 mg intravenous dose are 32 +- 5 nM and 2.4 +- 0.4 nM. With repetitive administrations, dopamine receptor occupancy is 70%-83% and D2LR antagonism is 1%-10%. Variations in dopamine receptor occupancy correlate with changes in RASS scores in individuals with hyperactive delirium. There is a linear association between the odds ratio of developing EPS and peak D2LR antagonism as functions of dopamine receptor occupancy. CONCLUSIONS: Haloperidol dopamine receptor occupancy time course and D2LR antagonism parallel RASS score changes and EPS risk, respectively.
