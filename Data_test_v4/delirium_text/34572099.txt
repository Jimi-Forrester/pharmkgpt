34572099|a|Since the initial identification of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) at the synapse, numerous studies demonstrated that alpha-syn is a key player in the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. Recent advances underline interactions between alpha-syn and lipids that also participate in alpha-syn misfolding and aggregation. In addition, increasing evidence demonstrates that alpha-syn plays a major role in different steps of synaptic exocytosis. Thus, we reviewed literature showing (1) the interplay among alpha-syn, lipids, and lipid membranes; (2) advances of alpha-syn synaptic functions in exocytosis. These data underscore a fundamental role of alpha-syn/lipid interplay that also contributes to synaptic defects in PD. The importance of lipids in PD is further highlighted by data showing the impact of alpha-syn on lipid metabolism, modulation of alpha-syn levels by lipids, as well as the identification of genetic determinants involved in lipid homeostasis associated with alpha-syn pathologies. While questions still remain, these recent developments open the way to new therapeutic strategies for PD and related disorders including some based on modulating synaptic functions.
