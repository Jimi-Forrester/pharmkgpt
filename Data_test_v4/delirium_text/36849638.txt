36849638|a|Burnout is a form of negative emotional and physical response to job stress. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of burnout among healthcare workers responding to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Korea and to explore correlates of burnout among healthcare workers. A nationwide questionnaire-based survey was conducted from December 1, 2020, to January 29, 2021 on 1425 healthcare workers who worked in one of the 16 healthcare facilities designated for COVID-19 care, in public health centers, or as paramedics in Korea. Burnout was assessed using 16 Korean-adapted items based on the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI). Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and analyzed using the R version 4.1.1 software program. OLBI results indicate clinically exhaustion in 84.5% (1204/1425) and clinically disengagement in 91.1% (1298/1425), and 77.3% (1102/1425) met the score criteria for both the exhaustion and disengagement subscales for burnout. Burnout rate was significantly increased in the group with chronic fatigue symptoms (Fatigue Severity Scale >= 3.22) after the outbreak of COVID-19 (OR, 3.94; 95% CI 2.80-5.56), in the female group (OR, 2.05; 95% CI 1.46-2.86), in the group with physical symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-15 >= 10) after the outbreak of COVID-19 (OR, 2.03; 95% CI 1.14-3.60), in the group with a higher Global Assessment of Recent Stress scale (OR, 1.71; 95% CI 1.46-2.01), in the group with post-traumatic stress symptoms (Primary Care Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder-5 >= 2) (OR, 1.47; 95% CI 1.08-2.01), and in the younger age group(OR, 1.45; 95% CI 1.22-1.72). The chronic fatigue symptoms were correlated with cumulative days of care (OR, 1.18; 95% CI 1.02-1.37). The physical symptoms were correlated with average contact hours with COVID-19 patients per day (OR, 1.34; 95% CI 1.17-1.54), and cumulative days of care (OR, 1.21; 95% CI 1.06-1.38). Most Korean healthcare workers suffered from burnout related to excessive workload during the COVID-19 pandemic. During a widespread health crisis like COVID-19, it is necessary to regularly check the burnout status in healthcare workers and reduce their excessive workload by supplementing the workforce and providing appropriate working hours sufficient rest hours.
