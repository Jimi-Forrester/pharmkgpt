31062330|t|Tortuous Paths of Insulin Signaling and Mitochondria in Alzheimer's Disease.
31062330|a|Due to the exponential growth of aging population worldwide, neurodegenerative diseases became a major public health concern. Among them, Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevails as the most common in the elderly, rendering it a research priority. After several decades considering the brain as an insulin-insensitive organ, recent advances proved a central role for this hormone in learning and memory processes and showed that AD shares a high number of features with systemic conditions characterized by insulin resistance. Mitochondrial dysfunction has also been widely demonstrated to play a major role in AD development supporting the idea that this neurodegenerative disease is characterized by a pronounced metabolic dysregulation. This chapter is intended to discuss evidence demonstrating the key role of insulin signaling and mitochondrial anomalies in AD.
