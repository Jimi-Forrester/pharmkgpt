35778702|a|Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a disorder characterized by pruritus and elevated liver function tests and bile acids. Poor vitamin absorption and, as a result, hypovitaminosis K can occur as a result of the pathology. Given the known effects of vitamin K, the authors considered that hypovitaminosis K could increase the risk of coagulopathic hemorrhage in pregnant women. The study revealed that 59.2% of women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy were diagnosed with hypovitaminosis K; however, 98.6% of women had normal coagulogram indices. Thus, coagulogram markers are more likely to indicate vitamin K activity than its actual level.
