31705890|t|The Interaction Between Contactin and Amyloid Precursor Protein and Its Role in Alzheimer's Disease.
31705890|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating disease and the most common cause of dementia. As the world population ages even modest advances in therapies and preventative strategies would be of benefit. The specific physiological function of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) remains unclear despite strong genetic and biochemical evidence of APP involvement in AD. The intricate molecular processes of the nervous system rely on interactions between cell surface receptors coupled to intracellular downstream signaling networks. APP is an integral membrane protein which interacts with members of the Contactin family of proteins. Here we review recent progresses in the field and discuss the physiological importance of APP-Contactin interaction, as well as their roles and contributions in the pathophysiology of AD.
