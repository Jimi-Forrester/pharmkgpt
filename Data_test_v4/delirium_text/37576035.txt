37576035|a|Pomegranate peel powder (PPP) is a rich source of many bioactive components particularly polyphenols that are interlinked to various technological and functional properties. In the present study, chicken tender pops were developed with incorporation of PPP, and its effect on quality attributes and storage stability of the product were evaluated. The treatments were formulated using 0%, 3%, 6%, and 9% PPP in replacement of chicken. The physicochemical properties, texture profile, instrumental color, sensory attributes, and storage stability were assessed for 21 days at refrigeration temperature, at a regular interval of 7 days. The results indicated that the inclusion of PPP significantly (p < .05) increased the dietary fiber from 0.25% in T0 to 1.45% in T3 at Day 0 and WHC 43.60% +- 0.02 in T0 to 49.36% +- 0.02 in T3 at Day 0, whereas the moisture content significantly reduced from 60.05% +- 0.03 in T0 to 55.08% +- 0.01 in T3 at the start of the study. In addition, the values of TBARS were significantly (p < .05) reduced for treated samples 0.72 mg MDA/Kg in T3 as compared to control 1.17 mg MDA/Kg on the 21st day of storage, whereas a significant increase (p < .05) in TPC from 0.90 mg GAE/g to 3.87 mg GAE/g in T0 to T3 was observed at the start of the study. For TPA, a significant (p < .05) increase was noticed in hardness, chewiness, and gumminess, whereas cohesiveness and springiness showed a non-significant (p > .05) change in treated samples in relation to control, and the instrumental color (L* and a*) decreased significantly. However, pH, crude fiber, fat, ash, and protein content showed non-significant (p > .05) variations over time. The sensory evaluation suggested that chicken tender pops supplemented with 6% PPP (T2) presented high overall acceptability and balanced organoleptic properties. Hence, it can be concluded that PPP can be effectively utilized as a natural fiber source, antioxidant, and antimicrobial agent in novel functional foods.
