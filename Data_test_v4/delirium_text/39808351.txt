39808351|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with cognitive impairments which are linked to a deficit in cholinergic function. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of TeMac  to prevent memory impairment in scopolamine-rats model of Alzheimer's disease and by in silico approaches to identify molecules in TeMac  inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. The cholinergic cognitive dysfunction was induced by intraperitoneal injection of scopolamine (1 mg/kg daily) in male Wistar rats for seven consecutive days. TeMac  at 400 mg/kg body weight was orally administrated 60 min after scopolamine. Donepezil was used as a reference drug. The cognitive deficits were assessed by the Morris Water Maze and novel object recognition tests. After killing the rats, brains were immediately collected and used to carry out cholinesterase enzyme activity and histopathological analyses. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) characterization of the TeMac  was carried out and the identified molecules were tested in silico for their ability to cross the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) and inhibit acetylcholinesterase using molecular docking. The administration of the TeMac  led to the prevention of memory deficits in rats by reducing significantly the cholinesterase enzymes activities and protecting against morphological alterations and loss of neurons in hippocampus. Seven major compounds were identified in TeMac . Molecular docking simulations confirm the ability of oleaterminaloic acid B and stigmasterol to cross the BBB and interact with peripheral site and the acyl pocket of acetylcholinesterase. All these observations suggest that TeMac  can therefore be used as an alternative for the management of AD-related cognitive impairments.
