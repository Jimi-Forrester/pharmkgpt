39095706|a|BACKGROUND: Silkie is a traditional Chinese chicken breed characterized by its unique combination of specialized morphological traits. While previous studies have focused on the genetic basis of these traits, the overall genomic characteristics of the Silkie breed remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employed whole genome resequencing data to examine the genetic diversity, selective signals and demographic history of the Silkie breed through comparative analyses with seven other Chinese indigenous breeds (IDGBs), a commercial breed, and the wild ancestor Red Jungle Fowl. RESULTS: In total, 20.8 million high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms and 86 large structural variations were obtained. We discovered that Silkie exhibits a relatively high level of inbreeding and is genetically distinct from other IDGBs. Furthermore, our analysis indicated that Silkie has experienced a stronger historical population bottleneck and has a smaller effective population size compared with other IDGBs. We identified 45 putatively selected genes that are enriched in the melanogenesis pathway, which probably is related to the feather color. Among these genes, LMBR1 and PDSS2 have been previously associated with the extra toe and the hookless feathers, respectively. Six of the selected genes (KITLG, GSK3B, SOBP, CTBP1, ELMO2, SNRPN) are known to be associated with neurodevelopment and mental diseases in human, and are possibly related to the distinct behavior of Silkie. We further identified structural variants in Silkie and found previously reported variants linked to hyperpigmentation (END3), muff and beard (HOXB8), and Rose-comb phenotype (MNR2). Additionally, we found a 0.61 Mb inversion overlapping with the GMDS gene, which was previously linked to neurodevelopmental defects in zebrafish and humans. This may also be related to the behavior distinctiveness of Silkie. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that Silkie is genetically distinct and relatively highly inbred compared to other IDGB chicken populations, possibly attributed to more prolong population bottlenecks and selective breeding practice. These results enhance our understanding of how domestication and selective breeding have shaped the genome of Silkie. These findings contribute to the broader field of domestication and avian genomics, and have implications for the future conservation and breeding efforts.
