38495122|a|Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) recently caused a global pandemic, resulting in more than 702 million people being infected and over 6.9 million deaths. Patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may suffer from diarrhea, sleep disorders, depression, and even cognitive impairment, which is associated with long COVID during recovery. However, there remains no consensus on effective treatment methods. Studies have found that patients with COVID-19 have alterations in microbiota and their metabolites, particularly in the gut, which may be involved in the regulation of immune responses. Consumption of probiotics may alleviate the discomfort caused by inflammation and oxidative stress. However, the pathophysiological process underlying the alleviation of COVID-19-related symptoms and complications by targeting the microbiota remains unclear. In the current study, we summarize the latest research and evidence on the COVID-19 pandemic, together with symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 and vaccine use, with a focus on the relationship between microbiota alterations and COVID-19-related symptoms and vaccine use. This work provides evidence that probiotic-based interventions may improve COVID-19 symptoms by regulating gut microbiota and systemic immunity. Probiotics may also be used as adjuvants to improve vaccine efficacy.
