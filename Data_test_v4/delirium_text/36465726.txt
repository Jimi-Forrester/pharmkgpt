36465726|t|Possible Macrophage Activation Syndrome Caused by Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography for Bacteremia Due to Chronic Cholelithiasis.
36465726|a|Hypoglycemia is caused by various clinical diseases. Among older patients, occult bacteremia may cause critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI), triggering hypoglycemia. Additionally, older patients have various chronic medical and homeostatic conditions. Interventions may be needed when chronic conditions cause clinical diseases and CIRCI. Herein, we report a case of possible macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) caused by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for bacteremia due to chronic cholelithiasis in an 85-year-old man. Interventions for chronic conditions could impinge on homeostasis in older patients, causing acute conditions such as MAS. Among older frail patients with chronic conditions, interventions for chronic conditions should be discussed, including the triggering of other acute conditions, such as MAS.
