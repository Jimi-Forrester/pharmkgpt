22994620|t|Delayed onset and prolonged interictal delirium following electroconvulsive therapy.
22994620|a|Electroconvulsive therapy is safe and effective in the treatment of depression in older individuals. Minor cognitive side effects of electroconvulsive therapy include acute postictal confusion and reversible short-term memory deficits. However, interictal delirium is uncommon in absence of risk factors. Herein, we report the case a depressed male patient without any known risk factors who developed interictal delirium 2 days after his sixth electroconvulsive therapy session. Interictal delirium improved with treatment within 1 week.
