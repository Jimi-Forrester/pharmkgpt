38250497|t|Scientific Publications and Subject Clusters in the Field of Glaucoma: A Scientometric Analysis.
38250497|a|Purpose: To analyze the glaucoma research in the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus to determine the top features, trends, and subject clusters. Methods: In this scientometric study, all glaucoma publications in Scopus and WoS were analyzed based on various characteristics such as authors, journals, and co-word analysis. Data analysis was conducted using both Excel and VOSviewer. Results: A gradual increase in the publication rate was found for articles in the field of glaucoma in both Scopus and WoS databases. In this regard, most publications were conducted in the USA and the University of California System. The co-word network was constituted of five clusters, including glaucoma, intraocular pressure, open-angle glaucoma, visual acuity, and optic disc. It showed that the top 10 highly cited articles were more addressed by epidemiologic studies. Conclusions: The findings of this study had a more precise vision of the previous research on the field of glaucoma. It also provided the possibility to discover hidden patterns and emerging events of a subject by explaining the most essential aspects of research and identifying the areas that need more research. The findings could be useful for authors and health policymakers in academia and countries.
