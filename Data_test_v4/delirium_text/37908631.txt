37908631|t|Associations of the MIND Diet with Cardiometabolic Diseases and Their Risk Factors: A Systematic Review.
37908631|a|Purpose: Recent studies have expanded the scope of research on the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet beyond its impact on cognitive performance. These investigations have specifically explored its potential to provide protection against cardiometabolic diseases and associated risk factors, including obesity and dyslipidemia. Methods: We systematically summarized and evaluated all existing observational and trial evidence for the MIND diet in relation to cardiometabolic diseases and their risk factors in adults. PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched to extract original studies on humans published until September 2023, without date restrictions. A total of 491 studies were initially retrieved, out of which 23 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the final review. Duplicated and irrelevant studies were screened out by five independent reviewers using the Rayyan platform. Quality assessment was ascertained using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for observational studies and the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB 2) for randomized trials. Results: Across the different study designs, the MIND diet was generally associated with an improvement in anthropometric measures and other cardiometabolic outcomes, such as blood pressure, glycemic control, lipid profile, inflammation and stroke. The effects of the MIND eating pattern on some cardiovascular diseases are less conclusive. Conclusion: The findings of this systematic review support the recommendation of the MIND diet as a strategy to reduce cardiometabolic risk in adults. Further well-designed and long-term studies are warranted.
