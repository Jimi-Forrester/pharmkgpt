31551789|t|Metabolomics Analysis Reveals the Protection Mechanism of Huangqi-Danshen Decoction on Adenine-Induced Chronic Kidney Disease in Rats.
31551789|a|Huangqi-Danshen decoction (HDD) is a commonly used drug pair for clinical treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in traditional Chinese medicine with good efficacy. However, the potential mechanisms of this action have not been well elucidated. The aim of this study was to explore the metabolic profiling variations in response to HDD treatment in a CKD rat model. CKD rat model was induced by adding 0.75% adenine to the diet for 4 weeks. The rats in the treatment group received HDD extract orally at the dose of 4.7 g/kg/day during the experiment. At the end of the experiment, serum and kidney samples were collected for biochemical and pathological examination. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS) was used to analyze metabolic profiling variations in the kidney. The results showed that treatment with HDD markedly attenuated kidney injury and improved renal function. A total of 28 metabolites contributing to CKD phenotype were found and identified in the kidney samples. The primary metabolic pathways disordered in the kidney of CKD rats were glycerophospholipid metabolism, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor biosynthesis, and citrate cycle. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) score plot showed that the three groups of renal samples were obviously divided into three categories, and the metabolic trajectory of the HDD treatment group moved to the control group. (E)-Piperolein A, phosphatidylcholines (PC) (18:1/22:6), phosphatidylinositols (PI) (13:0/18:1), PI (15:0/20:3), phosphatidylserines (PS) (O-20:0/12:0), and triglyceride (TG) (22:4/24:0/O-18:0) represented potential biomarkers of the renoprotective effects of HDD against CKD. In conclusion, HDD has renoprotective effect against adenine-induced CKD, which may be mediated via partially restoration of perturbed metabolism in the kidney.
