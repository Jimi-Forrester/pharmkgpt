22647261|a|The Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project are both cohort studies of aging and dementia that include organ donation at death. Together, more than 2,700 persons have agreed to annual clinical evaluation and brain donation at death. A subset of participants also participated in a substudy that included ante-mortem imaging. We highlight recent findings that have been highly cited over the past five years. The findings fall into three general categories. The first relates to the neuropathology of probable Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and those without dementia or mild cognitive impairment. The second relates to risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and neuropathology. The third are clinical and imaging studies of mild cognitive impairment. The findings illustrate the range of insights that can be gained into cognitive aging by incorporating neuropathologic indices into well designed, prospective cohort studies.
