24109301|t|1-(2,4-Di-nitro-phen-yl)-2-[(E)-2,4,5-tri-meth-oxy-benzyl-idene]hydrazine.
24109301|a|The title compound, C16H16N4O7, is close to being planar, with a dihedral angle of 3.15 (11)  between the benzene rings. The meth-oxy groups at the ortho- and para-positions of the 2,4,5-tri-meth-oxy-phenyl group are almost coplanar with the ring [deviations of the C atoms = 0.017 (2) and -0.025 (2) A, respectively], whereas the meta-meth-oxy group deviates slightly [C-atom displacement = 0.162 (2) A]. Both the ortho- and para-nitro groups are close to being coplanar with their attached ring [dihedral angles = 7.81 (12) and 8.56 (11) , respectively]. An intra-molecular N-H O hydrogen bond generates an S(6) ring motif. In the crystal, inversion dimers linked by pairs of N-H O hydrogen bonds involving the same H atom as the intra-molecular bond generate R 2 (2)(12) loops. The dimers are linked by weak C-H O inter-actions into sheets parallel to the (10-4) plane and the sheets are stacked by pi-pi inter-actions, with a centroid-centroid distance of 3.5974 (14) A.
