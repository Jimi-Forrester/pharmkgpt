37477839|t|The Associations Between Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and Cognition in People with Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
37477839|a|Most people with dementia experience neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), including anxiety, depression or disinhibition. There is growing interest in the relationship between NPS and cognitive impairment, but data is still limited. This study aimed to investigate the specific associations between NPS and cognition in people with dementia. MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched for published, peer-reviewed studies of associations between at least one NPS and one cognitive ability in people with dementia. The quality of the studies was assessed with the NIH National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's quality assessment tools. A meta-analysis was conducted using Robumeta package for R. Ninety studies were included. We found significant associations between NPS, global cognition and cognitive domains, e.g. apathy was associated with global cognitive and memory impairment; dysphoria was associated with worse attention; delusions with executive dysfunction. Increased NPS in people with dementia are associated with worse cognitive performance. There were few studies looking at associations between some neuropsychiatric clusters and cognitive abilities, and there was little research on causal relationships. Our review was limited by the inclusion of studies that reported associations in specific formats, and most included people with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, given the large number of studies, this is unlikely to have biased results. More research is needed that includes diverse people with different dementia syndromes.
