23314178|a|Familial or genetic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (fCJD or gCJD) is an inherent             human prion disease caused by mutation of the prion protein gene (PRNP). In the             present study, global expression patterns of the parietal cortex from a patient             with G114V gCJD were analyzed using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133+ 2.0 chip             with a commercial normal human parietal cortex RNA pool as a normal control. In             total, 8,774 genes showed differential expression; among them 2,769 genes were             upregulated and 6,005 genes were downregulated. The reliability of the results             was confirmed using real-time RT-PCR assays. The most differentially expressed             genes (DEGs) were involved in transcription regulation, ion transport, transcription,             cell adhesion, and signal transduction. The genes associated with gliosis were             upregulated and the genes marked for neurons were downregulated, while the transcription             of the PRNP gene remained unaltered. A total of 169 different pathways exhibited             significant changes in the brain of G114V gCJD. The most significantly regulated             pathways included Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, oxidative phosphorylation,             regulation of actin cytoskeleton, MAPK signaling and proteasome, which have previously             been linked to prion diseases. In addition, we found some pathways that have rarely             been explored in regards to prion diseases that were also significantly altered             in G114V gCJD, such as axon guidance, gap junction and purine metabolism. The             majority of the genes in the 10 most altered pathways were downregulated. The             data of the present study provide useful insights into the pathogenesis of G114V             gCJD and potential biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
