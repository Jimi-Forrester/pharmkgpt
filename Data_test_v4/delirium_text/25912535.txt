25912535|t|Pharmacotherapy of bipolar disorder with quetiapine: a recent literature review and an update.
25912535|a|Bipolar disorder is a chronic, recurrent condition with the usual onset during adolescence or early adulthood. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition, it is conceptualized as a spectrum disorder usually associated with such comorbidities as anxiety disorders and substance use disorders. It is a relatively prevalent condition often complicated by mixed episodes, rapid cycling, subsyndromal symptoms, and treatment refractoriness. In spite of carrying substantial morbidity and mortality, effective treatments are few and far between and conventional mood stabilizers are often unsuccessful in controlling the various manifestations of the disorder. In this scenario, second generation antipsychotics are emerging as treatments with valid efficacy in all phases of bipolar disorder. Quetiapine is a versatile atypical antipsychotic which was first approved for the treatment of schizophrenia, but latter on the basis of controlled studies earned United States Food and Drug Administration's approval for acute as well as maintenance treatment of this difficult to treat condition. In this review, recently published studies in the last 10 years were examined to update the knowledge about the efficacy and safety of quetiapine in the treatment of bipolar disorder. The medication's clinical pharmacology was first considered followed by a literature review summarizing its uses in bipolar disorder. The conclusion was that quetiapine was efficacious in manic, mixed and depressive episodes and as a maintenance agent with a good tolerability profile.
