32066393|a|BACKGROUND: Screening is an important component of understanding and managing frailty. This study examined older adults', caregivers' and healthcare providers' perspectives on frailty and frailty screening. METHODS: Fourteen older adults and caregivers and 14 healthcare providers completed individual or focus group interviews. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using line-by-line emergent coding techniques and inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: The interviews yielded several themes with associated subthemes: definitions and conceptualizations of frailty, perceptions of "frail", factors contributing to frailty (physical,, cognitive, social, pharmaceutical, nutritional), and frailty screening (current practices, tools in use, limitations, recommendations). CONCLUSION: Older adults, caregivers and healthcare providers have similar perspectives regarding frailty; both identified frailty as multi-dimensional and dynamic. Healthcare providers need clear "next steps" to provide meaning to frailty screening practices, which may improve use of frailty-screening tools.
