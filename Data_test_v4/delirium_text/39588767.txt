The Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) are uniquely positioned to address this gap. The ADRCs longitudinally follow   17,000 participants, ranging from cognitively unimpaired to dementia, arising from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD; e.g., AD, Lewy body disorders, vascular). Motivated by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative's (ADNI) impact, the ADRC Consortium for Clarity in ADRD Research Through Imaging (CLARiTI) was formed. Leveraging existing ADRC infrastructure, CLARiTI will integrate standardized imaging and plasma collection to characterize mixed pathologies and use community-engaged research methods to ensure that >= 25% of the sample is from underrepresented populations (e.g., ethnoculturally minoritized, low education). The resulting ADRD profiles, within a more diverse sample, will provide key resources for ADRCs and an unprecedented, more generalizable publicly available imaging-plasma dataset. HIGHLIGHTS: In vivo detection of mixed pathologies is critical for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias research. The Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) are uniquely positioned to address gaps related to mixed pathologies. The ADRC Consortium for Clarity in ADRD Research Through Imaging (CLARiTI) will enhance this national program by adding standardized imaging and plasma collection to existing ADRC infrastructure. This effort will provide key resources for ADRCs and an unprecedented publicly available imaging-plasma-neuropath dataset.
