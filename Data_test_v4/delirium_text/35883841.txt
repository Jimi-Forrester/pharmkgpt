35883841|a|(1) Background: With unknown causes and no effective treatment available, Alzheimer's disease (AD) places enormous pressure on families and society. Our previous study had shown that Ebselen at a high concentration (10.94 muM) improved the cognition of triple-transgenic AD (3xTg-AD) mice and alleviated the related pathological indicators but showed toxicity to the mice. Here, we dedicated to study the therapeutic effect and molecular mechanism of Ebselen at a much lower concentration on 3xTg-AD mice. (2) Methods: Various behavioral experiments were applied to detect the behavioral ability of mice. Western blot, thioflavin T staining and a transmission electron microscope were used to evaluate the pathology of AD mice. The mitochondrial membrane potential and respiration were assessed with the corresponding assay kit. (3) Results: Ebselen remarkably increased cognitive ability of AD mice, eliminated beta-Amyloid (Abeta) oligomers and recovered the synaptic damage in AD mice brain. In addition, the destroyed mitochondrial morphologies and function were repaired by Ebselen through ameliorating mitochondrial energy metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial fusion/fission balance in N2a-SW cells and brain tissues of AD mice. (4) Conclusions: This research indicated that Ebselen might exert its therapeutic effect via protecting mitochondria in AD.
