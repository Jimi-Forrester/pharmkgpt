32458309|a|Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cells in the central nervous system, and are important players in both brain injury and neurodegenerative disease. Curcumin (1,7-bis[4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl]-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione), the major active component of turmeric, belongs to the curcuminoid family that was originally isolated from the plant Curcuma longa. Several studies suggest that curcumin may have a beneficial impact on the brain pathology and aging. These effects are due to curcumin's antioxidant, free-radical scavenging, and anti-inflammatory activity. In light of this, our current review aims to discuss the role of astrocytes as essential players in neurodegenerative diseases and suggest that curcumin is capable of direct inhibition of astrocyte activity with a particular focus on its effects in Alexander disease, Alzheimer's disease, ischemia stroke, spinal cord injury, Multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease.
