35434031|a|Background: Glioma is the most common intracranial primary malignancy, characterized by abnormal signal transductions caused by transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators. Studies show the palmitoylation of oncoproteins and tumor suppressors participate in cancer progression, while studies of protein S-palmitoyltransferases in glioma are limited. A systematic analysis of zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferases (ZDHHC) in glioma is still lacking. Methods: A prognostic heatmap and Kaplan-Meier overall survival plot of 24 members of the ZDHHC family in pan-cancer created. The expression and prognostic significance of ZDHHC12 was analyzed by using Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) and PrognoScan. DBTRG and U251 cells with silenced ZDHHC12 expression were constructed and used for cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), Transwell assay and wound healing assay in vitro. Results: Here, we first conducted expression and prognostic analyses of 24 ZDHHCs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), and other glioma datasets. We found ZDHHC12 to be the only unfavorable prognostic marker in glioma. The function of ZDHHC12 in glioma was then investigated with loss-of-function strategies and in vitro cell assays. Results showed that ZDHHC12 knockdown remarkably reduced the growth, migration, and invasion capabilities in DBTRG and U251 cell lines, suggesting that ZDHHC12 may contribute to malignant behavior in glioma cells. Finally, the molecular basis for ZDHHC12 expression in glioma was analyzed, and DNA hypomethylation was found to be responsible for increased ZDHHC12 mRNA expression and related prognoses. Conclusions: ZDHHC12 positively promoted the proliferation and migration of glioma cells. Decreased DNA methylation may lead to increased ZDHHC12 expression in gliomas. This study may deepen the understanding of glioma progression and therapeutics.
