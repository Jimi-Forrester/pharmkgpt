36834631|a|Emerging evidence suggests that an important function of the sleeping brain is the removal of wastes and toxins from the central nervous system (CNS) due to the activation of the brain waste removal system (BWRS). The meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) are an important part of the BWRS. A decrease in MLV function is associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, intracranial hemorrhages, brain tumors and trauma. Since the BWRS is activated during sleep, a new idea is now being actively discussed in the scientific community: night stimulation of the BWRS might be an innovative and promising strategy for neurorehabilitation medicine. This review highlights new trends in photobiomodulation of the BWRS/MLVs during deep sleep as a breakthrough technology for the effective removal of wastes and unnecessary compounds from the brain in order to increase the neuroprotection of the CNS as well as to prevent or delay various brain diseases.
