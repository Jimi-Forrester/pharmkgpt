Therefore, it is intended to reduce the probable physical and emotional burden related to the patient that arise by commuting to the hospital, to increase the number of empty beds for other patients and to improve the living standard by reducing the risk of hospital infection. In this study, the demographic characteristics of housebound patients, their general disease and its relationship with age and gender was investigated. METHODS: The following study was performed on 626 active patients of Malatya State Hospital Home Health Care Unit from January to November 2014. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel Program. RESULTS: The study included 60.5% (n=379) female and 39.5% (n=247) male patients. The highest group consisted of patients with 80 years or above 37.7% (n=236). Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) (n=95; 25.0%), senility (n=56; 14.8%) and Alzheimer's disease (n=50; 13.2%) were commonly observed in women. Male patients had CVD (n=54; 21.8%), femur fracture or gonarthrosis which required surgery (n=28; 11.3%), and fracture due to trauma or traffc accidents (n=28; 11.3%), senility and Alzheimer's disease (n=218.5%). CONCLUSION: In recent years home health care units became even more important after the gradual increase in the elderly population and injuries due to accidents. This study can help to provide home health care units in a more effcient manner by educating the staff and relatives who take care of the patients.
