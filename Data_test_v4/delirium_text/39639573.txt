39639573|a|BACKGROUND: Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) has been found to enter the brain and induce inflammation, contributing to Alzheimer's disease (AD). P. gingivalis is also closely linked to gut dysbiosis. However, does P. gingivalis induce AD-like pathology through the microbiota-gut-brain axis? There is limited literature on this topic. OBJECTIVE: To determine the precise causal link among P. gingivalis, intestinal inflammation, and AD-related pathology. METHODS: 12- to 13-month-old female C57BL/6J mice were subjected to ligature placement and oral administration of P. gingivalis over a 24-week period. Then, cognitive performance was evaluated with behavioral tests, while AD neuropathological changes, neuroinflammation, and intestinal inflammation were assessed through qPCR, immunofluorescence, and western blot, and gut microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA. RESULTS: Mice exposed to P. gingivalis showed impaired behavior in open field test, novel object recognition, and Y-maze tests. The bacterium infiltrated their brains, increasing Abeta42, AbetaPP, and Abeta fragments, promoting tau phosphorylation and microglial activation, and reducing levels of ZO-1, PSD95, SYP, and NeuN proteins. Inflammatory factors like NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha were elevated in both brains and intestine, while ZO-1 and occludin levels decreased in intestine. P. gingivalis also altered gut microbial compositions. CONCLUSIONS: P. gingivalis induced gut dysbiosis and activated the NLRP3 inflammasome in the intestine and brains of mice. This led to impairment of both the intestinal and brain-blood barriers, triggering neuroinflammation and promoting the progression of AD. These findings highlight the critical role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the AD-like pathology induced by P. gingivalis.
