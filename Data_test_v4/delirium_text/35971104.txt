35971104|a|BACKGROUND: Due to concomitant factors like frailty and comorbidity, super elderly (>=90 years) patients with hip fracture differ from patients aged 65-89 years in perioperative complications and mortality. The integrated management bundle referred to bundled application of multiple clinical measures. The aim of this study was to analyze effect of integrated management bundle on 1-year overall survival and perioperative outcomes in super elderly patients with hip fracture, with multidisciplinary management group serving as the control group. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, super elderly patients with hip fracture were included from Jan 2017 to Nov 2020. Patients were retrospectively divided to multidisciplinary management group and integrated management bundle group. The primary outcome was 1- year overall survival, and the secondary outcome was perioperative outcomes. Kaplan-Meier methods was used to compare survival probability. Multivariable Cox's modeling was used to explain the effect of integrated bundle on 1-year overall survival adjusted for confounders. The perioperative outcomes including complications and in-hospital data of two groups were compared. The multivariable logistic regression was used to explain the effect of integrated bundle on the occurrence of perioperative complications adjusted for confounders. Prognostic factors related to survival was identified by multivariable Cox's regression analysis. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients comprised multidisciplinary management group, and 83 comprised integrated management bundle group. The Kaplan-Meier plots showed that the survival probability of integrated management bundle group was significantly better than multidisciplinary management group (HR:0.435, 95%CI:0.207-0.914, P = 0.039). Multivariable analysis after adjustment for confounders showed a 42.8% lower incidence of mortality integrated management bundle group than multidisciplinary management group (HR:0.428, 95%CI:0.186-0.986, P = 0.046). Incidence of hypoproteinemia, and electrolyte disturbance in integrated management bundle group was significantly lower than multidisciplinary management group (all P < 0.05). In addition, significant reduction was observed in length of stay (P < 0.05) in integrated management bundle group. Multivariable logistic regression showed integrated management bundle was independent protective factor of hypoproteinemia, and electrolyte disturbance. mECM score >= 6 and ASA score > 2 were independent risk factors of overall survival (HR: 1.940, 95%CI: 1.067-3.525,P = 0.030; HR: 2.281, 95%CI: 1.113-4.678,P = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: The integrated management bundle improved 1-year overall survival and played positive effects in improving perioperative outcomes. It might be a more suitable management modality for super elderly patients with hip fracture.
