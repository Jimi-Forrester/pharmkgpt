29799517|t|The ABP Dendrimer, a Drug-Candidate against Inflammatory Diseases That Triggers the Activation of Interleukin-10 Producing Immune Cells.
29799517|a|The ABP dendrimer, which is built on a phosphorus-based scaffold and bears twelve azabisphosphonate groups at its surface, is one of the dendrimers that has been shown to display immuno-modulatory and anti-inflammatory effects towards the human immune system. Its anti-inflammatory properties have been successfully challenged in animal models of inflammatory disorders. In this review, we trace the discovery and the evaluation of the therapeutic effects of the ABP dendrimer in three different animal models of both acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. We emphasize that its therapeutic effects rely on the enhancement of the production of Interleukin-10, the paradigm of anti-inflammatory cytokines, by different subsets of immune cells, such as monocytes/macrophages and CD4+ T lymphocytes.
