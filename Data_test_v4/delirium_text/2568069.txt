2568069|t|Neurotransmitter deficits in a non-multi-infarct category of vascular dementia.
2568069|a|Brain tissue from 9 severely demented patients cared for in psychiatric long-term wards and with records of stroke episodes, macroscopic signs of brain infarcts and with no clinical evidence of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type was investigated and compared with control material. The mean volume of the brain infarcts in this vascular dementia group was only 6.8 ml. Pronounced disturbances of the serotoninergic and cholingergic systems were found in subcortical and cortical grey matter. These widespread neurotransmitter changes can hardly be explained by the localized brain infarcts per se, but suggest the existence of another category of vascular dementia. Since the neurotransmitter disturbances were found to be similar to those of Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, it seems more likely that they indicate a common pathway for dementia disorders than that they serve as markers of different dementia categories.
