38981928|t|Investigation of the Circular Transcriptome in Alzheimer's Disease Brain.
38981928|a|Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a subclass of non-coding RNAs which have demonstrated potential as biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we conducted a comprehensive exploration of the circRNA transcriptome within AD brain tissues. Specifically, we assessed circRNA expression patterns in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex collected from nine AD-afflicted individuals and eight healthy controls. Utilising two circRNA detection tools, CIRI2 and CIRCexplorer2, we detected thousands of circRNAs and performed a differential expression analysis. CircRNAs which exhibited statistically significantly differential expression were identified as AD-specific differentially expressed circRNAs. Notably, our investigation revealed 120 circRNAs with significant upregulation and 1325 circRNAs displaying significant downregulation in AD brains when compared to healthy brain tissue. Additionally, we explored the expression profiles of the linear RNA counterparts corresponding to differentially expressed circRNAs in AD-afflicted brains and discovered that the linear RNA counterparts exhibited no significant changes in the levels of expression. We used CRAFT tool to predict that circUBE4B had potential to target miRNA named as hsa-miR-325-5p, ultimately regulated CD44 gene. This study provides a comprehensive overview of differentially expressed circRNAs in the context of AD brains, underscoring their potential as molecular biomarkers for AD. These findings significantly enhance our comprehension of AD's underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, offering promising avenues for future diagnostic and therapeutic developments.
