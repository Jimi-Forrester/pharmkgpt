38277179|t|Effects of Vibration Therapy on the Physical Function of Critically Ill Adults Trial: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
38277179|a|OBJECTIVES: Vibration therapy uses vibration to rehabilitate physical functions. Recently, it has been demonstrated to be safe for critically ill patients. However, its effects on physical functions are unclear. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: A single-center, ICU. PATIENTS: Patients were randomly assigned to either vibration therapy coupled with protocolized mobilization or protocolized mobilization alone. We included patients who could sit at the edge of the bed or in a wheelchair during their ICU stay. The exclusion criteria were based on the early mobilization inhibition criteria. INTERVENTIONS: The primary outcome was the Functional Status Score for the ICU (FSS-ICU) at ICU discharge. Secondary outcomes were the Medical Research Council score, ICU-acquired weakness, delirium, ICU Mobility Scale (IMS), and ventilator- and ICU-free days. For safety assessment, vital signs were monitored during the intervention. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 180 patients, 86 and 90 patients remained in the vibration therapy and control groups, respectively. The mean age was 69 +- 13 vs. 67 +- 16 years in the vibration therapy and control groups, and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score was 19 (14-25) vs. 18 (13-23). The total FSS-ICU at ICU discharge was 24 (18-27) and 21 (17-26) in the intervention and control groups, respectively (p = 0.09), and the supine-to-sit ability significantly improved in the intervention group (p < 0.01). The secondary outcomes were not significantly different. Vital signs remained stable during vibration therapy. In the predefined subgroup analysis, FSS-ICU improved in the population with a higher body mass index (>= 23 kg/m2), lower APACHE II scores (< 19), and higher IMS scores (>= 6). CONCLUSIONS: Vibration therapy did not improve the total FSS-ICU. However, the supine-to-sit ability in the FSS-ICU improved without any adverse event.
