29566504|t|Mechanism by which DHA inhibits the aggregation of KLVFFA peptides: A molecular dynamics study.
29566504|a|Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is one of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which has shown promising applications in lowering Abeta peptide neurotoxicity in vitro by preventing aggregation of Abeta peptides and relieving accumulation of Abeta fibrils. Unfortunately, the underlying molecular mechanisms of how DHA interferes with the aggregation of Abeta peptides remain largely enigmatic. Herein, aggregation behaviors of amyloid-beta(Abeta)16-21 peptides (KLVFFA) with or without the presence of a DHA molecule were comparatively studied using extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We found that DHA could effectively suppress the aggregation of KLVFFA peptides by redirecting peptides to unstructured oligomers. The highly hydrophobic and flexible nature of DHA made it randomly but tightly entangled with Leu-17, Phe-19, and Phe-20 residues to form unstructured but stable complexes. These lower-ordered unstructured oligomers could eventually pass through energy barriers to form ordered beta-sheet structures through large conformational fluctuations. This study depicts a microscopic picture for understanding the role and mechanism of DHA in inhibition of aggregation of Abeta peptides, which is generally believed as one of the important pathogenic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease.
