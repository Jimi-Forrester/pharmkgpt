37221295|t|Sting and p53 DNA repair pathways are compromised in Alzheimer's disease.
37221295|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. A common finding in AD is DNA damage. Double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) are particularly hazardous to neurons because their post-mitotic state forces neurons to rely on error-prone and potentially mutagenic mechanisms to repair DNA breaks. However, it remains unclear whether DNA damage results from increased DNA damage or failure of DNA repair. Oligomerization of the tumor suppressor protein p53 is an essential part of DSB repair, and p53 phosphorylated on S15 is an indicator of DNA damage. We report that the monomer:dimer ratio of phosphorylated (S15) p53 is increased by 2.86-fold in temporal lobes of AD patients compared to age-matched controls, indicating that p53 oligomerization is compromised in AD. In vitro oxidation of p53 with 100 nM H2O2 produced a similar shift in the monomer:dimer ratio. A COMET test showed a higher level of DNA degradation in AD consistent with double-strand DNA damage or inhibition of repair. Protein carbonylation was also elevated (190% of control), indicating elevated oxidative stress in AD patients. Levels of the DNA repair support protein 14-3-3sigma, gamma-H2AX, a phosphorylated histone marking double strand DNA breaks, and phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein were all increased. cGAS-STING-interferon signaling was impaired in AD and was accompanied by a depletion of STING protein from Golgi and a failure to elevate interferon despite the presence of DSBs. The results suggest that oxidation of p53 by ROS could inhibit the DDR and decrease its ability to orchestrate DSB repair by altering the oligomerization state of p53. The failure of immune-stimulated DNA repair may contribute to cell loss in AD and suggests new therapeutic targets for AD.
