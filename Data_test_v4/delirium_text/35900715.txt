35900715|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to summarize the current research on postoperative cognitive complications, such as delirium and cognitive dysfunction. This includes discussion on preoperative preventive strategies, such as physical and nutritional prehabilitation as well as up-to-date information on neuroprehabilitation. RECENT FINDINGS: Current recommendations for prevention of postoperative delirium have focused on multicomponent interventions. The optimal composition of surgical prehabilitation programs targeting exercise and nutrition has not yet been established. The Neurobics Trial shows that cognitive prehabilitation improves cognitive reserve and may be a useful addition to multimodal surgical prehabilitation. Perioperative management of oncologic patients is often associated with a myriad of challenges, such as the management of tumor-related pathologies, adverse events from neoadjuvant therapy, and chronic metabolic and immunological changes associated with malignancy. In addition, oncologic patients are at increased risk of developing frailty, which adversely affects postoperative recovery and further cancer treatment. As a result, oncologic patients are at considerable risk of developing postoperative cognitive complications, such as delirium and cognitive dysfunction. In this review, we discuss the effect of prehabilitation on postoperative cognitive outcomes.
