32911197|a|Cryptotanshinone (1), a major bioactive constituent in the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Dan-Shen Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, has been reported to possess remarkable pharmacological activities. To improve its bioactivities and physicochemical properties, in the present study, cryptotanshinone (1) was biotransformed with the fungus Cunninghamella elegans AS3.2028. Three oxygenated products (2-4) at C-3 of cryptotanshinone (1) were obtained, among them 2 was a new compound. Their structures were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic analysis including HRESIMS, NMR and ECD data. All of the biotransformation products (2-4) were found to inhibit significantly lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide production in BV2 microglia cells with the IC50 values of 0.16-1.16 muM, approximately 2-20 folds stronger than the substrate (1). These biotransformation products also displayed remarkably improved inhibitory effects on the production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, COX-2 and iNOS) in BV-2 cells via targeting TLR4 compared to substrate (1). The underlying mechanism of 2 was elucidated by comparative transcriptome analysis, which suggested that it reduced neuroinflammatory mainly through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Western blotting results revealed that 2 downregulated LPS-induced phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and p38 in MAPK signaling pathway. These findings provide a basal material for the discovery of candidates in treating Alzheimer's disease.
