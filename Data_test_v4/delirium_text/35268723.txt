35268723|t|The Potential of Dietary Bioactive Compounds against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19-Induced Endothelial Dysfunction.
35268723|a|COVID-19 is an endothelial disease. All the major comorbidities that increase the risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 including old age, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, respiratory disease, compromised immune system, coronary artery disease or heart failure are associated with dysfunctional endothelium. Genetics and environmental factors (epigenetics) are major risk factors for endothelial dysfunction. Individuals with metabolic syndrome are at increased risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and poor COVID-19 outcomes and higher risk of mortality. Old age is a non-modifiable risk factor. All other risk factors are modifiable. This review also identifies dietary risk factors for endothelial dysfunction. Potential dietary preventions that address endothelial dysfunction and its sequelae may have an important role in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection severity and are key factors for future research to address. This review presents some dietary bioactives with demonstrated efficacy against dysfunctional endothelial cells. This review also covers dietary bioactives with efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Dietary bioactive compounds that prevent endothelial dysfunction and its sequelae, especially in the gastrointestinal tract, will result in more effective prevention of SARS-CoV-2 variant infection severity and are key factors for future food research to address.
