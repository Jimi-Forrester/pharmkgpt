36082283|t|Total Joint Arthroplasty Should Not Be Delayed in Hepatitis C Patients After Successful Treatment Achieving a Sustained Viral Load.
36082283|a|Background: Preoperative treatment recommendations and optimal time to perform total joint arthroplasty (TJA) in patients with hepatitis C virus after treatment completion for achieving best outcomes have not been elucidated. We aim to determine (1) if undetectable viral load (UVL) prior to TJA leads to decreased postoperative complication rates, specifically periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), and (2) if delaying TJA after treatment completion has benefit in decreasing PJI. Methods: A retrospective review of all hepatitis C virus patients undergoing TJA at 3 academic tertiary care centers was conducted. A total of 270 TJAs performed from 2005 to 2019 were included, 125 with positive viral load at the time of surgery. The duration from completion of treatment regimen to TJA was recorded for the UVL cohort. The primary study outcome was PJI at 1-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital complications, mechanical revision TJA rates, and optimal time to TJA upon completion of treatment. Results: Patients with positive viral load at the time of TJA had longer length of stay (3.9 vs 2.9 days, P < .0001) and a higher PJI rate at 1 year postoperatively (9% vs 2%, P = .02) than UVL patients. There was no difference of in-hospital complications or revision rates for mechanical etiologies. Delaying TJA after achieving a sustained virologic response did not impact PJI rates. Conclusions: Sustained UVL prior to TJA is critical to minimize PJI irrespective of the treatment regimen utilized. Surgery can be performed with lower complication rates any time after achieving sustained virologic response. Level of Evidence: Level III, prognostic retrospective cohort study.
