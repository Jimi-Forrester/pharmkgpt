28000168|a|INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to assess caregiver preference and treatment compliance with oral and transdermal medications in a "real-world" setting in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) in South Korea. METHODS: Real-world evaluation of compliance and preference in Alzheimer's disease treatment (RECAP) was a 24-week, multicenter, prospective, non-interventional study in patients with AD treated with oral or transdermal therapy. Here, we report data from patients living in South Korea. Eligible patients were grouped into one of two treatment cohorts: oral (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, or memantine) or transdermal (rivastigmine patch). Caregiver preference, patient compliance, and physician preference were assessed at week 24 (end of the study). Safety was assessed by reported adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: A total of 398 patients were enrolled (oral 51.8%; transdermal 48.2%) and 79.4% completed the study. Caregivers of patients that were exposed to either the oral or transdermal monotherapy showed a preference for the treatment to which the patients were exposed (both p < 0.0001). However, caregivers of patients that were exposed to both forms of treatments reported a higher preference for transdermal monotherapy (65.9%; p < 0.0041). Patients in both treatment cohorts showed good compliance, with an overall mean (SD) score of 8.84 (1.514) (a median of 9). Of the 15 participating physicians, eight indicated their preference for transdermal therapy and seven preferred oral therapy at week 24. A total of 133 (33.4%) patients reported at least one AE during the study period (oral: 60 patients; transdermal: 73 patients). CONCLUSION: The study showed higher caregiver preference for transdermal monotherapy over oral monotherapy when patients with AD were exposed to both forms of treatment and good patient compliance for both oral and transdermal treatments.
