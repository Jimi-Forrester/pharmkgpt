23960722|a|After the success of human genome project, proteome is a new emerging field of biochemistry as it provides the knowledge of enzymes (proteins) interactions with different body organs and medicines administrated into human body. Therefore, the study of proteomics is very important for the development of new and effective drugs to control many lethal diseases. In proteomics study, analyses of proteome is essential and significant from the pathological point of views, i.e., in several serious diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease and aging, heart diseases and also for plant biology. The separation and identification of proteomics is a challenging job due to their complex structures and closely related physico-chemical behaviors. However, the recent advances in liquid chromatography make this job easy. Various kinds of liquid chromatography, along with different detectors and optimization strategies, have been discussed in this article. Besides, attempts have been made to include chirality concept in proteomics for understanding mechanism and medication of various disease controlled by different body proteins.
