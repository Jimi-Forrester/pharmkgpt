37468309|a|The assumption of accelerated postoperative recovery according to the ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) method is good condition of the patient prepared for surgery and gently operated on. Application of ERAS in postoperative care in the situation of patient with multimorbidity requires an individual approach and greater pre-operative preparation. During the healing process, the operation causes a systemic inflammatory reaction in the body, which is proportional to the size of the surgery trauma. There is fluid movement between the intravascular and interstitial spaces, increased protein catabolism, increased susceptibility to infectious complications and increased risk of decompensation of chronic diseases. The mandatory content of the pre-operative examination is a functional cardiopulmonary reserves assessment, nutritional risk screening, update of diagnostic summary and optimization of chronic medication before surgery. Prehabilitation and nutritional preparation before the planned operation is influenced by the time urgency of the operation, but even in the case of cancer, short-term nutritional preparation is indicated., Medical workplaces are the most suitable for parenteral and enteral pre-operative nutrition however some surgical departments perform the preparation themselves if necessary. The GDT (Goal Directed Therapy) regimen with a higher degree of hemodynamic monitoring and intervention is applied in the postoperative care of hemodynamic unstable risk patients. Next to decompensation of a chronic disease is mainly heart rhythm disorders (most often atrial fibrillation), cardiac complications including coronary event, stroke, acute delirium.
