32647717|a|Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is an effective mechanical circulatory support modality that rapidly restores systemic perfusion for circulatory failure in patients. Given the huge increase in VA-ECMO use, its optimal management depends on continuous and discrete hemodynamic monitoring. This article provides an overview of VA-ECMO pathophysiology, and the current state of the art in hemodynamic monitoring in patients with VA-ECMO.
