36980773|t|Comparison of T1/2 Tongue Carcinoma with or without Radial Forearm Flap Reconstruction Regarding Post-Therapeutic Function, Survival, and Gender.
36980773|a|BACKGROUND: Flap reconstruction is commonly used in advanced tongue carcinoma in order to compensate for the loss of tongue tissue and function. Surprisingly, a large number of reconstructed early-stage tongue cancer can be found. Survival or functional benefits in these cases remain unclear. METHODS: A retrospective data analysis of 384 surgically treated tongue carcinoma patients was conducted aiming to find epidemiologic and survival differences between patients with (n = 158) or without flap reconstruction (n = 226). A prospective functional analysis was performed on 55 early-stage tongue cancer patients, 33 without and 22 with radial-forearm flap reconstruction, focusing on post-therapeutic swallowing function as the primary endpoint, speech as the secondary endpoint, xerostomia, quality of life, and mouth opening. RESULTS: Consistent with the current literature, we demonstrated the significantly more frequent use of flap grafts in advanced tongue carcinomas. For the first time, we depicted a higher female ratio in the reconstructed group (p = 0.02). There were no significant differences in survival or functional outcomes between the groups. The none-reconstructed group showed more frequent use of adjuvant C/RT despite presenting fewer N+ stages. CONCLUSIONS: The higher female ratio in the reconstruction group is plausible due to the anatomically smaller oral cavity and relatively larger carcinoma in women. A higher presence of close margins in the none-reconstruction group may explain the more frequent use of adjuvant C/RT. Since we found no survival or functional differences between the groups, we propose a critical approach toward flap reconstruction in T1/2 tongue carcinoma. At the same time, proportional aspects and adequate resection margins should be taken into account.
