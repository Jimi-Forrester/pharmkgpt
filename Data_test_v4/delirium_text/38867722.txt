To this end, we propose a new encoding method: Interpretable Carbon-based Array of Neighborhoods (iCAN). Designed to address machine learning models' need for more structured and less flexible input, it captures the neighborhoods of carbon atoms in a counting array and improves the utility of the resulting encodings for machine learning models. The iCAN method provides interpretable molecular encodings and representations, enabling the comparison of molecular neighborhoods, identification of repeating patterns, and visualization of relevance heat maps for a given data set. When reproducing a large biomedical peptide classification study, it outperforms its predecessor encoding. When extended to proteins, it outperforms a lead structure-based encoding on 71% of the data sets. Our method offers interpretable encodings that can be applied to all organic molecules, including exotic amino acids, cyclic peptides, and larger proteins, making it highly versatile across various domains and data sets. This work establishes a promising new direction for machine learning in peptide and protein classification in biomedicine and healthcare, potentially accelerating advances in drug discovery and disease diagnosis.
