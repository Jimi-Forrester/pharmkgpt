35505123|t|Cerebral oxygen saturation as outcome predictor after transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation.
35505123|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebral oxygen saturation (ScO2) can be measured non-invasively by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and correlates with cerebral perfusion. We investigated cerebral saturation during transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and its impact on outcome. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cerebral oxygenation was measured continuously by NIRS in 173 analgo-sedated patients during transfemoral TAVI (female 47%, mean age 81 years) with self-expanding (39%) and balloon-expanding valves (61%). We investigated the periprocedural dynamics of cerebral oxygenation. Mean ScO2 at baseline without oxygen supply was 60%. During rapid ventricular pacing, ScO2 dropped significantly (before 64% vs. after 55%, p < 0.001). ScO2 at baseline correlated positively with baseline left-ventricular ejection fraction (0.230, p < 0.006) and hemoglobin (0.327, p < 0.001), and inversely with EuroSCORE-II ( - 0.285, p < 0.001) and length of in-hospital stay ( - 0.229, p < 0.01). Patients with ScO2 < 56% despite oxygen supply at baseline had impaired 1 year survival (log-rank test p < 0.01) and prolonged in-hospital stay (p = 0.03). Furthermore, baseline ScO2 was found to be a predictor for 1 year survival independent of age and sex (multivariable adjusted Cox regression, p = 0.020, hazard ratio (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90-0.99) and independent of overall perioperative risk estimated by EuroSCORE-II and hemoglobin (p = 0.03, HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Low baseline ScO2 not responding to oxygen supply might act as a surrogate for impaired cardiopulmonary function and is associated with worse 1 year survival and prolonged in-hospital stay after transfemoral TAVI. ScO2 monitoring is an easy to implement diagnostic tool to screen patients at risk with a potential preserved recovery and worse outcome after TAVI.
