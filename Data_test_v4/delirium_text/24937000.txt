24937000|t|Clinical experience with olanzapine in the course of post-operative delirium associated with psychosis in geriatric patients: A report of three cases.
24937000|a|Olanzapine treatment was initiated with three geriatric patients who manifested symptoms of psychosis associated with post-operative delirium. The patients' response was assessed by the clinical observation of their behavior. Since post-operative delirium is time-limited, and can spontaneously remit, no conclusions regarding the efficacy of olanzapine in reversing delirium can be made. However it is speculated that olanzapine may have shortened the duration of the associated psychosis. These case reports offered the opportunity to illustrate the pharmacological actions, the convenient dosing schedule and the side-effects profile of this atypical antipsychotic.
