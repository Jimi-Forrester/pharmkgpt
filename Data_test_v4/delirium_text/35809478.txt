35809478|t|Idiopathic megacolon complicated by life-threatening giant megacolon and respiratory failure due to diaphragmatic eventration: A case report.
35809478|a|INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Giant megacolon requiring emergency surgery is rare. Eventration of the diaphragm associated with giant megacolon is also uncommon. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 66-year-old male who presented with abdominal distention and progressive dyspnea. After resuscitation following cardiopulmonary arrest, the patient underwent emergent subtotal abdominal colectomy. Eventration of the diaphragm was found postoperatively and his respiratory condition was insufficient to allow liberation. Plication of both diaphragms was performed through left and right thoracotomy via the 8th intercostal space. Postoperatively the patient made a full recovery. CLINICAL DISCUSSIONS: Chronic constipation is a common health condition. A life-threatening condition secondary to chronic constipation is a rarely documented complication. Diaphragmatic eventration that was caused due to chronic megacolon in symptomatic patients requires surgical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a patient with giant megacolon and diaphragmatic eventration secondary to idiopathic megacolon. The patient underwent subtotal colectomy and diaphragmatic plication and recovered fully.
