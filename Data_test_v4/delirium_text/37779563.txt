37779563|a|An increasing proportion of surgical procedures involves elderly and frail patients in high-income countries, leading to an increased risk of postoperative complications. Complications significantly impact patient outcomes and costs, due to prolonged hospitalization and loss of autonomy. Consequently, it is crucial to evaluate preoperative functional status in older patients, to tailor the perioperative plan, and evaluate risks. The hospital environment often exacerbates cognitive impairments in elderly and frail patients, also increasing the risk of infection, falls, and malnutrition. Thus, it is essential to work on dedicated pathways to reduce hospital readmissions and favor discharges to a familiar environment. In this context, the use of wearable devices and telehealth has been promising. Telemedicine can be used for preoperative evaluations and to allow earlier discharges with continuous monitoring. Wearable devices can track patient vitals both preoperatively and postoperatively. Preoperative education of patient and caregivers can improve postoperative outcomes and is favored by technology-based approach that increases flexibility and reduce the need for in-person clinical visits and associated travel; moreover, such approaches empower patients with a greater understanding of possible risks, moving toward shared decision-making principles. Finally, caregivers play an integral role in patient improvement, for example, in the prevention of delirium. Hence, their inclusion in the care process is not only advantageous but essential to improve perioperative outcomes in this population.
