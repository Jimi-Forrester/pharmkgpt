33483322|t|Identifying a Population of Glial Progenitors That Have Been Mistaken for Neurons in Embryonic Mouse Cortical Culture.
33483322|a|Experiments in primary culture have helped advance our understanding of the curious phenomenon of cell cycle-related neuronal death. In a differentiated postmitotic cell such as a neuron, aberrant cell cycle reentry is strongly associated with apoptosis. Indeed, in many pathologic conditions, neuronal populations at risk for death are marked by cells engaged in a cell cycle like process. The evidence for this conclusion is typically based on finding MAP2+ cells that are also positive for cell cycle-related proteins (e.g., cyclin D) or have incorporated thymidine analogs such as bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) into their nuclei. We now report that we and others may have partly been led astray in pursuing this line of work. Morphometric analysis of mouse embryonic cortical cultures reveals that the size of the "cycling" MAP2+ cells is significantly smaller than those of normal neurons, and their expression of MAP2 is significantly lower. This led us to ask whether, rather than representing fully developed neurons, they more closely resembled precursor-like cells. In support of this idea, we find that these small MAP2+ cells are immunopositive for nestin, a neuronal precursor marker, Olig2, an oligodendrocyte lineage marker, and neural/glial antigen 2 (NG2), an oligodendrocyte precursor marker. Tracking their behavior in culture, we find that they predominantly give rise to GFAP+ astrocytes instead of neurons or oligodendrocytes. These findings argue for a critical reexamination of previous reports of stimuli that lead to neuronal cell cycle-related death in primary cultures.
