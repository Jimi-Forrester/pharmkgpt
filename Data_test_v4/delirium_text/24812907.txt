METHODS: Sixty SPF mice were randomly divided into the blank control group, the model group, and the XP group, Shugan Jianpi group (SJ), Shugan Yangxue group (SY), and Jianpi Yangxue group (JY), 10 in each group.The AD mouse model was prepared by peritoneal injecting D-galactose. Meanwhile, mice in the blank control group and the model group were administered with physiological saline (at the daily dose of 24 mL/kg) by gastrogavage. Mice in the XP group (2.485 g/kg), the SY group (1.136 g/kg), the SJ group (1.775 g/kg), and the JY group (2.059 g/kg) were administered with corresponding medicated decoction by gastrogavage, with the gastric volume of 24 mL/kg. On the 41st day the training of capability for learning and memory was started. On the 42nd day capability for learning and memory was tested. The brain tissue was cut. One half was used to determine the contents of homogenate acetyl cholinesterase (AchE), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), and monoamine oxidase (MAO).Another half was used to carry out morphological observations. RESULTS: The capability for learning and memory could be improved and the latency time could be lowered in all the treatment groups. Besides, the homogenate AchE and MAO could also be elevated, ChAT could be lowered; the morphology, number, and distribution of neurons could be improved. But the improvement of ethology, morphology, and activities of neurotransmitters were most obviously seen in the XP group. CONCLUSIONS: XP could improve the ethology, morphology, and activities of neurotransmitters, and showed better effects on prevention and treatment of AD. The rationality of compatibility methods and combination thinking ways of soothing Gan, nourishing blood, and invigorating Pi were clarified.
