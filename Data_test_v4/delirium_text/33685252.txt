33685252|t|Terminal Delirium in Hospice: The Experiences and Perspectives of Caregivers Providing Care to Terminally Ill Patients in Home Settings.
33685252|a|OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the experiences of caregivers who provide care to persons with terminal delirium (TD) in home settings. This scarcity of information is suggestive that further research is needed about care for hospice patients with delirium in the home and community. AIM: To elicit views, feelings, and end-of-life care experiences of primary caregivers assisting dying persons with TD in hospice at home. DESIGN: Qualitative, exploratory, cross-sectional study design was chosen. In-depth semistructured interviews explored caregiver experiences in caring for persons with TD. Qualitative thematic framework analysis was used. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen bereaved adult primary caregivers who received services from a hospice care program affiliated with a large nonprofit health system in the US Midwest. RESULTS: Caregiver experiences were broad and reflected 4 major themes: symptomology, coping, effective and noneffective interventions, and support. The most distressing factors for caregivers were behaviors and symptomology of TD. They did not know what to say, how to respond, and how best to behave with someone who had delirium. Many caregivers had the impression that medication does not lessen delirium symptoms and that nonpharmacologic interventions are effective and beneficial only when they were important and meaningful to patients before delirium onset. CONCLUSIONS: This study added new knowledge from direct and personal perspectives of caregivers providing end-of-life care to patients at home. Understanding developed about provision of care to someone with TD in home hospice. Improved comprehension of caregiver experiences can help professional hospice and palliative care staff better prepare caregivers for when patients have TD.
