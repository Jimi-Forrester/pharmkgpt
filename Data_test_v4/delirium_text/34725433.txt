34725433|a|Cold brewing coffee has gained increasing popularity as a novel brewing method. A completely different flavour profile during cold brewing extraction (smooth and mild) is a result of the low-energy process, prolonged water-grind contact times and long preparation time. The aim of our research was to compare coffee drinks obtained with an innovative device for a faster, dynamic cold coffee extraction process (Hardtank) to drinks prepared traditionally in 24 h and hot brewed drinks. This study investigated the differences in chemical composition (volatile, non-volatile and lipid compounds), sensory properties and antioxidant capacity of coffee drinks from various extraction processes carried out at variable brewing temperatures, times and percolation modes. The results showed that the new cold maceration technique using coffee bed percolation (Hardtank) improved the quality of cold coffee drinks, making them similar in taste to hot coffee drinks. Among the studied extractions, the combination of a lower temperature (19.3  C) and percolation process appeared to be the ideal setting for the most efficient extraction of compounds such as chlorogenic acids, gallic acid, caffeine, trigonelline, 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural and lipids and consequently for their intake. In addition, FTIR spectra indicated an even 4 times greater quantity of lipids in Hardtank drinks than in classic cold brew and up to 5 times more lipids than in hot brew coffee, which contribute to the formation of the aroma and flavour. The decreased extraction time and use of coffee bed percolation could be beneficial for the quality and taste of cold brew products.
