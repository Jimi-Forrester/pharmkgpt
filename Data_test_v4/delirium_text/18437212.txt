18437212|a|Various radical-scavenging activities of thiamin and thiamin diphosphate (TDP) were found in some in vitro experiments. Thiamin and TDP caused considerable suppressive effects on superoxide generation in hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase system which was measured by a sensitive chemiluminescence method using 2-methyl-6-[p-methylphenyl]-3,7-dihydroimidazo[1,2-alpha]pyrazin-3-one (MCLA), and their 50% inhibition (IC(50)) values were estimated to be 158 and 56 microM, respectively. They also showed the significant suppression against hydroperoxide generation derived from oxidized linoleic acid which was estimated by aluminum chloride method and their IC(50) values were calculated to be 260 and 46 microM. They further prevented the oxygen radical generation in opsonized zymosan-stimulated human blood neutrophils which was shown by chemiluminescence method using luminol, and their IC(50) values were calculated to be 169 and 38 microM. In contrast, they caused weak but significantly suppressive effects on the hydroxyl radical generation by Fenton reaction which was measured by electric spin resonance (ESR) method, their IC(50) values were calculated to be 8.45 and 1.46 mM respectively. These results strongly suggest a possibility that thiamin and TDP play as radical scavengers in cell-free and cellular systems.
