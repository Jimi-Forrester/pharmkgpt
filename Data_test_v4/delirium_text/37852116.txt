37852116|t|Green process for the preparation of resveratrol-containing high oleic acid peanut oil.
37852116|a|Resveratrol (Res), a polyphenol compound with strong biological activity, is widely used in medicinal and health products. In this study, an innovative resveratrol high oleic peanut oil (Res-HOPO) was prepared utilizing self-developed cold pressing equipment and high oleic peanuts. The peanut roots were pretreated with four different methods, including ultra-fine crushing, ultrasound-treating, microwave-treating, and a combination of microwave-ultrasound-treating peanut roots. Under optimized conditions (microwave power of 15 W, ultrasound time of 28 min, and ultrasound power of 400 W), the Res-HOPO prepared by pretreating with a combination of microwave-ultrasound had the most Res (91.12 mg/kg). Except for the pretreated whole peanut roots, pretreating with microwave (40.49 mg/kg), ultrasound (39.03 mg/kg), and ultra-fine crushing of peanut root powder (22.57 mg/kg) resulted in the high Res content. The Res-HOPO had a satisfactory yield (40%), oleic acid content (74.05% ~ 75.85%), no trans fatty acids, great physicochemical properties, higher nutritional value (4-fold increase in squalene and almost 10-fold increase in campesterol), an extended oxidation induction time (1.39 ~ 22 times), and no heavy metals, pesticides, or aflatoxins. The four green pretreatment methods used for the preparation of Res-HOPO in this study were effective, which provided an innovative approach for developing nutritious and healthy edible oil.
