METHODS: An electronic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science was conducted from database inception to November 20, 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effect of DEX administration on postoperative sleep quality using PSG or its derivatives were included. No language restrictions were applied. The sleep efficiency index (SEI), arousal index (AI), percentages of stage N1, N2 and N3 of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were measured in our meta-analysis. RESULTS: Five studies, involving 381 participants were included. Administration of DEX significantly improved SEI, lowered AI, decreased the duration of stage N1 sleep and increased the duration of stage N2 sleep compared to placebo groups. There were no significant differences in the duration of stage N3 sleep and REM sleep. DEX administration lowered the postoperative Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score and improved the Ramsay sedation score with no adverse effect on postoperative delirium (POD). However, high heterogeneity was observed in most of the primary and secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides support for the perioperative administration of DEX to improve postoperative sleep quality. The optimal dosage and overall effect of DEX on postoperative sleep quality require further investigation using large-scale randomized controlled trials.
