36805368|a|BACKGROUND: Stigma affects different life aspects in people living with bipolar disorder and their families. This study aimed to examining the experience of stigma and evaluating predictors, consequences and strategies to combat stigma in people with bipolar disorder and their families. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) in 2022. We extensively reviewed six online databases (PubMed, Scopus, Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science and Google Scholar). Articles published in the English language about stigma in people living with bipolar disorders and their families were included. RESULTS: A total of 42,763 articles were retrieved, of which 40 articles from 14 countries were included in this study (n = 7417 participants). Of the 40 articles, 29 adopted quantitative methods (72.5%), two used mixed-methods (5%), eight used qualitative (20%) methods, and one was a case series (2.5%). The results of the studies were categorized into four themes: 1. Stigma experienced by people living with bipolar disorders and their families, 2. Predictors of stigma in people living with bipolar disorders and their families, 3. Consequences of stigma in people living with bipolar disorders and their families, 4. Effective interventions and strategies to reduce stigma in people living with bipolar disorders and their families. CONCLUSION: The results of this study might be useful to design psychiatric cognitive interventions to reduce stigma in people living with bipolar disorders and their families and designing community-based interventions to normalize bipolar disorder at the community level.
