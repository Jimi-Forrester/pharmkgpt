38153752|t|The Association of Retinal Microvasculature With Gray Matter Changes and Structural Covariance Network: A Voxel-Based Morphometry Study.
38153752|a|Purpose: Increasing evidence suggests that retinal microvasculature may reflect global cerebral atrophy. However, little is known about the relation of retinal microvasculature with specific brain regions and brain networks. Therefore, we aimed to unravel the association of retinal microvasculature with gray matter changes and structural covariance network using a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis. Methods: One hundred and forty-four volunteers without previously known neurological diseases were recruited from West China Hospital, Sichuan University between April 1, 2021, and December 31, 2021. Retinal microvasculature of superficial vascular plexus (SVP), intermediate capillary plexus (ICP), and deep capillary plexus (DCP) were measured by optical coherence tomography angiography using an automatic segmentation. The VBM and structural covariance network analyses were applied to process brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. The associations of retinal microvasculature with voxel-wise gray matter volumes and structural covariance network were assessed by linear regression models. Results: In the study, 137 participants (mean age = 59.72 years, 37.2% men) were included for the final analysis. Reduced perfusion in SVP was significantly associated with reduced voxel-wise gray matter volumes of the brain regions including the insula, putamen, occipital, frontal, and temporal lobes, all of which were located in the anterior part of the brain supplied by internal carotid artery, except the occipital lobe. In addition, these regions were also involved in visual processing and cognitive impairment (such as left inferior occipital gyrus, left lingual gyrus, and right parahippocampal gyrus). In regard to the structural covariance, the perfusions in SVP were positively related to the structural covariance of the left lingual gyrus seed with the left middle occipital gyrus, the right middle occipital gyrus, and the left middle frontal gyrus. Conclusions: Poor perfusion in SVP was correlated with reduced voxel-wise gray matter volumes and structural covariance networks in regions related to visual processing and cognitive impairment. It suggests that retinal microvasculature may offer a window to identify aging related cerebral alterations.
