38892521|a|The rhizomes of Acorus tatarinowii Schott and Acorus gramineus Solander are widely used for treating amnesia in traditional Chinese medicine. In contrast, their leaves are usually discarded without their medicinal properties being known. Here, we found that the hot water extract of leaves improved cognition and tau pathology in model mice of frontotemporal dementia, similar to or even better than that of rhizomes. To explore the optimal method of processing, we made three preparations from dried leaves: hot water extract, extraction residue, and non-extracted simple crush powder. Among them, the simple crush powder had the strongest effect on tauopathy in mice. The crush powder also ameliorated Abeta and alpha-synuclein pathologies and restored cognition in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. These findings suggest the potential of Acorus tatarinowii/gramineus leaves as a dietary source for dementia prevention and reveal that simple crushing is a better way to maximize their efficacy.
