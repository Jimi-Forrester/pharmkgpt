25647035|t|Glucose-6-phosphate tips the balance in modulating apoptosis in cerebellar granule cells.
25647035|a|A metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis (i.e. the Warburg effect) occurs in Alzheimer's disease accompanied by an increase of both activity and level of HK-I. The findings reported here demonstrate that in the early phase of apoptosis VDAC1 activity, but not its protein level, progressively decreases, in concomitance with the physical interaction of HK-I with VDAC1. In the late phase of apoptosis, glucose-6-phosphate accumulation in the cell causes the dissociation of the two proteins, the re-opening of the channel and the recovery of VDAC1 function, resulting in a reawakening of the mitochondrial function, thus inevitably leading to cell death.
