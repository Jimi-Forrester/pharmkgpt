26483832|t|Cognitive Rehabilitation of Dementia in Adults with Down Syndrome: A Review of Non-Pharmacological Interventions.
26483832|a|BACKGROUND: There is a close genetic relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down syndrome (DS), AD being the most severe mental disorder affecting ageing individuals with DS. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation interventions in DS patients with AD by means of a critical literature review. SUMMARY: Because AD is progressive and irreversible, treatment is aimed at delaying and reducing the cognitive and functional decline in order to preserve or improve quality of life. The effects that pharmacological treatments and cognitive interventions have on elderly individuals with AD are well documented. Recent clinical trials have investigated the use of pharmacological treatment in DS patients with AD, generating preliminary results that have been unfavourable. KEY MESSAGES: There is a clear lack of studies addressing the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation interventions in DS patients with AD, and there is an urgent need for studies providing evidence to inform decisions regarding the appropriate choice of treatment strategies.
