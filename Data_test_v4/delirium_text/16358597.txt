16358597|a|The aim of the study was to assess the impact of vascular factors on the rate of progression of cognitive impairment. The study included 291 subjects without dementia. Cognitive function were assessed with the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale--cognitive subscale (ADAS--cog) which were conducted at baseline and at the end of the study. Statistical analysis included 215 persons. During the observation AD developed in 19 subjects and 11 vascular and mix dementia (according to DSM-IIIR and DSM-IV criteria). Subjects were categorized by the baseline Modified Hachinski Ischemic Score as having vascular factors 0-1 point (n = 140) or vascular factors > 1 point (n = 75). Statistical analyses were based on the patients' Modified Hachinski Ischemic Score dichotomization. The results show that vascular factors were risk factors for Alzheimer type dementia but the study does not prove the impact of vascular factors on progression of cognitive impairment.
