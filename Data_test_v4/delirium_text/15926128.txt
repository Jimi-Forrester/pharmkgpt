15926128|a|INTRODUCTION: Alcohol withdrawal syndrome may be accompanied by severe complications, such as epileptic syndromes or delirium tremens. A number of pharmacological strategies, especially benzodiazepines (BZD), have been used in their treatment and prevention, although problems can arise from the use of these drugs due to their addictive properties. The classical anticonvulsive drugs are rarely employed as an alternative because of their side effects, but the latest generation of substances could be especially useful. AIMS. The aim of this study was to examine the safety of oxcarbazepine (OXC) in the prevention of epileptic seizures and complications deriving from the withdrawal syndrome in alcohol detoxification treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study involved a comparison of two groups of patients with a syndrome of physical dependence on alcohol, 42 of whom were treated with OXC and the remaining 42 received BZD as part of a programmed detoxification therapy. RESULTS: Both OXC and BZD were equally efficient in preventing the appearance of epileptic complications and in reducing withdrawal symptoms. Overall, OXC produced fewer adverse events (p < 0.001) and offered fewer problems when it came to ending administration (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: OXC can be a valuable alternative to BZD and other pharmacological treatments in the prevention of complications in detoxification therapy, especially because of the absence of addictive properties and its having a better safety profile than classical anticonvulsant drugs.
