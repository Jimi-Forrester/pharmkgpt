9313890|a|Mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) function is selectively reduced in multiple tissues, including brain, from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The ETC defects are specific to each illness, involve complex I in PD and complex IV in AD, are transferable with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and lead to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mtDNA-deficient clonal neuronal cells hybridized with mtDNA ('cybrids') from PD or AD patients. C57BL/6 mice treated with MPTP developed elevated tissue hydroxyl radical ('OH) levels in striatum and ventral midbrain but not cerebellum. In brain microdialysis in awake rats, striatal 'OH output increased 3-5-fold after infusion of methylpyridinium ion (MPP+), a complex I inhibitor, or sodium azide, a complex IV inhibitor. Elevated 'OH after MPP+ was blocked stereospecifically by infusion of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor nitro-L-arginine or by the NMDA channel blocker MK801. Neither NOS inhibition nor NMDA blockade altered azide-induced 'OH production. ETC inhibition in vivo increases production of toxic 'OH, but the underlying mechanisms vary as a function of which ETC complex is inhibited. These results support the concept of developing oxygen free radical scavengers for both AD and PD and further suggest that inhibition of NOS and blockade of NMDA receptor function may alter progression of idiopathic PD.
