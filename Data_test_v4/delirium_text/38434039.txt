38434039|a|Magnesium and its alloys are considered excellent materials for biodegradable implants because of their good biocompatibility and biodegradability as well as their mechanical properties. However, the rapid degradation rate severely limits their clinical applications. Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO), also known as micro-arc oxidation (MAO), is an effective surface modification technique. However, there are many pores and cracks on the coating surface under conventional PEO process. The corrosive products tend to penetrate deeply into the substrate, reducing its corrosion resistance and the biocompatibility, which makes PEO-coated Mg difficult to meet the long-term needs of in vivo implants. Hence, it is necessary to modify the PEO coating. This review discusses the formation mechanism and the influential parameters of PEO coatings on Mg. This is followed by a review of the latest research of the pretreatment and typical amelioration of PEO coating on biodegradable Mg alloys in the past 5 years, including calcium phosphate (Ca-P) coating, layered double hydroxide (LDH)-PEO coating, ZrO2 incorporated-PEO coating, antibacterial ingredients-PEO coating, drug-PEO coating, polymer-PEO composite coating, Plasma electrolytic fluorination (PEF) coating and self-healing coating. Meanwhile, the improvements of morphology, corrosion resistance, wear resistance, biocompatibility, antibacterial abilities, and drug loading abilities and the preparation methods of the modified PEO coatings are deeply discussed as well. Finally, the challenges and prospects of PEO coatings are discussed in detail for the purpose of promoting the clinical application of biodegradable Mg alloys.
