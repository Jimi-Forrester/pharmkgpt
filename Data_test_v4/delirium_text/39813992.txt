39813992|t|The immunology of stroke and dementia.
39813992|a|Ischemic stroke and vascular cognitive impairment, caused by a sudden arterial occlusion or more subtle but protracted vascular insufficiency, respectively, are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide with limited therapeutic options. Innate and adaptive immunity have long been implicated in neurovascular injury, but recent advances in methodology and new experimental approaches have shed new light on their contributions. A previously unappreciated dynamic interplay of brain-resident, meningeal, and systemic immune cells with the ischemic brain and its vasculature has emerged, and new insights into the frequent overlap between vascular and Alzheimer pathology have been provided. Here, we critically review these recent findings, place them in the context of current concepts on neurovascular pathologies and Alzheimer's disease, and highlight their impact on recent stroke and Alzheimer therapies.
