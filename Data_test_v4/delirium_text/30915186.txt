30915186|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neurohospitalist neurology is a fast-growing subspecialty with a variety of practice settings featuring neurohospitalist models of care. Since inception, the subspecialty has responded to new challenges in resident training, hospital reimbursement, practice, and burnout. METHODS: To characterize neurohospitalists' current practice and perspectives, we surveyed the neurohospitalists and trainees affiliated with the Neurohospitalist Society using an electronic survey distributed through the society listserv. RESULTS: Of 501 individuals surveyed by e-mail, 119 began the survey (23.8% response rate), with 88.2% self-identifying as neurohospitalists. Most neurohospitalists (63%) are 10 years or less out of training, devoting 70% of their professional time to inpatient clinical activities while also performing administrative or teaching activities. Only 38% are employed by an academic department. Call schedules are common, with 75% of neurohospitalists participating in a hospital or emergency call schedule, while 55% provide telemedicine services. The majority (97%) of neurohospitalists primarily care for adults, most commonly treating patients with cerebrovascular disease, seizures, and delirium/encephalopathy. The majority (87%) are overall pleased with their work, but 36% report having experienced burnout. CONCLUSIONS: Neurohospitalists are a diverse group of neurologists primarily practicing in the inpatient setting while performing a variety of additional activities. They provide a wide array of clinical expertise for acute neurological diseases and neurological emergencies that require hospitalization, including stroke, seizure, and encephalopathy. Neurohospitalists in general are very pleased with their work, while burnout, as in neurology and other areas of medicine, remains a concern.
