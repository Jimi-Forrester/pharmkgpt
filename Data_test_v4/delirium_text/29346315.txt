29346315|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious threat for the aging society. In this study, we examined the preventive effect of the total prenylflavonoids (TPFB) prepared from the dried fruits of Psoralea corylifolia L., using an age-related AD mouse model SAMP8. We found that long-term dietary TPFB at 50 mg/kg day significantly improved cognitive performance of the SAMP8 mice in Morris water maze tests, similar to 150 mg/kg day of resveratrol, a popular neuro-protective compound. Furthermore, TPFB treatment showed significant improvements in various AD markers in SAMP8 brains, which were restored to near control levels of the normal mice, SAMR1. TPFB significantly reduced the level of amyloid beta-peptide 42 (Abeta42), inhibited hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau, induced phosphorylation of Ser9 of the glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta), and decreased the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNFalpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta. Finally, TPFB also markedly reduced the level of serum derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs), a biomarker of oxidative stress in vivo. These results showed that dietary TPFB could effectively prevent age-related cognitive deficits and AD-like neurobiochemical changes, and may have a potential role in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease.
