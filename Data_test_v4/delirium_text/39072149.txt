39072149|a|BACKGROUND: Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is a malignant tumor of the digestive system. The mechanisms underlying COAD development and progression are still largely unknown. AIM: To identify the role of canopy FGF signaling regulator 3 (CNPY3) in the development and progression of COAD by using bioinformatic tools and functional experiments. METHODS: Bioinformatic data were downloaded from public databases. The associations of clinicopathological features, survival, and immune function with the expression of CNPY3 were analyzed. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were used to explore the related pathways. Then, quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry were used for validation of CNPY3 expression in clinical samples and tumor cell lines. Cell lines with CNPY3 knockdown were constructed to further analyze gene functions. The functional experiments included proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis assays. RESULTS: In both the TCGA cohort and the merged dataset, elevated CNPY3 expression was observed in tumor tissues. High CNPY3 expression correlated with adverse survival and compromised immune functions. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that the pro-oncogenic properties of CNPY3 might be linked to the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. CNPY3 expression was validated at both the RNA and protein levels. Functional assays indicated that cell proliferation, invasion, and migration were inhibited and cell apoptosis was promoted after CNPY3 knockdown. Additionally, Western blot results revealed the downregulation of key proteins in the PI3K/AKT pathway following CNPY3 knockdown. PI3K/AKT pathway activator reversed the decrease in proliferation, invasion, and migration and the increase in apoptosis. Notably, CNPY3 knockdown still affected the cells when the pathway was inhibited. CONCLUSION: This study showed that CNPY3 is upregulated in COAD and might regulate COAD development and progression by the PI3K/AKT pathway. Thus, CNPY3 might be a promising therapeutic target.
