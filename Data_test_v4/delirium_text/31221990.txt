31221990|t|Microglia-derived TNF-alpha mediates endothelial necroptosis aggravating blood brain-barrier disruption after ischemic stroke.
31221990|a|Endothelium (EC) is a key component of blood-brain barrier (BBB), and has an important position in the neurovascular unit. Its dysfunction and death after cerebral ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury not only promote evolution of neuroinflammation and brain edema, but also increase the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage of thrombolytic therapies. However, the mechanism and specific interventions of EC death after I/R injury are poorly understood. Here we showed that necroptosis was a mechanism underlying EC death, which promoted BBB breakdown after I/R injury. Treatment of rats with receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1)-inhibitor, necrostatin-1 reduced endothelial necroptosis and BBB leakage. We furthermore showed that perivascular M1-like microglia-induced endothelial necroptosis leading to BBB disruption requires tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) secreted by M1 type microglia and its receptor, TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), on endothelium as the primary mediators of these effects. More importantly, anti-TNFalpha (infliximab, a potent clinically used drug) treatment significantly ameliorate endothelial necroptosis, BBB destruction and improve stroke outcomes. Our data identify a previously unexplored role for endothelial necroptosis in BBB disruption and suggest infliximab might serve as a potential drug for stroke therapy.
