33847624|a|RATIONALE: Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is a heterogeneous disease with multiple subtypes. NCSE poses great diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to the lack of typical symptoms. Here, we report a case of NCSE manifesting as rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) and infarction in the splenium of the corpus callosum. Additionally, the relevant literature was reviewed. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 63-year-old man presented with RPD. Electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed NCSE, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an isolated infarction in the splenium of the corpus callosum. Mini-mental state examination showed moderate cognitive impairment (14/30 points). DIAGNOSIS: A diagnosis of NCSE with RPD and infarction in the splenium of the corpus callosum was made. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with intravenous diazepam (10 mg), oral levetiracetam (1.0g twice daily), oral sodium valproate (0.2g twice daily), and intramuscular phenobarbital sodium (0.2g once daily). OUTCOMES: After the treatment, the symptoms were improved. The patient could answer questions. Repeated EEG showed that the background a rhythm was slightly overdeveloped, and no clinical or electrical seizures were observed. After discharge, the patient was treated with oral levetiracetam (1.0g twice daily) and oral sodium valproate (0.2g twice daily) for 6 months. At the last follow-up, the patient had clear consciousness, sensitive response, and fluent answering ability. Repeated mini-mental state examination showed that his cognitive function was significantly improved (28/30 points); nevertheless, the lesion in the splenium of corpus callosum remained unchanged on MRI. LESSONS: NCSE manifesting as RPD and infarction in the splenium of the corpus callosum is extremely rare. Epileptic events and focal infarction are usually overlooked in patients with dementia, and the diagnostic value of MRI and EEG should be highlighted.
