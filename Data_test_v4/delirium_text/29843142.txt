29843142|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Decreasing levels of aromatase and seladin-1 could be one of the molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aromatase is an enzyme that catalyzes estrogen biosynthesis from androgen precursors, and seladin-1 is an enzyme that converts desmosterol to cholesterol, which is the precursor of all hormones. Verifying the potential relationship between these proteins and accordingly determining new therapeutic targets constitute the aims of this study. METHODS: Changes in protein levels were compared in vitro in aromatase and seladin-1 inhibitor-administered human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells in vivo in intracerebroventricular (icv) aromatase or seladin-1 inhibitor-administered rats, as well as in transgenic AD mice in which the genes encoding these proteins were knocked out. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In the cell cultures, we observed that seladin-1 protein levels increased after aromatase enzyme inhibition. The hippocampal aromatase protein levels decreased following chronic seladin-1 inhibition in icv inhibitor-administered rats; however, the aromatase levels in the dentate gyrus of seladin-1 knockout (SelKO) AD male mice increased. These findings indicate a partial relationship between these proteins and their roles in AD pathology.
