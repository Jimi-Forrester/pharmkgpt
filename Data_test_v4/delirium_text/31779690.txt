31779690|t|Systemic and central nervous system metabolic alterations in Alzheimer's disease.
31779690|a|BACKGROUND: Metabolic alterations, related to cerebral glucose metabolism, brain insulin resistance, and age-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, play an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) on both the systemic and central nervous system level. To study the extent and significance of these alterations in AD, quantitative metabolomics was applied to plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from clinically well-characterized AD patients and cognitively healthy control subjects. The observed metabolic alterations were associated with core pathological processes of AD to investigate their relation with amyloid pathology and tau-related neurodegeneration. METHODS: In a case-control study of clinical and biomarker-confirmed AD patients (n = 40) and cognitively healthy controls without cerebral AD pathology (n = 34) with paired plasma and CSF samples, we performed metabolic profiling, i.e., untargeted metabolomics and targeted quantification. Targeted quantification focused on identified deregulated pathways highlighted in the untargeted assay, i.e. the TCA cycle, and its anaplerotic pathways, as well as the neuroactive tryptophan and kynurenine pathway. RESULTS: Concentrations of several TCA cycle and beta-oxidation intermediates were higher in plasma of AD patients, whilst amino acid concentrations were significantly lower. Similar alterations in these energy metabolism intermediates were observed in CSF, together with higher concentrations of creatinine, which were strongly correlated with blood-brain barrier permeability. Alterations of several amino acids were associated with CSF Amyloidbeta1-42. The tryptophan catabolites, kynurenic acid and quinolinic acid, showed significantly higher concentrations in CSF of AD patients, which, together with other tryptophan pathway intermediates, were correlated with either CSF Amyloidbeta1-42, or tau and phosphorylated Tau-181. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed AD-associated systemic dysregulation of nutrient sensing and oxidation and CNS-specific alterations in the neuroactive tryptophan pathway and (phospho)creatine degradation. The specific association of amino acids and tryptophan catabolites with AD CSF biomarkers suggests a close relationship with core AD pathology. Our findings warrant validation in independent, larger cohort studies as well as further investigation of factors such as gender and APOE genotype, as well as of other groups, such as preclinical AD, to identify metabolic alterations as potential intervention targets.
