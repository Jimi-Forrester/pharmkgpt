27191714|t|Antipsychotic-Induced Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome After Cardiac Surgery.
27191714|a|We report a case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) in a postoperative cardiac surgery patient after the administration of typical and atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of delirium. On postoperative day 8, the patient's temperature peaked at 40.6 C. Agitation, rigidity, elevation in creatine kinase, and leukocytosis were associated findings. NMS was suspected on postoperative day 10. All antipsychotics were discontinued; dantrolene infusions and fluid therapy were initiated. After 2 days of NMS treatment, the patient's symptoms resolved. The temporal relationship between discontinuation of all antipsychotics, initiation of dantrolene, and clinical improvement supports the diagnosis of antipsychotic-induced NMS.
