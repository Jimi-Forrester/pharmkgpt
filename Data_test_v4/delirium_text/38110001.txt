38110001|a|Epidemiological studies have shown that cigarette smoking increases the risk of Alzheimer disease. However, inconsistent results have been reported regarding the effects of smoking or nicotine on brain amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition. In this study, we found that stimulation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) increased Abeta production in mouse brains and cultured neuronal cells. nAChR activation triggered the MEK/ERK pathway, which then phosphorylated and stabilized nuclear SP1. Upregulated SP1 acted on two recognition motifs in the BACE1 gene to induce its transcription, resulting in enhanced Abeta production. Mouse brain microdialysis revealed that nAChR agonists increased Abeta levels in the interstitial fluid of the cerebral cortex but caused no delay of Abeta clearance. In vitro assays indicated that nicotine inhibited Abeta aggregation. We also found that nicotine modified the immunoreactivity of anti-Abeta antibodies, possibly through competitive inhibition and Abeta conformation changes. Using anti-Abeta antibody that was carefully selected to avoid these effects, we found that chronic nicotine treatment in Abeta precursor protein knockin mice increased the Abeta content but did not visibly change the aggregated Abeta deposition in the brain. Thus, nicotine influences brain Abeta deposition in the opposite direction, thereby increasing Abeta production and inhibiting Abeta aggregation.
