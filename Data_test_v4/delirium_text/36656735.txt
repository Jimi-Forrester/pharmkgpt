36656735|a|INTRODUCTION: Obesity increases the risk of Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, several types of cancer, and other age-related disorders. Among older adults, obesity is also related to epigenetic age, typically measured with DNA methylation (DNAm). Because less is known about obesity and epigenetic aging earlier in the lifespan, this study examined the relationship between obesity and DNAm in young adulthood and whether these relationships vary by sex. METHODS: A cross-sectional community sample of 290 healthy young adults (mean age 27.39 years, 60% female; 80% African American, 18% White) had their BMI and waist circumference measured. Four epigenetic age estimators were derived from salivary DNA: Hannum DNAm, Horvath DNAm, Phenoage DNAm, and GrimAge DNAm. Sociodemographic covariates included age, sex, race, parental education, and income-to-needs ratio. RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, higher BMI and waist were associated with higher DNAm PhenoAge in both sexes, with a stronger effect on BMI in males (beta = 0.35, p < .001) compared to females (beta = 0.13, p = .002). Higher waist, but not BMI, was associated with higher Horvath DNA methylation age. Both BMI and waist circumference were associated with higher Hannum DNAm age in men but not in women. Neither BMI nor waist circumference were related to GrimAge. DISCUSSION: This study extends prior research by linking obesity with accelerated epigenetic aging in young adulthood, replicating the associations across two measures of obesity and four indices of salivary epigenetic aging. The results add to evidence that higher BMI accelerates aging early in the lifespan.
