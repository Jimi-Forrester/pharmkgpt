38592290|t|Co-Morbidity Clusters in Post-COVID-19 Syndrome.
38592290|a|Background: Post-COVID-19 syndrome, characterized by persistent symptoms emerging more than 12 weeks after acute infection, displays diverse manifestations. This study aimed to analyze co-existing organ dysfunctions in post-COVID-19 patients and explore their potential association with the acute COVID-19 episode and functional impairment. Methods: Data from 238 patients attending post-COVID-19 outpatient care between 1 March 2021 and 1 March 2022, after previous hospitalization for acute COVID-19, were retrospectively analyzed with 80 having comprehensive mapping of organ involvement. Results: The average time between acute episode and post-COVID-19 care was 149 days. Spirometry indicated significant abnormalities in lung function. Predominant symptoms included respiratory (75%), fatigue (73%), neurological (62.5%), and ear-nose-throat issues (51.25%). Multiorgan dysfunctions were observed in 87.5% of patients, contributing to an 18.33% reduction in health quality compared to pre-acute COVID-19 levels. Subgroup analysis identified four distinct post-COVID-19 syndrome subgroups, highlighting the coexistence of respiratory and neurological disorders as potential indicators and drivers of further organ involvement. Our results reveal that most patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome suffer from multiorgan disorders. Conclusions: The presence of coexisting respiratory and neurological symptoms suggests the involvement of other organ systems as well. The complexity of multiorgan involvement requires further studies to provide insights into the different symptom clusters and identify potential targets for personalized preventive and therapeutic interventions to improve patient outcome.
