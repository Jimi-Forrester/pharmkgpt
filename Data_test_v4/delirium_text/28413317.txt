28413317|a|BACKGROUND: The prevalence of allergic inflammatory diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma, and allergic rhinitis worldwide has increased and complete recovery is difficult. Korean Red Ginseng, which is the heat-processed root of Panax ginseng Meyer, is widely and frequently used as a traditional medicine in East Asia. In this study, we investigated whether Korean Red Ginseng water extract (RGE) regulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines via the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway in allergic inflammation. METHODS: Compound 48/80-induced anaphylactic shock and 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNFB)-induced AD-like skin lesion mice models were used to investigate the antiallergic effects of RGE. Human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) and human mast cells (HMC-1) were also used to clarify the effects of RGE on the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. RESULTS: Anaphylactic shock and DNFB-induced AD-like skin lesions were attenuated by RGE administration through reduction of serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) and interleukin (IL)-6 levels in mouse models. RGE also reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8, and expression of chemokines such as IL-8, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) in HaCaT cells. Additionally, RGE decreased the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 as well as expressions of chemokines including macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta, regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and IL-8 in HMC-1 cells. Furthermore, our data demonstrated that these inhibitory effects occurred through blockage of the MAPK and NF-kappaB pathway. CONCLUSION: RGE may be a useful therapeutic agent for the treatment of allergic inflammatory diseases such as AD-like dermatitis.
