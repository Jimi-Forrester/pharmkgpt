14750039|a|Galanthamine is an Amaryllidaceae-type alkaloid with acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity which is used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The distribution of galanthamine and four other alkaloids in different organs of Narcissus confusus plants, as well as the variations occurring during the ontogenic cycle of this plant species, was studied. The five alkaloids were found to be present in all the organs at every stage, with the exception of haemanthamine in senescent flowers. The highest amount of alkaloids occurred in the bulb at the emerging stage, galanthamine being the most abundant, reaching a concentration of up to 2.5 % referred to dry weight.
