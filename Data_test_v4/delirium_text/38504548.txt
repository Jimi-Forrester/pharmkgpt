38504548|a|Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common manifestation of sepsis, ranging from mild confusion and delirium to severe cognitive impairment and deep coma. SAE is associated with higher mortality and long-term outcomes, particularly substantial declines in cognitive function. The mechanisms of SAE probably include neuroinflammation that is mediated by systemic inflammation and ischemic lesions in the brain, a disrupted blood-brain barrier, oxidative stress, neurotransmitter dysfunction, and severe microglial activation. Increasing evidence suggests that complementary and alternative medicine, especially Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), is favorable in alleviating cognitive decline after sepsis. Here, we summarized the studies of traditional herbal remedies, TCM formulas and acupuncture therapy in animal models of neurological dysfunctions after sepsis in recent decades and reviewed their potential mechanisms.
