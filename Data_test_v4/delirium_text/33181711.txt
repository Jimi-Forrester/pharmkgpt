33181711|t|Efficacy and safety of butylphthalide as adjunctive therapy for vascular dementia: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis.
33181711|a|BACKGROUND: Butylphthalide is widely used for the adjunctive treatment of vascular dementia; however, the clinical evidences are not well synthesized yet. METHODS: We proposed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of butylphthalide as adjunctive therapy for vascular dementia. Seven electronic databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang database, Chongqing VIP database, China Biomedical Literature Database, Pubmed, EMBASE and Cochrane library) will be searched for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Required data of included studies will be collected. Quality of studies will be evaluated using Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Data synthesis will be performed using Review Manager software. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis will also be carried. RESULTS: Synthesis results of current available RCTs regarding the efficacy and safety of butylphthalide for the treatment vascular dementia will be provided by this systematic review and meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis will provide high level evidence of butylphthalide clinical application. REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42020168947.
