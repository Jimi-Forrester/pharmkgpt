36859183|a|BACKGROUND: Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord (SCD) is mainly caused by deficiency of Vitamin B12 and characterized by deep hypoesthesia, sensory ataxia and spasmodic paralysis of lower limbs. SCD often accompanies with megaloblastic anemia. Psychiatric symptoms could be the initial manifestations of SCD by lack of Vitamin B12, but are rarely considered secondary to physical discomfort and psychological factors in SCD. Additionally, treatment experience for psychiatric symptoms in SCD remains little reported. CASE REPORT: We presented a case of a 37-year-old female who complained of being persecuted and controlled for one week and thus was admitted to the psychiatry department. Before that, she had went through persistent paresthesia and numbness of her lower extremities for two-month. Low Vitamin B12 level and hemoglobin concentration, neurologic symptoms and bone marrow smear results supported the clinical diagnosis of SCD and megaloblastic anemia. With supplementation of Vitamin B12 and blood transfusion and short-term prescription of antipsychotics and antidepressants, physical symptoms were improved and psychological symptoms disappeared within 2 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric symptoms of SCD could be generated from lack of Vitamin B12, anemia and neurologic symptoms, where short-term use of antipsychotics and antidepressants may be effective.
