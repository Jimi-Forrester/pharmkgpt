29710712|t|Melatonin in Synaptic Impairments of Alzheimer's Disease.
29710712|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) underlies dementia for millions of people worldwide with no effective treatment. The dementia of AD is thought stem from the impairments of the synapses because of their critical roles in cognition. Melatonin is a neurohormone mainly released by the pineal gland in a circadian manner and it regulates brain functions in various manners. It is reported that both the melatonin deficit and synaptic impairments are present in the very early stage of AD and strongly contribute to the progress of AD. In the mammalian brains, the effects of melatonin are mainly relayed by two of its receptors, melatonin receptor type 1a (MT1) and 1b (MT2). To have a clear idea on the roles of melatonin in synaptic impairments of AD, this review discussed the actions of melatonin and its receptors in the stabilization of synapses, modulation of long-term potentiation, as well as their contributions in the transmissions of glutamatergic, GABAergic and dopaminergic synapses, which are the three main types of synapses relevant to the synaptic strength. The synaptic protective roles of melatonin in AD treatment were also summarized. Regarding its protective roles against amyloid-beta neurotoxicity, tau hyperphosphorylation, oxygenation, inflammation as well as synaptic dysfunctions, melatonin may be an ideal therapeutic agent against AD at early stage.
