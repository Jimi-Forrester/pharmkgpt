19190868|a|This paper describes the development and management of a new model of care for hospitalized patients with challenging behaviour evoked by dementia and/or delirium. To ameliorate care for patients with dementia in a geriatric acute care hospital a segregated Special Care Unit for patients with challenging behaviour was created. Environmental features allow for safe and unrestricted ambulation within the unit and create a home-like atmosphere. Day-time activities structure the day and assure additional professional presence in the unit. An intensive training program for the staff was provided. The SCU has been well accepted by the staff and is considered to be an improvement in care. Psychological burden of the nurses did not increase over a time period of one year in caring for these difficult patients.
