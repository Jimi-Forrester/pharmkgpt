9581220|t|Psychosocial and behavioral interventions for Alzheimer's disease patients and their families.
9581220|a|In the absence of definitive treatments for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, researchers in a variety of disciplines are developing psychosocial and behavioral intervention strategies to help patients and caregivers better manage and cope with the troublesome symptoms common in these conditions. These strategies include cognitive interventions, functional performance interventions, environmental interventions, integration of self interventions, and pleasure-inducing interventions. Although more research is needed to further develop these strategies and establish their best use, psychosocial and behavioral interventions hold great promise for improving the quality of life and well-being of dementia patients and their family caregivers.
