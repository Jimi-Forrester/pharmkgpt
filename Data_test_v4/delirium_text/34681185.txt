34681185|a|The oil palm tree (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) originates from West and Central Africa, and it is cultivated in Malaysia for its oil-producing fruits. Malaysia is the world's second largest palm oil producer and the world's largest exporter to date. Consequently, the Malaysian oil palm industry constantly generates a huge amount of biomass with the major contributor being the leaves. A large percentage of these leaves remain underutilized, making them a promising source of raw materials that can be converted into value-added products. The present review summarizes and discusses the flavonoid composition, total phenolic and flavonoid content, and the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological properties exhibited by the extracts of the leaves of E. guineensis. The purpose of this systematic review is to highlight the potential of valorizing the leaf extracts of the oil palm tree as pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical agents.
