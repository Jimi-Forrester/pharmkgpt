31011055|t|Estimate of the Costs Caused by Adverse Effects in Hospitalised Patients Due to Hip Fracture: Design of the Study and Preliminary Results.
31011055|a|INTRODUCTION: Hip fracture is a health problem that presents high morbidity and mortality, negatively influencing the patient's quality of life and generating high costs. Structured analysis of quality indicators can facilitate decision-making, cost minimization, and improvement of the quality of care. METHODS: We studied 1571 patients aged 70 years and over with the diagnosis of hip fracture at Hospital Universitario de la Ribera in the period between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2016. Demographic, clinical, functional, and quality indicator variables were studied. An indirect analysis of the costs associated with adverse events arising during hospital admission was made. A tool based on the "Minimum Basic Data Set (CMBD)" was designed to monitor the influence of patient risk factors on the incidence of adverse effects (AE) and their associated costs. RESULTS: The average age of the patients analysed was 84.15 years (SD 6.28), with a length of stay of 8.01 days (SD 3.32), a mean preoperative stay of 43.04 h (SD 30.81), and a mortality rate of 4.2%. Likewise, the percentage of patients with AE was 41.44%, and 11.01% of patients changed their cost as a consequence of these AEs suffered during hospital admission. The average cost of patients was $8752 (SD: 1,864) and the average cost increase in patients with adverse events was $2321 (SD: 3,164). CONCLUSIONS: Through the analysis of the main clinical characteristics and the indirect estimation of the complexity of the patients, a simple calculation of the average cost of the attention and its adverse events can be designed in patients who are admitted due to hip fracture. Additionally, this tool can fit the welfare quality indicators by severity and cost.
