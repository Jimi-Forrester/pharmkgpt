34189249|t|An international, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2b clinical trial of intepirdine for dementia with Lewy bodies (HEADWAY-DLB).
34189249|a|INTRODUCTION: A phase 2b clinical trial, HEADWAY-DLB, was performed to assess treatment with intepirdine, a serotonin receptor antagonist, in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). METHODS: HEADWAY-DLB was a multinational, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Two hundred sixty-nine DLB patients were randomized to receive placebo, 70 mg/day intepirdine, or 35 mg/day intepirdine over 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 24 on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-Part III (UPDRS-III). RESULTS: Both intepirdine groups did not demonstrate significant benefits over placebo at 24 weeks on the UPDRS-III (35 mg/day: P = .1580, 70 mg/day: P = .6069). All other endpoints were not significant. Intepirdine was well tolerated, with a slightly higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events observed in the intepirdine groups versus placebo. DISCUSSION: Intepirdine treatment did not lead to improvements over placebo in patients with DLB. As one of the largest DLB studies to date, HEADWAY-DLB demonstrates that international trials for DLB are feasible within a reasonable timeframe.
