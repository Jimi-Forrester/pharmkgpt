38223135|t|Low HALP (Hemoglobin, Albumin, Lymphocyte, and Platelet) Score Increases the Risk of Post-Stroke Cognitive Impairment: A Multicenter Cohort Study.
38223135|a|Objective: The HALP (hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet) score is a novel indicator that measures systemic inflammation and nutritional status that has not been correlated with the risk of post-stroke cognitive impairment in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Methods: Study participants were recruited from 40 stroke centers in China. The HALP score was derived using a weighted sum of hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocytes and platelets, and study participants were categorized into 4 groups of equal sizes based on quartiles cutoffs of the HALP score. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)-Beijing Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA-Beijing) was performed at 2 weeks and 12 months following stroke onset. Post-stroke cognitive impairment was considered in patients with MoCA-Beijing<=22. Multiple logistic regression methods were employed to evaluate the relationship between the HALP score and the subsequent risk of developing post-stroke cognitive impairment. Results: The study population comprised 1022 patients (mean age 61.6+-11.0 years, 73% men). The proportion of individuals with MoCA-Beijing<=22 at 2 weeks was 49.2% and 32.4% at one year. Patients in the lowest quartile of HALP score (<36.56) were observed to harbor the highest risk of post-stroke cognitive impairment at 12 months post-stroke/TIA compared to those in the highest quartile (odds ratio=1.59, 95% CI=1.07-2.37, p=0.022), and lower domain scores for executive function, naming, and attention. There were no statistically significant differences between patients in the different quartiles of HALP score and HALP score at 2 weeks post-stroke/TIA. Conclusion: The HALP score is a simple score that could stratify the risk of post-stroke cognitive impairment in stroke/TIA patients to facilitate early diagnosis and interventions.
