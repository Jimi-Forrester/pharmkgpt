37353739|t|Knockout of PERK protects rat Muller glial cells against OGD-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress-related apoptosis.
37353739|a|BACKGROUND: The pathological basis for many retinal diseases, retinal ischemia is also one of the most common causes of visual impairment. Numerous ocular diseases have been linked to Endoplasmic reticulum(ER)stress. However, there is still no clear understanding of the relationship between ER stress and Muller glial cells during retinal ischemia and hypoxia. This study examined the effects of ER stress on autophagy and apoptosis-related proteins, as well as the microtubule-related protein tau in rMC-1 cells. METHODS: rMC-1 cells were cultured in vitro. RT-PCR immunofluorescence and Western blotting revealed the expression levels of associated mRNAs and proteins, and the CCK-8 and flow cytometry assays detected cell apoptosis. RESULTS: The results showed that under OGD(Oxygen-glucose deprivation) conditions, the number of rMC-1 cells was decreased, the PERK/eIF2a pathway was activated, and the expressions of p-tau, LC3 Beclin1 and Caspase-12 proteins were increased. After the PERK knockout, the expression of the above proteins was decreased, and the apoptosis was also decreased. CONCLUSION: According to the findings of this study, specific downregulation of PERK expression had an anti-apoptotic effect on OGD-conditioned rMC-1 cells. There is a possibility that this is one of the mechanisms of MG cell apoptosis during retinal ischemic injury.
