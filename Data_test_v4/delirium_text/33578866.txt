33578866|t|Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease: Current Evidence and Future Perspectives.
33578866|a|Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, clinically heterogeneous, and particularly complex neurodegenerative disease characterized by a decline in cognition. Over the last two decades, there has been significant growth in the investigation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. This review presents current evidence from many clinical neurochemical studies, with findings that attest to the efficacy of existing core CSF biomarkers such as total tau, phosphorylated tau, and amyloid-beta (Abeta42), which diagnose Alzheimer's disease in the early and dementia stages of the disorder. The heterogeneity of the pathophysiology of the late-onset disease warrants the growth of the Alzheimer's disease CSF biomarker toolbox; more biomarkers showing other aspects of the disease mechanism are needed. This review focuses on new biomarkers that track Alzheimer's disease pathology, such as those that assess neuronal injury (VILIP-1 and neurofilament light), neuroinflammation (sTREM2, YKL-40, osteopontin, GFAP, progranulin, and MCP-1), synaptic dysfunction (SNAP-25 and GAP-43), vascular dysregulation (hFABP), as well as CSF alpha-synuclein levels and TDP-43 pathology. Some of these biomarkers are promising candidates as they are specific and predict future rates of cognitive decline. Findings from the combinations of subclasses of new Alzheimer's disease biomarkers that improve their diagnostic efficacy in detecting associated pathological changes are also presented.
