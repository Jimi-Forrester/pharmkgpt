34663883|a|Triple intrinsic brain networks including the salience network (SN), default mode network (DMN), and central executive network (CEN), are known to be important in human cognition. Therefore, investigating those intrinsic brain networks in transient global amnesia (TGA) may offer novel insight useful for the pathophysiology of TGA. Fifty TGA patients underwent the resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) within 24 h, at 72 h, and 3 months after TGA onset. Twenty-five age, gender matched controls also underwent rsfMRI. Within 24 h of TGA onset, TGA patients showed greater functional connectivity in the SN and lower functional connectivity in the DMN, while relatively preserved functional connectivity was observed in the CEN. Interestingly, TGA patients continued to show decreased connectivity in the DMN, while no alterations were shown in the SN 72 h after illness onset. Three months after TGA onset, alterations of functional connectivity in the SN or the DMN were normalized. Our findings suggest that TGA is associated with transient greater functional connectivity in the SN and lower connectivity in the DMN.
