30720548|t|Nonadherence in Hemodialysis Patients and Related Factors: A Multicenter Study.
30720548|a|BACKGROUND: Nonadherence to dietary and fluid restrictions, hemodialysis (HD), and medication treatment has been shown to increase the risks of hospitalization and mortality significantly. Sociodemographic and biochemical parameters as well as psychosocial conditions such as depression and anxiety are known to affect nonadherence in HD patients. However, evidence related to the relative importance and actual impact of these factors varies among studies. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to identify the factors that affect nonadherence to dietary and fluid restrictions, HD, and medication treatment. METHODS: This descriptive study was conducted on 274 patients who were being treated at four HD centers in Turkey. The parameters used to determine nonadherence to dialysis treatment were as follows: skipping multiple dialysis sessions during the most recent 1-month period, shortening a dialysis session by more than 10 minutes during the most recent 1-month period, and Kt/V < 1.4. The parameters used to determine nonadherence to dietary and fluid restriction were as follows: serum phosphorus level > 7.5 mg/dl, predialysis serum potassium level > 6.0 mEq/L, and interdialytic weight gain > 5.7% of body weight. The Morisky Green Levine Medication Adherence Scale was performed to determine nonadherence to medication treatment. A patient was classified as nonadherent if he or she did not adhere to one or more of these indices. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to identify patient risk in terms of anxiety and depression. Logistic regression was used to determine the predictors of nonadherence. RESULTS: The nonadherence rate was 39.1% for dietary and fluid restrictions, 33.6% for HD, and 20.1% for medication. The risk of nonadherence to dietary and fluid restriction was found to be 4.337 times higher in high school graduates (95% CI [1.502, 12.754], p = .007). The risk of nonadherence to HD treatment was 2.074 times higher in men (95% CI [1.213, 3.546], p = .008) and 2.591 times higher in patients with a central venous catheter (95% CI [1.171, 5.733], p = .019). Longer duration in HD resulted in 0.992 times decrease in risk of nonadherence to treatment (95% CI [0.986, 0.998], p = .005). CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Educational status, being male, having a central venous catheter, and having a short HD duration were found to be risk factors for nonadherence. Nurses must consider the patient's adherence to the dietary and fluid restrictions, HD, and medication treatment at each visit.
