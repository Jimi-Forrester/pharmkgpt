35320954|t|Recovery Profile of Sugammadex versus Neostigmine in Pediatric Patients Undergoing Cardiac Catheterization: A Randomized Double-Blind Study.
35320954|a|Background: Sugammadex is a selective reversal agent which has the ability to reverse deep neuromuscular blockade. However, there are still controversial results as regard sugammadex effects on the quality of recovery. We hypothesized that Sugammadex may have better recovery profile compared to neostigmine in pediatric patients with congenital heart diseases undergoing cardiac catheterization. Patients and Methods: This prospective randomized double-blind study included 50 pediatric patients aged <2 years who were divided into two groups according to the reversal agent used; Group S (Sugammadex) and Group N (Neostigmine). Both groups received the same anesthetic technique during cardiac catheterization, and basic hemodynamic monitoring was ensured in both groups. After the procedure, reversal was done using 4 mg.kg-1 sugammadex or 0.04 mg. kg-1 neostigmine plus 0.02 mg. kg-1 atropine according to the group allocation. Recovery time and side effects were recorded. Results: The two groups showed comparable findings regarding demographics. Nonetheless, the total time of anesthesia had mean values of 91.06 and 101.25 min in the two groups, respectively (P = 0.003), while recovery time had mean values of 1.61 and 9.23 min in the same groups, respectively (P < 0.001). Hemodynamic profile (heart rate and mean arterial pressure) was better after reversal with sugammadex. Blood sugar levels and side effects showed no significant difference between both groups. Conclusion: Sugammadex can be a more rapid and effective alternative to neostigmine for reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.
