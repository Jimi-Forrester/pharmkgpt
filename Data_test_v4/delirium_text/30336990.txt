30336990|a|Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common neurodegenerative dementia following Alzheimer disease. It stems from the formation of Lewy bodies, which contain aggregates of the misfolded protein, alpha-synuclein. These deposit in areas of the nervous system and brain, leading to neuronal cell death and causing clinically apparent symptoms. Because of its clinical overlap with other forms of dementia, DLB is often underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed. There is currently no cure for DLB and treatments are aimed at ameliorating specific symptoms.
