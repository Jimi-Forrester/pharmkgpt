30576228|t|VEGF receptor-1 modulates amyloid beta 1-42 oligomer-induced senescence in brain endothelial cells.
30576228|a|Aggregated amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain are hypothesized to trigger several downstream pathologies, including cerebrovascular dysfunction. Previous studies have shown that Abeta peptides can have antiangiogenic properties, which may contribute to vascular dysfunction in the early stages of the disease process. We have generated data showing that brain endothelial cells (ECs) exposed to toxic Abeta1-42 oligomers can readily enter a senescence phenotype. To determine the effect of Abeta oligomers on brain ECs, we treated early passaged human brain microvascular ECs and HUVECs with high MW Abeta1-42 oligomers (5 microM, for 72 h). For controls, we used no peptide treatment, 5 microM Abeta1-42 monomers, and 5 microM Abeta1-42 fibrils, respectively. Brain ECs treated with Abeta1-42 oligomers showed increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining and increased senescence-associated p21/p53 expression. Treatment with either Abeta1-42 monomer or Abeta1-42 fibrils did not induce senescence in this assay. We then measured vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) expression in the Abeta1-42 oligomer-treated ECs, and these cells showed significantly increased VEGFR-1 expression and decreased VEGFR-2 levels. Overexpression of VEGFR-1 in brain ECs readily induced senescence, suggesting a direct role of VEGFR-1 signaling events in this paradigm. More importantly, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of VEGFR-1 expression in brain ECs was able to prevent up-regulation of p21 protein expression and significantly reduced induction of senescence following Abeta1-42 oligomer treatment. Our studies show that exposure to Abeta1-42 oligomers may impair vascular functions by altering VEGFR-1 expression and causing ECs to enter a senescent phenotype. Altered VEGFR expression has been documented in brains of AD patients and suggests that this pathway may play a role in AD disease pathogenesis. These studies suggest that modulating VEGFR-1 expression and signaling events could potentially prevent senescence and rejuvenate EC functions, and provides us with a novel target to pursue for prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD.-Angom, R.
