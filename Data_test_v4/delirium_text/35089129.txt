35089129|a|Advancing age causes reduced hippocampal neurogenesis, associated with age-related cognitive decline. The spatial relationship of age-induced alterations in neural stem cells (NSCs) and surrounding cells within the hippocampal niche remains poorly understood due to limitations of antibody-based cellular phenotyping. We established iterative indirect immunofluorescence imaging (4i) in tissue sections, allowing for simultaneous detection of 18 proteins to characterize NSCs and surrounding cells in 2-, 6-, and 12-month-old mice. We show that reorganization of the dentate gyrus (DG) niche already occurs in middle-aged mice, paralleling the decline in neurogenesis. 4i-based tissue analysis of the DG identifies changes in cell-type contributions to the blood-brain barrier and microenvironments surrounding NSCs to play a pivotal role to preserve neurogenic permissiveness. The data provided represent a resource to characterize the principles causing alterations of stem cell-associated plasticity within the aging DG and provide a blueprint to analyze somatic stem cell niches across lifespan in complex tissues.
