28031986|t|Retrospective analysis of prognostic factors in dengue infected patients with intracranial bleed.
28031986|a|BACKGROUND: Dengue is one of the most common mosquito-transmitted arboviral disease of tropical and a few subtropical areas in the world. It is estimated that approximately 100 million cases occur per year and approximately 2.5 billion people are at risk of developing dengue infection. Hemorrhagic complications causing encephalopathy are quite rare but fatal consequences of this deadly disease. This study was conducted to discuss the prognostic factors in the management of intracranial hemorrhage in dengue infected patients. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in the neurosurgery department of our tertiary healthcare centre. Duration of the study was 1 year, and 18 patients who presented with intracranial bleed and required neurosurgical care were included in this study. All patients had deranged coagulation profile and were thrombocytopenic. All the patients were given platelet concentrates for correction of thrombocytopenia. Eight of these patients had deterioration in their neurological status, and 6 of them underwent surgery. RESULTS: Out of 18 patients, 12 (66.66%) were managed conservatively, including one case of cervical extradural hemorrhage. Five patients who were conservatively managed died because they had deep-seated bleed and rapid deterioration. The remaining 7 patients who were managed conservatively improved well with few residual deficits. Six (33.33%) patients who underwent surgery had excellent outcome with one case of mortality. CONCLUSION: Very high index of suspicion is required in dengue infected patients for neurological complications, especially during the convalescence period. Special attention should be given to those patients who have altered sensorium, and should not be misinterpreted as fever delirium or toxic encephalopathy. It requires immediate attention and further neurological investigation (including thorough clinical examination). Timely diagnosis using a computed tomography scan and early neurosurgical intervention after rapid correction of thrombocytopenia can save many lives.
