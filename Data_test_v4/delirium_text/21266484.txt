21266484|t|A high-throughput DNA methylation analysis of a single cell.
21266484|a|In recent years, the field of epigenetics has grown dramatically and has become one of the most dynamic and fast-growing branches of molecular biology. The amount of diseases suspected of being influenced by DNA methylation is rising steadily and includes common diseases such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, atherosclerosis, cancer, major psychosis, lupus and Parkinson's disease. Due to cellular heterogeneity of methylation patterns, epigenetic analyses of single cells become a necessity. One rationale is that DNA methylation profiles are highly variable across individual cells, even in the same organ, dependent on the function of the gene, disease state, exposure to environmental factors (e.g. radiation, drugs or nutrition), stochastic fluctuations and various other causes. Using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-slide microreaction system, we present here a methylation-sensitive PCR analysis, the restriction enzyme-based single-cell methylation assay (RSMA), in the analysis of DNA methylation patterns in single cells. This method addresses the problems of cell heterogeneity in epigenetics research; it is comparably affordable, avoids complicated microfluidic systems and offers the opportunity for high-throughput screening, as many single cells can be screened in parallel. In addition to this study, critical principles and caveats of single cell methylation analyses are discussed.
