1019365|t|EEG examination during delirium tremens.
1019365|a|In 30 male patients several EEG examinations could be carried out during delirium tremens (d.t.) or shortly thereafter. Most of the patients showed a normal EEG or changes which can be explained with regard to sedation through medication. 1 patient showed generalized paroxysmal spike wave bursts. On account of experimental results, we may assume that a transitory cerebral excitibality change occures in d.t. This pathophysiological basis explains the normal EEGs and paroxysmal bursts during d.t. 4 cases showed passages of pronounced diffuse slow activity during d.t. partly accompanied by thythmic bilateral slow waves. These changes point to a complication of d.t. that occurs because of another disease which results in cerebral functional disturbances as in other organic psychoses.
