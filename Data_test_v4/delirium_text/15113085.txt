15113085|t|Peptide and amino acid glycation: new insights into the Maillard reaction.
15113085|a|Nonenzymatic glycation of proteins, peptides and other macromolecules (the Maillard reaction) has been implicated in a number of pathologies, most clearly in diabetes mellitus. but also in the normal processes of aging and neurodegenerative amyloid diseases such as Alzheimer's. In the early stage, glycation results in the formation of Amadori-modified proteins. In the later stages, advanced glycation end products (AGE) are irreversibly formed from Amadori products leading to the formation of reactive intermediates, crosslinking of proteins, and the formation of brown and fluorescent polymeric materials. Although, the glycation of structural proteins has been attributed a key role in the complications of diabetes, recent attention has been devoted to the physiological significance of glycated peptide hormones. This review focuses on the physico-chemical properties of the Amadori compounds of bioactive peptides of endogenous and exogenous origin, such as Leu-enkephalin and morphiceptin, investigated under different conditions as well as on novel pathways in the Maillard reaction observed from investigating intramolecular events in ester-linked glycopeptides.
