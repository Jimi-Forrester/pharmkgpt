37580462|a|PURPOSE: Noninvasive imaging of protein aggregates in the brain is critical for the early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of novel therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging with specific probes is a promising technique for the in vivo detection of protein deposits without radiation exposure. Comprehensive screening of fluorescent compounds identified a novel compound, THK-565, for the in vivo imaging of amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits in the mouse brain. This study assessed whether THK-565 could detect amyloid-beta deposits in vivo in the AD mouse model. PROCEDURES: The fluorescent properties of THK-565 were evaluated in the presence and absence of Abeta fibrils. APP knock-in (APP-KI) mice were used as an animal model of AD. In vivo NIRF images were acquired after the intravenous administration of THK-565 and THK-265 in mice. The binding selectivity of THK-565 to Abeta was evaluated using brain slices obtained from these mouse models. RESULTS: The fluorescence intensity of the THK-565 solution substantially increased by mixing with Abeta fibrils. The maximum emission wavelength of the complex of THK-565 and Abeta fibrils was 704 nm, which was within the optical window range. THK-565 selectively bound to amyloid deposits in brain sections of APP-KI mice After the intravenous administration of THK-565, the fluorescence signal in the head of APP-KI mice was significantly higher than that of wild-type mice and higher than that after administration of THK-265. Ex vivo analysis confirmed that the THK-565 signal corresponded to Abeta immunostaining in the brain sections of these mice. CONCLUSIONS: A novel NIRF probe, THK-565, enabled the in vivo detection of Abeta deposits in the brains of the AD mouse model, suggesting that NIRF imaging with THK-565 could non-invasively assess disease-specific pathology in AD.
