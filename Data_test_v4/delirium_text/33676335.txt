33676335|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease majorly affecting old age populations. Various factors that affect the progression of the disease include, amyloid plaque formation, neurofibrillary tangles, inflammation, oxidative stress, etc. Herein we report of a new series of substituted (2-aminothiazol-5-yl)(imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-yl)methanones. The designed compounds were synthesized and characterized by spectral data. In vivo anti-inflammatory activity was carried out for screening of anti-inflammatory potential of synthesized compounds. All the compounds were tested for acute inflammatory activity by using carrageenan induced acute inflammation model. Compounds 10b, 10c, and 10o had shown promising acute anti-inflammatory activity and they were further tested for formalin induced chronic inflammation model. Compound 10c showed both acute and chronic anti-inflammatory activity. Compound 10c also showed promising results in AlCl3 induced AD model. Studies on various behavioral parameters suggested improved amnesic performance of compound 10c treated rats. Compound 10c treated rats also exhibited excellent antioxidant and neuroprotective effect with inherent gastrointestinal safety.
