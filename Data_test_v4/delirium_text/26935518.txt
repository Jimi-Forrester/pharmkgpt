26935518|t|[A clinical analysis of elderly dementia patients with physical comorbidities].
26935518|a|AIM: To investigate the current status of elderly dementia patients with physical illnesses and identify optimal care strategies for this growing population. METHODS: This retrospective study included elderly dementia patients who (i) received in-patient treatment for a physical comorbidity at the dementia ward of the Juntendo Tokyo Koto Geriatric Medical Center, and (ii) who were discharged from April 2009 to March 2011. RESULTS: The study population was 390 patients (144 males, 246 females), with a mean [+-SD] age of 80.5 [+-8.1] years. Two hundred thirteen of the patients had Alzheimer's disease; the remaining 177 had other types of dementia. The comorbidities necessitating admission were: malignant neoplasms (n=65), respiratory conditions (n=57), genitourinary conditions (n=50), trauma or fracture (n=41), and other (n=177). Among the 239 subjects who were hospitalized from their homes and who were discharged alive, 157 (65.7%) returned to their homes. The hospital stays of patients who were discharged were significantly shorter (P<0.000) and their N-ADL scores were significantly better at admission (P<0.013) and at discharge (P<0.000). The proportion of subjects who were capable of oral ingestion was significantly higher among the patients who were discharged to their homes (P<0.025). The subjects who lived in their homes alone at the time of hospitalization were significantly less likely to be discharged to their homes (P<0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly dementia patients should ideally return home after hospitalization for comorbid illnesses. This was facilitated by minimizing their hospital stay. During in-patient treatment, efforts should be made to maintain their N-ADL levels and support their oral intake.
