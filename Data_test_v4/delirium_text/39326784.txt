39326784|a|BACKGROUND: Psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) are a type of neuropsychiatric symptom found during Alzheimer's Disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to comprehensively capture, analyse, and evaluate the body of evidence that has investigated associations between brain regions/networks and psychotic symptoms in AD. METHODS: The protocol, created according to the PRISMA guidelines, was pre-registered on OSF (https://osf.io/tg8xp/). Searches were performed using PubMed, Web of Science and PsycInfo. A partial coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) was performed based on data availability. RESULTS: Eighty-two papers were selected: delusions were found to be associated mainly with right fronto-temporal brain regions and the insula; hallucinations mainly with fronto-occipital areas; both were frequently associated with the anterior cingulate cortex. The CBMA, performed on the findings of fourteen papers on delusions, identified a cluster in the frontal lobe, one in the putamen, and a smaller one in the insula. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence highlights that key brain regions, predominantly in the right frontal lobe, the anterior cingulate cortex, and temporo-occipital areas, appear to underpin the different manifestations of psychotic symptoms in AD and MCI. The fronto-temporal areas identified in relation to delusions may underpin a failure to assimilate correct information and consider alternative possibilities (which might generate and maintain the delusional belief), and dysfunction within the salience network (anterior cingulate cortex and insula) may suggest a contribution for how internal and external stimuli are identified; the fronto-occipital areas linked to hallucinations may indicate diminished sensory processing and non-optimal predictive processing, that together contribute to misinterpretation of stimuli and misperceptions; the fronto-temporal and occipital areas, as well as the anterior cingulate cortex were linked to the psychotic cluster.
