36986620|t|Natural Gums in Drug-Loaded Micro- and Nanogels.
36986620|a|Gums are polysaccharide compounds obtained from natural sources, such as plants, algae and bacteria. Because of their excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, as well as their ability to swell and their sensitivity to degradation by the colon microbiome, they are regarded as interesting potential drug carriers. In order to obtain properties differing from the original compounds, blends with other polymers and chemical modifications are usually applied. Gums and gum-derived compounds can be applied in the form of macroscopic hydrogels or can be formulated into particulate systems that can deliver the drugs via different administration routes. In this review, we present and summarize the most recent studies regarding micro- and nanoparticles obtained with the use of gums extensively investigated in pharmaceutical technology, their derivatives and blends with other polymers. This review focuses on the most important aspects of micro- and nanoparticulate systems formulation and their application as drug carriers, as well as the challenges related to these formulations.
