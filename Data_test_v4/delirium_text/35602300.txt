35602300|t|Effect of Heptaflourane Inhalation and Anesthesia Induction on Hemodynamics of Elderly Patients Undergoing Elective Gastrointestinal Tumor Surgery.
35602300|a|Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare malignancies that begin in specific cells in the GI tract's (also known as the digestive tract's) wall. The microenvironment of gastrointestinal cancers has gotten a lot of interest in the last decade. There are various obstacles connected with providing care to individuals with gastrointestinal cancers, especially the elderly. The physiological reserves of elderly individuals are generally depleted, and comorbidities might limit treatment options and increase problems. Surgeons and anesthesiologists must be aware of the measures that must be used while dealing with this fragile population. Anesthesia is a term that refers to the use of drugs to alleviate pain during the surgery and other treatments. Anesthesia is crucial to a patient's successful treatment and recovery. To induce and maintain general anesthesia in the operating room, inhalation anesthetics (isoflurane, halothane, nitrous oxide, sevoflurane, and desflurane, the most commonly used agents in practice today) are utilized. Inhalation anesthetics are drugs used to give general anesthesia for surgery in the operating room. Anesthetics have the potential to cause substantial cardiac depression as well as hemodynamic instability. In this study, we propose the SBWOA (spark bumper whale optimization algorithm), which is used to assess the patient's risk before surgery. The entire experiment was run through Matlab simulations.
