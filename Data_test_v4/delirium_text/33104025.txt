33104025|t|The Relationship Between Anxiety and Incident Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease.
33104025|a|BACKGROUND: Agitation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been hypothesized to be an expression of anxiety, but whether anxiety early in the course of dementia could be a risk factor for developing later agitation is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We used the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database to examine the longitudinal relationship between anxiety and incident agitation in individuals with a diagnosis of AD at baseline or during follow-up. METHODS: Longitudinal neuropsychiatric symptom data from AD individuals who were agitation-free at study baseline (N = 272) were analyzed using mixed effects regression models to test the longitudinal relationship between baseline and incident anxiety with incident agitation. RESULTS: Anxiety at baseline was not associated with subsequent agitation, but there was a positive linear relationship between incident anxiety and agitation over the study duration. Baseline apathy and delusions were consistently associated with subsequent agitation and greater disease severity and illness duration also appeared to be risk factors for agitation. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the concept that anxiety and agitation are likely to be distinct rather than equivalent constructs in mild-moderate AD. Future longitudinal cohort studies are needed to replicate these findings and further characterize potential risk factors for agitation, such as apathy and delusions.
