37533598|t|Electroconvulsive therapy for treating patients with agitation and related behavioral disorders due to dementia: a systematic review.
37533598|a|Behavioral disturbances are clinically relevant in patients with dementia, and pharmacological regimens to mitigate these symptoms have provided limited results. Proven to be effective in several psychiatric conditions, electroconvulsive therapy is a potentially beneficial strategy for treating severe agitation due to dementia. Objective: This review aimed to examine the publications on the efficacy, safety and tolerability of electroconvulsive therapy in treating patients with agitation due to dementia. Methods: We performed a systematic analysis on the electroconvulsive therapy to treat patients with dementia and coexisting severe agitation. Articles were classified according to the level of evidence based on methodological design. Patients received an acute course of electroconvulsive therapy, often followed by maintenance intervention. Results: We selected 19 studies (156 patients; 64.1% women; 51-98 years old), which met the inclusion criteria: one case-control study by chart analysis (level of evidence 2); one open-label study (level of evidence 3); three historical/retrospective chart analyses (level of evidence 4); and 14 case series/reports (level of evidence 5). No randomized, sham-controlled clinical trials (level of evidence 1) were identified, which represents the main methodological weakness. Some patients had postictal delirium, cardiovascular decompensation and cognitive changes, lasting for a short time. Conclusions: Overall, patients achieved significant improvement in agitation. However, the main finding of the present review was the absence of methodological design based on randomized and sham-controlled clinical trials. Despite methodological limitations and side effects requiring attention, electroconvulsive therapy was considered a safe and effective treatment of patients with severe agitation and related behavioral disorders due to dementia.
