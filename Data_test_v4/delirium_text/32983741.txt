32983741|t|Miniplate Fixation to an Edentulous Mandibular Fracture in Panfacial Trauma.
32983741|a|A 70-year-old edentulous male presented with bilateral mandible and left midface fractures following an assault. Imaging confirmed fractures and showed mandible thickness greater than 20 millimeters. The patient was treated by open reduction internal fixation with miniplates via an intra-oral approach and recovered without deficit. While miniplate fixation and an intra-oral approach is typically reserved for the dentulous patient, this case illustrates that in select edentulous patients with sufficient bone thickness and amenable midface fractures this technique may be successfully utilized.
