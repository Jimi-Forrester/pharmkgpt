37886544|a|Simian varicella virus (SVV) produces peripheral inflammatory responses during varicella (primary infection) and zoster (reactivation) in rhesus macaques (RM). However, it is unclear if peripheral measures are accurate proxies for central nervous system (CNS) responses. Thus, we analyzed cytokine and Abeta42/Abeta40 changes in paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during the course of infection. During varicella and zoster, every RM had variable changes in serum and CSF cytokine and Abeta42/Abeta40 levels compared to pre-inoculation levels. Overall, peripheral infection appears to affect CNS cytokine and Abeta42/Abeta40 levels independent of serum responses, suggesting that peripheral disease may contribute to CNS disease.
