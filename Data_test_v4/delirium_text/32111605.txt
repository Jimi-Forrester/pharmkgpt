32111605|t|EGFR Signaling Causes Morphine Tolerance and Mechanical Sensitization in Rats.
32111605|a|The safety and efficacy of opioids are compromised as analgesic tolerance develops. Opioids are also ineffective against neuropathic pain. Recent reports have suggested that inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), may have analgesic effects in cancer patients suffering from neuropathic pain. It has been shown that the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFR-beta), an RTK that has been shown to interact with the EGFR, mediates opioid tolerance but does not induce analgesia. Therefore, we sought to determine whether EGFR signaling was involved in opioid tolerance and whether EGFR and PDGFR signaling could induce pain in rats. We found that gefitinib, an EGFR antagonist, eliminated morphine tolerance. In addition, repeated EGF administration rendered animals unresponsive to subsequent analgesic doses of morphine, a phenomenon we call "pre-tolerance." Using a nerve injury model, we found that gefitinib alone was not analgesic. Rather, it reversed insensitivity to morphine analgesia (pre-tolerance) caused by the release of EGF by injured nerves. We also showed that repeated, but not acute EGF or PDGF-BB administration induced mechanical hypersensitivity in rats. EGFR and PDGFR-beta signaling interacted to produce this sensitization. EGFR was widely expressed in primary sensory afferent cell bodies, demonstrating a neuroanatomical substrate for our findings. Taken together, our results suggest a direct mechanistic link between opioid tolerance and mechanical sensitization. EGFR antagonism could eventually play an important clinical role in the treatment of opioid tolerance and neuropathic pain that is refractory to opioid treatment.
