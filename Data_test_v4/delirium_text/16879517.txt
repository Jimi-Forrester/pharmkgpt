16879517|a|BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to determine whether prophylactic use of 1 microg x kg(-1) dexmedetomidine affected the incidence of emergence agitation (EA) after sevoflurane based anesthesia without surgery in children. METHODS: In a double-blinded trial, 42 children (ASA I-II,18 months to 10 years) undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination were randomly assigned to receive dexmedetomidine 1 microg x kg(-1) iv or placebo after induction of anesthesia. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO2) were monitored. Anesthesia was induced in all patients, irrespective of group, with 8% sevoflurane in 50-50% O2/N2O and maintained with 1.5% sevoflurane in 50/50% O2/N2O. Agitation parameters were assessed with a 5-point scale and measured every 5 min. Delirium was defined as agitation score of > or =4 for > or =5 min. Anesthesia and procedure times and per- and postoperative side effects were recorded. RESULTS: The HR, MAP, and SpO2, spontaneous arm or leg motion times and purposeful movement times showed no significant differences between the two groups. The time of removing the LMA, and the time of eye opening with verbal stimuli was shorter in group P than the group D (P = 0.007 and P = 0.01). The time of discharge to recovery room and the time of discharge from hospital were similar in the two groups. The mean agitation scores in the dexmedetomidine group were significantly lower than the placebo group except at 30 min (P < 0.0001, P = 0.001, P = 0.002, P = 0.013 and P = 0.001). The incidence of emergence agitation was 47.6% in group P, and 4.8% in group D (P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: We concluded that a 1 microg x kg(-1) dose of i.v. dexmedetomidine reduces EA after sevoflurane anesthesia in children undergoing MRI.
