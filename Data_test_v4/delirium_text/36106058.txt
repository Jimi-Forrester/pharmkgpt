36106058|t|Dose Dependent Effects of Breynia cernua Against the Paraquat Induced Parkinsonism like Symptoms in Animals' Model: In Vitro, In Vivo and Mechanistic Studies.
36106058|a|The aims and objectives of the study were to evaluate the antiParkinson's (PD) potential of B cernua (BCE). B cernua (Poir.) Mull. Arg. (B cernua) is a member of the Phyllanthaceae family. HPLC revealed the presence of various phytochemicals. Study was conducted for 40 days. After PD induction by paraquat behavioural studies were carried out. Biochemical parameters such as DPPH, NO-scavenging, Ferrous reducing power, MDA, GSH, CAT, SOD, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), neurotransmitter estimation and TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels were determined. DPPH, NO-scavenging and Ferrous reducing power assays showed 78.02%, 48.05% and 71.45% inhibitions, respectively. There was significant improvement in motor functions and coordination in a dose-dependent manner (50 < 250 < 500 mg/kg) in PD rat model. Biochemical markers; SOD, CAT, GPx and GSH showed significant restoration (P < .001) while MDA showed significant decrease (P < .05). The AChE level was significantly reduced (P < .05) at 500 mg/kg while neurotransmitters were significantly improved (P < .001) in a dose-dependent fashion. The ELISA results showed significant (P < .001) down-regulation of IL-6 and TNF-alpha level. In conclusion, it is suggested that BCE has the potential to reduce the symptoms of PD.
