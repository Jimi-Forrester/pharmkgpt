30337611|a|Improving and maintaining memory function is effective in preventing cognitive decline and dementia. Previously, we demonstrated that iso-alpha-acids, the hop-derived bitter components in beer, prevent cognitive impairment in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model. In this report, we investigated the effects of matured hop bitter acids (MHBA) containing components of oxides derived from alpha- and beta-acids, and structurally similar to iso-alpha-acids, on cognitive function using behavioral pharmacological procedures. MHBA and the representative components of MHBA, 4'-hydroxyallohumulinone (HAH) and 4'-hydroxy-cis-alloisohumulone (HAIH) improved spatial working memory in scopolamine-induced amnesia mice. MHBA also enhanced episodic memory in the novel object recognition test (NORT). The administration of MHBA increased the amount of norepinephrine (NE) and NE release into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in hippocampus. The MHBA activity in improving memory function was attenuated by treatment with a beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. In addition, vagotomized mice did not display the memory improvement induced by MHBA. Together, our results suggest that MHBA improves memory function via stimulation of the vagus nerve and enhancement of NE release in the hippocampus. Vagus nerve activation by the intake of food materials including MHBA may be a safe and effective approach for improving cognitive function.
