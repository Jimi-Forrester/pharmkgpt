35291573|a|Objectives: Achieving the hip fracture best practice tariff is associated with decreased mortality rates. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on achieving Best Practice Tariff. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all adult hip fractures admitted to our unit between March and June 2020. Patient's characteristics, place of residence, delirium assessment, and mobility status were recorded. All the Best practice Tariff criteria have been analysed. Covid-19 was diagnosed using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Results: 178 patients with a mean age of 82.8 years presented with hip fractures during the study period. 18 patients (10.1%) tested positive for COVID-19. 44.4% failed to achieve the BPT from the COVID-19 positive group and 22.5% from the negative group. Conclusion: Based on this study, hip fractures associated with Covid-19 infection are more likely to fail the BPT and have higher 30-day mortality rates compare to the COVID-19 negative patients.
