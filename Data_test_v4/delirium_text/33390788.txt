33390788|a|Islet amyloid polypeptide (amylin), consecrated by the pancreatic beta-cells with insulin, has a significant role to play in maintaining homeostasis of islet cell hormones. Alzheimer's disease is the predominant source of dementia. However, its etiology remains uncertain; it appears that type 2 diabetes mellitus and other prediabetic states of insulin resistance contribute to the intermittent Alzheimer's disease presence. Amylin is abnormally elevated in Type II diabetes patients, accumulated into amylin aggregates, and ultimately causes apoptosis of the beta-cells, and till date, its mechanism remains unclear. Several flavonoids have inhibitory effects on amylin amyloidosis, but its inhibition mechanisms are unknown. Screening a collection of traditional compounds revealed the flavone Chrysin, a potential lead compound. Chrysin inhibits amyloid aggregate formation according to Thioflavin T binding, turbidimetry assay. We report results of molecular interaction analysis of Chrysin with amylin which shows potent binding affinity against amylin. Pharmacokinetics and Drug likeness studies of Chrysin also suggest that it is a potential lead compound. Therefore, Chrysin prevented amylin aggregation.
