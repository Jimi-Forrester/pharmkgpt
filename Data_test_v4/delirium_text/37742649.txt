37742649|t|Criterion Validation of Tau PET Staging Schemes in Relation to Cognitive Outcomes.
37742649|a|BACKGROUND: Utilization of NIA-AA Research Framework requires dichotomization of tau pathology. However, due to the novelty of tau-PET imaging, there is no consensus on methods to categorize scans into "positive" or "negative" (T+ or T-). In response, some tau topographical pathologic staging schemes have been developed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study is to establish criterion validity to support these recently-developed staging schemes. METHODS: Tau-PET data from 465 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (aged 55 to 90) were classified as T+ or T- using decision rules for the Temporal-Occipital Classification (TOC), Simplified TOC (STOC), and Lobar Classification (LC) tau pathologic schemes of Schwarz, and Chen staging scheme. Subsequent dichotomization was analyzed in comparison to memory and learning slope performances, and diagnostic accuracy using actuarial diagnostic methods. RESULTS: Tau positivity was associated with worse cognitive performance across all staging schemes. Cognitive measures were nearly all categorized as having "fair" sensitivity at classifying tau status using TOC, STOC, and LC schemes. Results were comparable between Schwarz schemes, though ease of use and better data fit preferred the STOC and LC schemes. While some evidence was supportive for Chen's scheme, validity lagged behind others-likely due to elevated false positive rates. CONCLUSIONS: Tau-PET staging schemes appear to be valuable for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, tracking, and screening for clinical trials. Their validation provides support as options for tau pathologic dichotomization, as necessary for use of NIA-AA Research Framework. Future research should consider other staging schemes and validation with other outcome benchmarks.
