38223812|t|Gut-joint axis: Oral Probiotic ameliorates Osteoarthritis.
38223812|a|Osteoarthritis (OA) etiology is multifactorial, and its prevalence is growing globally. The Gut microbiota shapes our immune system and impacts all aspects of health and disease. The idea of utilizing probiotics to treat different conditions prevails. Concerning musculoskeletal illness and health, current data lack the link to understand the interactions between the host and microbiome. We report that S. thermophilus, L. pentosus (as probiotics), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) harbour against osteoarthritis in vivo and alleviate IL-1beta induced changes in chondrocytes in vitro. We examined the increased GABA concentration in mice's serum and small intestine content followed by bacterial treatment. The treatment inhibited the catabolism of cartilage and rescued mice joints from degradation. Furthermore, the anabolic markers upregulated and decreased inflammatory markers in mice knee joints and chondrocytes. This study is the first to represent GABA's chondrogenic and chondroprotective effects on joints and human chondrocytes. This data provides a foundation for future studies to elucidate the role of GABA in regulating chondrocyte cell proliferation. These findings opened future horizons to understanding the gut-joint axis and OA treatment. Thus, probiotic/GABA therapy shields OA joints in mice and could at least serve as adjuvant therapy to treat osteoarthritis.
