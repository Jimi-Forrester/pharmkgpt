37199774|a|Gastrodin (Gas) has exhibited protective activity in neurological disorders. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective effect and potential mechanisms of Gas against cognitive impairment via regulating gut microbiota. APPswe/PSEN1dE9 transgenic (APP/PS1) mice were treated intragastrically with Gas for 4 weeks, and then cognitive deficits, deposits of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and phosphorylation of tau were analyzed. The expression levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) pathway-related proteins, such as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), were detected. Meanwhile, gut microbiota composition was evaluated. Our results showed that Gas treatment significantly improved cognitive deficits and Abeta deposition in APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, Gas treatment increased the level of Bcl-2 and decreased level of Bax and ultimately inhibited neuronal apoptosis. Gas treatment markedly increased the expression levels of IGF-1 and CREB in APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, Gas treatment improved abnormal composition and structure of gut microbiota in APP/PS1 mice. These findings revealed that Gas actively participated in regulating the IGF-1 pathway to inhibit neuronal apoptosis via the gut-brain axis and that it can be considered a new therapeutic strategy against Alzheimer's disease.
