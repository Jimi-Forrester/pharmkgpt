33926496|t|The emerging role of beta-secretases in cancer.
33926496|a|BACE1 and BACE2 belong to a class of proteases called beta-secretases involved in ectodomain shedding of different transmembrane substrates. These enzymes have been extensively studied in Alzheimer's disease as they are responsible for the processing of APP in neurotoxic Abeta peptides. These proteases, especially BACE2, are overexpressed in tumors and correlate with poor prognosis. Recently, different research groups tried to address the role of BACE1 and 2 in cancer development and progression. In this review, we summarize the latest findings on beta-secretases in cancer, highlighting the mechanisms that build the rationale to propose inhibitors of these proteins as a new line of treatment for different tumor types.
