36188259|t|Use of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography/Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry for Structural Characterization of Bioactive Compounds in the Olive Root Bark and Wood of Chemlali Cultivar.
36188259|a|This report aims to provide complete knowledge on the polyphenol composition and biological activities of the olive tree. The extraction of the root bark and wood of Olea europaea. L (Chemlali cultivar) was realized by solid-liquid ethanolic extraction, whose analysis was conducted via high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with photodiode array detection and mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-DAD and MS/MS). Moreover, radical scavenging and antibacterial activities were determined. The results present a total of 14 phenolic compounds belonging mainly to secoiridoid and flavonoid subclasses. Oleuropein was found to be the most abundant compound at an amount of up to 7000 mg/kg followed by ligstroside and oleuropein derivatives. In addition, we found oleocanthal at a great amount (2115 mg/kg). Higher individual polyphenolic concentrations were recorded in root wood extracts compared to bark ones, except for the flavonoid group. Likewise, the total phenolic compound contents increased in the olive root wood. This trend was reflected in biological activities. In fact, root wood extracts exert more important antioxidant and antibacterial activities than bark extracts due to their high bioactive compounds.
