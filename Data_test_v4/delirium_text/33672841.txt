33672841|t|Study of Resveratrol's Interaction with Planar Lipid Models: Insights into Its Location in Lipid Bilayers.
33672841|a|Resveratrol, a polyphenolic molecule found in edible fruits and vegetables, shows a wide range of beneficial effects on human health, including anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and anti-aging properties. Due to its poor water solubility and high liposome-water partition coefficient, the biomembrane seems to be the main target of resveratrol, although the mode of interaction with membrane lipids and its location within the cell membrane are still unclear. In this study, using electrophysiological measurements, we study the interaction of resveratrol with planar lipid membranes (PLMs) of different composition. We found that resveratrol incorporates into palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and POPC:Ch PLMs and forms conductive units unlike those found in dioleoyl-phosphatidylserine (DOPS):dioleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) PLMs. The variation of the biophysical parameters of PLMs in the presence of resveratrol provides information on its location within a lipid double layer, thus contributing to an understanding of its mechanism of action.
