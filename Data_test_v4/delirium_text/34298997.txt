34298997|t|Proteomics of Multiple Sclerosis: Inherent Issues in Defining the Pathoetiology and Identifying (Early) Biomarkers.
34298997|a|Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the human central nervous system having an unconfirmed pathoetiology. Although animal models are used to mimic the pathology and clinical symptoms, no single model successfully replicates the full complexity of MS from its initial clinical identification through disease progression. Most importantly, a lack of preclinical biomarkers is hampering the earliest possible diagnosis and treatment. Notably, the development of rationally targeted therapeutics enabling pre-emptive treatment to halt the disease is also delayed without such biomarkers. Using literature mining and bioinformatic analyses, this review assessed the available proteomic studies of MS patients and animal models to discern (1) whether the models effectively mimic MS; and (2) whether reasonable biomarker candidates have been identified. The implication and necessity of assessing proteoforms and the critical importance of this to identifying rational biomarkers are discussed. Moreover, the challenges of using different proteomic analytical approaches and biological samples are also addressed.
