31325011|t|Structure and Function of Alzheimer's Amyloid betaeta Proteins from Monomer to Fibrils: A Mini Review.
31325011|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, that affects millions of people worldwide. According to the widely accepted amyloid cascade hypothesis, misfolding and aggregation of Abeta peptides is the principal cause of Alzheimer's disease. In the present mini-review, we have discussed the different structures of Abeta protein from monomer to fibrils and their arrangement in different symmetries. We have highlighted the critical amino acid residue that plays a crucial role in the early stage misfolding of Abeta monomers, Abeta fibrils arrangement in different symmetries, the elongation process and Abeta protein interaction with the membrane. We have further discussed the antibodies that are currently in clinical trial phase III for Alzheimer's disease.
