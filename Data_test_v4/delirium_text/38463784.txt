38463784|a|Background: Lung cancer metastasis to the brain presents significant clinical challenges. Therefore, elucidating its underlying mechanisms and characterizing its transcriptomic landscape is essential for developing therapeutic interventions. Methods: We analyzed two distinct single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of lung cancer metastasis to analyze the evolutionary trajectory of brain metastatic tumors. In addition, a systematic comparison of cell-cell interaction between tumor cells and lymphocytes was conducted within primary and brain metastatic tumors. Results: The brain metastatic tumors showed greater transcriptomic changes (reflected by a higher pseudotime) than tumors in the lymph nodes and primary tumors. Furthermore, our investigation has not only revealed specific shared ligand-receptor pairs in both mLN and mBrain, exemplified by the interaction between SPP1 and CD99 in T cells, but has also unveiled a diverse array of ligand-receptor pairs exclusive to the mBrain. Notably, this includes distinctive pairs such as APP and IL1 observed specifically in myeloid cells. Conclusion: The distinct microenvironment in the brain may influence the observed transcriptomic changes in tumors, emphasizing the significance of the specific environment in determining tumor behavior and therapeutic response.
