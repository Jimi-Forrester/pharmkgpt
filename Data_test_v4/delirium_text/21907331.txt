21907331|t|Caffeine induces beneficial changes in PKA signaling and JNK and ERK activities in the striatum and cortex of Alzheimer's transgenic mice.
21907331|a|Caffeine intake has been associated with a lower incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in humans. In AD mouse models, caffeine significantly decreases senile plaques and amyloid beta (Abeta) levels while also protecting against or reversing cognitive impairment. To understand the mechanism(s) underlying the protective effects of caffeine against AD pathology, we investigated the effects of a two-week treatment with caffeine (3mg/day) in transgenic (APPswe) mice and non-transgenic (NT) mice on signaling factors involved in neuronal plasticity and survival. We evaluated cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), phospho-cyclic AMP response-element binding protein (phospho-CREB), and the pro-apoptotic protein kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (phospho-ERK) and phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (phospho-JNK) in the striatum and frontal cortex of caffeine-treated mice. In the striatum, APPswe control mice exhibited a significant decrease in phospho-CREB, as well as significant increases in phospho-JNK and phospho-ERK in comparison to NT mice. Caffeine treatment stimulated PKA activity, increased phospho-CREB levels, and decreased phospho-JNK and phospho-ERK expression in the striatum of APPswe mice, all of which are thought to be beneficial changes for brain function. Even caffeine-treated NT mice exhibited some of these changes in striatum. In the frontal cortex, caffeine did not significantly increase phospho-CREB and PKA activity, but significantly reduced phospho-JNK and phospho-ERK expression in both APPswe and NT mice. These results suggest that caffeine shifts the balance between neurodegeneration and neuronal survival toward the stimulation of pro-survival cascades and inhibition of pro-apoptotic pathways in the striatum and/or cortex, which may contribute to its beneficial effects against AD.
