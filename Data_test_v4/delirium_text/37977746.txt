37977746|t|Geriatric Psychiatric Emergencies.
37977746|a|Geriatric patients, those 65 years of age and older, often experience psychiatric symptoms or changes in mentation as a manifestation of an organic illness. It is crucial to recognize and treat delirium in these patients as it is often under-recognized and associated with significant morbidity. Iatrogenic causes of altered mentation or delirium due to medication adverse reactions are common. Treatment of the underlying cause, creating an environment conducive to orientation, and minimizing agitation and discomfort are first-line interventions. Antipsychotics are first-line pharmacologic interventions if needed to preserve patient safety.
