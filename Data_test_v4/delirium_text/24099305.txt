24099305|t|The BRICHOS domain, amyloid fibril formation, and their relationship.
24099305|a|Amyloid diseases are defined by tissue deposition of insoluble, fibrillar beta-sheet polymers of specific proteins, but it appears that toxic oligomeric species rather than the fibrils are the main cause of tissue degeneration. Many proteins can form amyloid-like fibrils in vitro, but only ~30 proteins have been found to cause mammalian amyloid disease, suggesting that physiological mechanisms that protect against amyloid formation exist. The transmembrane region of lung surfactant protein C precursor (proSP-C) forms amyloid-like fibrils in vitro, and SP-C amyloid has been found in lung tissue from patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD). ProSP-C contains a BRICHOS domain, in which many ILD-associated mutations are localized, and the BRICHOS domain can prevent SP-C from forming amyloid-like fibrils. Recent data suggest that recombinant BRICHOS domains from proSP-C and Bri2 (associated with familial dementia and amyloid formation) interact with peptides with a strong propensity to form beta-sheet structures, including amyloid beta-peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease. Such interactions efficiently delay formation of fibrils and oligomers. The BRICHOS domain is defined at the sequence level and is found in ~10 distantly related proprotein families. These have widely different or unknown functions, but several of the proteins are associated with human disease. Structural modeling of various BRICHOS domains, based on the X-ray structure of the proSP-C BRICHOS domain, identifies a conserved region that is structurally complementary to the beta-sheet- and/or amyloid-prone regions in the BRICHOS domain-containing proproteins. These observations make the BRICHOS domain the first example of a chaperone-like domain with specificity for beta-prone regions.
