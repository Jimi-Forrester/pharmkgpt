30974029|t|Tannic acid as a natural antioxidant compound: Discovery of a potent metabolic enzyme inhibitor for a new therapeutic approach in diabetes and Alzheimer's disease.
30974029|a|Multiple studies have been recorded on the synthesis and design of multi-aim anti-Alzheimer molecules. Using dual butyrylcholinesterase/acetylcholinesterase inhibitor molecules has attracted more interest in the therapy for Alzheimer's disease. In this study, a tannic acid compound showed excellent inhibitory effects against acetylcholine esterase (AChE), alpha-glycosidase, alpha-amylase, and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). IC50 values of tannic acid obtained 11.9 nM against alpha-glycosidase and 3.3 nM against alpha-amylase, respectively. In contrast, Ki values were found of 50.96 +- 2.18 microM against AChE and 53.17 +- 4.47 microM against BChE. alpha-Glycosidase inhibitor compounds can be utilized as a novel group of antidiabetic drugs. By competitively decreasing glycosidase activity, these inhibitor molecules help to hamper the fast breakdown of sugar molecules and thereby control the blood sugar level.
