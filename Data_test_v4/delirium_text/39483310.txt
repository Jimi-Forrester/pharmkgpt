39483310|t|Outcomes of Peripheral Nerve Blocks in Elderly Patients with Fragility Hip Fractures in the Philippine General Hospital: A 6-month Prospective Study.
39483310|a|Background and Objective: Hip fractures among the elderly continue to be a serious public health concern. Hip fractures result in extremely painful injuries and given the higher risk of the elderly for complications, managing pain in this population can be challenging. This study aimed to describe the outcomes of peripheral nerve blocks on elderly patients with fragility hip fractures who will undergo elective or emergency hip surgery. Methods: A single-center prospective cohort study was conducted at the Philippine General Hospital from May 2022 to November 2022. Patients included were aged 60 years old and above with fragility hip fracture, for elective or emergency hip surgery, and with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Score 1-3. Patients' baseline profile, intraoperative characteristics, and postoperative outcomes were collected using a standard data collection form. The data collector was blinded to the type of block performed. Results: A total of 29 patients who underwent hip surgery were included in the study. Most (65.5%) had Subarachnoid block + Peripheral Nerve Block (SAB+PNB) while 24.1% had General Anesthesia + Peripheral Nerve Block (GA+PNB) and 10.3% had no Peripheral Nerve Block (PNB). The median Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) 30 minutes post block was similar (p=0.977) in those who had PNB blocks (GA+PNB = 0, SAB+PNB = 0). The median NRS at rest during Postoperative day 1 (POD1) was significantly highest (p=0.023) in the No PNB group (3) than in both GA+PNB (0) and SAB+PNB (0). In contrast, the median NRS at rest during POD2 was similar (p=0.713) in the three groups (GA+PNB = 0, SAB+PNB = 0, No PNB = 0). The median NRS at motion during POD1 was significantly highest (p=0.008) in the No PNB group (6) than in both GA+PNB (0) and SAB+PNB (1). Also, the median NRS at motion during POD2 was significantly highest (p=0.009) in No PNB group (4) than in both GA+PNB (0) and SAB+PNB (1). Median Morphine Milligram Equivalent (MME) of postoperative opioid was significantly higher in the No PNB group among the three groups (p=0.047). The median satisfaction score (p=0.210), median delirium score at POD2 (p=0.993), and median length of hospitalization (p=0.173) were all similar in the three groups. Conclusion: Peripheral nerve block is effective in elderly patients undergoing surgery for fragility hip fractures. It results in lower pain scores and can be administered with equal effectiveness either with general anesthesia or with subarachnoid block. Mortality rate, incidence of delirium, and hospital length of stay did not vary between those with and without peripheral nerve block.
