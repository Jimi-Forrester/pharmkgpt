1679280|a|We investigated the immune-associated antigens of peripheral lymphocytes from 13 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 13 age-matched healthy control subjects using two-color analysis with flow cytometry. Four ratios of immune-related antigens, T/B lymphocytes, CD4/CD8, CD4/CD45R and CD4/HLA-DR, were compared for the AD and control groups. The T/B and CD4/CD8 ratios did not differ between the groups, the ratio of CD4+CD45R+ subset in the AD group was lower than the ratio in the control group, and the ratios of CD4+ CD45R- and CD4+HLA-DR+ subsets in the AD group were significantly higher. Further, in the AD group, the CD4+ CD45R+/CD4+ ratio was lower and the CD4+ CD45R- CD4+ ratio was higher than in the control group.
