32954297|t|Longitudinal evaluation of the natural history of amyloid-beta in plasma and brain.
32954297|a|Plasma amyloid-beta peptide concentration has recently been shown to have high accuracy to predict amyloid-beta plaque burden in the brain. These amyloid-beta plasma markers will allow wider screening of the population and simplify and reduce screening costs for therapeutic trials in Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to determine how longitudinal changes in blood amyloid-beta track with changes in brain amyloid-beta. Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle study participants with a minimum of two assessments were evaluated (111 cognitively normal, 7 mild cognitively impaired, 15 participants with Alzheimer's disease). Amyloid-beta burden in the brain was evaluated through PET and was expressed in Centiloids. Total protein amyloid-beta 42/40 plasma ratios were determined using ABtest  assays. We applied our method for obtaining natural history trajectories from short term data to measures of total protein amyloid-beta 42/40 plasma ratios and PET amyloid-beta. The natural history trajectory of total protein amyloid-beta 42/40 plasma ratios appears to approximately mirror that of PET amyloid-beta, with both spanning decades. Rates of change of 7.9% and 8.8%, were observed for total protein amyloid-beta 42/40 plasma ratios and PET amyloid-beta, respectively. The trajectory of plasma amyloid-beta preceded that of brain amyloid-beta by a median value of 6 years (significant at 88% confidence interval). These findings, showing the tight association between changes in plasma and brain amyloid-beta, support the use of plasma total protein amyloid-beta 42/40 plasma ratios as a surrogate marker of brain amyloid-beta. Also, that plasma total protein amyloid-beta 42/40 plasma ratios has potential utility in monitoring trial participants, and as an outcome measure.
