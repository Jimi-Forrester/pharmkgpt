37790313|a|Background : Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and its incidence increases with age. While acute therapies for stroke are currently limited to intravenous thrombolytics and endovascular thrombectomy, recent studies have implicated an important role for the gut microbiome in post-stroke neuroinflammation. After stroke, several immuno-regulatory pathways, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway, become activated. AHR is a master regulatory pathway that mediates neuroinflammation. Among various cell types, microglia (MG), as the resident immune cells of the brain, play a vital role in regulating post-stroke neuroinflammation and antigen presentation. Activation of AHR is dependent on a dynamic balance between host-derived and microbiota-derived ligands. While previous studies have shown that activation of MG AHR by host-derived ligands, such as kynurenine, is detrimental after stroke, the effects of post-stroke changes in microbiota-derived ligands of AHR, such as indoles, is unknown. Our study builds on the concept that differential activation of MG AHR by host-derived versus microbiome-derived metabolites affects outcomes after ischemic stroke. We examined the link between stroke-induced dysbiosis and loss of essential microbiota-derived AHR ligands. We hypothesize that restoring the balance between host-derived (kynurenine) and microbiota-derived (indoles) ligands of AHR is beneficial after stroke, offering a new potential avenue for therapeutic intervention in post-stroke neuroinflammation. Method : We performed immunohistochemical analysis of brain samples from stroke patients to assess MG AHR expression after stroke. We used metabolomics analysis of plasma samples from stroke and non-stroke control patients with matched comorbidities to determine the levels of indole-based AHR ligands after stroke. We performed transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in aged (18 months) wild-type (WT) and germ-free (GF) mice to investigate the effects of post-stroke treatment with microbiota-derived indoles on outcome. To generate our results, we employed a range of methodologies, including flow cytometry, metabolomics, and 16S microbiome sequencing. Results : We found that MG AHR expression is increased in human brain after stroke and after ex vivo oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R). Microbiota-derived ligands of AHR are decreased in the human plasma at 24 hours after ischemic stroke. Kynurenine and indoles exhibited differential effects on aged WT MG survival after ex vivo OGD/R. We found that specific indole-based ligands of AHR (indole-3-propionic acid and indole-3-aldehyde) were absent in GF mice, thus their production depends on the presence of a functional gut microbiota. Additionally, a time-dependent decrease in the concentration of these indole-based AHR ligands occurred in the brain within the first 24 hours after stroke in aged WT mice. Post-stroke treatment of GF mice with a cocktail of microbiota-derived indole-based ligands of AHR regulated MG-mediated neuroinflammation and molecules involved in antigen presentation (increased CD80, MHC-II, and CD11b). Post-stroke treatment of aged WT mice with microbiota-derived indole-based ligands of AHR reduced both infarct volume and neurological deficits at 24 hours. Conclusion : Our novel findings provide compelling evidence that the restoration of a well-balanced pool of host-derived kynurenine-based and microbiota-derived indole-based ligands of AHR holds considerable therapeutic potential for the treatment of ischemic stroke.
