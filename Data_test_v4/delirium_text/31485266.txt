Herein we hypothesized that the BMSCs-derived exosomes containing overexpressed miR-138-5p could protect the astrocytes following IS involved with lipocalin 2 (LCN2). METHODS: The differentially expressed gene related to IS was initially identified by bioinformatics analysis. miR-138-5p was predicted to regulate LCN2. The expression of miR-138-5p and LCN2 was altered in the oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced astrocytes. Furthermore, the cell behaviors and inflammatory responses were evaluated both in astrocytes alone and astrocytes co-cultured with exosomes derived from BMSCs overexpressing miR-138-5p to explore the involvement of miR-138-5p and LCN2 in IS. Besides, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model was established to explore the effect of BMSCs-derived exosomal miR-138-5p in IS in vivo. RESULTS: LCN2 was highly expressed in IS. Besides, LCN2 was a target gene of miR-138-5p. BMSCs-derived exosomes could be endocytosed by astrocytes via co-culture. Overexpression of miR-138-5p promoted the proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of astrocytes injured by OGD, accompanied by the reduced expression of inflammatory factors, which was achieved by down-regulating LCN2. More importantly, BMSCs delivered miR-138-5p to the astrocytes via exosomes and BMSCs-derived exosomal miR-138-5p alleviated neuron injury in IS mice. CONCLUSION: BMSCs-derived exosomal miR-138-5p reduces neurological impairment by promoting proliferation and inhibiting inflammatory responses of astrocytes following IS by targeting LCN2, which may provide a novel target for IS treatment.
