31685113|a|Several hospital interventions increase patient risk for developing delirium, including mechanical ventilation, monitoring devices, medication interactions, urinary catheters, interrupted sleep cycles, and use of physical restraints. Developing delirium leads to increased length of hospital stay, likelihood of requiring long-term care services after discharge, and risk of mortality following hospitalization. Longer periods of delirium worsen cognition, executive functioning, ability to complete activities of daily living, and sensorimotor functioning. Routine screening and early recognition prevent or reduce the long-term health and financial effects of delirium. The Confusion Assessment Method is a useable tool for screening noncritically ill adult patients for delirium.
