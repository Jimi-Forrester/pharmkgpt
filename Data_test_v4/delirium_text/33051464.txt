33051464|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is marked by progressive cognitive decline, deposition of misfolded amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Recently, microglial training has emerged as an important contributor to neurological diseases, which augments the subsequent inflammation. However, how it affects the pathology of AD remains unknown. Here, using a mouse model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD) induced by streptozotocin injection, we demonstrated that microglial training exacerbated Abeta accumulation, neuronal loss, and cognitive impairment. In addition, we injected MCC950 to inhibit NLRP3 activation and used an inducible Cre recombinase to delete the NLRP3 gene in microglia. Inhibition or depletion of microglial NLRP3 could protect against the pathologies of SAD and abolish the effects of microglial training. Our results identified microglial training as an important modifier of neuropathology in SAD and demonstrated that activation of NLRP3 inflammasome contributed to the pathologies and microglial training in SAD. Therefore, NLRP3 could be a potential therapeutic target for SAD treatment.
