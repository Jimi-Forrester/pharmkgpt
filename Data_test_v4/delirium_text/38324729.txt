38324729|a|BACKGROUND: Anesthesia/surgery accelerate AD pathology and cause memory deficits in animal models, yet we lack prospective data comparing CSF AD-related biomarker and cognitive trajectories in older adults who underwent surgery versus those who have not. Thus, the objective here was to better understand whether anesthesia/surgery contribute to cognitive decline or an acceleration of AD-related pathology in older adults. METHODS: We enrolled 140 patients age >= 60 undergoing major non-neurologic surgery and 51 nonsurgical controls via strata-based matching on age, sex, and years of education. CSF Abeta42, tau, and p-tau-181p levels and cognitive function were measured before and after surgery, and at the same time intervals in controls. RESULTS: The groups were well-matched on 25 of 31 baseline characteristics. There was no effect of group or interaction of group by time for baseline to 24-hr or 6-week postoperative changes in CSF Abeta, tau, or p-tau levels, or tau/Abeta or p-tau/Abeta ratios (Bonferroni p>0.05 for all) and no difference between groups in these CSF markers at 1-year (p>0.05 for all). Nonsurgical controls did not differ from surgical patients in baseline cognition (mean difference [95% CI]: 0.19 [-0.06, 0.43], p=0.132), yet had greater cognitive decline than the surgical patients 1-year later (beta [95% CI]: -0.31 [-0.45, -0.17], p < 0.001) even when controlling for baseline differences between groups. However, there was no difference between non-surgical and surgical groups in 1-year postoperative cognitive change in models which used imputation or inverse probability weighting for cognitive data to account for loss to follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Over a 1-year time period, as compared to matched non-surgical controls, we found no evidence that older patients who underwent anesthesia and non-cardiac, non-neurologic surgery had accelerated CSF AD-related biomarker (tau, p-tau, and Abeta) changes or greater cognitive decline.
