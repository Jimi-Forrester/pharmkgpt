37706054|t|A case of diphenhydramine intoxication showing prolonged false positive tricyclic antidepressant in the urine assay.
37706054|a|Background: The urine immunochromatographic assay is a useful screening tool for patients suspected of acute drug intoxication in emergency conditions. Diphenhydramine intoxication shows symptoms similar to those of tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) intoxication. Case presentation: We examined a case of diphenhydramine intoxication showing cerebellar ataxia and prolonged false positive results for TCA in the urine. The urine TCA test showed persistently positive results even 60 h after the patient's initial drug screening. We observed negative conversion 90 h after the initial drug screening. Discussion: Considering the similarities of clinical symptoms between diphenhydramine and TCA intoxication, emergency physicians should consider the possibility of cross-reactivity in the diagnosis of a patient with unknown acute drug intoxication showing positive results of TCA immunochromatographic assay in the urine. Conclusion: The present case suggests that diphenhydramine overdose may cause cerebellar ataxia and show prolonged cross-reactivity as TCA in the urine.
