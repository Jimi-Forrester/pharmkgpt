34660839|t|Remote Assessment of Pediatric Patients with Daytime Sleepiness and Healthy Controls: A Pilot Study of Feasibility and Reliability.
34660839|a|We assessed the reliability of cognitive testing for children and adolescents ages 8 to 19 years of age with narcolepsy or subjective daytime sleepiness compared to healthy controls. Forty-six participants took part in the study (n = 18 narcolepsy type 1, n = 6 subjective daytime sleepiness, and n = 22 healthy controls). Participants completed verbal (vocabulary testing) and non-verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) tasks (block design, matrix reasoning) from the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence- Second Edition (WASI-II) in-person or remotely through a HIPAA compliant telehealth platform with conditions counterbalanced. We found that vocabulary T-scores showed good reliability with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.85) between remote and in-person testing conditions. Matrix Reasoning T-scores showed moderate reliability (ICC 0.69, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.90) and Block Design T-scores was poor between testing conditions. Overall, the results of this pilot study support the feasibility and reliability of verbal and non-verbal IQ scores collected by telehealth.
