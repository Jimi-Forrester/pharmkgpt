36430146|t|Regulation of Cholesterol Metabolism by Phytochemicals Derived from Algae and Edible Mushrooms in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.
36430146|a|Cholesterol synthesis occurs in almost all cells, but mainly in hepatocytes in the liver. Cholesterol is garnering increasing attention for its central role in various metabolic diseases. In addition, cholesterol is one of the most essential elements for cells as both a structural source and a player participating in various metabolic pathways. Accurate regulation of cholesterol is necessary for the proper metabolism of fats in the body. Disturbances in cholesterol homeostasis have been linked to various metabolic diseases, such as hyperlipidemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). For many years, the use of synthetic chemical drugs has been effective against many health conditions. Furthermore, from ancient to modern times, various plant-based drugs have been considered local medicines, playing important roles in human health. Phytochemicals are bioactive natural compounds that are derived from medicinal plants, fruit, vegetables, roots, leaves, and flowers and are used to treat a variety of diseases. They include flavonoids, carotenoids, polyphenols, polysaccharides, vitamins, and more. Many of these compounds have been proven to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiobesity and antihypercholesteremic activity. The multifaceted role of phytochemicals may provide health benefits to humans with regard to the treatment and control of cholesterol metabolism and the diseases associated with this disorder, such as NAFLD. In recent years, global environmental climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, the current war in Europe, and other conflicts have threatened food security and human nutrition worldwide. This further emphasizes the urgent need for sustainable sources of functional phytochemicals to be included in the food industry and dietary habits. This review summarizes the latest findings on selected phytochemicals from sustainable sources-algae and edible mushrooms-that affect the synthesis and metabolism of cholesterol and improve or prevent NAFLD.
