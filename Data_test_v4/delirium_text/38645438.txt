38645438|a|Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by skin and internal organ fibrosis and obliterative vasculopathy. Few effective treatments are currently available for fibrosis in SSc, therefore, demand persists for novel therapies. Although use of Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) has been reported to improve blood circulation and alleviate liver and lung fibrosis, its effect on skin fibrosis in SSc remains unclear. In this study, the effects and underlying mechanisms of GBE on skin fibrosis in bleomycin (BLM)-induced mouse model of SSc was investigated. GBE significantly reduced dermal thickness and protein levels of profibrotic factors in the BLM-induced SSc mouse model. Moreover, GBE inhibited the gene expression of profibrotic factors, such as COL1A1, alpha-SMA, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), in fibroblasts by suppressing transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling. Furthermore, GBE inhibited the transdifferentiation of adipocytes into myofibroblasts. Thus, our findings suggest that GBE is a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of SSc.
