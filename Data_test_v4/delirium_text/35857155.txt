35857155|t|Dementia, a Polypharmaceutical Phenomenon: The Intimate Combinations of Dementia Drugs in Brazil.
35857155|a|It is commonplace to state that dementia is a complex condition. Such complexity involves the limits between pathological and normal aging, diagnosis with no simple organic causation, and the use of psychiatric medication that does not cure but generates hope to alleviate symptoms such as forgetfulness and delirium. Based on an ethnography of one year and a half (2017-2018) in a Brazilian metropolis, within a Public Geriatric center and the households of three families, I argue that dementia, more than a complex condition, is a generator of drug complexity. Following Stefan Ecks' reflections on multimorbidity and polyiatrogenesis and Karen Barad's understanding of intra-action, I discuss the polypharmacy present in most cases of dementia that I have known. Considering the complicated relations of medications with themselves and with time and places, I conclude that dementia should be seen a polypharmaceutical phenomenon.
