29074346|a|Developmental lead (Pb) exposure is linked to neurological health issues. Results from non-human primate and rodent studies suggest detrimental effects of an early life Pb exposure, showing transcriptional disturbances and pathological evidence of Alzheimer's disease in the adult animal brain. To elucidate the impacts of an embryonic Pb exposure on the adult brain, transcriptomic analysis was completed on the brain of zebrafish aged 12months exposed to a control treatment or to an embryonic 100mug/L Pb exposure by sex. In the adult female zebrafish brain, significant changes in expression profiles occurred in a number of genes involved in neurological disease and nervous system development and function. On the other hand, in adult males, a number of genes with significant expression alterations were found to be associated with cancer and tumors. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) was also indicated as an upstream regulator of observed gene expression changes. Western blot analysis confirmed activation of p38 MAPK in the form of phosphorylated p38 MAPK in the male zebrafish brain. In addition, we compared transcriptomic changes observed in this study to a previous study with an embryonic exposure of 10mug/L Pb by sex, showing unique sets of genes dependent on Pb concentration. Overall, these results show sex-specific and concentration-dependent disturbances of global gene expression patterns in the brain of adult zebrafish exposed to Pb during embryogenesis.
