39570447|a|BACKGROUND: 18F-Florbetaben amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease, typically involving a 20 min acquisition. However, maintaining such prolonged scans can be challenging in some cases. This study explores the diagnostic impact and feasibility of reducing scan durations by comparing quantitative measures between shortened and standard scans. Additionally, we identified the optimal Centiloid threshold to distinguish between positive and negative amyloid results. RESULTS: We analyzed 307 PET scans from our memory clinic, each followed up for a minimum of two years. The scans, conducted 90 to 110 min after approximately 300 MBq of 18F-Florbetaben injection, were categorized into four sets of 5 min durations: 5, 10, 15, and 20 min. Nuclear medicine physicians validated and rated each scan as either amyloid-positive or negative. For quantitative assessments, we employed the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and Centiloid scales, comparing total SUVR and Centiloid values across five subregions (global, frontal, posterior cingulate-precuneus, lateral temporal, and parietal) using Bland-Altman analysis. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized to develop optimal Centiloid thresholds. Comparing the images at 5, 10, 15, and 20 min images, SUVR and Centiloid values gradually increased with prolonged scan times. The mean SUVR difference between 5 and 20 min was 0.03 for the amyloid-positive and 0.01 for the amyloid-negative groups; Centiloid differences were 4.60 and 2.38, respectively. Additionally, no significant variation was observed in total SUVR and Centiloid values among the durations across all subregions in positive and negative groups (all p > 0.1). ROC analysis indicated that a Centiloid threshold of 21.86 at 5 min provided optimal agreement with visual assessments (AUC = 0.985, sensitivity = 0.950, specificity = 0.972), especially using the global area. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that 5 min image scans with an optimal threshold of CL = 21.86 exhibited minimal bias in SUVR and Centiloid values compared to longer scans (10, 15, and 20 min). Our findings suggest that shorter scan times are a viable and effective option for brain amyloid PET imaging in clinical settings.
