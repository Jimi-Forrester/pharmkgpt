34758996|a|INTRODUCTION: Inhaled volatile anaesthetics have a long tradition of use as hypnotic agents in operating rooms and are gaining traction as sedatives in intensive care units (ICUs). However, uptake is impeded by low familiarity with volatiles, unique equipment and education needs. Inhaled anaesthetics are often reserved in ICUs as therapies for refractory and life threatening status asthmaticus, status epilepticus, high and difficult sedation need scenarios given they possess unique pharmacological properties to manage these medical conditions while providing sedation to acutely ill patients. The objective of this systematic review is to collate evidence regarding the efficacy, safety and feasibility of volatile anaesthetics in adult and paediatric ICU patients for these three emergency conditions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a systematic review of the primary studies in adult and paediatric ICU patients with status asthmaticus, status epilepticus and high/difficult sedation needs. We will include observational and interventional studies published from 1970 to 2021 in English or French investigating patients who have received a volatile inhalational agent for the above indications. We will evaluate the efficacy, safety, feasibility and implementation barriers for the volatile anaesthetics for each of three specified indications. Included studies will not be limited by necessity of a comparator arm. We will also evaluate clinical characteristics, patient demographics and provider attitudes towards volatile anaesthetic administration in defined critical care scenarios. Data will be extracted and analysed across these domains. The databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Science Citation Index as well as the Cochrane Central Controlled Trials Register will be queried with our search strategy.Descriptive and statistical analysis will be employed where appropriate. Data extraction and quality assessment will be performed in duplicate using a standardised tool. A narrative approach and statistical analyses will be used to describe patient characteristics, volatile efficacy, safety concerns, technical administration, attitudes towards administration and other implementation barriers. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethics board approval will be necessary for this systematic review. This research is independently funded. Results will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and conference presentation. PROSPERO NUMBER: CRD42021233083.
