37886595|t|Therapeutic Intervention of Neuroinflammatory Alzheimer Disease Model by Inhibition of Classical Complement Pathway with the Use of Anti-C1r Loaded Exosomes.
37886595|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease associated with memory decline, cognitive impairment, amyloid plaque formation and tau tangles. Neuroinflammation has been shown to be a precursor to apparent amyloid plaque accumulation and subsequent synaptic loss and cognitive decline. In this study, the ability of a novel, small molecule, T-ALZ01, to inhibit neuroinflammatory processes was analyzed. T-ALZ01, an inhibitor of complement component C1r, demonstrated a significant reduction in the levels of the inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in vitro. An LPS-induced animal model, whereby animals were injected intraperitoneally with 0.5 mg/kg LPS, was used to analyze the effect of T-ALZ01 on neuroinflammation in vivo. Moreover, exosomes (nanosized, endogenous extracellular vehicles) were used as drug delivery vehicles to facilitate intranasal administration of T-ALZ01 across the blood-brain barrier. T-ALZ01 demonstrated significant reduction in degenerating neurons and the activation of resident microglia and astrocytes, as well as inflammatory markers in vivo. This study demonstrates a significant use of small molecule complement inhibitors via exosome drug delivery as a possible therapeutic in disorders characterized by neuroinflammation, such AD.
