32739011|a|Evidence increasingly suggests that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). These diseases share many pathological processes, including oxidative stress, local inflammation/neuroinflammation and chronic, low-grade (systemic) inflammation, which are exacerbated by aging, a common risk factor for T2DM and NDDs. Here, we focus on the link between chronic inflammation driven by peripheral metabolic disease and how this may impact neurodegeneration in AD and PD. We review the relationship between these common pathological processes in AD and PD from the perspective of the "pro-inflammatory" signaling of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-, leucine-rich repeat- (LRR)-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome complex. Since the need for effective disease-modifying therapies in T2DM, AD and PD is significant, the relationship between these diseases is important as a positive clinical impact on one may benefit the others. We briefly consider how novel strategies may target neuro-inflammation and provide potential therapies for AD and PD.
