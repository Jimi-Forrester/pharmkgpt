38361911|t|American Delirium Society 2022 Year in Review: Highlighting the Year's Most Impactful Delirium Research.
38361911|a|Background: Since 2015, the American Delirium Society (ADS) Research Committee has conducted an annual survey of the delirium literature for presentation in its year-in-review session. Our objectives were to describe the review process used for the 2021-2022 and to summarise the selected publications. Methods: Each member of the ADS Research Committee nominated up to 6 publications considered to be the most impactful primary delirium research published from September 1, 2021, to July 31, 2022. The 24 nominated studies were divided into three categories balanced by number of articles: medical intervention trials, non-medical intervention trials, and delirium detection/basic science studies. Each ADS Research Committee member ranked all studies in their assigned category for methodological rigor and for impact, each being scored as 0-10, for a total score of 0-20. It was decided a priori to select the top three highest-scoring articles in each category for presentation, with ties adjudicated by Committee consensus. Results: Nineteen Research Committee members served as reviewers. Scores for each category were similar: medical interventions mean (standard deviation) 12.8 (1.1), non-medical interventions 13.1 (1.1), and detection/basic science 12.6 (1.0). We summarise the results of the papers presented in the 2022 ADS year-in-review session. Conclusion: The diversity of studies presented for the 2022 ADS year-in-review session illustrates the breadth of the delirium field and the growing number of clinical trials. The dissemination of publications across a broad, diverse array of journals provides further justification of the need for delirium-specific journals.
