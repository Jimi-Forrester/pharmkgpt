39361635|t|Use of Socially Assistive Robots to Improve Outcomes Among Hospitalized Older Adults With Dementia: A Pilot Randomized Trial.
39361635|a|PURPOSE: To examine the use of the PARO robotic pet seal for hospitalized older adults with dementia and compare the effects of PARO use with visits by a human on various outcomes, including physical restraint use, psychotropic medications, bedside sitters, and delirium. METHOD: Complete data for 38 participants were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests. RESULTS: Participants interacting with PARO spent less time in their interactions; however, they received fewer psychotropic medications and had fewer instances of delirium than those who interacted with human visitors only. CONCLUSION: Aspects of hospitalization may limit the time an older adult can sustain attention or be free from interruption; however, short, repeated visits with PARO may affect the development of delirium and decrease use of medications to alter behavior in the hospital setting.
