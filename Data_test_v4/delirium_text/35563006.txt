35563006|t|Role of Polyamine-Induced Dimerization of Antizyme in Its Cellular Functions.
35563006|a|The polyamines, spermine (Spm) and spermidine (Spd), are important for cell growth and function. Their homeostasis is strictly controlled, and a key downregulator of the polyamine pool is the polyamine-inducible protein, antizyme 1 (OAZ1). OAZ1 inhibits polyamine uptake and targets ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate-limiting enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis, for proteasomal degradation. Here we report, for the first time, that polyamines induce dimerization of mouse recombinant full-length OAZ1, forming an (OAZ1)2-Polyamine complex. Dimerization could be modulated by functionally active C-methylated spermidine mimetics (MeSpds) by changing the position of the methyl group along the Spd backbone-2-MeSpd was a poor inducer as opposed to 1-MeSpd, 3-MeSpd, and Spd, which were good inducers. Importantly, the ability of compounds to inhibit polyamine uptake correlated with the efficiency of the (OAZ1)2-Polyamine complex formation. Thus, the (OAZ1)2-Polyamine complex may be needed to inhibit polyamine uptake. The efficiency of polyamine-induced ribosomal +1 frameshifting of OAZ1 mRNA could also be differentially modulated by MeSpds-2-MeSpd was a poor inducer of OAZ1 biosynthesis and hence a poor downregulator of ODC activity unlike the other MeSpds. These findings offer new insight into the OAZ1-mediated regulation of polyamine homeostasis and provide the chemical tools to study it.
