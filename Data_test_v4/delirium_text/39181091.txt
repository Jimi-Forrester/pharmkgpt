39181091|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains of unknown etiology and lacks a cure. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of a novel bithiophene derivative at two doses against AlCl3-induced AD in a rat model. Adult male rats (Rattus norvegicus) were divided into six groups (n=6): Group one consisted of naive animals, group two received bithiophene (1 mg/kg) every other day for 30 days, and groups 3-6 were subjected to AlCl3 (100 mg/kg, equivalent to 20.23 mg Al3+) for 45 consecutive days. Groups four and five received low (0.5 mg/kg) or high (1 mg/kg) doses of bithiophene, respectively. Group six received memantine (20 mg/kg) daily for 30 days. All treatments were administered orally. Aluminum exposure resulted in severe degeneration of both histological and ultrastructural aspects of cells. Administration of the low dose of bithiophene significantly restored the number of CA1 pyramidal cells and the thickness of the stratum granulosum of the dentate gyrus. However, the high dose of bithiophene increased viable CA1 pyramidal cell numbers significantly without restoring the thickness of the stratum granulosum or reducing vacuolization or pyknotic changes. The low dose of bithiophene restored the normal histological and cytological structure of both cortical and hippocampal neurons affected by dementia. Further investigation is required to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the ameliorative effects on Alzheimer's disease-induced deteriorations in the cortex and hippocampus.
