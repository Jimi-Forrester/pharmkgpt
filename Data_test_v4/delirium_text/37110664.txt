37110664|t|Cytotoxicity Profiles and Neuroprotective Properties of the Novel Ifenprodil Analogues as Sigma Ligands.
37110664|a|Neurodegeneration is a slow and progressive loss of neuronal cells or their function in specific regions of the brain or in the peripheral system. Among several causes responsible for the most common neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), cholinergic/dopaminergic pathways, but also some endogenous receptors, are often involved. In this context, sigma 1 receptor (S1R) modulators can be used as neuroprotective and antiamnesic agents. Herein, we describe the identification of novel S1R ligands endowed with antioxidant properties, potentially useful as neuroprotective agents. We also computationally assessed how the most promising compounds might interact with the S1R protein's binding sites. The in silico predicted ADME properties suggested that they could be able to cross the brain-blood-barrier (BBB), and to reach the targets. Finally, the observation that at least two novel ifenprodil analogues (5d and 5i) induce an increase of the mRNA levels of the antioxidant NRF2 and SOD1 genes in SH-SY5Y cells suggests that they might be effective agents for protecting neurons against oxidative damage.
