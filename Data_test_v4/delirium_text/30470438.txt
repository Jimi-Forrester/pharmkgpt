30470438|t|Relationship between long non-coding RNAs and Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review.
30470438|a|Alzheimer disease (AD), is a typical progressive and destructive neurodegenerative disease. It is the leading cause of senile dementia that is mainly represented as neurocognitive symptoms, including progressive memory impairment, cognitive disorder, personality change and language barrier, etc. The pathogeny and nosogenesis of AD have not been clearly explained. AD is characterized by extracellular senile plaques (SP) formed by beta amyloid (Abeta) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles in neuronal cells formed by hyperphosphorylation of tau, as well as the deficiency of neuronal with gliosis. However, the complete spectrum of regulating factors in molecular level that affect the pathogenesis of AD is unclear. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and AD. It is increasingly recognized that lncRNAs is tightly related to the pathogenesis and prevention and cure of AD. In the review, we highlighted the roles of lncRNAs in AD pathways and discussed increasing interest in targeting and regulating lncRNAs for the therapeutics of AD.
