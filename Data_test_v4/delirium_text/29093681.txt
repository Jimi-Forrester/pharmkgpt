29093681|t|Quantitative and Systems Pharmacology 3. Network-Based Identification of New Targets for Natural Products Enables Potential Uses in Aging-Associated Disorders.
29093681|a|Aging that refers the accumulation of genetic and physiology changes in cells and tissues over a lifetime has been shown a high risk of developing various complex diseases, such as neurodegenerative disease, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Over the past several decades, natural products have been demonstrated as anti-aging interveners via extending lifespan and preventing aging-associated disorders. In this study, we developed an integrated systems pharmacology infrastructure to uncover new indications for aging-associated disorders by natural products. Specifically, we incorporated 411 high-quality aging-associated human genes or human-orthologous genes from mus musculus (MM), saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC), caenorhabditis elegans (CE), and drosophila melanogaster (DM). We constructed a global drug-target network of natural products by integrating both experimental and computationally predicted drug-target interactions (DTI). We further built the statistical network models for identification of new anti-aging indications of natural products through integration of the curated aging-associated genes and drug-target network of natural products. High accuracy was achieved on the network models. We showcased several network-predicted anti-aging indications of four typical natural products (caffeic acid, metformin, myricetin, and resveratrol) with new mechanism-of-actions. In summary, this study offers a powerful systems pharmacology infrastructure to identify natural products for treatment of aging-associated disorders.
