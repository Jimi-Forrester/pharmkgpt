35884143|t|Why We May Need Higher Doses of Beta-Lactam Antibiotics: Introducing the 'Maximum Tolerable Dose'.
35884143|a|The surge in antimicrobial resistance and the limited availability of new antimicrobial drugs has fueled the interest in optimizing antibiotic dosing. An ideal dosing regimen leads to maximal bacterial cell kill, whilst minimizing the risk of toxicity or antimicrobial resistance. For beta-lactam antibiotics specifically, PK/PD-based considerations have led to the widespread adoption of prolonged infusion. The rationale behind prolonged infusion is increasing the percentage of time the beta-lactam antibiotic concentration remains above the minimal inhibitory concentration (%fT>MIC). The ultimate goal of prolonged infusion of beta-lactam antibiotics is to improve the outcome of infectious diseases. However, merely increasing target attainment (or the %fT>MIC) is unlikely to lead to improved clinical outcome for several reasons. First, the PK/PD index and target are dynamic entities. Changing the PK (as is the case if prolonged instead of intermittent infusion is used) will result in different PK/PD targets and even PK/PD indices necessary to obtain the same level of bacterial cell kill. Second, the minimal inhibitory concentration is not a good denominator to describe either the emergence of resistance or toxicity. Therefore, we believe a different approach to antibiotic dosing is necessary. In this perspective, we introduce the concept of the maximum tolerable dose (MTD). This MTD is the highest dose of an antimicrobial drug deemed safe for the patient. The goal of the MTD is to maximize bacterial cell kill and minimize the risk of antimicrobial resistance and toxicity. Unfortunately, data about what beta-lactam antibiotic levels are associated with toxicity and how beta-lactam antibiotic toxicity should be measured are limited. This perspective is, therefore, a plea to invest in research aimed at deciphering the dose-response relationship between beta-lactam antibiotic drug concentrations and toxicity. In this regard, we provide a theoretical approach of how increasing uremic toxin concentrations could be used as a quantifiable marker of beta-lactam antibiotic toxicity.
