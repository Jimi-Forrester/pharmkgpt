29739128|t|Evaluation of Acute and Chronic Effects of D-Galactose on Memory and Learning in Wistar Rats.
29739128|a|OBJECTIVE: D-galactose has been commonly used in rodent models to induce accelerated effects of aging, including those on learning, memory, and muscular tone and coordination. This is normally seen on chronic administration of D-galactose. However, there is minimal suggestive evidence on the short-term effects of the same. The aim of the study was to study the acute and chronic effects of D-galactose on learning and memory in Wistar rats. METHODS: Twenty four male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to the control, standard (rivastigmine), oral D-galactose (200 mg/kg/day) and subcutaneous D-galactose (200 mg/kg/day) for a total duration of 8 weeks. Effects on learning and memory were assessed at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks by Morris water maze model and passive avoidance testing. RESULTS: Both oral and subcutaneous D-galactose showed positive effects on learning and memory on acute dosing, whereas this beneficial effect was lost during chronic dosing. CONCLUSION: Short-term administration of D-galactose showed positive effects, while long-term administration nullified these effects.
