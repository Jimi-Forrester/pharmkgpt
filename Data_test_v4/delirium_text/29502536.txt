29502536|a|BACKGROUND: Understanding the process of relapse to abused drugs and ultimately developing treatments that can reduce the incidence of relapse remains the primary goal for the study of substance dependence. Therefore, exploring the metabolite characteristics during the relapse stage is valuable. METHODS: A heroin self-administered rat model was employed, and analysis of the 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics was performed to investigate the characteristic metabolite profile upon reintroduction to the drug after abstinence. RESULTS: Sixteen metabolites in the serum of rats, including phospholipids, intermediates in TCA (Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle) cycle, keto bodies, and precursors for neurotransmitters, underwent a significant change in the reinstatement stage compared with those in the control group. In particular, energy production was greatly disturbed as evidenced by different aspects such as an increase in glucose and decrease in intermediates of glycolysis and the TCA cycle. The finding that the level of 3-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate increased significantly suggested that energy production was activated from fatty acids. The concentration of phenylalanine, glutamine, and choline, the precursors of major neurotransmitters, increased during the reinstatement stage which indicated that an alteration in neurotransmitters in the brain might occur along with the disturbance in substrate supply in the circulatory system. CONCLUSIONS: Heroin reinforcement resulted in impaired energy production via different pathways, including glycolysis, the TCA cycle, keto body metabolism, etc. A disturbance in the substrate supply in the circulatory system may partly explain heroin toxicity in the central nervous system. These findings provide new insight into the mechanism underlying the relapse to heroin use.
