38429234|t|SSK1-Loaded Neurotransmitter-Derived Nanoparticles for Alzheimer's Disease Therapy via Clearance of Senescent Cells.
38429234|a|Age is a significant contributor to the onset of AD. Senolysis has been recently demonstrated to ameliorate aging-associated diseases that showing a great potential in AD therapy. However, due to the presence of BBB, the anti-AD activity of senolytics are significantly diminished. SSK1 is a prodrug that can be activated by beta-gal, a lysosomal enzyme commonly upregulated in senescent cells, and thus selectively eliminates senescent cells. Furthermore, the level of beta-gal is significantly correlated with conventional AD genes from clinical sequencing data. SSK1-loaded neurotransmitter -derived lipid nanoparticles are herein developed (SSK1-NPs) that revealing good BBB penetration and bioavailability of in the body. At the brain lesion, SSK1-NP treatment significantly reduces the expression of genes associated with senescence, induced senescent cells elimination, decreased amyloid-beta accumulation, and eventually improve cognitive function of aged AD mice. SSK1-NPs, a novel nanomedicine displaying potent anti-AD activity and excellent safety profile, provides a promising strategy for AD therapy.
