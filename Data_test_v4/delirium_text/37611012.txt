37611012|t|Changes in Selected Cognitive and Motor Skills as Well as the Quality of Life After a 24-Week Multidimensional Music-Based Exercise Program in People With Dementia.
37611012|a|The loss of independence is one of the greatest consequences of dementia. Multidimensional music-based exercise programs could counteract. The present study investigates the effects of such a program on people with dementia and bases on a 24-week intervention with three measurement time points. Sixty-nine people with dementia were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 43) and control group (n = 26). The following outcome parameters were measured: leg strength, gait, grip strength, balance, reaction time, selected cognitive abilities, and quality of life. A mixed ANOVA with repeated measurement showed significant interaction effects between group and time. After 24-weeks in contrast to the control group the intervention group significantly improved in leg strength (P = .001), balance (P = .001), gait (P = .001), grip strength (right P = .002, left P = .011), reaction time (P = .003), global cognition (P = .039), verbal fluency (P = .002), attention (P = .013) and quality of life (P = .011). In conclusion, the program enhanced selected cognitive and motor skills and quality of life.
