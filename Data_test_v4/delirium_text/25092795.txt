25092795|a|OBJECTIVE: The prescription of multiple medications for older people is common, despite concerns over the dangers associated with this. Older adults are particularly vulnerable to adverse effects of medication, and this is an even greater risk in patients with dementia. Many drugs used for physical health conditions can negatively affect cognition. Our aim was to identify areas of concern and which drugs to avoid in patients with dementia. DESIGN: A review of the literature was carried out using Pubmed, Medline and Embase. RESULTS: Many drugs used for physical health conditions may worsen the symptoms of dementia. They do this either by negating the effects of cognitive enhancers or through direct adverse effects on cognition CONCLUSIONS: Where evidence exists, we provide guidance as to the safest drugs to prescribe in particular clinical situations. Anticholinergic drugs should be avoided in dementia wherever possible. Effective pain management is important in older patients, but caution should be used when selecting an opioid analgesic because of their adverse central effects. Cardiac drugs have overall negligible effects on cognition, although some have been reported to cause delirium.
