39465770|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is a neurobehavioral disorder that can appear after surgery. It is characterized by an altered level of consciousness and impaired cognitive function. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of visual projection of images of relatives or loved ones in patients undergoing cardiac surgery in the immediate postoperative period, and its influence on the incidence and development of postoperative delirium. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was designed in the immediate postoperative period of adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Consolidated Statement of Reporting Trials guidelines were followed. A control group (CG) and an intervention group (IG) were established. In the IG, the patients underwent a visual projection, while the usual unit treatment was carried out with the CG. Sociodemographic, anthropometric, anesthetic, and surgical variables were also recorded. The postoperative delirium assessment scale used was the confusion assessment method for diagnosing delirium in intensive care unit patients. RESULTS: Information was collected from 104 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Most of the patients included in the study were men (66.35%) and the most performed surgical intervention was aortic valve replacement (34.62%). In the CG, positive patients in postoperative delirium increased from 19.23% to 25%, while in the IG they decreased from 5.77% to 1.92%. The logistic regression analysis presents a prediction model where the variables that influence the model are gender and group membership, meaning that being female and belonging to the IG significantly reduce the presence of delirium. CONCLUSION: The projection of visual material reduced the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, although it cannot be established that it is effective as a treatment once the pathology is already established.
