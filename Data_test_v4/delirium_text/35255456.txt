35255456|a|The recent revelation that the gut microbiome, home to approximately 100 trillion microorganisms, is implicated in the development of both health and disease has spurred an exponential increase in interdisciplinary research involving gut microbiology. In all this hype, there is a need to better understand and contextualize the emerging evidence for the role of the gut microbiota in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases, including central nervous system (CNS) malignancies. In this review, we aim to unravel the complex interactions of the microbiota-gut-brain-axis to pave a better understanding of microbiota-mediated pathogenesis, avenues for noninvasive prognosis, and therapeutic possibilities leveraging microbiota-gut-brain-axis modulations. We further provide insights of the ongoing transition from bench to bedside and discuss limitations of current approaches. Ultimately, we urge the continued development of synergistic therapeutic models with considerable consideration of the many gut-resident bacteria that will enable significant progress for the treatment of many neurological diseases.
