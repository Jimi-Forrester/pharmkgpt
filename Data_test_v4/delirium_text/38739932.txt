38739932|a|The dynamic interaction between the brain and the skin is termed the 'skin-brain axis.' Changes in the skin not only reflect conditions in the brain but also exert direct and indirect effects on the brain. Interestingly, the connection between the skin and brain is crucial for understanding aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Several studies have shown an association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and various skin disorders, such as psoriasis, bullous pemphigoid, and skin cancer. Previous studies have shown a significantly increased risk of new-onset AD in patients with psoriasis. In contrast, skin cancer may reduce the risk of developing AD. Accumulating evidence suggests an interaction between skin disease and AD; however, AD-associated pathological changes mediated by the skin-brain axis are not yet clearly defined. While some studies have reported on the diagnostic implications of the skin-brain axis in AD, few have discussed its potential therapeutic applications. In this review, we address the pathological changes mediated by the skin-brain axis in AD. Furthermore, we summarize (1) the diagnostic implications elucidated through the role of the skin-brain axis in AD and (2) the therapeutic implications for AD based on the skin-brain axis. Our review suggests that a potential therapeutic approach targeting the skin-brain axis will enable significant advances in the treatment of AD.
