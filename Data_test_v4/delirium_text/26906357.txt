26906357|t|Triptolide Rescues Spatial Memory Deficits and Amyloid-beta Aggregation Accompanied by Inhibition of Inflammatory Responses and MAPKs Activity in APP/PS1 Transgenic Mice.
26906357|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease characterized by aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in the hippocampus and cortex of brain. Neuroinflammation is considered a driving force of the progression of cognitive decline in AD. During the neuroinflammatory process, activated astrocytes and microglia induced by Abeta peptide produce pro-inflammatory factors and neurotoxins, which promote neurodegeneration in AD brain, eventually dementia. Thus, the suppression of glial over-activation in AD brain might result in therapeutic effect. Triptolide, a natural compound extracted from the Chinese medicinal herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F., has shown anti-inflammatory effects. Whether triptolide exhibits preventive effects on AD-like pathology via anti-inflammatory action is unclear. The present study showed that intraperitoneal injection of triptolide (20 mug/kg) for 15 weeks markedly alleviated deficits in learning and memory, and prevented Abeta accumulation in the brain of AD transgenic mice (APP/PS1 mice). These results were accompanied by reduction in glial activation and contents of pro-inflammatory factors in the brain of APP/PS1 mice treated by triptolide compared to saline-treated APP/PS1 mice. In addition, we observed that the Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs, including p38, ERK and JNK) phosphorylation was also suppressed by treatment of triptolide in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. Taken together, our study suggests that molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of triptolide on the AD model might involve inhibition of the neuroinflammation by suppressing MAPKs activity.
