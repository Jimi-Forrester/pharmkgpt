36745307|a|Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are the group of enzymes that control both cellular activity and the dephosphorylation of tyrosine (Tyr)-phosphorylated proteins. Dysregulation of PTP1B has contributed to numerous diseases including Diabetes Mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, and obesity rendering PTP1B as a legitimate target for therapeutic applications. It is highly challenging to target this enzyme because of its highly conserved and positively charged active-site pocket motivating researchers to find novel lead compounds against it. The present work makes use of an integrated approach combining ligand-based and structure-based virtual screening to find hit compounds targeting PTP1B. Initially, pharmacophore modeling was performed to find common features like two hydrogen bond acceptors, an aromatic ring and one hydrogen bond donor from the potent PTP1B inhibitors. The dataset of compounds matching with the common pharmacophoric features was filtered to remove Pan-Assay Interference substructure and to match the Lipinski criteria. Then, compounds were further prioritized using molecular docking and top fifty compounds with good binding affinity were selected for absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) predictions. The top five compounds with high solubility, absorption and permeability holding score of - 10 to - 9.3 kcal/mol along with Ertiprotafib were submitted to all-atom molecular dynamic (MD) studies. The MD studies and binding free energy calculations showed that compound M4, M5 and M8 were having better binding affinity for PTP1B enzyme with  Gtotal score of - 24.25, - 31.47 and - 33.81 kcal/mol respectively than other compounds indicating that compound M8 could be a suitable lead compound as PTP1B inhibitor.
