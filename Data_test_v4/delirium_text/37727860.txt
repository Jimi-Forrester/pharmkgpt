37727860|t|A case of disseminated coccidioidomycosis and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in a patient with HIV/AIDS.
37727860|a|Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection endemic to the southwestern United States and Central/South America, and its range is expanding with the warming climate. People with HIV/AIDS are at increased risk of developing disseminated infection, and furthermore are at risk for developing immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) if they are initiating or re-initiating anti-retroviral therapy (ART). There have been few cases of coccidioidomycosis-related IRIS reported in the literature, and there is no clear guidance on treatment. We present a case of paradoxical IRIS in a patient with AIDS who clinically improved after initiating corticosteroids.
