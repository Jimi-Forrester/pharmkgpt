35955718|t|Reg-1alpha, a New Substrate of Calpain-2 Depending on Its Glycosylation Status.
35955718|a|Reg-1alpha/lithostathine, a protein mainly associated with the digestive system, was previously shown to be overexpressed in the pre-clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease. In vitro, the glycosylated protein was reported to form fibrils at physiological pH following the proteolytic action of trypsin. However, the nature of the protease able to act in the central nervous system is unknown. In the present study, we showed that Reg-1alpha can be cleaved in vitro by calpain-2, the calcium activated neutral protease, overexpressed in neurodegenerative diseases. Using chemical crosslinking experiments, we found that the two proteins can interact with each other. Identification of the cleavage site using mass spectrometry, between Gln4 and Thr5, was found in agreement with the in silico prediction of the calpain cleavage site, in a position different from the one reported for trypsin, i.e., Arg11-Ile12 peptide bond. We showed that the cleavage was impeded by the presence of the neighboring glycosylation of Thr5. Moreover, in vitro studies using electron microscopy showed that calpain-cleaved protein does not form fibrils as observed after trypsin cleavage. Collectively, our results show that calpain-2 cleaves Reg-1alpha in vitro, and that this action is not associated with fibril formation.
