35416983|a|OBJECTIVES: The need to ration medical equipment and interventions during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic translated to an ever-lengthening wait list for surgical care. Retrospective analysis of lockdowns is of high importance to learn from the current situation for future pandemics. This monocentric study assessed the impact of lockdown periods on cardiac surgery cases and outcomes. METHODS: The single-centre cross-sectional descriptive observational study was conducted to investigate the first lockdown period and the following post-lockdown period in comparison to the same periods during the previous 3 years at the Department of Cardiac Surgery at the Medical University of Innsbruck. Data were prospectively collected and retrospectively analysed from the department-specific quality management system. The primary objective was to compare the number of open-heart procedures between the prelockdown and the lockdown period. The secondary objectives were to analyse the characteristics and the outcomes of open-heart procedures. RESULTS: There were no differences in patient demographics. A significant decrease of 29% in weekly surgical procedures was observed during the lockdown period. The surgical case-mix was unaffected: The numbers of aortic valve replacements, coronary artery bypass grafts, mitral valve repair or replacement procedures and others remained stable. The urgency of cases increased significantly, and the general health conditions of patients appeared to be worse. However, outcomes were unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: By implementing a rational patient selection process, the quality of open-heart procedures was maintained even though patients who underwent surgery during lockdown were sicker and more symptomatic.
