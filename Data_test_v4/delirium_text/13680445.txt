13680445|t|Discrimination of normal from demented elderly on a Spanish version of the verbal Selective Reminding Test.
13680445|a|The verbal Selective Reminding Test (vSRT) is a frequently used test for evaluating verbal learning and memory. In the present study we investigated the construct validity of a Spanish version of the vSRT by determining its ability to distinguish between a group of healthy elderly subjects and a group of patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). Further validation of the test was assessed by comparing the pattern of memory deficits found in the group of patients with DAT with findings from previous neuropsychological research concerning with memory impairments in English-speaking patients with Alzheimer's disease. Analyses revealed that the test was able to differentiate normal individuals from patients with DAT. In addition the pattern of memory functioning found in the group of patients with DAT was consistent with findings of previous experimental and clinical reports. These results support the construct validity of the Spanish version of the vSRT.
