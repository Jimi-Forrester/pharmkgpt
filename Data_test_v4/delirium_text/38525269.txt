38525269|t|Curcumin as a regulator of Th17 cells: Unveiling the mechanisms.
38525269|a|Curcumin, a polyphenol natural product derived from turmeric, possesses diverse pharmacological effects due to its interactions with various cells and molecules. Recent studies have highlighted its immunomodulatory properties, including its impact on immune cells and mediators involved in immune responses. Th17 cells play a crucial role in promoting immune responses against extracellular pathogens by recruiting neutrophils and inducing inflammation. These cells produce inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-21, IL-17A, IL-23, IL-17F, IL-22, and IL-26. Curcumin has been shown to significantly inhibit the proliferation of Th17 cells and reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha, IL-22, and IL-17. This review aims to assess the effectiveness of curcumin and its underlying mechanisms in modulating Th17 cells.
