25022541|a|OBJECTIVE: The Alzheimer's Disease Anti-Inflammatory Prevention Trial (ADAPT) and Follow-up Study (ADAPT-FS) examined effects of naproxen and celecoxib on cognition in the elderly. We report here results describing trajectories of cognitive evaluation test scores. METHODS: A total of 2356 participants completed baseline and at least one follow-up cognitive evaluation between 2001 and 2004. Study treatments were discontinued in 2004, but participants were followed until 2007. A total of 1537 participants were reevaluated in 2010 to 2011. Outcomes include seven cognitive evaluations administered yearly in person in ADAPT and three of these evaluations that were administered by telephone near the end of ADAPT and again in ADAPT-FS. RESULTS: There were no important differences over time by treatment group on any ADAPT cognitive measure, a global composite, or the three cognitive measures reassessed in ADAPT-FS by telephone. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment for 1 to 3 years with naproxen or celecoxib did not protect against cognitive decline in older adults with a family history of AD.
