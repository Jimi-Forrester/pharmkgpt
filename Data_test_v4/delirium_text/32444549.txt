32444549|a|BACKGROUND: Estrogens have been found to reduce amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels, a risk factor associated with dementia. We hypothesized that phytoestrogenic soybean products such as tempe and tofu might show similar effects. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study were to analyze the effect of tempe and tofu flour on Abeta1-40 serum levels in ovariectomized rats. METHODS: This research was conducted on female Sprague Dawley rats, aged 12 months. Before the intervention rats underwent ovariectomy (OVx) and were grouped into 5 intervention groups which were given tempe flour, tofu flour, estradiol, or casein as an active control. There was also a non-OVx control group which was fed a normal diet. RESULTS: The intake of tempe and tofu flour decreased Abeta serum levels in all estrogen and phytoestrogenic treatment groups, offsetting effects of OVx (but not in the casein group, where Abeta levels rise). CONCLUSION: The tempe flour group showed the strongest decrease in serum Abeta levels compared to the other groups. Future studies should investigate whether tempe can reduce Abeta levels in patients with dementia.
