35097128|t|Changes in Pre- and Postsurgery for Drug Resistant Epilepsy: Cognition and Sleep.
35097128|a|BACKGROUND: Most patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) have cognitive impairment and sleep disturbance. There was a significant correlation between sleep disorders and cognitive dysfunction. This study performed surgical treatment on patients with DRE and observed seizures, sleep, and cognition in patients with DRE in 6th month after operation to clarify the correlation between sleep and cognition in DRE patients. METHODS: 21 individuals with DRE were recruited to enroll in this trial. Each participant completed epileptic focus resection. Seizure frequency was the principle index; the mean seizure frequency was 1 month before surgery and six months after surgery. Cognitive function was assessed by MMSE, and sleep status was assessed by PSQI and ActiGraph; assessments were performed before and 6 months after surgery. RESULTS: There were significant differences between conditions on all outcome measures; after 6 months of surgery, compared with before treatment, the monthly average seizure frequency of DRE decreased, which was statistically significant (P < 0.001) compared with that before treatment. The MMSE score of DRE patients was significantly higher than before (P < 0.01), especially the ability of attention, calculation, and recall in MMSE score, which was significantly higher than before operation (respectively, P < 0.001 and P < 0.01). The subjective sleep evaluation index PSQI and objective measurement of sleep latency, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency of patients with DRE by ActiGraph were statistically significant (respectively, P < 0.01) compared with that before treatment. There was a correlation between seizure frequency and MMSE (r = -0.8887, P < 0.0001), PSQI (0.5515, P < 0.01), sleep latency (0.5353, P < 0.05), total sleep time (-0.7814, P < 0.0001), and sleep efficiency (-0.4380, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Surgery can effectively reduce the epileptic seizures frequency in patients with DRE and indirectly improve the computational power, attention, recall ability, and sleep status of patients. However, this result did not show a correlation between improved cognitive function and sleep, so the patient's cognitive function may be caused by surgery to improve the frequency of seizures. So, whether the improvement of patients' sleep conditions can also significantly improve the frequency of attacks and cognitive function in patients with DRE needs further exploration.
