36458166|t|Ketogenic diets and Ketone suplementation: A strategy for therapeutic intervention.
36458166|a|Ketogenic diets and orally administered exogenous ketone supplements are strategies to increase serum ketone bodies serving as an alternative energy fuel for high energy demanding tissues, such as the brain, muscles, and the heart. The ketogenic diet is a low-carbohydrate and fat-rich diet, whereas ketone supplements are usually supplied as esters or salts. Nutritional ketosis, defined as serum ketone concentrations of >= 0.5 mmol/L, has a fasting-like effect and results in all sorts of metabolic shifts and thereby enhancing the health status. In this review, we thus discuss the different interventions to reach nutritional ketosis, and summarize the effects on heart diseases, epilepsy, mitochondrial diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders. Interest in the proposed therapeutic benefits of nutritional ketosis has been growing the past recent years. The implication of this nutritional intervention is becoming more evident and has shown interesting potential. Mechanistic insights explaining the overall health effects of the ketogenic state, will lead to precision nutrition for the latter diseases.
