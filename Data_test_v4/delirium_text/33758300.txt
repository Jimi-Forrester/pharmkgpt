33758300|t|Bio-multifunctional noncovalent porphyrin functionalized carbon-based nanocomposite.
33758300|a|Herein, in a one-pot method, the reduced graphene oxide layers with the assistance of multiwalled carbon nanotubes were decorated to provide a suitable space for the in situ growth of CoNi2S4, and the porphyrins were incorporated into the layers as well to increase the sensitivity of the prepared nanostructure. The prepared nanocomposite can establish pi-pi interactions between the genetic material and on the surface of porphyrin rings. Also, hydrogen bonds between genetic domains and the porphyrin' nitrogen and the surface hydroxyl groups are probable. Furthermore, the potential donor-acceptor relationship between the d7 transition metal, cobalt, and the genetic material provides a suitable way to increase the interaction and gene loading , and transfections. The reason for this phenomenon was optimized to increase the EGFP by up to 17.9%. Furthermore, the sensing ability of the nanocomposite towards H2O2 was investigated. In this regard, the limit of detection of the H2O2 obtained 10 microM. Also, the in situ biosensing ability in the HEK-293 and PC12 cell lines was evaluated by the addition of PMA. The nanocomposite showed the ability to detect the released H2O2 after adding the minimum amount of 120 ng/mL of the PMA.
