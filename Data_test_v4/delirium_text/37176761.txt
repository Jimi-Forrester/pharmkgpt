37176761|t|Diagnosis and Management of Malnutrition in Patients with Heart Failure.
37176761|a|Heart failure is a disease with an increasingly greater prevalence due to the aging population, the development of new drugs, and the organization of healthcare processes. Malnutrition has been identified as a poor prognostic factor in these patients, very often linked to frailty or to other comorbidities, meaning that early diagnosis and treatment are essential. This paper reviews some important aspects of the pathophysiology, detection, and management of malnutrition in patients with heart failure.
