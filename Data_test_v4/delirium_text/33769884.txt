33769884|a|Postoperative delirium (POD) is an acute neurological condition associated with changes in cognition and attention and disorganised thinking. Although delirium can affect patients from any age group, it is common in older patients and could lead to a longer hospital stay and a higher risks of mortality. This article presents findings from a literature review that identifies various strategies used by health professionals globally to prevent POD. A database search resulted in 25 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Thematic analysis and coding were used to combine recurrent ideas that emerged from the literature. Three themes were identified: early identification and screening, modifiable risk factors, and preventive interventions. Further research focusing on education and improving awareness about POD among nurses is essential.
