39633474|a|Cullin 4B (CUL4B) is the scaffold protein in the CUL4B-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4B) complex. Loss-of-function mutations in the human CUL4B gene lead to syndromic X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). Till now, the mechanism of intellectual disability caused by CUL4B mutation still needs to be elucidated. In this study, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to investigate the impact of CUL4B deficiency on the transcriptional programs of diverse cell types. The results revealed that depletion of CUL4B resulted in impaired intercellular communication and elicited cell type-specific transcriptional changes relevant to synapse dysfunction. Golgi-Cox staining of brain slices and immunostaining of in vitro cultured neurons revealed remarkable synapse loss in CUL4B-deficient mice. Ultrastructural analysis via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the width of the synaptic cleft was significantly greater in CUL4B-deficient mice. Electrophysiological experiments found a decrease in the amplitude of AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons of CUL4B-deficient mice. These results indicate that depletion of CUL4B in mice results in morphological and functional abnormalities in synapses. Furthermore, behavioral tests revealed that depletion of CUL4B in the mouse nervous system results in impaired spatial learning and memory. Taken together, the findings of this study reveal the pathogenesis of neurological disorders associated with CUL4B mutations and promote the identification of therapeutic targets that can halt synaptic abnormalities and preserve memory in individuals.
