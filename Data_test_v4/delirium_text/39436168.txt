39436168|t|Ozone: complicated effects in central nervous system diseases.
39436168|a|Oxidative stress is closely related to various diseases. Ozone can produce redox reactions through its unique response. As a source of the oxidative stress response, the strong oxidizing nature of ozone can cause severe damage to the body. On the other hand, low ozone concentrations can activate various mechanisms to combat oxidative stress and achieve therapeutic effects. Some animal experiments and clinical studies have revealed the potential medical value of ozone, indicating that ozone is not just a toxic gas. By reviewing the mechanism of ozone and its therapeutic value in treating central nervous system diseases (especially ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease) and the toxic effects of ozone, we find that ozone inhalation and a lack of antioxidants or excessive exposure lead to harmful impacts. However, with adequate antioxidants, ozone can transmit oxidative stress signals, reduce inflammation, reduce amyloid beta peptide levels, and improve tissue oxygenation. Similar mechanisms to those of possible new drugs for treating ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease indicate the potential of ozone. Nevertheless, limited research has restricted the application of ozone. More studies are needed to reveal the exact dose-effect relationship and healing effect of ozone.
