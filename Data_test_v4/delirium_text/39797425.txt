39797425|a|The inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme responsible for the inactivation and decrease in acetylcholine in the cholinergic pathway, has been considered an attractive target for small-molecule drug discovery in Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapy. In the present study, a series of TZD derivatives were designed, synthesized, and studied for drug likeness, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET). Additionally, docking studies of the designed compounds were performed on AChE. Additionally, all the TZD derivatives (CHT1-5) showed an acceptable affinity for AChE inhibition, and the results showed convincing binding modes in the active site of AChE. Among them, 5-(4-methoxybenzylidene) thiazolidine-2,4-dione (CHT1) was identified as the most potent AChE inhibitor (IC50 of 165.93 nM) with the highest antioxidant activity. Following the exposure of PC12 cells to Abeta1-42 (100 muM), a marked reduction in cell survival was observed. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with TZD derivatives had a neuroprotective effect and significantly enhanced cell survival in response to Abeta-induced toxicity. Western blotting analysis revealed that CHT1 (5 and 8 muM) downregulated p-Tau and HSP70 expression levels. The results indicate that CHT1 is a promising and effective AchE-I that could be utilized as a powerful candidate against AD.
