39505249|t|Anesthesia/surgery leads to blood-brain barrier disruption via the transcellular and paracellular pathways, and postoperative delirium-like behavior: A comparative study in mice of different ages.
39505249|a|AIMS: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication of anesthesia and surgery, with a higher incidence in elderly patients. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is considered one of the key mechanisms underlying POD. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of different BBB permeability alteration pathways on POD in mice of various ages. METHODS: C57BL/6 J mice aged 4 and 16 months underwent exploratory laparotomy under sevoflurane anesthesia. Behavioral tests were conducted 24 h prior to surgery, as well as 6, 9, and 24 h postoperatively. Frontal cortex tissue was collected to detect the levels of BBB-related proteins and mRNA. RESULTS: At 6 and 9 h after anesthesia/surgery, 4-month-old mice showed poorer performance on behavioral tests than their untreated counterparts. However, 16-month-old mice exhibited worse behavioral test results at 6, 9, and 24 h after surgery. Anesthesia/surgery 6 h postoperatively increased the expression of vesicle-associated proteins, and BBB leakage in 4-month-old mice. In 16-month-old mice, anesthesia/surgery altered the expression of tight junction proteins, vesicle-associated proteins, and BBB leakage at 6 and 24 h postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Overall, our results suggest that anesthesia/surgery leads to age-dependent cognitive decline, and is associated with differences in the BBB injury pathways among mice of different ages. The transcellular pathway (transcytosis), compared to the paracellular pathway (tight junction), is more vulnerable to damage following anesthesia/surgery. This study provides new evidence for the improvement of POD through protection of the BBB.
