25292430|t|Learning by failing: ideas and concepts to tackle gamma-secretases in Alzheimer's disease and beyond.
25292430|a|gamma-Secretases are a group of widely expressed, intramembrane-cleaving proteases involved in many physiological processes. Their clinical relevance comes from their involvement in Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and other disorders. A clinical trial with the wide-spectrum gamma-secretase inhibitor semagacestat has, however, demonstrated that global inhibition of all gamma-secretases causes serious toxicity. Evolving insights suggest that selective inhibition of one of these proteases, or more subtle modulation of gamma-secretases by stimulating their carboxypeptidase-like activity but sparing their endopeptidase activity, are potentially highly interesting approaches. The rapidly growing knowledge of regulation, assembly, and specificity of these intriguing protein complexes and the potential advent of high-resolution structural information could dramatically change the perspective on safe and efficacious gamma-secretase inhibition in various disorders.
