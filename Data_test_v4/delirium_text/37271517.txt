37271517|t|Efficacy of Orexin Receptor Antagonist for Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation in Patients Who Underwent Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting.
37271517|a|PURPOSE: We retrospectively evaluated the postoperative efficacy of an orexin receptor antagonist for patients who underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We invested 108 patients who underwent cardiovascular surgery at our hospital. Patients were categorized as those received orexin receptor antagonist after surgery (S group, n = 64) or without orexin receptor antagonist (N group, n = 44), and the following data were analyzed between both groups. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) was significantly less in the S group than in the N group (N vs. S = 36.4 vs. 6.3%, p <0.001). Postoperative new atrial fibrillation (POAF) was significantly less in the S group compared with the N group (N vs. S = 36.4% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.003). Intensive care unit stay (N vs. S = 5.0 +- 1.5 vs. 3.8 +- 0.9 days, p <0.001) and hospitalization (N vs. S = 20.5 +- 9.2 vs. 17.1 +- 7.2 days, p = 0.037) were significantly shorter in the S group compared with the N group. CONCLUSION: Orexin receptor antagonists might reduce POD and POAF, and this effect could introduce the shortness of intensive care unit stay and hospitalization. Orexin receptor antagonist could be useful for patients who undergo OPCAB.
