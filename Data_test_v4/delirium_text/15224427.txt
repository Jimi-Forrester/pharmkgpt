15224427|t|[The practice guideline 'Dementia' (second revision) from the Dutch College of General Practitioners; a response from the perspective of general practice].
15224427|a|With growing numbers of older adults in the population, the number suffering from dementia will increase. The general practitioner has to try to determine the difference between Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia on the one hand, and fronto-temporal dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies on the other hand, while also considering the therapeutic options now and in the future. Support for patients and their family is the responsibility of the general practitioner, who must also consider the patient's driving proficiency and the wishes for euthanasia of the demented older adult. The revised version of the practice guideline 'Dementia' of the Dutch College of General Practitioners is well suited to the work of the general practitioner. It is advisable to read the practice guideline several times and in such cases not only to use the summary card but the entire practice guideline.
