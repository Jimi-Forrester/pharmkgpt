35308305|t|The Role of Lipid Rafts and Membrane Androgen Receptors in Androgen's Neurotoxic Effects.
35308305|a|Sex differences have been observed in multiple oxidative stress-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Androgens, such as testosterone, can exacerbate oxidative stress through a membrane androgen receptor (mAR), AR45, localized to lipid rafts in the plasma membrane. The goal of this study is to determine if interfering with mAR localization to cholesterol-rich lipid rafts decreases androgen induced neurotoxicity under oxidative stress environments. We hypothesize that cholesterol-rich caveolar lipid rafts are necessary for androgens to induce oxidative stress generation in neurons via the mAR localized within the plasma membrane. Nystatin was used to sequester cholesterol and thus decrease cholesterol-rich caveolar lipid rafts in a neuronal cell line (N27 cells). Nystatin was applied prior to testosterone exposure in oxidatively stressed N27 cells. Cell viability, endocytosis, and protein analysis of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and mAR localization were conducted. Our results show that the loss of lipid rafts via cholesterol sequestering blocked androgen-induced oxidative stress in cells by decreasing the localization of mAR to caveolar lipid rafts.
