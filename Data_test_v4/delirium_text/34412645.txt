34412645|t|The regulatory roles of microRNAs toward pathogenesis and treatments in Huntington's disease.
34412645|a|Huntington's disease (HD) is one of neurodegenerative diseases, and is defined as a monogenetic disease due to the mutation of Huntingtin gene. This disease affects several cellular functions in neurons, and further influences motor and cognitive ability, leading to the suffering of devastating symptoms in HD patients. MicroRNA (miRNA) is a non-coding RNA, and is responsible for gene regulation at post-transcriptional levels in cells. Since one miRNA targets to several downstream genes, it may regulate different pathways simultaneously. As a result, it raises a potential therapy for different diseases using miRNAs, especially for inherited diseases. In this review, we will not only introduce the update information of HD and miRNA, but also discuss the development of potential miRNA-based therapy in HD. With the understanding toward the progression of miRNA studies in HD, we anticipate it may provide an insight to treat this devastating disease, even applying to other genetic diseases.
