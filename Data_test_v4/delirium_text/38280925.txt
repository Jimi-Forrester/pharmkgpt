38280925|a|Bacterial cells can form biofilm on food contact surfaces, becoming a source of food contamination with profound health implications. The current study aimed to determine some Egyptian medicinal plants antibacterial and antibiofilm effects against foodborne bacterial strains in milk plants. Results indicated that four ethanolic plant extracts, Cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum), Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla), Marigold (Calendula officinalis), and Sage (Salvia officinalis), had antibacterial (12.0-26.5 mm of inhibition zone diameter) and antibiofilm (10-99%) activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella Typhimurium. The tested extracts had minimum inhibitory concentration values between 0.14 and 2.50 mg/ml and minimum bactericidal concentration values between 0.14 and 12.50 mg/ml. L. monocytogenes was more sensitive for all tested ethanolic extracts; Sage and Cinnamon showed a bacteriocidal effect, while Chamomile and Marigold were bacteriostatic. The ethanolic extracts mixture from Chamomile, Sage, and Cinnamon was chosen for its antibiofilm activity against L. monocytogenes using L-optimal mixture design. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis showed that this mixture contained 12 chemical compounds, where 2-Propenal,3-phenyl- had the maximum area % (34.82%). At concentrations up to 500 microg/ml, it had no cytotoxicity in the normal Vero cell line, and the IC50 value was 671.76 +- 9.03 microg/ml. Also, this mixture showed the most significant antibacterial effect against detached L. monocytogenes cells from formed biofilm in stainless steel milk tanks. At the same time, white soft cheese fortified with this mixture was significantly accepted overall for the panelist (92.2 +- 2.7) than other cheese samples, including the control group.
