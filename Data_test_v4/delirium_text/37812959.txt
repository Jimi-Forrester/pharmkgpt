37812959|t|Complicated jejunal diverticulitis with small bowel obstruction due to enterolith: A case report.
37812959|a|INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Small bowel diverticular disease (DD) is encountered and managed much less frequently than colonic DD, leading to a significantly less developed body of evidence for managing small bowel diverticulum and its associated complications. CASE PRESENTATION: This case report discusses a rare occurrence of simultaneous perforated jejunal diverticulitis and mechanical small bowel obstruction (SBO) due to a migrating diverticular enterolith. The patient's condition was ultimately managed operatively through laparoscopically assisted small bowel resection. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: A review of the literature reveals only eight reported cases of jejunal diverticulitis with simultaneous enterolith obstruction. All cases were managed operatively, with approaches including small bowel resection encompassing both pathologies, milking the enterolith back to the diverticulitis site and resecting en bloc to avoid extensive resection, or enterotomy and enterolith retrieval. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of small bowel diverticular disease is increasing, and as a result, clinicians may encounter more complications associated with this condition in the future. This case highlights the importance of considering alternate complications of small bowel DD.
