37180884|a|One of the adverse outcomes of acute inflammatory response is progressing to the chronic stage or transforming into an aggressive process, which can develop rapidly and result in the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The leading role in this process is played by the Systemic Inflammatory Response that is accompanied by the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, acute phase proteins, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. The purpose of this review that highlights both the recent reports and the results of the authors' own research is to encourage scientists to develop new approaches to the differentiated therapy of various SIR manifestations (low- and high-grade systemic inflammatory response phenotypes) by modulating redox-sensitive transcription factors with polyphenols and to evaluate the saturation of the pharmaceutical market with appropriate dosage forms tailored for targeted delivery of these compounds. Redox-sensitive transcription factors such as NFkappaB, STAT3, AP1 and Nrf2 have a leading role in mechanisms of the formation of low- and high-grade systemic inflammatory phenotypes as variants of SIR. These phenotypic variants underlie the pathogenesis of the most dangerous diseases of internal organs, endocrine and nervous systems, surgical pathologies, and post-traumatic disorders. The use of individual chemical compounds of the class of polyphenols, or their combinations can be an effective technology in the therapy of SIR. Administering natural polyphenols in oral dosage forms is very beneficial in the therapy and management of the number of diseases accompanied with low-grade systemic inflammatory phenotype. The therapy of diseases associated with high-grade systemic inflammatory phenotype requires medicinal phenol preparations manufactured for parenteral administration.
