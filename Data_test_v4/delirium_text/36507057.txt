36507057|t|Neuron devices: emerging prospects in neural interfaces and recognition.
36507057|a|Neuron interface devices can be used to explore the relationships between neuron firing and synaptic transmission, as well as to diagnose and treat neurological disorders, such as epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease. It is crucial to exploit neuron devices with high sensitivity, high biocompatibility, multifunctional integration and high-speed data processing. During the past decades, researchers have made significant progress in neural electrodes, artificial sensory neuron devices, and neuromorphic optic neuron devices. The main part of the review is divided into two sections, providing an overview of recently developed neuron interface devices for recording electrophysiological signals, as well as applications in neuromodulation, simulating the human sensory system, and achieving memory and recognition. We mainly discussed the development, characteristics, functional mechanisms, and applications of neuron devices and elucidated several key points for clinical translation. The present review highlights the advances in neuron devices on brain-computer interfaces and neuroscience research.
