36870972|a|BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic lung disease that has no cure. Although mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been reported to ameliorate lung inflammation and fibrosis in mouse models, their mechanisms of action remain unknown. Therefore, we aimed to determine the changes in various immune cells, especially macrophages and monocytes, involved in the effects of MSC treatment on pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: We collected and analyzed explanted lung tissues and blood from patients with IPF who underwent lung transplantation. After establishing a pulmonary fibrosis model via the intratracheal administration of bleomycin (BLM) to 8-week-old mice, MSCs derived from human umbilical cords were administered intravenously or intratracheally on day 10 and the lungs were immunologically analyzed on days 14 and 21. Flow cytometry was performed to analyze the immune cell characteristics, and gene expression levels were examined using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In the histological analysis of explanted human lung tissues, the terminally fibrotic areas contained a larger number of macrophages and monocytes than the early fibrotic areas of the lungs. When human monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMs) were stimulated with interleukin-13 in vitro, the expression of type 2 macrophage (M2) markers was more prominent in MoMs from the classical monocyte subset than in those from intermediate or non-classical monocyte subsets, and MSCs suppressed M2 marker expression independent of MoM subsets. In the mouse model, the increased number of inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and the degree of lung fibrosis observed in BLM-treated mice were significantly reduced by MSC treatment, which tended to be more prominent with intravenous administration than intratracheal administration. Both M1 and M2 MoMs were upregulated in BLM-treated mice. The M2c subset of M2 MoMs was significantly reduced by MSC treatment. Among M2 MoMs, M2 MoMs derived from Ly6C+ monocytes were most effectively regulated by the intravenous administration, not intratracheal administration, of MSCs. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory classical monocytes may play a role in lung fibrosis in human IPF and BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Intravenous rather than intratracheal administration of MSCs may ameliorate pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting monocyte differentiation into M2 macrophages.
