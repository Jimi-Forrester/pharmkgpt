36896359|t|ISCCM Guidelines for Hemodynamic Monitoring in the Critically Ill.
36896359|a|Hemodynamic assessment along with continuous monitoring and appropriate therapy forms an integral part of management of critically ill patients with acute circulatory failure. In India, the infrastructure in ICUs varies from very basic facilities in smaller towns and semi-urban areas, to world-class, cutting-edge technology in corporate hospitals, in metropolitan cities. Surveys and studies from India suggest a wide variation in clinical practices due to possible lack of awareness, expertise, high costs, and lack of availability of advanced hemodynamic monitoring devices. We, therefore, on behalf of the Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine (ISCCM), formulated these evidence-based guidelines for optimal use of various hemodynamic monitoring modalities keeping in mind the resource-limited settings and the specific needs of our patients. When enough evidence was not forthcoming, we have made recommendations after achieving consensus amongst members. Careful integration of clinical assessment and critical information obtained from laboratory data and monitoring devices should help in improving outcomes of our patients.
