32499599|a|The inflammasome is a cytoplasmic multiprotein complex responsible for the activation of inflammatory caspases (caspase-1, -4, and -5) in response to pathogen- and/or damage-associated molecular patterns or to homeostasis-altering molecular pathways, and for the consequent release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1ss and IL-18. Taking in account the complexity of inflammasome activation and that several regulatory steps are involved in maintaining its physiologic role in homeostasis and innate immune response, it does not surprise that several genetic variants in inflammasome components have been associated with common pathologies in the general population, such as autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular diseases, obesity and associated metabolic syndrome, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Moreover, the susceptibility to infectious agents and/or to develop severe complications during infections also has been related to inflammasome genetics. In this work, we revised genetic association studies about polymorphisms of main inflammasome genes in sterile as well as infectious diseases, trying to depict the genetic contribution of inflammasome in disease pathogenesis.
