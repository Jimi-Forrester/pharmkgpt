28979781|t|2017 update on pain management in patients with chronic kidney disease.
28979781|a|The prevalence of pain has been reported to be >60-70% among patients with advanced and end-stage kidney disease. Although the underlying etiologies of pain may vary, pain per se has been linked to lower quality of life and depression. The latter is of great concern given its known association with reduced survival among patients with end-stage kidney disease. We herein discuss and update the management of pain in patients with chronic kidney disease with and without requirement for renal replacement therapy with the focus on optimizing pain control while minimizing therapy-induced complications.
