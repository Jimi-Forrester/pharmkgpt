35361255|a|The adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily A member 7 gene (ABCA7) is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in large genome-wide association studies. Targeted sequencing of ABCA7 suggests a role for rare premature termination codon (PTC) mutations in AD, with haploinsufficiency through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay as a plausible pathogenic mechanism. Since other classes of rare variants in ABCA7 are poorly understood, we investigated the contribution and pathogenicity of rare missense, indel and splice variants in ABCA7 in Belgian AD patient and control cohorts. We identified 8.36% rare variants in the patient cohort versus 6.05% in the control cohort. For 10 missense mutations identified in the Belgian cohort we analyzed the pathogenetic effect on protein localization in vitro using immunocytochemistry. Our results demonstrate that rare ABCA7 missense mutations can contribute to AD by inducing protein mislocalization, resulting in a lack of functional protein at the plasma membrane. In one pedigree, a mislocalization-inducing missense mutation in ABCA7 (p.G1820S) co-segregated with AD in an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Brain autopsy of six patient missense mutation carriers showed typical AD neuropathological characteristics including cerebral amyloid angiopathy type 1. Also, among the rare ABCA7 missense mutations, we observed mutations that affect amino acid residues that are conserved in ABCA1 and ABCA4, of which some correspond to established ABCA1 or ABCA4 disease-causing mutations involved in Tangier or Stargardt disease.
