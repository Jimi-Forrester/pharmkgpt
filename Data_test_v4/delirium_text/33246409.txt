33246409|a|BACKGROUND: Frailty and cognitive decline are highly prevalent among older adults. However, the relationship between frailty and mild behavioral impairment (MBI), a dementia risk syndrome characterized by later-life emergence of persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms, has yet to be elucidated. We aimed to evaluate the associations between MBI and frailty in older adults without dementia. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a consecutive series of 137 older adults without dementia in the Anti-Aging Study, recruited from primary care clinics, were enrolled. Frailty was estimated using the Fried phenotype. MBI was evaluated by the Mild Behavioral Impairment Checklist (MBI-C) at a cut-off point of > 8. Cognition was assessed with the Chinese versions of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-BC) and Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to estimate the relationship between MBI and objective cognition with frailty status. RESULTS: At baseline, 30.7% of the older adults had frailty and 18.2% had MBI (MBI+ status). Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that compared to those without MBI (MBI- status), MBI+ was more likely to have frailty (odds ratio [OR] = 7.44, 95% CI = 1.49-37.21, p = 0.02). Frailty and MBI were both significantly associated with both MMSE and MoCA-BC score (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Both frailty and MBI status were associated with higher odds of cognitive impairment. MBI was significantly associated with an increased risk of having frailty in the absence of dementia. This association merits further study to identify potential strategies for the early detection, prevention and therapeutic intervention of frailty.
