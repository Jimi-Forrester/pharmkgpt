38295164|a|Understanding the plasticity of neuronal networks is an emerging field of (patho-) physiological research, yet the underlying cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Gamma oscillations (30 to 80 hertz), a biomarker of cognitive performance, require and potentiate glutamatergic transmission onto parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PVIs), suggesting an interface for cell-to-network plasticity. In ex vivo local field potential recordings, we demonstrate long-term potentiation of hippocampal gamma power. Gamma potentiation obeys established rules of PVI plasticity, requiring calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). A microcircuit computational model of CA3 gamma oscillations predicts CP-AMPAR plasticity onto PVIs critically outperforms pyramidal cell plasticity in increasing gamma power and completely accounts for gamma potentiation. We reaffirm this ex vivo in three PVI-targeting animal models, demonstrating that gamma potentiation requires PVI-specific signaling via a Gq/PKC pathway comprising mGluR5 and a Gi-sensitive, PKA-dependent pathway. Gamma activity-dependent, metabotropically mediated CP-AMPAR plasticity on PVIs may serve as a guiding principle in understanding network plasticity in health and disease.
