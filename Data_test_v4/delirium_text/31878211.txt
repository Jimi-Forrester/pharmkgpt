31878211|t|Analysis of Polyphenolic Composition of a Herbal Medicinal Product-Peppermint Tincture.
31878211|a|The pharmacological activity of peppermint leaf (Menthae piperitae folium) for medical use is mainly attributed to the presence of essential oil, which, according to the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.), should constitute not less than 12 mL/kg of raw material. The content of polyphenols in peppermint-based preparations, except peppermint leaf dry extract, has not yet been considered as an essential parameter in the pharmacopeial assessment of peppermint quality. This study concerns the evaluation of the presence of representatives of polyphenolic compounds in 23 commercial peppermint tinctures (ethanolic extracts) purchased in pharmacies in Poland. The non-volatile polyphenolic fraction was investigated, and the presence of flavonoids and phenolic acids was quantified. High performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode-array detector (HPLC-DAD) and an electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (U(H)PLC-ESI-MS) were used in the experiment. The study showed that eriocitrin, luteolin-7-O-rutinoside, and rosmarinic acid were the main polyphenolic components of the peppermint tinctures, as previously reported for peppermint leaf. Despite this, the research shows the extremely diverse content of the mentioned compounds in analyzed commercial medicinal products. In light of these results, it seems that the pharmacopeial assessment for the peppermint leaf (Ph. Eur.) and peppermint tincture (Polish Pharmacopoeia (FP)) requires correction and supplementation.
