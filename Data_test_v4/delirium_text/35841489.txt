However, relevant report on surgical prostate cancer patients is scarce. This study put forward a reminiscence therapy-based care program (RTCP + UC) combing reminiscence therapy with usual care (UC), and aimed to evaluate the impact of RTCP + UC on anxiety, depression, quality of life and survival in surgical prostate cancer patients. METHODS: Totally, 108 prostate cancer patients receiving surgical resection were enrolled, who were subsequently randomized and allocated to the RTCP + UC group (N = 55) and UC group (N = 53) at a 1:1 ratio. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and QLQ-C30 were assessed at month M0, M3, M6, M9 and M12 during the intervention period. After intervention, patients were followed up for another 24 months to calculate disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: RTCP + UC decreased HADS-anxiety score at M9 and M12, declined HADS-depression score at M6, M9 and M12, reduced depression rate and the severity level of depression at M12, while did not affect these issues at other time points. Meanwhile, RTCP + UC enhanced the QLQ-C30 global health status score at M3, M6, M9 and M12, but did not influence the QLQ-C30 function score and QLQ-C30 symptom score at any time points. Meanwhile, RTCP + UC had no effect on the accumulating DFS and OS of surgical prostate cancer patients. CONCLUSION: RTCP + UC serves as an optional nursing modality in alleviating anxiety and depression, improving quality of life in surgical prostate cancer patients.
