38007659|t|Evaluation of Cognitive and Physical Function Among Older Adults by Their Physical Activity: A Cross-Sectional Kasama Study, Japan.
38007659|a|BACKGROUND: The amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta42) level is a biomarker that is widely used to evaluate individual cognitive dysfunction early in neurodegenerative diseases, as well as differentiate between normal cognitive function, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE: Our cross-sectional study evaluated the association between daily exercise and physical and cognitive function and Abeta42 levels among a subsample of 325 older adults from the Kasama Study. METHODS: Participants (age: 74.5 [range 65-90] years) were classified into three exercise groups: the dual-task (DEG, n = 128), single-task (SEG, n = 122), and non-exercise (NEG, n = 75) groups. The main outcomes were the plasma Abeta42 levels and the scores of the five cognitive (5-COG) tests and five cognition-related physical function (5-PHYS) tests. RESULTS: The Abeta42 levels and 5-COG and 5-PHYS scores were higher in the SEG and DEG than in the NEG. The Abeta42 levels were higher in the DEG than in the NEG (p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Physical activities such as regular exercise may benefit older adults, improving their cognitive and physical function.
