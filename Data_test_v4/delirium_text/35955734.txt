35955734|t|A Bright Horizon: Immunotherapy for Pediatric T-Cell Malignancies.
35955734|a|Immunotherapy has transformed the treatment of hematologic malignancies in the past two decades. The treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), in particular, has been highly impacted by multiple novel immunotherapies. For pediatric patients with T-cell malignancies, translating immunotherapies has proved more challenging due to the complexities of fratricide, risk of product contamination with malignant cells, and concerns over T-cell aplasia. Despite these hurdles, many creative and promising strategies are on the horizon. We review challenges in the development of immunotherapy for T-cell malignancies, strategies to overcome these challenges, as well as therapies currently being investigated and starting to reach the clinic. Immunotherapy will hopefully successfully treat patients with relapsed and refractory T-cell malignancies and may someday be incorporated in up-front protocols in order to prevent relapses.
