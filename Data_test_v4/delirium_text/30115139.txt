30115139|t|Delirious mania intractable to treatment.
30115139|a|We present the case of a 68-year-old lady with a background diagnosis of bipolar disorder, who developed significant episodes of intractable delirium during each of her last three inpatient psychiatric admissions, where she was admitted with mania and psychosis. The case demonstrates diagnostic and management difficulties secondary to this delirium. We discuss the probable cause of this delirium and the various management strategies utilised in an effort to ameliorate her condition.
