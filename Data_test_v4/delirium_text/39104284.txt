39104284|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in post-transcriptional processes and regulate major cellular functions. The abnormal regulation of expression of miRNAs has been linked to numerous human diseases such as respiratory diseases, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Latest miRNA-disease associations are predominantly found in unstructured biomedical literature. Retrieving these associations manually can be cumbersome and time-consuming due to the continuously expanding number of publications. We propose a deep learning-based text mining approach that extracts normalized miRNA-disease associations from biomedical literature. To train the deep learning models, we build a new training corpus that is extended by distant supervision utilizing multiple external databases. A quantitative evaluation shows that the workflow achieves an area under receiver operator characteristic curve of 98% on a holdout test set for the detection of miRNA-disease associations. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach by extracting new miRNA-disease associations from biomedical literature (PubMed and PubMed Central). We have shown through quantitative analysis and evaluation on three different neurodegenerative diseases that our approach can effectively extract miRNA-disease associations not yet available in public databases.
