19751127|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be definitively diagnosed only by histopathologic examination of brain tissue; the identification and differential diagnosis of AD is especially challenging in its early stages. Neuroimaging is playing an increasingly relevant role in the identification and quantification of AD in vivo, especially in the preclinical stages, when therapeutic intervention could be more effective. Neuroimaging enables quantification of brain volume loss (structural imaging), detection of early cerebral dysfunction (functional imaging), probing into the finest cerebral structures (microstructural imaging), and investigation of amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle build-up (amyloid imaging). Throughout the years, several imaging tools have been developed, ranging from simple visual rating scales to sophisticated computerized algorithms. As recently revised criteria for AD require quantitative evaluation of biomarkers mostly based on imaging, this paper provides an overview of the main neuroimaging tools which might be used presently or in the future in routine clinical practice for AD diagnosis.
