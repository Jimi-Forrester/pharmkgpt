38212717|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the construct validity and reliability of the Iranian version of the COVID-19 Yorkshire Rehabilitation Scale (C19-YRS) among the elderly population. METHOD: A cohort of 230 elderly individuals who tested positive for Covid-19 via PCR were administered a health and demographic information questionnaire along with the C19-YRS. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted, and Cronbach's alpha was calculated. RESULTS: Findings from the exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the C19-YRS revealed alterations compared to the original version, resulting in an adapted version with three factors achieved by redistributing the questions. These factors accounted for 57.46% of the total variance. Despite a relatively lower factor loading in the 6th question, it was retained due to its significance among the elderly. The Cronbach's alpha for the C19-YRS subscales ranged from 0.730 to 0.890, indicating acceptable reliability. CONCLUSION: The validation results indicated a well-adjusted factor structure and internal consistency, affirming the utility of this tool among the elderly population. Consequently, the C19-YRS in Iran can serve as a valuable resource in healthcare settings, aiding in the assessment of chronic complications arising from Covid-19 in the elderly. It can be utilized as an initial screening or triage test and to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions.
