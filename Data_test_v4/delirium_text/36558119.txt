36558119|a|The aim of this study was to verify various extraction methods: shaking water bath extraction (SWA), ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) and microwave assisted extraction (MAE), and their parameters to optimize the extraction yield as well as maximize the concentration of polyphenols in Plectranthus barbatus extracts. Extracts were obtained from dried roots of P. barbatus in various degrees of fragmentation and analyzed for content of polyphenols, antioxidant capacity and flavonoids. Additionally, phenolic compounds in extracts were analyzed using the UHPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS method. The conducted research showed that roots of P. barbatus are rich in polyphenolic compounds. A total of 15 phenolic compounds, belonging to the group of phenolic acids and their derivatives, were identified. The extraction yield was similar for all extraction methods and averaged 31%. Irrespective of the extraction method, the yield was the lowest in the case of using 80% ethanol as the solvent. The extracts obtained from the finer fraction were characterized by a higher antioxidant capacity as well as a higher concentration of polyphenolic compounds including flavonoids. UAE seems to be the most effective method for extraction of polyphenols from P. barbatus roots. Regardless of the extraction method, ethanol was a better extractant than distilled water. All ethanolic extracts were characterized by a high antioxidant capacity. The 80% ethanol solution was considered the best solvent for the extraction of flavonoids, while the 40% and 60% ethanol solutions were sufficient for the effective extraction of polyphenolic compounds in general.
