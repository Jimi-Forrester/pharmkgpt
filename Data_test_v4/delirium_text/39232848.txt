39232848|t|Updates in Alzheimer's disease: from basic research to diagnosis and therapies.
39232848|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized pathologically by extracellular deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) into senile plaques and intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) as neurofibrillary tangles. Clinically, AD patients show memory deterioration with varying cognitive dysfunctions. The exact molecular mechanisms underlying AD are still not fully understood, and there are no efficient drugs to stop or reverse the disease progression. In this review, we first provide an update on how the risk factors, including APOE variants, infections and inflammation, contribute to AD; how Abeta and tau become abnormally accumulated and how this accumulation plays a role in AD neurodegeneration. Then we summarize the commonly used experimental models, diagnostic and prediction strategies, and advances in periphery biomarkers from high-risk populations for AD. Finally, we introduce current status of development of disease-modifying drugs, including the newly officially approved Abeta vaccines, as well as novel and promising strategies to target the abnormal pTau. Together, this paper was aimed to update AD research progress from fundamental mechanisms to the clinical diagnosis and therapies.
