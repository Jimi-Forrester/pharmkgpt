38755952|t|Recruitment Barriers and Potential Strategies for Inclusion of Older Asian Americans in Alzheimer's Disease Research.
38755952|a|The makeup of the US population of older adults continues to become more diverse as numbers from ethnic subgroups increase. However, these subgroups are generally underrepresented in research focused on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). This paper examines barriers to recruitment for older Asian Americans, to underpin potential strategies for future research, with particular emphasis on recruitment of Vietnamese Americans. The paper discusses three recommended strategies: implementing appropriate recruitment outreach methods, establishing and maintaining community partnerships, and adopting flexible and convenient assessment methods. All three complementary approaches may be applied to improve Vietnamese American aging research participation. This has the potential to promote early intervention, foster longevity, ameliorate health disparities, and reduce healthcare burdens for this population.
