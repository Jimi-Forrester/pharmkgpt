38551404|t|Mechanisms underlying LncRNA SNHG1 regulation of Alzheimer's disease involve DNA methylation.
38551404|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with long non-coding RNAs and DNA methylation; however, the mechanisms underlying the role of lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (lncRNA SNHG1) and subsequent involvement of DNA methylation in AD development are not known. The aim of this study was to examine the regulatory mechanisms attributed to lncRNA SNHG1 gene utilizing 2 strains of senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) model of AD and compared to senescence-accelerated mouse resistant (SAMR) considered a control. Both strains of the mouse were transfected with either blank virus, psLenti-U6-SNHG1(low gene expression) virus, and psLenti-pA-SNHG1(gene overexpression) virus via a single injection into the brains for 2 weeks. At 2 weeks mice were subjected to a Morris water maze to determine any behavioral effects followed by sacrifice to extract hippocampal tissue for Western blotting to measure protein expression of p-tau, DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, TET1, and p-Akt. No marked alterations were noted in any parameters following blank virus transfection. In SAMP8 mice, a significant decrease was noted in protein expression of DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, and p-Akt associated with rise in p-tau and TET1. Transfection with ps-Lenti-U6-SNHG1 alone in SAMR1 mice resulted in a significant rise in DNMTs and p-Akt and a fall in p-tau and TET1. Transfection of SAMP8 with ps-Lenti-U6-SNHG1 blocked effects on overexpression noted in this mouse strain. However, knockdown of lncRNA SNHG1 yielded the opposite results as found in SAMR1 mice. In conclusion, the knockdown of lncRNA SNHG1 enhanced DNA methylation through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, thereby reducing the phosphorylation levels of tau in SAMP8 AD model mice with ameliorating brain damage attributed to p-tau accumulation with consequent neuroprotection.
