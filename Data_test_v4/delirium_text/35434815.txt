35434815|a|Rising rates of alcohol use disorder (AUD) combined with increases in alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) and other liver disease have resulted in the need to develop alcohol management strategies at all levels of patient care. For those with pre-existing liver disease, whether ALD or others, attention to alcohol use treatment and abstinence becomes critical to avoiding worsening liver-related consequences. Modalities to help patients reduce or stop alcohol include screening/brief intervention/referral to treatment, various therapeutic modalities including cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational enhancement therapy and 12-step facilitation, and alcohol relapse prevention medications. Harm reduction approaches versus total abstinence may be considered, but for those with existing ALD, particularly advanced ALD (cirrhosis or acute alcoholic hepatitis), total abstinence from alcohol is the recommendation, given clear data that ongoing alcohol use worsens mortality and liver-related morbidity. For certain populations, alcohol cessation is even more critically important. For those with hepatitis C or NAFLD, alcohol use accelerates negative liver-related outcomes. In women, alcohol use accelerates liver damage and results in worsened liver-related mortality. Efforts to integrate AUD and liver disease care are urgently needed and can occur at several levels, with establishment of multidisciplinary ALD clinics for fully integrated co-management as an important goal.
