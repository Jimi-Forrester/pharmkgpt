36134289|a|Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease is associated with disruption of the neuronal cell membrane by the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide. However, the disruption mechanism and the resulting changes in membrane properties remain to be elucidated. To address this issue, herein the interaction of amyloid beta monomers (AbetaMs) and amyloid beta oligomers (AbetaOs) with a floating bilayer lipid membrane (fBLM) was studied using electrochemical and IR spectroscopy techniques. IR measurements showed that both Abeta forms interacted similarly with the hydrophobic membrane core (lipid acyl chains), causing conformational and orientational changes of the lipid acyl chains, thus decreasing acyl chain mobility and altering the lipid packing unit cell. In the presence of AbetaOs, these changes were more significant than those in the presence of AbetaMs. However, respective interactions of AbetaMs and AbetaOs with the membrane hydrophilic exterior (lipid heads) were quite different. AbetaMs dehydrated lipid heads without affecting their orientation while AbetaOs changed the orientation of lipid heads keeping their hydration level intact. Electrochemical measurements showed that only AbetaOs porated the fBLM, thus significantly changing the fBLM electrical properties. The present results provide new molecular-level insight into the mechanism of membrane destruction by AbetaOs and changes in the membrane properties.
