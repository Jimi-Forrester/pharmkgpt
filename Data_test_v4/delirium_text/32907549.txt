32907549|a|BACKGROUND: The standard chemotherapy regimens for soft tissue sarcoma are doxorubicin-based. This retrospective study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of pirarubicin, ifosfamide, and etoposide combination therapy for patients with this disease. METHODS: Between 2008 and 2017, 25 patients with soft tissue sarcoma were treated with pirarubicin (30 mg/m2, 2 days), ifosfamide (2 g/m2, 5 days), and etoposide (100 mg/m2, 3 days) every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was overall response, and the secondary endpoint was adverse events of this regimen. RESULTS: Responses to this regimen according to RECIST criteria were partial response (n = 9, 36%), stable disease (n = 9, 36%) and progressive disease (n = 7, 28%). During the treatment phase, frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events were hematological toxicities including white blood cell decreases (96%), febrile neutropenia (68%), anemia (68%), and platelet count decreases (48%). No long-term adverse events were reported during the study period. CONCLUSION: This regimen was comparable to previously published doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy in terms of response rate. Although there were no long-lasting adverse events, based on our results, severe hematological toxicity should be considered.
