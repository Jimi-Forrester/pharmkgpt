36676680|t|Synthetic Pharmacotherapy for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Potential Mechanisms of Action, Efficacy, and Safety.
36676680|a|The pharmacological treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) aims to decrease disease activity, progression, systemic compromise, and mortality. Among the pharmacological alternatives, there are chemically synthesized drugs whose efficacy has been evaluated, but which have the potential to generate adverse events that may compromise adherence and response to treatment. Therapy selection and monitoring will depend on patient characteristics and the safety profile of each drug. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the most important synthetic drugs used in the treatment of SLE, including the current treatment options (mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide), review their mechanism of action, efficacy, safety, and, most importantly, provide monitoring parameters that should be considered while the patient is receiving the pharmacotherapy.
