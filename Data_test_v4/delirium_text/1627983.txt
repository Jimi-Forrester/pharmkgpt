1627983|t|Anticholinergic delirium caused by topical homatropine ophthalmologic solution: confirmation by anticholinergic radioreceptor assay in two cases.
1627983|a|The authors report two patients with prolonged metabolic delirium presumably initiated by systemic absorption of homatropine from a topical ophthalmologic solution. Anticholinergic toxicity was confirmed by muscarinic radioreceptor assay in both cases and by quantitative EEG in one case.
