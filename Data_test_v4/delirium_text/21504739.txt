21504739|t|Naproxen interferes with the assembly of Abeta oligomers implicated in Alzheimer's disease.
21504739|a|Experimental and epidemiological studies have shown that the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug naproxen may be useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. To investigate the interactions of naproxen with Abeta dimers, which are the smallest cytotoxic aggregated Abeta peptide species, we use united atom implicit solvent model and exhaustive replica exchange molecular dynamics. We show that naproxen ligands bind to Abeta dimer and penetrate its volume interfering with the interpeptide interactions. As a result naproxen induces a destabilizing effect on Abeta dimer. By comparing the free-energy landscapes of naproxen interactions with Abeta dimers and fibrils, we conclude that this ligand has stronger antiaggregation potential against Abeta fibrils rather than against dimers. The analysis of naproxen binding energetics shows that the location of ligand binding sites in Abeta dimer is dictated by the Abeta amino acid sequence. Comparison of the in silico findings with experimental observations reveals potential limitations of naproxen as an effective therapeutic agent in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
