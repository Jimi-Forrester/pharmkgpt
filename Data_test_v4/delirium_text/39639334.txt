39639334|t|TGNet: tensor-based graph convolutional networks for multimodal brain network analysis.
39639334|a|Multimodal brain network analysis enables a comprehensive understanding of neurological disorders by integrating information from multiple neuroimaging modalities. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively model the complex structures of multimodal brain networks. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor-based graph convolutional network (TGNet) framework that combines tensor decomposition with multi-layer GCNs to capture both the homogeneity and intricate graph structures of multimodal brain networks. We evaluate TGNet on four datasets-HIV, Bipolar Disorder (BP), and Parkinson's Disease (PPMI), Alzheimer's Disease (ADNI)-demonstrating that it significantly outperforms existing methods for disease classification tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited sample sizes. The robustness and effectiveness of TGNet highlight its potential for advancing multimodal brain network analysis. The code is available at  https://github.com/rongzhou7/TGNet .
