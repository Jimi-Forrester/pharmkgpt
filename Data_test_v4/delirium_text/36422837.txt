36422837|a|Accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau is a histopathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies. Growing evidence demonstrated that tau pathology in AD spreads in a prion-like manner. Previous studies showed that metformin might have a positive effect on cognition. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of metformin on tau propagation. Brain extracts containing tau aggregates were unilaterally injected into the hippocampus and the overlying cerebral cortex of PS19 mice. Metformin was administrated through drinking water for four months, and we observed tau spreading in the brain of tau-seeded PS19 mice. Metformin inhibited the spreading of tau pathology in the ipsilateral hemisphere, attenuated tau pathology in the contralateral hemisphere, and reduced the hyperphosphorylation of tau at Ser202/Thr205, Thr231, and Ser422 sites in the soluble fraction and Ser202/Thr205, Ser262, Thr396, Thr231, and Ser422 sites in the insoluble fraction of tau-seeded PS19 mice brains. Metformin did not affect tau kinases or phosphatase 2A protein levels but reduced mTORC1 protein levels. Additionally, metformin reduced learning and memory deficits of the tau-seeded PS19 mice. These findings indicate that metformin reduced tau hyperphosphorylation, attenuated tau pathology in tau-seeded PS19 mice, and improved learning and memory deficits. These findings highlight the potential mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of metformin on cognition, implying that metformin could be a promising drug for the prevention and early treatment of AD.
