38699003|a|Objectives: The positive effects of tea on Alzheimer's disease (AD) have increasingly captured researchers' attention. Nevertheless, the quantitative comprehensive analysis in the relevant literatur is lack. This paper aims to thoroughly examine the current research status and hotspots from 2014 to 2023, providing a valuable reference for subsequent research. Methods: Documents spanning from 2014 to 2023 were searched from the Web of Science, and the R software, VOSviewer, and Citespace software were used for analysis and visualization. Results: A total of 374 documents were contained in the study. The rate of article publications exhibited a consistent increase each year from 2014 to 2023. Notably, China emerged as the leading country in terms of published articles, followed by the United States and India. Simultaneously, China is also in a leading position in cooperation with other countries. Molecules emerged as the most frequently published journal, while the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease secured the top spot in terms of citations. The identified main keywords included oxidative stress, amyloid, epigallocatechin gallate, and green tea polyphenol, among others. These focal areas delved into the antioxidative and anti-amyloid aggregation actions of tea's polyphenolic components. Furthermore, the particularly way in which epigallocatechin gallate delivers neuroprotective outcomes by influencing molecules related to AD represents a focal point of research. Conclusion: The increasing attention from researchers on the role of tea in ameliorating AD positions it as a hot spot in the development of anti-AD drugs in the development of future. Through our generalized analysis of the current landscape and hotspots regarding tea's application in AD, this study provides an estimable reference for future research endeavors.
