35001895|t|An Argument for Simple Tests of Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
35001895|a|Two potential disease-modifying approaches for dementia are being vigorously tested: the early targeting of the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and multi-domain lifestyle interventions to promote resilience to neuropathology. We apply the "web of information" model of clinical translation to both approaches to argue firstly that tests of treatments aiming to achieve clinically meaningful outcomes should remain simple, and secondly, that building clinically-meaningful treatments should be kept separate from public health policy which means promoting wide-reaching action against risk factors now with available information.
