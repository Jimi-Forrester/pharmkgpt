30958368|t|Phospho-Tau Changes in the Human CA1 During Alzheimer's Disease Progression.
30958368|a|Despite extensive studies regarding tau phosphorylation progression in both human Alzheimer's disease cases and animal models, the molecular and structural changes responsible for neurofibrillary tangle development are still not well understood. Here, by using the antibodies AT100 (recognizes tau protein phosphorylated at Thr212 and Ser214 in the proline-rich region) and pS396 (recognizes tau protein phosphorylated at serine residue 396 in the C-terminal region), we examined phospho-tau immunostaining in neurons from the hippocampal CA1 region of 21 human cases with tau pathology ranging from Braak stage I to VI. Our results indicate that the AT100/pS396 ratio decreases in CA1 in accordance with the severity of the disease, along with its colocalization. We therefore propose the AT100/pS396 ratio as a new tool to analyze the tau pathology progression. Our findings also suggest a conformational modification in tau protein that may cause the disappearance of the AT100 epitope in the late stages of tau pathology, which may play a role in the toxic tangle aggregation. Thus, this study provides new insights underlying the stages for the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease.
