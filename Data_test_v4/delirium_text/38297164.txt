38297164|t|Exploring the potential of Toxoplasma gondii in drug development and as a delivery system.
38297164|a|Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases are various groups of conditions that result in immune system disorders and increased cancer risk. Despite the identification of causative cytokines and pathways, current clinical treatment for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases is limited. In addition, immune-mediated inflammatory disease treatment can increase the risk of cancer. Several previous studies have demonstrated that Toxoplasma gondii manipulates the immune response by inhibiting or stimulating cytokines, suggesting the potential for controlling and maintaining a balanced immune system. Additionally, T. gondii also has the unique characteristic of being a so-called "Trojan horse" bacterium that can be used as a drug delivery system to treat regions that have been resistant to previous drug delivery therapies. In this study, we reviewed the potential of T. gondii in drug development and as a delivery system through current research on inflammation-regulating mechanisms in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.
