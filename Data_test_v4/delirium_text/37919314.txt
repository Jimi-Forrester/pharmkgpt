37919314|a|As an important risk factor for many cardiovascular diseases, hypertension requires convenient and reliable methods for prevention and intervention. This study designed a visualization risk prediction system based on Machine Learning and SHAP as an auxiliary tool for personalized health management of hypertension. We used ten Machine Learning algorithms such as random forests and 1617 anonymized health check data to build ten hypertension risk prediction models. The model performance was evaluated through indicators such as accuracy, F1-score, and ROC curve. We used the best-performing model combined with the SHAP algorithm for feature importance analysis and built a visualization risk prediction system on the web page. The LightGMB model exhibited the best predictive performance, and age, alkaline phosphatase, and triglycerides were important features for predicting the risk of hypertension. Users can obtain their risk probability of hypertension and determine the focus of intervention through the visualization system built on the web page. Our research helps doctors and patients to develop personalized prevention and intervention programs for hypertension based on health check data, which has significant clinical and public health significance.
