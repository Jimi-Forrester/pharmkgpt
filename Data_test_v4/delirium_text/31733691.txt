31733691|t|Hallucinations, Delusions and Impulse Control Disorders in Parkinson Disease.
31733691|a|Psychotic and compulsive symptoms in Parkinson disease are highly prevalent and associated with poor outcomes and greater caregiver burden. When acute, delirium should be ruled out or treated accordingly. When chronic, comorbid systemic illnesses, dementia, and psychiatric disorders should be considered. Reduction and discontinuation of anticholinergics, amantadine, dopamine agonists, and levodopa as tolerated, as well as adjunctive clozapine or quetiapine are frequently effective to manage Parkinson disease psychosis. Pimavanserin appears effective but is not widely available, and more experience is needed. Dopamine agonist discontinuation is usually successful for impulse control disorders, but requires frequent monitoring, documentation, and caregiver involvement.
