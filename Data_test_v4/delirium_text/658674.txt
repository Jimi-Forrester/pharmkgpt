658674|t|Normal chromosome banding pattern in Alzheimer's disease.
658674|a|Lymphocyte chromosomes were studied in 10 female patients with Alzheimer's disease, including 5 cases with positive heredity for organic dementia. The chromosomes were analyzed by means of the Giesma banding technique. All patients had a normal karyotype with a completely normal banding pattern in all metaphases analyzed. It may be concluded that chromosomal changes demonstrable with methods available today are not involved in the causation of Alzheimer's disease, whether sporadic or with positive heredity for organic dementia starting in the presenile or senile periods.
