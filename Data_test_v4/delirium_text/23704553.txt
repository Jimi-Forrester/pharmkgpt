23704553|a|Cramer et al. (Reports, 23 March 2012, p. 1503; published online 9 February 2012) demonstrates short-term bexarotene treatment clearing preexisting beta-amyloid deposits from the brains of APP/PS1DeltaE9 mice with low amyloid burden, providing a rationale for repurposing this anticancer agent as an Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutic. Using a nearly identical treatment regimen, we were unable to detect any evidence of drug efficacy despite demonstration of target engagement.
