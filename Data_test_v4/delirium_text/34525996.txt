34525996|a|BACKGROUND: The integration of palliative care into primary health care has been advocated to improve its accessibility and the continuity of care. Recent studies on such an approach have mainly focused on health care cost and utilization. This study aims to evaluate the effects of a community interdisciplinary palliative care program on the symptom experience of patients with advanced disease. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted. The Integrated Palliative Care Outcome Scale was used for monthly assessment to monitor their condition. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to examine changes in symptom experience across time. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients with a predominance of cancer diagnoses, enrolled in the program. They reported anxiety, hardly feeling at peace, and neither receiving information as wanted nor being able to share their feeling with family/friends as more overwhelming than physical symptoms. Improvements in emotional symptoms was statistically significant at 1-month follow up (p < 0.001). Improvements in communication/practical issues were also significant at the 1-month (p < 0.001) and 2-month (p = 0.005) follow-up. However, changes in symptom experiences in the subsequent months were not apparent. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the overwhelming emotional, communication and information needs among patients with advanced diseases and provides empirical evidence of the community palliative care program in short term. Further work is needed to strengthen the medical-social partnership to support care in place albeit health deterioration.
