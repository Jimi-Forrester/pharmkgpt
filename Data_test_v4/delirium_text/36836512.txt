36836512|t|External Validation of Prediction Models for Surgical Complications in People Considering Total Hip or Knee Arthroplasty Was Successful for Delirium but Not for Surgical Site Infection, Postoperative Bleeding, and Nerve Damage: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
36836512|a|Although several models for the prediction of surgical complications after primary total hip or total knee replacement (THA and TKA, respectively) are available, only a few models have been externally validated. The aim of this study was to externally validate four previously developed models for the prediction of surgical complications in people considering primary THA or TKA. We included 2614 patients who underwent primary THA or TKA in secondary care between 2017 and 2020. Individual predicted probabilities of the risk for surgical complication per outcome (i.e., surgical site infection, postoperative bleeding, delirium, and nerve damage) were calculated for each model. The discriminative performance of patients with and without the outcome was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and predictive performance was assessed with calibration plots. The predicted risk for all models varied between <0.01 and 33.5%. Good discriminative performance was found for the model for delirium with an AUC of 84% (95% CI of 0.82-0.87). For all other outcomes, poor discriminative performance was found; 55% (95% CI of 0.52-0.58) for the model for surgical site infection, 61% (95% CI of 0.59-0.64) for the model for postoperative bleeding, and 57% (95% CI of 0.53-0.61) for the model for nerve damage. Calibration of the model for delirium was moderate, resulting in an underestimation of the actual probability between 2 and 6%, and exceeding 8%. Calibration of all other models was poor. Our external validation of four internally validated prediction models for surgical complications after THA and TKA demonstrated a lack of predictive accuracy when applied in another Dutch hospital population, with the exception of the model for delirium. This model included age, the presence of a heart disease, and the presence of a disease of the central nervous system as predictor variables. We recommend that clinicians use this simple and straightforward delirium model during preoperative counselling, shared decision-making, and early delirium precautionary interventions.
