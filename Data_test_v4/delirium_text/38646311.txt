38646311|t|Sensing of Quercetin With Cobalt-Doped Manganese Nanosystems by Electrochemical Method.
38646311|a|BACKGROUND: The pressing need for precise, quick, and affordable detection of diverse biomolecules has led to notable developments in the realm of biosensors. Quercetin, a biomolecule rich in flavonoids predominantly found in our diet, is sensed by the electrochemical method. The electrochemical properties show remarkable improvement when Mn2O3 (MO) is doped with cobalt (Co).  Aim: This study aimed to investigate the biomolecule sensing of quercetin using Co-doped MO by electrochemical method.  Materials and methods: Co-doped MO nanospheres were prepared by hydrothermal method. The crystal structure of the synthesized material was evaluated by using X-ray diffraction analysis. The sample morphology was assessed by using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) techniques. The cyclic voltammetry technique was used for the detection of quercetin biomolecules.  Results: The synthesized Co-doped MO appeared to be spherical in morphology in FE-SEM. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy showed the only presence of Co, Mn, and O, which confirmed the purity of the sample. The modified electrode sensed the biomolecule with a higher current of 7.35 microA than the bare glassy carbon electrode of 6.1 microA. CONCLUSION: The Co-doped MO exhibited enhanced conductivity, reactivity, and electrochemical performance. This tailored approach will help in the optimization of material properties toward specific biomolecule sensing applications.
