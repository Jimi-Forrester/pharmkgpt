39860453|a|Background: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive, chronic eye disease with no permanent cure currently available. Symptoms of the disease, including distorted and blurred vision and gradual loss of central vision, significantly aggravate patients' daily functioning. The purpose of this study was to assess the acceptance of the disease among patients diagnosed with neovascular age-related macular degeneration before treatment and after receiving seven intravitreal injections and to determine how it was related to the values of visual parameters. Methods: This survey-based study was carried out using the author's questionnaire and a standardized research tool, the Acceptance of Illness Scale (AIS). It also involved the analysis of the patients' medical records. Results: The study included 121 patients (121 eyes), including 60 women and 61 men. The age range of the participants was 51-90 years. The mean and median age of the participants was 75 years. After undergoing a series of intravitreal injections, statistically significant improvements were observed in the degree of illness acceptance according to the AIS score. Data analysis revealed that the degree of disease acceptance was significantly related to visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. Conclusions: The acceptance of the disease among the study participants from the beginning of the therapy until receiving a series of seven intravitreal injections was at an average level. Acceptance of the disease was better before the beginning of the therapy, due to higher values of corrected visual acuity, and after the therapy, because of higher values of contrast sensitivity and corrected visual acuity.
