37571992|a|Objective: In neuropsychological evaluations, assessing cognitive functioning is often achieved using objective neuropsychological measures, whereas subjective informant reports are typically obtained to determine manifest daily functioning. Informant reports of participant functioning and their associations with objective participant performance on neuropsychological testing have been shown to vary based on informant characteristics. However, associations among informant characteristics, reported functioning, and neuropsychological performance have not been adequately examined with Mexican American or other Hispanic/Latino samples, despite these populations' disproportionately higher rates of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. Method: We examined associations of informant characteristics with informant reports of participant functioning (assessed via the Functional Activities Questionnaire [FAQ]), and potential moderating effects of these characteristics on associations between reported functioning and participant performance on neuropsychological testing, for Mexican American adult participants in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center cohort (n = 294). Results: Female informants reported significantly worse participant functioning compared to male informants (p = .035, r = .126). Moreover, significant associations between reported functioning and memory performance were observed for participants with female informants, but not for those with male informants (p = .024, r = .138). Higher levels of informant education were associated with significantly worse participant functioning (p = .011, r = .151). However, informant education did not moderate associations between reported functioning and neuropsychological performance (ps > .05). Conclusions: Compared to male informants, female informants may provide subjective reports of Mexican American participant functioning that more closely corroborate objective participant performance in memory.
