35026532|a|Based on multitarget-directed ligands approach, through two rounds of screening, a series of 2-aminoalkyl-6-(2-hydroxyphenyl)pyridazin-3(2H)-one derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated as innovative multifunctional agents against Alzheimer's disease. In vitro biological assays indicated that most of the hybrids were endowed with great AChE inhibitory activity, excellent antioxidant activity and moderate Abeta1-42 aggregation inhibition. Taken both efficacy and balance into account, 12a was identified as the optimal multifunctional ligand with significant inhibition of AChE (EeAChE, IC50 = 0.20 muM; HuAChE, IC50 = 37.02 nM) and anti-Abeta activity (IC50 = 1.92 muM for self-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation; IC50 = 1.80 muM for disaggregation of Abeta1-42 fibrils; IC50 = 2.18 muM for Cu2+-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation; IC50 = 1.17 muM for disaggregation of Cu2+-induced Abeta1-42 fibrils; 81.7% for HuAChE-induced Abeta1-40 aggregation). Moreover, it was equipped with the potential to serve as antioxidant (3.03 Trolox equivalents), metals chelator and anti-neuroinflammation agent for synergetic treatment. Finally, in vivo study demonstrated that 12a, with suitable BBB permeability (log BB = -0.61), could efficaciously ameliorate cognitive dysfunction on scopolamine-treated mice by regulating cholinergic system and oxidative stress simultaneously. Altogether, these results highlight the potential of 12a as an innovative balanced multifunctional candidate for Alzheimer's disease treatment.
