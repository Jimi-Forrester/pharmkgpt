37930233|a|OBJECTIVE: To learn about the experience of families of children and adolescents in psychological distress facing hospitalization in a psychiatric inpatient unit of a general university hospital. METHOD: This is a qualitative phenomenological-social study, with data collection carried out from February to March 2022 through open interviews, analyzed using Alfred Schutz's framework with the construction of categories of meaning. RESULTS: Based on the analysis of eight interviews, it was possible to understand changes in the families' way of life, impacts on their routine, work, and social relationships. Their expectations were about the recovery of mental health and autonomy. CONCLUSION: This study allowed us to understand the experience of families faced with the hospitalization of children and adolescents in psychological distress and understand their members' needs. The need for implementation of care spaces that incorporate the relationship between the multidisciplinary team and the family is highlighted.
