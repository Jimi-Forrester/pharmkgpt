37762318|t|Circulating Sphingolipids in Insulin Resistance, Diabetes and Associated Complications.
37762318|a|Sphingolipids play an important role in the development of diabetes, both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, as well as in the development of both micro- and macro-vascular complications. Several reviews have been published concerning the role of sphingolipids in diabetes but most of the emphasis has been on the possible mechanisms by which sphingolipids, mainly ceramides, contribute to the development of diabetes. Research on circulating levels of the different classes of sphingolipids in serum and in lipoproteins and their importance as biomarkers to predict not only the development of diabetes but also of its complications has only recently emerged and it is still in its infancy. This review summarizes the previously published literature concerning sphingolipid-mediated mechanisms involved in the development of diabetes and its complications, focusing on how circulating plasma sphingolipid levels and the relative content carried by the different lipoproteins may impact their role as possible biomarkers both in the development of diabetes and mainly in the development of diabetic complications. Further studies in this field may open new therapeutic avenues to prevent or arrest/reduce both the development of diabetes and progression of its complications.
