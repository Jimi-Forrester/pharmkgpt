36579076|a|There has been limited research on encephalitis/encephalopathy, which is a less common coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) neurological complication. The differentiation between stroke and encephalopathy with stroke mimickers is challenging in patients with COVID-19. Here, we describe a case of COVID-19-related encephalopathy mimicking stroke that was successfully treated with high-dose steroid pulse therapy. The patient suddenly experienced language disturbance with a left facial droop and symmetric numbness in his upper limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans revealed hyperintensities in both the white matter and splenium. No pneumonia was observed. MRI abnormalities and neurological symptoms resolved after steroid pulse therapy and administration of remdesivir. High-dose steroid pulse treatment (for 3 days) might alleviate COVID-19-related encephalopathy.
