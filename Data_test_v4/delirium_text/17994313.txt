17994313|a|Very little data exist to evaluate the value of longitudinal CSF biological markers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most studies indicate that tau and amyloid beta markers do not reflect disease progression. We now report on a longitudinal, three-time point, CSF Isoprostane (IsoP) and quantitative MRI study that examined 11 normal elderly (NL) volunteers and 6 Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients. After 4 years, all 6 MCI patients declined to AD and 2 of the NL subjects declined to MCI. At baseline and longitudinally, the MCI patients showed reduced delayed memory, increased IsoP levels, and reduced medial temporal lobe gray matter concentrations as compared to NL. A group comprised of all decliners to AD or to MCI (n = 8) was distinguished at baseline from the stable NL controls (n = 9) by IsoP with 100% accuracy.Moreover, both at baseline and longitudinally, the IsoP measures significantly improved the diagnostic and predictive outcomes of conventional memory testing and quantitative MRI measurements. These data indicate that IsoP is potentially useful for both the early detection of AD-related pathology and for monitoring the course of AD.
