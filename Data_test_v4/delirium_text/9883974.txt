9883974|t|Sensitivity to ageing of the limbic dopaminergic system: a review.
9883974|a|The limbic system includes the complex of brain centres, nuclei and connections that provide the anatomical substrate for emotions. Although the presence of small amounts of dopamine (DA) in several limbic structures has been recognized for a long time, for many years it was thought that limbic DA represented a precursor of noradrenaline in the biosynthetic pathway of catecholamines. More recent evidence has shown that limbic centres and nuclei are supplied with a dopaminergic innervation arising from the ventral tegmental area (field A10) and in smaller amounts from the mesencephalic A9 field. The dopaminergic limbic system is sensitive to ageing. Parameters of dopaminergic neurotransmission (DA levels, biosynthetic and catabolic markers and DA receptors) undergo age-related changes which depend on the structure and species investigated and are characterized mainly by a decline of different parameters examined. In this paper, the influence of ageing on DA biosynthesis, levels, metabolism and receptors are reviewed in laboratory rodents, monkeys and humans as well as in cases of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The possibility that changes of dopaminergic neurotransmission markers in the limbic system are associated with cognitive impairment and psychotic symptoms affecting the elderly is discussed. Better knowledge of dopaminergic neurotransmission mechanisms in the so-called physiological ageing and in senile dementia may provide new insights in the treatment of behavioural alterations frequently occurring in old age.
