33783286|t|Flavonoids from edible fruits as therapeutic agents in neuroinflammation - a comprehensive review and update.
33783286|a|Neuroinflammation is a key process in the pathogenesis of many neurological disorders, i.e. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, there are no anti-inflammatory medical interventions recommended so far in the treatment of neuroinflammation-related brain disorders. Therefore, the burden of searching for effective and safe antineuroinflammatory agents is well founded, especially in the aging society. Compounds of plant origin, mainly (poly)phenols, have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Notably, the role of flavonoids in ameliorating neuroinflammation is in the limelight. Thus, we used comprehensive literature retrieval to summarize the effects and active components of edible fruits and their phenolic compounds. As a result, this review presents a valuable summary of results of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies on the antineuroinflammatory effects of edible fruits and their (poly)phenolic extracts as well as dietary flavonoids and other selected (poly)phenols based on the detailed description of foregoing studies. Additionally, problems resulting from the limited bioavailability of (poly)phenols were discussed.
