35401099|t|Association of the Protein-Quality-Control Protein Ubiquilin-1 With Alzheimer's Disease Both in vitro and in vivo.
35401099|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) belongs to a class of diseases characterized by progressive accumulation and aggregation of pathogenic proteins, particularly Abeta proteins. Genetic analysis has identified UBQLN1 as an AD candidate gene. Ubiquilin-1 levels reduce with AD progression, suggesting a potential loss-of-function mechanism. The ubiquilin-1 protein is involved in protein quality control (PQC), which plays essential roles in cellular growth and normal cell function. Ubiquilin-1 regulates gamma-secretase by increasing endoproteolysis of PS1, a key gamma-secretase component. Presently, the effects of ubiquilin-1 on cellular physiology as well as Abeta-related events require further investigation. Here, we investigated the effects of ubiquilin-1 on cellular growth and viability in association with APP (amyloid-beta protein precursor), APP processing-related beta-secretase (BACE1, BACE) and gamma-secretase using cell and animal-based models. We showed that loss-of-function in Drosophila ubqn suppresses human APP and human BACE phenotypes in wing veins and altered cell number and tissue compartment size in the wing. Additionally, we performed cell-based studies and showed that silencing UBQLN1 reduced cell viability and increased caspase-3 activity. Overexpression of UBQLN1 significantly reduced Abeta levels. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of gamma-secretase increased ubiquilin-1 protein levels, suggesting a mechanism that regulates ubiquilin-1 levels which may associate with reduced Abeta reduction by inhibiting gamma-secretase. Collectively, our results support not only a loss-of-function mechanism of ubiquilin-1 in association with AD, but also support the significance of targeting ubiquilin-1-mediated PQC as a potential therapeutic strategy for AD.
