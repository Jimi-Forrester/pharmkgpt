37537738|t|[How Useful is Brain MRI for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease?]
37537738|a|MR imaging is often used in assessing patients with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. Assessment is done through quantitative imaging analysis in addition to visual assessment using structural MRI. Advanced MRI techniques, such as diffusion MRI, functional MRI, arterial spin labeling (ASL), and MR spectroscopy, are also potential imaging biomarkers. In this article, we will outline the current status in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using these techniques.
