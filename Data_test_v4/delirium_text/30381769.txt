30381769|t|Spinal Anaesthesia for Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy in Parkinson's Disease.
30381769|a|Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, presents with resting tremor, muscle rigidity and bradykinesia. Affecting multiple organ-systems, it's an important cause of peri-operative morbidity. General anaesthesia may deteriorate cardio-pulmonary and neuro-cognitive functions; moreover, medications used may interact with anti-parkinsonian agents. Spinal anaesthesia is usually avoided in Parkinson's disease. However, it offers neurologic monitoring and less surgical stress response and avoids complications of general anaesthesia. This case report aims to demonstrate application of spinal anaesthesia for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a Parkinson's elderly with pulmonary dysfunction and anticipated difficult airway management. Sensory blockade of third thoracic dermatome was achieved. Bupivacaine was instilled intra-peritoneally. Surgery was smooth at low intra-abdominal pressure. Regular Paracetamol provided satisfactory post-operative analgesia. Single episode of post-operative vomiting was effectively managed. Without deterioration, patient was discharged from hospital on third day. Spinal anaesthesia is a valid technique for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in needy patients with multiple peri-operative risks.
