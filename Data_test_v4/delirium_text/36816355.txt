36816355|t|Comprehensive Analysis of Transcriptomic Profiles Identified the Prediction of Prognosis and Drug Sensitivity of Aminopeptidase-Like 1 (NPEPL1) for Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.
36816355|a|Aminopeptidase-like 1 (NPEPL1) is a member of the aminopeptidase group that plays a role in the development and progression of various diseases. Expression of NPEPL1 has been reported to be involved in prostate, breast, and colorectal cancers. However, the role and mechanism of NPEPL1 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) are unclear. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Human Protein Atlas (HPA) databases were used to predict the relationship between clinicopathological features and NPEPL1 expression. Changes in immune status and drug sensitivity with NPEPL1 expression were analyzed by the "CIBERSORT" function in R software. The results found that NPEPL1 expression was upregulated in ccRCC tissues, with expression progressively increasing with ccRCC stage and grade. Patients with high NPEPL1 expression presented with a poor prognosis across different clinicopathological features. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that aberrant NPEPL1 expression was an independent risk factor for ccRCC. The nomogram showed that NPEPL1 expression improved the accuracy of predicting the prognosis of ccRCC patients. The Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that NPEPL1 may be involved in the development of ccRCC through the voltage-gated calcium channel complex, channel activity, cAMP signaling pathway, and oxytocin signaling pathway. The coexpression analysis found that NPEPL1 altered tumor characteristics by interacting with related genes. The "CIBERSORT" analysis showed that elevated NPEPL1 expression was followed by an enrichment of regulatory T cells and follicular helper T cells in the microenvironment. The drug sensitivity analysis found patients with high NPEPL1 expression had a higher benefit from axitinib, cisplatin, and GSK429286A. In conclusion, upregulation of NPEPL1 expression was involved in ccRCC prognosis and treatment. NPEPL1 could be used as a therapeutic target to guide clinical dosing.
