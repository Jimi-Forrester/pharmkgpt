37168731|t|Functional connectivity in older adults-the effect of cerebral small vessel disease.
37168731|a|Ageing is associated with functional reorganization that is mainly characterized by declining functional connectivity due to general neurodegeneration and increasing incidence of disease. Functional connectivity has been studied across the lifespan; however, there is a paucity of research within the older groups (>=75 years) where neurodegeneration and disease prevalence are at its highest. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated associations between age and functional connectivity and the influence of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD)-a common age-related morbidity-in 167 community-dwelling older adults aged 75-91 years (mean = 80.3 +- 3.8). Resting-state functional MRI was used to determine functional connectivity within ten standard networks and calculate the whole-brain graph theoretical measures global efficiency and clustering coefficient. CSVD features included white matter hyperintensities, lacunar infarcts, cerebral microbleeds, and atrophy that were assessed in each individual and a composite score was calculated. Both main and interaction effects (age*CSVD features) on functional connectivity were studied. We found stable levels of functional connectivity across the age range. CSVD was not associated with functional connectivity measures. To conclude, our data show that the functional architecture of the brain is relatively unchanged after 75 years of age and not differentially affected by individual levels of vascular pathology.
