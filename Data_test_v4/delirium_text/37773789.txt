37773789|t|Postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing aortic surgery: A single-center retrospective study.
37773789|a|Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are among the most common complications after cardiovascular surgery. This study aimed to explore the real incidence of and risk factors for PPC in patients with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) who underwent total aortic arch replacement combined with the frozen elephant trunk (TAR + FET). In total, 305 ATAAD patients undergoing TAR + FET from January 2021 to August 2022 in a single-center were divided into PPCs or non-PPCs group. The incidence of PPCs was calculated, risk factors of PPCs were analyzed, and postoperative outcomes were compared between these 2 groups. The incidence of any PPC was 29.2%. And the incidence of respiratory infection, respiratory failure, pleural effusion, atelectasis, pneumothorax, acute respiratory distress syndrome, aspiration pneumonitis, pulmonary edema and bronchospasm was 23.0%, 12.5%, 10.5%, 1.0%, 0.7%, 1.0%, 0%, 0.7%, 0%, respectively. The logistic regression analysis revealed that the history of diabetes, history of renal dysfunction, preoperative SpO2 <90%, cardiopulmonary bypass duration, fresh frozen plasma volume and platelet concentrates volume were independent risk factors for PPCs. Among 2 groups, postoperative ventilation duration, postoperative length of stay in intensive care unit and hospital were (73.5 +- 79.0 vs 24.8 +- 35.2 hours; P < .001), (228.3 +- 151.2 vs 95.2 +- 72.0 hours; P < .001) and (17.9 +- 8.8 vs 11.5 +- 6.2 days; P < .001). There was no difference between 2 groups of in-hospital mortality rate. Additionally, other short-term outcomes were also significantly poorer in patients with PPCs. PPCs are common in ATAAD patients undergoing TAR + FET, and could be multifactorial. PPCs occurrence are associated with poor patient outcomes postoperatively and worth further investigation.
