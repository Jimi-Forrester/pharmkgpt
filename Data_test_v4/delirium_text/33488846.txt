33488846|t|Responsive Expression of MafF to beta-Amyloid-Induced Oxidative Stress.
33488846|a|The small musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (sMaf) proteins MafF, MafG, and MafK are basic region leucine zipper- (bZIP-) type transcription factors and display tissue- or stimulus-specific expression patterns. As the oxidative stress reactive proteins, sMafs are implicated in various neurological disorders. In the present study, the expressions of sMafs were investigated across five databases gathering transcriptomic data from 74 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and 66 controls in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The expression of MafF was increased in the hippocampus of AD patients, which was negatively correlated with the expression of the glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC). Furthermore, MafF was significantly increased in patients with Braak stage V-VI, compared to those with Braak stage III-IV. beta-Amyloid (Abeta), a strong inducer of oxidative stress, plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD. The responsive expressions of sMafs to Abeta-induced oxidative stress were studied in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD, Abeta intrahippocampal injection rats, and several human cell lines from different tissue origins. This study revealed that only the induction of MafF was accompanied with reduction of GCLC and glutathione (GSH). MafF knockdown suppressed the increase of GSH induced by Abeta. Among sMafs, MafF is the most responsive to Abeta-induced oxidative stress and might potentiate the inhibition of antioxidation. These results provide a better understanding of sMaf modulation in AD and highlight MafF as a potential therapeutic target in AD.
