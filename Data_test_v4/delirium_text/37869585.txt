37869585|t|Psychopathology associated with cardiac pacing in Tanzania: A case series.
37869585|a|Emotional disarray linked to interventional procedures may potentially aggravate previous psychiatric conditions or even precipitate new psychopathologies. Despite of the well-known deleterious impact of mental health disorders on cardiac outcomes, psychological disturbances are relatively understudied yet of vital importance to the overall health of post-pacing patients. In this case series we present a spectrum of mental illnesses observed in a cohort of patients who underwent permanent pacemaker implantation in Tanzania's national referral cardiac centre. Five individuals of African origin aged between 58 and 81 years presented to Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute with clinical conditions warranting permanent pacemaker implantation. All five denied prior history of mental illness, however, after thorough psychiatric reviews; organic brain syndrome, panic disorder, brief psychotic disorder, adjustment disorder and major depressive disorder diagnoses were reached. All five were successfully channeled for medical psychotherapy. To conclude, this case series illustrates variable consequences of poor psychological adaptation to implantable cardiac devices, and it underscores the importance of continued psychological evaluation to such patients.
