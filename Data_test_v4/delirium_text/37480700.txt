37480700|t|Suffering in silence - Cardiac surgery patients recalling hypoactive delirium a qualitative descriptive study.
37480700|a|OBJECTIVES: Postoperative delirium affects up to 50% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Delirium phenotypes are commonly divided into hyperactive and hypoactive, with hypoactive symptoms (reduced motor activity and withdrawal) often being overlooked due to their discreet character. Although the consequences of hypoactive delirium are severe, studies focusing on patients' experiences of hypoactive delirium are scarce. The aim of the study was to describe cardiac surgery patients' experiences of hypoactive delirium. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY/DESIGN: We used qualitative descriptive semi-structured interviews with an inductive, latent approach. Twelve patients with hypoactive symptoms of delirium after cardiac surgery were purposefully selected. Interview data were analysed by qualitative content analysis. FINDINGS: Two themes based on eight sub-themes emerged. "Dream or reality in parallel worlds" included disturbing experiences of existing in parallel realities with cognitive effects, residual nightmares, and illusions that occasionally persisted after hospital discharge. "Managing the state of hypoactive delirium" included experiences of intellectually dealing with hypoactive delirium with assumptions of causes and cures, and through interactions like communicating with others. CONCLUSION: Participants experienced hypoactive delirium as extensive and long-lasting with perceptions of existing in parallel realities. The findings emphasize the need for healthcare professionals to have expertise in hypoactive delirium and its fluctuating course, as the delirium of many patients may be undetected and undiagnosed. Improving the use of screening tools for clinical practice is essential for the detection of hypoactive delirium, and a person-centred approach is needed to properly care for this group of patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: The challenges in the recognition of hypoactive delirium need to be emphasized because the syndrome is still overlooked. The use of screening tools in clinical practice is essential. A person-centred approach supports relationships between delirious patients and healthcare professionals.
