35401111|t|Human Galectin-7 Gene LGALS7 Promoter Sequence Polymorphisms and Risk of Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage: A Prospective Study.
35401111|a|Background and purpose: Despite evidence for the role of genetic factors in stroke, only a small proportion of strokes have been clearly attributed to monogenic factors, due to phenotypic heterogeneity. The goal of this study was to determine whether a significant relationship exists between human galectin-7 gene LGALS7 promoter region polymorphisms and the risk of stroke due to non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Methods: This two-stage genetic association study included an initial exploratory stage followed by a discovery stage. During the exploratory stage, transgenic galectin-7 mice or transgenic mice with the scrambled sequence of the hairpin structure -silenced down gene LGALS7-were generated and then expressed differentially expressed proteins and galectin-7-interacting proteins were identified through proteomic analysis. During the discovery stage, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping approach was used to determine associations between 2 LGALS7 SNPs and ICH stroke risk for a cohort of 24 patients with stroke of the Chinese Han population and 70 controls. Results: During the exploratory phase, LGALS7 expression was found to be decreased in TGLGALS-DOWN mice as compared to its expression in TGLGALS mice. During the discovery phase, analysis of LGALS7 sequences of 24 non-traumatic ICH cases and 70 controls led to the identification of 2 ICH susceptibility loci: a genomic region on 19q13.2 containing two LGALS7 SNPs, rs567785577 and rs138945880, whereby the A allele of rs567785577 and the T allele of rs138945880 were associated with greater risk of contracting ICH [for T and A vs. C and G, unadjusted odds ratio (OR) = 13.5; 95% CI = 2.249-146.5; p = 0.002]. This is the first study to genotype the galectin-7 promoter in patients with hemorrhagic stroke. Genotype and allele association tests and preliminary analysis of patients with stroke revealed that a single locus may be a genetic risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke. Conclusion: A and T alleles of two novel SNP loci of 19q13.2, rs567785577 and rs138945880, respectively, were evaluated for associations with susceptibility to ICH. Further studies with expanded case numbers that include subjects of other ethnic populations are needed to elucidate mechanisms underlying associations between these SNPs and ICH risk.
