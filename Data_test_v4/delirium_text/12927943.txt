12927943|t|"They're just going to get worse anyway": perspectives on rehabilitation for nursing home residents with dementia.
12927943|a|UNLABELLED: In recent years, researchers have provided data to show that individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) can learn new information and functional behaviors, despite significant declarative memory deficits. However, clinicians in long-term care frequently have difficulty justifying and providing needed services to persons with Alzheimer's disease in LTC settings. In this paper, implicit learning will be discussed as a theoretical rationale to support rehabilitation along with practical issues related to the provision of speech-language pathology services for residents with Alzheimer's disease in LTC settings. LEARNING OUTCOMES: After reading this article, learners will be able to: (1) Define implicit learning; (2) discuss evidence for implicit learning in Alzheimer's disease; (3) describe how to capitalize on implicit learning during rehabilitation for individuals with Alzheimer's disease; (4) explain how to justify and provide interventions for individuals with Alzheimer's disease in LTC settings.
