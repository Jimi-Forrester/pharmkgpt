6858483|t|[Study of the relation between the clinical picture of alcoholism and the constitutional-morphologic profile of patients who have sustained delirium tremens and schizophrenia complicated by alcoholism].
6858483|a|Two hundred and forty patients with psychotic alcoholism and 200 patients with paranoic schizophrenia (48 of them suffered from alcoholism too) were examined clinicoanthropometrically. A definite syndromotaxis in patients with psychotic alcoholism and the peculiarities of the disease manifestations in patients with schizophrenia complicated by alcoholism in discrete somatotypical groups (classified according to the Rees Eysenk index) were discovered. The constitutional morphophenotype is regarded as an additional differential-diagnostic criterion of the disease clinical manifestations.
