36725353|t|Lymphatic Intervention, the Frontline of Modern Lymphatic Medicine: Part II. Classification and Treatment of the Lymphatic Disorders.
36725353|a|Lymphatic disorders encompass a broad spectrum of diseases involving the lymphatic system, ranging from traumatic lymphatic leaks to lymphatic malformations. Lymphatic disorders can be categorized into traumatic and non-traumatic disorders according to their etiology. These two categories may be further divided into subgroups depending on the anatomical location of the lymphatic pathology and their association with clinical syndromes. Thoracic duct embolization was a milestone in the field of lymphatic intervention that encouraged the application of percutaneous embolization techniques to treat leaks and reflux disorders in the lymphatic system. Additional access routes for embolization, including retrograde thoracic duct and transhepatic lymphatic access, have also been developed. This article comprehensively reviews a variety of options for the treatment of lymphatic disorders, from conservative management to the most recent embolization techniques.
