36948200|a|BACKGROUND: The neurological manifestations in COVID-19 adversely impact acute illness and post-disease quality of life. Limited data exist regarding the association of neurological symptoms and comorbid individuals. OBJECTIVE: To assess neurological symptoms in hospitalized patients with acute COVID-19 and multicomorbidities. METHODS: Between June 2020 and July 2020, inpatients aged 18 or older, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, admitted to the Hospital Sao Paulo (Federal University of Sao Paulo), a tertiary referral center for high complexity cases, were questioned about neurological symptoms. The Composite Autonomic Symptom Score 31 (COMPASS-31) questionnaire was used. The data were analyzed as a whole and whether subjective olfactory dysfunction was present or not. RESULTS: The mean age of the sample was 55 +- 15.12 years, and 58 patients were male. The neurological symptoms were mostly xerostomia (71%), ageusia/hypogeusia (50%), orthostatic intolerance (49%), anosmia/hyposmia (44%), myalgia (31%), dizziness (24%), xerophthalmia (20%), impaired consciousness (18%), and headache (16%). Furthermore, 91% of the patients had a premorbidity. The 44 patients with subjective olfactory dysfunction were more likely to have hypertension, diabetes, weakness, shortness of breath, ageusia/hypogeusia, dizziness, orthostatic intolerance, and xerophthalmia. The COMPASS-31 score was higher than that of previously published controls (14.85 +- 12.06 vs. 8.9 +- 8.7). The frequency of orthostatic intolerance was 49% in sample and 63.6% in those with subjective olfactory dysfunction (2.9-fold higher risk compared to those without). CONCLUSION: A total of 80% of inpatients with multimorbidity and acute COVID-19 had neurological symptoms. Chemical sense and autonomic symptoms stood out. Orthostatic intolerance occurred in around two-thirds of the patients with anosmia/hyposmia. Hypertension and diabetes were common, mainly in those with anosmia/hyposmia.
