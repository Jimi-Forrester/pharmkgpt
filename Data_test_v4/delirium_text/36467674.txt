36467674|a|Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition between normal aging and dementia; nearly 10-15% of MCI patients develop dementia annually. There are no effective interventions for MCI progression. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that has attempted to improve the overall cognitive function of MCI patients. However, it does not affect episodic memory improvement. Methods: In this study, we engaged 15 clinically diagnosed MCI patients and normal controls to explore the effect of dual-targeted rTMS on progressing cognitive function, particularly episodic memory in MCI patients. Resting-state EEG recordings and neuropsychological assessments were conducted before and after the intervention. EEG features were extracted using an adaptive algorithm to calculate functional connectivity alterations in relevant brain regions and the mechanisms of altered brain functional networks in response to dual-target rTMS. Results: The study revealed that the functional brain connectivity between the right posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC) and the right dorsal caudate nucleus (DC) was significantly reduced in MCI patients compared to normal controls (p < 0.001). Dual-target rTMS increased the strength of the reduced functional connectivity (p < 0.001), which was related to cognitive enhancement (p < 0.05). Conclusion: This study provides a new stimulation protocol for rTMS intervention. Improving the functional connectivity of the right PCC to the right DC is a possible mechanism by which rTMS improves overall cognitive and memory function in MCI patients.
