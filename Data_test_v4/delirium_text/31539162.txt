PATIENTS AND METHODS: 122 patients undergoing thoracoscopic radical resection of lung cancer in The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University from April 2009 to January 2012 were selected as the subjects of the study. Among them, 68 patients were anesthetized with dexmedetomidine combined with dezocine as a study group, 54 patients with midazolam combined with fentanyl as a control group. The onset of anesthetic, operation time, awakening time, extubation time, and recovery time was compared. The mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), and heart rate (HR) were compared before anesthesia (t0), at extubation (t1), 10 min after extubation (t2), and when patients left anesthesia recovery room (t3). The postoperative sedation score (Ramsay), modified the objective pain score (MOPS), and the pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium (PAED) score were compared at the time of the postoperative awakening (b1), 30 min after awakening (b2), 1 hour after awakening (b3), and 3 hours after awakening (b4). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in MAP, CVP, and HR between the study group and the control group at t0 (p > 0.05). The scores of PAED at b3 and b4 in the study group were lower than those in the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The anesthesia effect of dexmedetomidine combined with dezocine in thoracoscopic radical resection of lung cancer is better and safer than other drugs, and it can produce good sedation and analgesic effect.
