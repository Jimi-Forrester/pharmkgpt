35882875|t|Neuromonitoring depth of anesthesia and its association with postoperative delirium.
35882875|a|Delirium after surgery or Postoperative delirium (POD) is an underdiagnosed entity, despite its severity and high incidence. Patients with delirium require a longer hospital stay and present more postoperative complications, which also increases hospital costs. Given its importance and the lack of specific treatment, multifactorial preventive strategies are evidenced based. Our hypothesis is that using general anaesthesia and avoiding the maximum time in excessively deep anaesthetic planes through BIS neuromonitoring device will reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients over the age of 65 and their hospitalization stay. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: The visible BIS group and the hidden BIS neuromonitoring group. In the visible BIS group, the depth of anaesthesia was sustained between 40 and 60, while in the other group the depth of anaesthesia was guided by hemodynamic parameters and the Minimum Alveolar Concentration value. Patients were assessed three times a day by research staff fully trained during the 72 h after the surgery to determine the presence of POD, and there was follow-up at 30 days. Patients who developed delirium (n = 69) was significantly lower in the visible BIS group (n = 27; 39.1%) than in the hidden BIS group (n = 42, 60.9%; p = 0.043). There were no differences between the subtypes of delirium in the two groups. Patients in the hidden BIS group were kept for 26.6 +- 14.0 min in BIS values < 40 versus 11.6 +- 10.9 min (p < 0.001) for the patients in the visible BIS group. The hospital stay was lower in the visible BIS group 6.56 +- 6.14 days versus the 9.30 +- 7.11 days (p < 0.001) for the hidden BIS group, as well as mortality; hidden BIS 5.80% versus visible BIS 0% (p = 0.01). A BIS-guided depth of anaesthesia is associated with a lower incidence of delirium. Patients with intraoperative neuromonitoring stayed for a shorter time in excessively deep anaesthetic planes and presented a reduction in hospital stay and mortality.
