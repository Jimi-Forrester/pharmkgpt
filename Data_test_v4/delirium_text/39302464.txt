39302464|t|Fermented Dairy Products, Musculoskeletal and Mental Health in Older Adults: is There Evidence to Support Benefits that go Beyond Those of Non-Fermented Dairy Products?
39302464|a|Fermented dairy products have recently gained popularity due to their purported health benefits, nevertheless, their role in ageing remains uncertain. This narrative review aims to evaluate evidence from observational (prospective) and interventional studies on the potential benefits of fermented dairy product consumption for musculoskeletal and mental health in older adults. Additionally, it seeks to determine whether any observed benefits surpass those of non-fermented dairy products and to identify directions for future research. Prospective studies support either favourable or neutral associations of fermented dairy products with outcomes of musculoskeletal health or neutral associations with mental health outcomes, whilst it remains unclear if the benefits observed with fermented dairy products go beyond those of the non-fermented dairy foods. Few interventional studies suggest overall favourable effects of yogurt and cheese on musculoskeletal health in older adults but given their small number (N = 6) and heterogeneity, they do not allow a clear assessment or definitive recommendations for fermented dairy intake. Interventional studies reporting mental health outcomes are largely lacking for this age group (N = 1). Given the very limited evidence for the effectiveness of fermented dairy products, future well-designed prospective and randomized controlled trials are needed to better understand their benefits (especially compared to those of non-fermented dairy foods), their characteristics and the quantities required to offer protection against musculoskeletal and/or mental health ageing.
