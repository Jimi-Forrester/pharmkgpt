27127724|a|BACKGROUND: To date, the relationship between thyroid dysfunction and subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD)-induced cognitive impairments still remains elusive. METHODS: Cognitive performances were examined in 215 participants, including 54 healthy participants, 52 SIVD patients with no dementia (SIVDND), 55 patients with mild cognitive impairment (SVMCI), and 54 patients with vascular dementia (VD). Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), total triiodothyronine (TT3), free triiodothyronine (FT3), total thyroxine (TT4) and free thyroxine (FT4), thyroglobulin antibody (TGA), and antithyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Abs) were quantified by radioimmunoassay or ELISA. RESULTS: A close correlation between thyroid status and cognitive dysfunction in SIVD was observed. Serum TT3 and FT3 levels decreased, whereas serum TSH level increased, with the decline in cognitive functions. Furthermore, TT3 levels showed a positive correlation, whereas TSH level showed a negative correlation, with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Our results suggested that thyroid function was associated with cognitive impairments induced by SIVD. Also, thyroid function and thyroid hormone level could be a risk factor in the development of SIVD. Serum TT3 and TSH levels might also be used as biomarkers for cognitive dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: These findings might contribute to a more accurate clinical diagnosis and differentiation among normal controls, SIVDND, SVMCI, and VD patients, in order to develop appropriate intervention approaches for SIVD therapeutic treatment.
