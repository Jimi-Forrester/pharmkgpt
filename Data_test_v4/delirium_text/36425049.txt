36425049|t|A Novel Trial of Mirabegron and Behavioral Modification Including Pelvic Floor Exercise for Overactive Bladder in Parkinson's Disease (MAESTRO).
36425049|a|Overactive bladder (OAB) is experienced by more than half of patients with untreated Parkinson's disease. Treatment of overactive bladder in these patients has included antimuscarinic anticholinergics, raising concerns about the possibility of exacerbating cognitive impairment or constipation. Mirabegron (Myrbetriq), a beta3-receptor agonist, provides relief of OAB without increasing cognitive impairment. While prior studies have examined the effect of mirabegron on OAB in a variety of patient populations, this study is the first controlled, prospective study investigating the effect of mirabegron on overactive bladder in patients with Parkinson's disease. By studying effective treatments for overactive bladder, this trial emphasizes the importance of antimicrobial stewardship so that lower urinary tract symptoms are not treated as lower urinary tract infections with antimicrobials and instead overactive bladder can be treated appropriately with medication. The MAESTRO study compared the effect of adding mirabegron to behavioral modification (including pelvic floor exercises) to behavior modification alone. Results from this novel study show that both the mean absolute change in the volume of micturition (objective measure) and the mean percent change increased significantly between visits two and three in the experimental group using mirabegron. Moreover, improvements in micturition in this study indicate that a larger-scale study of mirabegron with pelvic floor exercises and behavior modification is warranted.
