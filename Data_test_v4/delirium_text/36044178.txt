36044178|t|Attenuating Muscle Mass Loss in Critical Illness: the Role of Nutrition and Exercise.
36044178|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Impaired recovery following an intensive care unit (ICU) admission is thought related to muscle wasting. Nutrition and physical activity are considered potential avenues to attenuate muscle wasting. The aim of this review was to present evidence for these interventions in attenuating muscle loss or improving strength and function. RECENT FINDINGS: Randomised controlled trials on the impact of nutrition or physical activity interventions in critically ill adult patients on muscle mass, strength or function are presented. No nutrition intervention has shown an effect on strength or function, and the effect on muscle mass is conflicting. RCTs on the effect of physical activity demonstrate conflicting results; yet, there is a signal for improved strength and function with higher levels of physical activity, particularly when commenced early. Further research is needed to elucidate the impact of nutrition and physical activity on muscle mass, strength and function, particularly in combination.
