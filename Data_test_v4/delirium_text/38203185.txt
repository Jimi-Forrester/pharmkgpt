38203185|t|Comparative Insight into Microglia/Macrophages-Associated Pathways in Glioblastoma and Alzheimer's Disease.
38203185|a|Microglia and macrophages are pivotal to the brain's innate immune response and have garnered considerable attention in the context of glioblastoma (GBM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. This review delineates the complex roles of these cells within the neuropathological landscape, focusing on a range of signaling pathways-namely, NF-kappaB, microRNAs (miRNAs), and TREM2-that regulate the behavior of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in GBM and disease-associated microglia (DAMs) in AD. These pathways are critical to the processes of neuroinflammation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis, which are hallmarks of GBM and AD. We concentrate on the multifaceted regulation of TAMs by NF-kappaB signaling in GBM, the influence of TREM2 on DAMs' responses to amyloid-beta deposition, and the modulation of both TAMs and DAMs by GBM- and AD-related miRNAs. Incorporating recent advancements in molecular biology, immunology, and AI techniques, through a detailed exploration of these molecular mechanisms, we aim to shed light on their distinct and overlapping regulatory functions in GBM and AD. The review culminates with a discussion on how insights into NF-kappaB, miRNAs, and TREM2 signaling may inform novel therapeutic approaches targeting microglia and macrophages in these neurodegenerative and neoplastic conditions. This comparative analysis underscores the potential for new, targeted treatments, offering a roadmap for future research aimed at mitigating the progression of these complex diseases.
