34757664|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes cognitive impairment in the elderly and is a severe problem worldwide. One of the major reasons for the pathogenesis of AD is thought to be due to the accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides that result in neuronal cell death in the brain. In this study, bioassay-guided fractionation was performed to develop seed compounds for anti-AD drugs that can act as dual inhibitors of BACE1 and Abeta aggregation from secondary metabolites produced by Streptomyces sp. To improve the solubility, the crude extracts were methylated with trimethylsilyl (TMS) diazomethane and then purified to yield polyketides 1-5, including the new compound 1. We synthesized the compounds 6 and 7 (original compounds 2 and 3, respectively), and their activities were evaluated. KS-619-1, the demethylated form of 4 and 5, was isolated and evaluated for its inhibitory activity. The IC50 values for BACE1 and Abeta aggregation were found to be 0.48 and 1.1 muM, respectively, indicating that KS-619-1 could be a lead compound for the development of therapeutic agents for AD.
