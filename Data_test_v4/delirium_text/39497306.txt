39497306|a|BACKGROUND: Women comprise approximately two-thirds of Alzheimer's disease cases. OBJECTIVE: This is the first known study to investigate the role of intersectionality between gender and other social determinants of health (SDOH) in the presentation of cognitive symptoms (i.e., being asymptomatic or symptomatic) among those with pathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: We studied 3107 individuals with Alzheimer's disease neuropathology (ADNP) confirmed at autopsy. Asymptomatic ADNP was defined as the absence of a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia before death (versus symptomatic: diagnosis of MCI/dementia). SDOH included gender, education, ethnoracial group, living alone, and primary language. Multivariable logistic regression tested associations between SDOH and asymptomatic ADNP (versus symptomatic); models were also stratified by gender. RESULTS: Women, Hispanics, those living alone, and more educated individuals were found to have higher odds of asymptomatic ADNP. Non-English speakers had lower odds of asymptomatic ADNP. Both women and men had higher odds of asymptomatic ADNP if Hispanic or living alone. In only women, non-English speakers had lower odds while in only men, more education was associated with higher odds of asymptomatic ADNP. CONCLUSIONS: Gender, education, ethnicity, primary language, and living alone, and intersectionality of gender with primary language, may differentially influence MCI and dementia diagnosis prior to death among those with underlying ADNP. These findings emphasize the need for future Alzheimer's disease research to prioritize social determinants of brain health including their intersectionality with gender and how to inform targeted interventions.
