23377270|t|Association between plasma biomarkers, CDK5 polymorphism and the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
23377270|a|In this study we evaluated biochemical blood serum parameters and the association of Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) gene polymorphisms with the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the Polish population. We observed an elevated total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and homocysteine levels and lower concentrations of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and vitamin B12 in AD patients. However, the analyzed CDK5 polymorphisms were not associated with the biochemical parameters. Moreover, we found no association between the studied polymorphisms and the risk of AD in the Polish population. The meta-analysis of previously published and current study was performed. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that alteration of cholesterol, LDL, HDL, homocysteine and B12 concentration may be an important factor in pathogenesis of AD.
