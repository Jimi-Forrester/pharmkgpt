39574800|t|Alcohol consumption and its association with cancer, cardiovascular, liver and brain diseases: a systematic review of Mendelian randomization studies.
39574800|a|Background: The health effects of alcohol consumption, particularly regarding potential protective benefits of light to moderate intake compared to abstinence, remain a subject of ongoing debate. However, epidemiological studies face limitations due to imprecise exposure measurements and the potential for bias through residual confounding and reverse causation. To address these limitations, we conducted a systematic review of Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies examining the causal relationship between alcohol consumption and cancers, cardiovascular, liver, and neurological diseases. Methodology: We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect and Embase and Europe PMC up to 05/2024 for MR studies investigating the association of genetically predicted alcohol consumption with cancers, cardiovascular, liver and neurological diseases. We assessed methodological quality based on key elements of the MR design a genetic association studies tool. Results: We included 70 MR studies that matched our inclusion criteria. Our review showed a significant association of alcohol consumption with multiple cancers such as oral and oropharyngeal, esophageal, colorectal cancers, hepatocellular carcinoma and cutaneous melanoma. While the available studies did not consistently confirm the adverse or protective effects of alcohol on other cancers, such as lung cancer, as suggested by observational studies. Additionally, MR studies confirmed a likely causal effect of alcohol on the risk of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infraction and vessels disease. However, there was no evidence to support the protective effects of light to moderate alcohol consumption on cognitive function, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as reported in observational studies while our review revealed an increased risk of epilepsy and multiple sclerosis. The available studies provided limited results on the link between alcohol consumption and liver disease. Conclusions: Despite the valuable insights into the causal relationship between alcohol consumption and various health outcomes that MR studies provided, it is worth noting that the inconsistent ability of genetic instrumental variables to distinguish between abstainers, light and moderate drinkers makes it difficult to differentiate between U or J-shaped vs. linear relationships between exposure and outcome. Additional research is necessary to establish formal quality assessment tools for MR studies and to conduct more studies in diverse populations, including non-European ancestries.
