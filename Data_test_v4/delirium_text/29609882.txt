29609882|a|BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols consist of a set of perioperative measures aimed at improving patient recovery and decreasing length of stay and postoperative complications. We assess the implementation and outcomes of an ERAS program for colorectal surgery. METHODS: Single center observational study. Data were collected from consecutive patients undergoing open or laparoscopic colorectal surgery during 2 time periods, 3 years before (Pre-ERAS) and 2 years after (Post-ERAS) the implementation of an ERAS protocol. Baseline characteristics of both groups were compared. The primary outcome was the number of patients with 180 days follow-up with moderate or severe complications; secondary outcomes were postoperative length of stay, and specific complications. Data were extracted from patient records. RESULTS: There were 360 patients in the Pre-ERAS group and 319 patients in the Post-ERAS Group. 214 (59.8%) patients developed at least one complication in the pre ERAS group, versus 163 patients in the Post-ERAS group (51.10%). More patients in the Pre-ERAS group developed moderate or severe complications (31.9% vs. 22.26%, p=0.009); and severe complications (15.5% vs. 5.3%; p<0.0001). The median length of stay was 13 (17) days in Pre-ERAS Group and 11 (10) days in the Post-ERAS Group (p=0.034). No differences were found on mortality rates (4.7% vs. 2.5%; p=0.154), or readmission (6.39% vs. 4.39%; p=0.31). Overall ERAS protocol compliance in the Post-ERAS cohort was 88%. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of ERAS protocol for colorectal surgery was associated with a significantly reduction of postoperative complications and length of stay.
