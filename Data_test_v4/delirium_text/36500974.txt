36500974|t|Evaluation of the Anti-Obesity Effect of Zeaxanthin and Exercise in HFD-Induced Obese Rats.
36500974|a|Obesity is a worldwide epidemic associated with many health problems. One of the new trends in health care is the emphasis on regular exercise and a healthy diet. Zeaxanthin (Zea) is a carotenoid with many beneficial effects on human health. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the combination of Zea and exercise had therapeutic effects on obesity induced by an HFD in rats. Sixty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups of twelve: rats fed a standard diet; rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD); rats fed an HFD with Zea; rats fed an HFD with Exc; and rats fed an HFD with both Zea and Exc. To induce obesity, rats were fed an HFD for twelve weeks. Then, Zea and exercise were introduced with the HFD for five weeks. The results showed that the HFD significantly increased visceral adipose tissue, oxidative stress, and inflammation biomarkers and reduced insulin, high-density lipoprotein, and antioxidant parameters. Treatments with Zea, Exc, and Zea plus Exc reduced body weight gain, triacylglycerol, glucose, total cholesterol, and nitric oxide levels and significantly increased catalase and insulin compared with the HFD group. This study demonstrated that Zea administration and Exc performance appeared to effectively alleviate the metabolic alterations induced by an HFD. Furthermore, Zea and Exc together had a better effect than either intervention alone.
