36819629|t|Predictors of Postoperative Delirium in Older Patients Undergoing Elective Spine Surgery.
36819629|a|Introduction: This prospective study was conducted to investigate the prevalence and predictors of postoperative delirium (POD) in a cohort of patients aged >=65 years who were scheduled to undergo elective spine surgery. Methods: Patients aged >=65 years who were scheduled to undergo elective spine surgery from February 2018 to May 2019 were prospectively recruited for this study. Delirium was diagnosed according to the Confusion Assessment Method algorithm. Candidate predictors included patient characteristics, comorbidities, surgical time, blood loss, preoperative laboratory parameters, and preoperative cognitive function, as assessed by the Mini-Cog test. These variables were compared between patients with and without POD. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the independent predictors of POD. For the continuous variables, a receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the optimal cutoff value for predicting POD. Results: Of the 106 patients included in the study, 12 (11.3%) patients developed POD, with a median time to onset of 3 d and median duration of 2 d. After adjusting for confounders, the occurrence of POD was independently associated with older age, a higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration, and a lower Mini-Cog score. The optimal cutoff point of the Mini-Cog score for predicting the occurrence of POD was <=3. Conclusions: POD was a common complication after spine surgery, showing an incidence of 11.3% in this study. Older age, a higher BUN concentration, and impaired cognition, as defined by the Mini-Cog, were independent predictors of POD. The current results may be useful for early identification of patients at risk of POD and facilitation of targeted interventions for preventing POD or mitigating its severity.
