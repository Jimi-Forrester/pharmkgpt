39713210|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating systemic disorder that has a detrimental impact on the overall well-being of individuals. Emerging research suggests that long non-coding RNAs play a role in neural development and function. Nevertheless, the precise relationship between lncRNAs and Alzheimer's disease remains uncertain. The authors' recent discoveries have uncovered an unconventional mechanism involving the regulation of synaptic plasticity and the functioning of the hippocampal fragile X mental retardation protein 1 (FMR1)-neurotrophin 3 (NTF3) pathway, which is mediated by cancer susceptibility candidate 15 (CASC15). Subsequently, functional rescue experiments were performed to illustrate the efficient delivery of exosomes harboring a significant amount of 2610307p16Rik transcripts, which is the murine equivalent of human CASC15, to the hippocampal region of mice. This resulted in significant improvements in synaptic morphological plasticity and cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice. Given the pivotal involvement of CASC15 in synaptic plasticity and the distinctive regulatory mechanisms of the CASC15-FMR1-NTF3 axis, CASC15 emerges as a promising biomarker for Alzheimer's disease and may even possess potential as a feasible therapeutic target.
