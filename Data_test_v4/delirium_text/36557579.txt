36557579|t|Atypical Pathogens in Adult Community-Acquired Pneumonia and Implications for Empiric Antibiotic Treatment: A Narrative Review.
36557579|a|Atypical pathogens are intracellular bacteria causing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in a significant minority of patients. Legionella spp., Chlamydia pneumoniae and psittaci, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Coxiella burnetii are commonly included in this category. M. pneumoniae is present in 5-8% of CAP, being the second most frequent pathogen after Streptococcus pneumoniae. Legionella pneumophila is found in 3-5% of inpatients. Chlamydia spp. and Coxiella burnetii are present in less than 1% of patients. Legionella longbeachae is relatively frequent in New Zealand and Australia and might also be present in other parts of the world. Uncertainty remains on the prevalence of atypical pathogens, due to limitations in diagnostic means and methodological issues in epidemiological studies. Despite differences between CAP caused by typical and atypical pathogens, the clinical presentation alone does not allow accurate discrimination. Hence, antibiotics active against atypical pathogens (macrolides, tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones) should be included in the empiric antibiotic treatment of all patients with severe CAP. For patients with milder disease, evidence is lacking and recommendations differ between guidelines. Use of clinical prediction rules to identify patients most likely to be infected with atypical pathogens, and strategies of narrowing the antibiotic spectrum according to initial microbiologic investigations, should be the focus of future investigations.
