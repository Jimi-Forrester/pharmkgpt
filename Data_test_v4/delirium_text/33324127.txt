33324127|a|PURPOSE: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a very common and serious neurological complication in patients admitted to the cardiothoracic surgical intensive care unit (CSICU). We aimed to identify a novel potential sleep-based marker for POD and investigate the relevance between atypical sleep and POD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study of patients admitted to the CSICU between December 2019 and February 2020 at our center. Sleep characteristics from 21:00 on postoperative day 1 to 07:00 on postoperative day 2 were assessed using polysomnography (PSG). POD from the end of PSG monitoring until postoperative day 5 was evaluated using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. RESULTS: This analysis included 20 patients admitted to the CSICU. The incidence of atypical sleep was 45.0%. Compared to patients without delirium, those with delirium had less delta power, less percentage REM sleep, and a higher proportion of atypical sleep and REM sleep loss (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The presence of atypical sleep and the absence of REM sleep were associated with POD in patients admitted to the CSICU.
