38352603|t|Functional Connectivity Differences in Distinct Dentato-Cortical Networks in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment.
38352603|a|Recent research has implicated the cerebellum in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and cerebrocerebellar network connectivity is emerging as a possible contributor to symptom severity. The cerebellar dentate nucleus (DN) has parallel motor and non-motor sub-regions that project to motor and frontal regions of the cerebral cortex, respectively. These distinct dentato-cortical networks have been delineated in the non-human primate and human brain. Importantly, cerebellar regions prone to atrophy in AD are functionally connected to atrophied regions of the cerebral cortex, suggesting that dysfunction perhaps occurs at a network level. Investigating functional connectivity (FC) alterations of the DN is a crucial step in understanding the cerebellum in AD and in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Inclusion of this latter group stands to provide insights into cerebellar contributions prior to diagnosis of AD. The present study investigated FC differences in dorsal (dDN) and ventral (vDN) DN networks in MCI and AD relative to cognitively normal participants (CN) and relationships between FC and behavior. Our results showed patterns indicating both higher and lower functional connectivity in both dDN and vDN in AD compared to CN. However, connectivity in the AD group was lower when compared to MCI. We argue that these findings suggest that the patterns of higher FC in AD may act as a compensatory mechanism. Additionally, we found associations between the individual networks and behavior. There were significant interactions between dDN connectivity and motor symptoms. However, both DN seeds were associated with cognitive task performance. Together, these results indicate that cerebellar DN networks are impacted in AD, and this may impact behavior. In concert with the growing body of literature implicating the cerebellum in AD, our work further underscores the importance of investigations of this region. We speculate that much like in psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, cerebellar dysfunction results in negative impacts on thought and the organization therein. Further, this is consistent with recent arguments that the cerebellum provides crucial scaffolding for cognitive function in aging. Together, our findings stand to inform future clinical work in the diagnosis and understanding of this disease.
