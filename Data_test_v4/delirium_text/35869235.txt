35869235|a|The establishment of robust human brain organoids to model cerebellar diseases is essential to study new therapeutic strategies for cerebellum-associated disorders. Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is a cerebellar hereditary neurodegenerative disease, without therapeutic options able to prevent the disease progression. In the present work, control and MJD induced-pluripotent stem cells were used to establish human brain organoids. These organoids were characterized regarding brain development, cell type composition, and MJD-associated neuropathology markers, to evaluate their value for cerebellar diseases modeling. Our data indicate that the organoids recapitulated, to some extent, aspects of brain development, such as astroglia emerging after neurons and the presence of ventricular-like zones surrounded by glia and neurons that are found only in primate brains. Moreover, the brain organoids presented markers of neural progenitors proliferation, neuronal differentiation, inhibitory and excitatory synapses, and firing neurons. The established brain organoids also exhibited markers of cerebellar neurons progenitors and mature cerebellar neurons. Finally, MJD brain organoids showed higher ventricular-like zone numbers, an indication of lower maturation, and an increased number of ataxin-3-positive aggregates, compared with control organoids. Altogether, our data indicate that the established organoids recapitulate important characteristics of human brain development and exhibit cerebellar features, constituting a resourceful tool for testing therapeutic approaches for cerebellar diseases.
