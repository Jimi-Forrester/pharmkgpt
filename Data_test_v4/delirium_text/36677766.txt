36677766|a|In the search for new bioactive compounds, a methodology based on combining two molecules with biological properties into a new hybrid molecule was used to design and synthesize of a series of ten indole derivatives bearing imidazole, benzothiazole-2-thione, or benzoxazole-2-thione moieties at the C-3 position. The compounds were spectroscopically characterized and tested for their antioxidant, antibacterial, and fungicidal activities. The crystal structures were determined for five of them. Comparison of the closely related structures containing either benzothiazole-2-thione or benzoxazole-2-thione clearly shows that the replacement of -S- and -O- ring atoms modify molecular conformation in the crystal, changes intermolecular interactions, and has a severe impact on biological activity. The results indicate that indole-imidazole derivatives with alkyl substituent exhibit an excellent cytoprotective effect against AAPH-induced oxidative hemolysis and act as effective ferrous ion chelating agents. The indole-imidazole compound with chlorine atoms inhibited the growth of fungal strains: Coriolus versicolor (Cv), Poria placenta (Pp), Coniophora puteana (Cp), and Gloeophyllum trabeum (Gt). The indole-imidazole derivatives showed the highest antibacterial activity, for which the largest growth-inhibition zones were noted in M. luteus and P. fluorescens cultures. The obtained results may be helpful in the development of selective indole derivatives as effective antioxidants and/or antimicrobial agents.
