39604566|a|BACKGROUND: Patients who experienced postoperative delirium (POD) are at higher risk of poor outcomes like dementia or death. Previous machine learning models predicting POD mostly relied on time-aggregated features. We aimed to assess the potential of temporal patterns in clinical parameters during surgeries to predict POD. METHODS: Long short-term memory (LSTM) and transformer models, directly consuming time series, were compared to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) trained on time-aggregated features. We also fitted hybrid models, fusing either LSTM or transformer models with MLPs. Univariate Spearman's rank correlations and linear mixed-effect models establish the importance of individual features that we compared to transformers' attention weights. RESULTS: Best performance is achieved by a transformer architecture ingesting 30 min of intraoperative parameter sequences. Systolic invasive blood pressure and given opioids mark the most important input variables, in line with univariate feature importances. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative temporal dynamics of clinical parameters, exploited by a transformer architecture named TRAPOD, are critical for the accurate prediction of POD.
