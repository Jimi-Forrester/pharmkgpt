28159831|t|Prion-Like Protein Aggregates and Type 2 Diabetes.
28159831|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a highly prevalent metabolic disease characterized by chronic insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction and loss, leading to impaired insulin release and hyperglycemia. Although the mechanism responsible for beta-cell dysfunction and death is not completely understood, recent findings suggest that the accumulation of misfolded aggregates of the islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) in the islets of Langerhans may play an important role in pancreatic damage. Misfolding and aggregation of diverse proteins and their accumulation as amyloid in different organs is the hallmark feature in a group of chronic, degenerative diseases termed protein misfolding disorders (PMDs). PMDs include highly prevalent human illnesses such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as more than 25 rarer disorders. Among them, prion diseases are unique because the pathology can be transmitted by a proteinaceous infectious agent, termed a prion, which induces disease by propagating protein misfolding and aggregation. This phenomenon has a striking resemblance to the process of protein misfolding and aggregation in all of the PMDs, suggesting that misfolded aggregates have an intrinsic potential to be transmissible. Indeed, recent studies have shown that the pathological hallmarks of various PMDs can be induced in vivo under experimental conditions by inoculating tissue extracts containing protein aggregates into animal models. In this review, we describe our current understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the prion-like transmission of protein aggregates and its possible role in T2D.
