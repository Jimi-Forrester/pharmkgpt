32668394|t|Intrinsic stability study of L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine with HPLC method development and validation.
32668394|a|L-alpha-Glycerylphosphorylcholine (L-alpha-GPC) is effective to control the symptoms of cognitive decline for the patients of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, an HPLC method coupled with a refractive index detector was developed to evaluate the intrinsic stability of L-alpha-GPC. The separation of L-alpha-GPC and its major potential degradation products was achieved on a normal-phase silica gel column (4.6 mm x 250 mm) with the mobile phase consisting of methanol-20 mM ammonium formate aqueous solution (pH 3.2) (65:35, v/v) in isocratic mode. The HPLC method was validated satisfactorily with respect to precision, accuracy and robustness. It is found that L-alpha-GPC is stable under the photolytic, thermal, oxidative and acidic conditions, while relatively sensitive to alkaline condition due to the specific breakage of phosphate ester bond in the moiety of L-alpha-GPC. A preliminary kinetics study for the alkaline degradation was conducted with the corresponding kinetics parameters obtained. It can be concluded that the developed HPLC method is capable of distinguishing the stability difference between the two phosphate ester bonds characterized on the L-alpha-GPC chemical structure.
