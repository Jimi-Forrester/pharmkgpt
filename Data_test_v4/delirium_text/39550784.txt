39550784|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Tau PET is being increasingly appraised as a novel diagnostic modality for dementia work up. Given limited data among South Asians, we assessed the frequency, patterns, phenotypic associations and incremental value of positive Tau PET scans in clinically diagnosed neurodegenerative dementia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited consecutive patients of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD syndromes (September 2021 to October 2022, India). Participants underwent clinical interview, cognitive assessment, MRI brain and tau PET scan ([F-18]ML-104). Visual read in a priori regions of interest was used to identify patterns of tau deposition in the brain. RESULTS: We recruited 54 participants (mean age: 63.2 +- 9.2 years, 64.8 % men, 77.8 % dementia, 70.4 % early onset cases, 37.8 % APOE4+). The analysis identified abnormal tau uptake in 40/54 (74.1 %) participants; with uptake in AD signature areas in 27/40 (67.5 %) cases [cortical subtype (74.1 %), limbic (14.8 %), combined cortical/limbic (11.1 %)], and patterns not conforming to AD in 13/40 (32.5 %) cases. Tau PET substantiated the diagnosis of AD among 17/19 (89.5 %) cases with clinically diagnosed AD dementia, 8/23 (34.8 %) cases with suspected non-AD cause, and 2/12 (16.7 %) cases with mild cognitive impairment. A trend for increasing proportion of early onset cases, and worsening cognition, behavior and functional ability was seen, from 'limbic' to 'combined cortical/limbic' to 'cortical' subgroups. CONCLUSION: Tau PET is a useful modality to differentiate AD dementia from other neurodegenerative causes in the Indian setting where amyloid biomarkers are not widely available. Biological subtypes of AD map well onto clinical phenotypes and need study in larger cohorts.
