35885061|a|In mammalian cells, the content of polyamines is tightly regulated. Polyamines, including spermine, spermidine and putrescine, are involved in many cellular processes. Spermine oxidase specifically oxidizes spermine, and its deregulated activity has been reported to be linked to brain pathologies involving neuron damage. Spermine is a neuromodulator of a number of ionotropic glutamate receptors and types of ion channels. In this respect, the Dach-SMOX mouse model overexpressing spermine oxidase in the neocortex neurons was revealed to be a model of chronic oxidative stress, excitotoxicity and neuronal damage. Reactive astrocytosis, chronic oxidative and excitotoxic stress, neuron loss and the susceptibility to seizure in the Dach-SMOX are discussed here. This genetic model would help researchers understand the linkage between polyamine dysregulation and neurodegeneration and unveil the roles of polyamines in the crosstalk between astrocytes and neurons in neuroprotection or neurodegeneration.
