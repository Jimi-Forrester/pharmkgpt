31592147|t|Periodate-Modified Gum Arabic Cross-linked PVA Hydrogels: A Promising Approach toward Photoprotection and Sustained Delivery of Folic Acid.
31592147|a|The chemically oxidized gum arabic was prepared and used as a naturally derived nontoxic and pH-responsive cross-linker to develop smart polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based hydrogels for the first time. The formulated hydrogels exhibited high mechanical properties, good porosity, and pH sensitivity, which facilitated their application as promising biomaterials for sustained delivery of folic acid. Further, the synthesized cross-linked PVA hydrogels displayed no cytotoxicity toward the human embryonic kidney cell line and exhibited higher blood compatibility. The hydrolytic degradation study confirmed their biodegradable nature. While the sustained delivery along with photoprotective properties of these hydrogels confirmed their multifunctional characteristics, these results suggest that these hydrogels may act as an efficient photoprotective material and find their application in the field of drug delivery.
