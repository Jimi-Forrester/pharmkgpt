35535155|t|Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking-Based Strategy to Investigate the Multitarget Mechanisms of Shenqi Yizhi Granule on Alzheimer's Disease.
35535155|a|Background: Traditional Chinese herbal medicine draws more attention to explore an effective therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Shenqi Yizhi granule (SQYG), a Chinese herbal recipe, has been applied to ameliorate cognitive impairment in mild-to-moderate AD patients. However, the overall molecular mechanism of SQYG in treating AD has not been clarified. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of SQYG on AD using an integration strategy of network pharmacology and molecular docking. Methods: The active compounds of SQYG and common targets between SQYG and AD were screened from databases. The herb-compound network, compound-target network, and protein-protein interaction network were constructed. The enrichment analysis of common targets and molecular docking were performed. Results: 816 compounds and 307 common targets between SQYG and AD were screened. KEGG analysis revealed that common targets were mainly enriched in lipid metabolism, metal ion metabolism, IL-17 signaling pathway, GABA receptor signaling, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. Molecular docking analysis showed high binding affinity between ginsenoside Rg1 and Abeta 1-42, tanshinone IIA and BACE1, baicalin, and AchE. Conclusions: The therapeutic mechanisms of SQYG on AD were associated with regulating lipid metabolism, metal ion metabolism, IL-17 signaling pathway, and GABA receptor signaling. Ginsenoside Rg1, tanshinone IIA, baicalin, astragaloside IV, and folic acid may play an important role in AD treatment.
