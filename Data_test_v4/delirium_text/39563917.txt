39563917|a|Objective: To assess the effectiveness of a 3-question decision-support tool to guide the diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in acute care hospitalized patients as an antibiotic and diagnostic stewardship initiative. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Four acute care hospitals within the same health system in Miami, FL. Patients: 124, admitted from the emergency department and hospitalized adult patients, treated with antibiotics for the indication of a UTI between March and April 2023. Intervention: We developed a 3-step clinical decision-support tool (CDST) to evaluate the appropriateness of urine cultures and antibiotic treatment. The tool's recommendations when deciding to prescribe antibiotics were compared with the actual need for treatment throughout the hospitalization, up to the time of patient discharge. Results: Overall, 31% of antibiotics prescribed for UTIs were inappropriate and met the criteria for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) based on the CDST. Prospective implementation of the decision-support tool could potentially reduce antibiotic use by 33.6%, corresponding to 265 days of unnecessary therapy. The sensitivity and specificity of the tool were calculated to be 98.6% and 100%, respectively, indicating high accuracy in identifying the need for antibiotic treatment. Urinalysis alone was insufficient to differentiate between symptomatic UTIs and ASB, with leukocyturia present in 95.3% of UTI cases and 94.6% of ASB cases (P = 0.87). Conclusions: Implementing a 3-question CDST may reduce unnecessary laboratory work-up and treatment for ASB improving the diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship of UTIs.
