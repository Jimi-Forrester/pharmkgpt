39125907|t|Proteomic Analysis Reveals Physiological Activities of Abeta Peptide for Alzheimer's Disease.
39125907|a|With the rapid progress in deciphering the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), it has been widely accepted that the accumulation of misfolded amyloid beta (Abeta) in the brain could cause the neurodegeneration in AD. Although much evidence demonstrates the neurotoxicity of Abeta, the role of Abeta in the nervous system are complex. However, more comprehensive studies are needed to understand the physiological effect of Abeta40 monomers in depth. To explore the physiological mechanism of Abeta, we employed mass spectrometry to investigate the altered proteomic events induced by a lower submicromolar concentration of Abeta. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to five different concentrations of Abeta1-40 monomers and collected at four time points. The proteomic analysis revealed the time-course behavior of proteins involved in biological processes, such as RNA splicing, nuclear transport and protein localization. Further biological studies indicated that Abeta40 monomers may activate PI3K/AKT signaling to regulate p-Tau, Ezrin and MAP2. These three proteins are associated with dendritic morphogenesis, neuronal polarity, synaptogenesis, axon establishment and axon elongation. Moreover, Abeta40 monomers may regulate their physiological forms by inhibiting the expression of BACE1 and APP via activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. A comprehensive exploration of pathological and physiological mechanisms of Abeta is beneficial for exploring novel treatment.
