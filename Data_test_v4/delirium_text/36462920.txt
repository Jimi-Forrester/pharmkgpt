36462920|a|With the proliferation of social media networks, online discussions can serve as a microcosm of the greater public opinion about key issues that affect society as a whole. Online discussions have been catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic and have magnified challenges experienced by older adults, health care professionals, and caregivers of long-term care (LTC) residents. Our main goal was to examine how online discussions and public perceptions about LTC practices have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a content analysis of Twitter posts about LTC to understand the nature of social media discussions regarding LTC practices prior to (March to June 2019) and following the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic (March to June 2020). We found that a much greater number of Twitter posts about LTC was shared during the COVID-19 period than in the year prior. Multiple themes emerged from the data including highlighting concerns about LTC, providing information about LTC, and interventions and ideas for improving LTC conditions. The proportion of posts linked to several of these themes changed as a function of the pandemic. Unsurprisingly, one major new issue that emerged in 2020 is that users began discussing the shortcomings of infection control during the pandemic. Our findings suggest that increased public concern offers momentum for embarking on necessary changes to improve conditions in LTC.
