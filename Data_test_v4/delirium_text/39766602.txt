39766602|t|Bisindole Compounds-Synthesis and Medicinal Properties.
39766602|a|The indole nucleus stands out as a pharmacophore, among other aromatic heterocyclic compounds with remarkable therapeutic properties, such as benzimidazole, pyridine, quinoline, benzothiazole, and others. Moreover, a series of recent studies refer to strategies for the synthesis of bisindole derivatives, with various medicinal properties, such as antimicrobial, antiviral, anticancer, anti-Alzheimer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antidiabetic, etc. Also, a series of natural bisindole compounds are mentioned in the literature for their various biological properties and as a starting point in the synthesis of other related bisindoles. Drawing from these data, we have proposed in this review to provide an overview of the synthesis techniques and medicinal qualities of the bisindolic compounds that have been mentioned in recent literature from 2010 to 2024 as well as their numerous uses in the chemistry of materials, nanomaterials, dyes, polymers, and corrosion inhibitors.
