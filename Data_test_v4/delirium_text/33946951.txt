33946951|a|Flavonoid compounds are known for their antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. Therefore, they can influence membrane properties that interest us, modifying both their structure and functions. We used kaempferol (K) and myricetin (M) as representatives of this group. We investigated the influence of the abovementioned compounds on model cell membranes' properties (i.e., Langmuir monolayers and liposomes). The basic research methods used in these studies were the Langmuir method with Brewster angle microscopy and microelectrophoresis. The pi-A isotherms were registered for the pure components and mixtures of these compounds with phosphatidylcholine (PC) in appropriate volume ratios. Using mathematical equations, we established that kaempferol, myricetin, and the lipids formed complexes at 1:1 ratios. We derived the parameters characterizing the formed complexes, i.e., the surfaces occupied by the complexes and the stability constants of the formed complexes. Using the microelectrophoretic method, we determined the dependence of the lipid membranes' surface charge density as a function of the pH (in the range of 2 to 10) of the electrolyte solution. The presented results indicate that the PC membrane's modification with kaempferol or myricetin affected changes in the surface charge density and isoelectric point values.
