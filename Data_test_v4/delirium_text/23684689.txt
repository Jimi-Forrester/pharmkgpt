23684689|t|VEGF-releasing biodegradable nanospheres administered by craniotomy: a novel therapeutic approach in the APP/Ps1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
23684689|a|This study attempts to develop a novel nanotechnology-based strategy to deliver vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to the brain, as a possible therapeutic approach for AD. For this purpose, VEGF was encapsulated in biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanospheres (VEGF-NS). The nanosphere particle size was about 200 nm, with a narrow size distribution, and the zeta potential around -30 mV. The encapsulation efficiency of VEGF was 44.06+-5.61%, showing a biphasic release profile in vitro. The biological activity and neuroprotective effect of encapsulated VEGF were investigated in neuronal cell cultures, confirming the neuronal proliferative effect and the protection against Abeta42 induced neurotoxicity. In vivo studies were carried out in amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 (APP/Ps1) mice administering VEGF-NS through minimally invasive craniotomy. The results obtained showed that VEGF-NS were able to improve behavioral deficits, decrease Abeta deposits and promote angiogenesis, as well as reduce neuronal loss and cerebrovascular abnormalities. Furthermore, their ability to protect neuronal cultures against neuroinflammation induced by LPS provides new insight for future therapeutic approaches in other neurodegenerative disorders.
