39536606|t|Prussian blue nanocages as efficient radical scavengers and photothermal agents for reducing amyloid-beta induced neurotoxicity.
39536606|a|The unusual accumulation of amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta42) is an essential pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and development of Abeta42 nanomodulators offers a potentially therapeutic approach to AD. Here, we report facile synthesis of the hollow mesocrystalline Prussian blue nanocages (HMPBs), which serve as versatile Abeta42 modulators. Due to the hollow nanostructures and large specific surface area, they can effectively inhibit Abeta42 aggregation by adsorption. They also exhibit robust near-infrared (NIR) photothermal effect for light-to-heat transition, which promotes the depolymerization of Abeta42 fibers. Besides, they display ROS quenching ability to scavenge hydroxyl radicals ( OH) caused by Abeta42 fibers, alleviate cellular oxidative stress, and improve cell survival. This work provides a new kind of Prussian blue nanomaterial for multimodal Abeta modulation.
