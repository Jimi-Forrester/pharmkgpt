20302203|a|BACKGROUND: recently, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, can be treated by pancreatic islet allotransplantation. METHODS: This retrospective study involves 137 patients from the Surgery Department of Colentina Clinical Hospital, Bucharest, in the July 2000 - July 2008 period, who underwent pancreatic resections, the number of patients who developed pancreatogenic diabetes and their selection for the pancreatic islet transplantation. RESULTS: After pancreatectomy, 70 patients are diagnosed with diabetes, and 42 with prediabetic stages (IFG and IGT). 61 of these had average glycemic excursions (MAGE) over the normal, and 31 of the 70 patients diagnosed with diabetes, presented hypoglycemic episodes during treatment. CONCLUSION: The present criteria of patient selection for pancreatic islets transplantation are limited and can be applied to a small number of patients.
