34768339|t|Predictors of Acute Encephalopathy in Patients with COVID-19.
34768339|a|INTRODUCTION: The majority of patients with severe COVID-19 suffer from delirium as the main sign of encephalopathy associated with this viral infection. The aim of this study was to identify early markers of the development of this condition. MATERIALS: The prospective cohort-based study included patients with community-acquired pneumonia and confirmed pulmonary tissue infiltration based on CT data, with a lesion consisting of at least 25% of one lung. The main group included patients who have developed acute encephalopathy (10 patients, 3 (30%) women; average age, 47.9 +- 7.3 years). The control group included patients who at discharge did not have acute encephalopathy (20 patients, 11 (55%) women; average age, 51.0 +- 10.5 years). The study collected clinical examination data, comprehensive laboratory data, neurophysiological data, pulse oximetry and CT data to identify the predictors of acute encephalopathy (study ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04405544). RESULTS: Data analysis showed a significant relationship between encephalopathy with the degree of lung tissue damage, arterial hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as with D-dimer, LDH, and lymphopenia. CONCLUSIONS: The development of encephalopathy is secondary to the severity of the patient's condition since a more severe course of the coronavirus infection leads to hypoxic brain damage.
