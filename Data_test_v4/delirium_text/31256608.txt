31256608|t|Purkinje Cells Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease.
31256608|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the main causes of dementia in senium and presenium. It is clinically characterized by memory impairment, deterioration of intellectual faculties, and loss of professional skills. The cerebellum is a critical part in the distributed neural circuits participating not only in motor function but also in autonomic, limbic, and cognitive behaviors. In present study, we aim to investigate the morphological changes in the Purkinje cells in different cerebellar regions in AD and to correlate them with the underlying AD pathology. Purkinje cells exhibit significant morphometric alterations in AD and prominently in the anterior lobe which is related to higher cognitive functions. The present study gives new insights into the cerebellar pathology in AD and confirms that Purkinje cells pathology is a key finding in AD brains and that AD is characterized by regional-specific atrophy picked in the anterior cerebellar lobe.
