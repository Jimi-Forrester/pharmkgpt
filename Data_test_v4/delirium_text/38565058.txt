38565058|t|Multitarget action of Benzothiazole-piperazine small hybrid molecule against Alzheimer's disease: In silico, In vitro, and In vivo investigation.
38565058|a|A novel small molecule based on benzothiazole-piperazine has been identified as an effective multi-target-directed ligand (MTDL) against Alzheimer's disease (AD). Employing a medicinal chemistry approach, combined with molecular docking, MD simulation, and binding free energy estimation, compound 1 emerged as a potent MTDL against AD. Notably, compound 1 demonstrated efficient binding to both AChE and Abeta1-42, involving crucial molecular interactions within their active sites. It displayed a binding free energy (DeltaGbind) -18.64+- 0.16 and -16.10 +- 0.18 kcal/mol against AChE and Abeta1-42, respectively. In-silico findings were substantiated through rigorous in vitro and in vivo studies. In vitro analysis confirmed compound 1 (IC50=0.42 muM) as an effective, mixed-type, and selective AChE inhibitor, binding at both the enzyme's catalytic and peripheral anionic sites. Furthermore, compound 1 demonstrated a remarkable ability to reduce the aggregation propensity of Abeta, as evidenced by Confocal laser scanning microscopy and TEM studies. Remarkably, in vivo studies exhibited the promising therapeutic potential of compound 1. In a scopolamine-induced memory deficit mouse model of AD, compound 1 showed significantly improved spatial memory and cognition. These findings collectively underscore the potential of compound 1 as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of AD.
