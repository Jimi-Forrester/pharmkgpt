38566903|t|Stroke-induced changes to immune function and their relevance to increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease.
38566903|a|As the COVID-19 pandemic moves towards endemic disease, it remains of key importance to identify groups of individuals vulnerable to severe infection and understand the biological factors that mediate this risk. Stroke patients are at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19, likely due to stroke-induced alterations to systemic immune function. Furthermore, immune responses associated with severe COVID-19 in patients without a history of stroke parallel many of the immune alterations induced by stroke, possibly resulting in a compounding effect that contributes to worsened disease severity. In this review, we discuss the changes to systemic immune function that likely contribute to augmented COVID-19 severity in patients with a history of stroke and the effects of COVID-19 on the immune system that may exacerbate these effects.
