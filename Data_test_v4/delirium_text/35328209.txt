35328209|t|Disseminated Cunninghamella spp. Endocarditis in a Beta-Thalassemia Patient after Asymptomatic COVID-19 Infection.
35328209|a|Cunninghamella spp. is a group of fungi belonging to the Mucorales order. Cases of fungal endocarditis are sporadic, but more frequent in immunocompromised patients. COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 Infection Disease 2019) infections, prematurity, deferoxamine treatment, iron overload, neutropenia, diabetes, and malignant hemopathies proved to be risk factors for mucormycosis. We present the case of a 7-year-old boy who was treated every three weeks with blood transfusion for major beta-thalassemia, receiving deferoxamine for secondary hemochromatosis. After two weeks with nonspecific respiratory and digestive symptoms, he was admitted for fever, followed by lower limb ischemia and neurological signs. Echocardiography revealed massive endocarditis affecting the mitral and tricuspid valves with embolization phenomena in the brain, lungs, kidney, spleen, and lower limbs. As a particular finding, IgG antibodies for COVID-19 were positive. Emergency cardiac surgery was performed. The mitral valve necessitated replacement with CarboMedics prosthesis. Unfortunately, the patient did not survive. Cunninghamella spp. was confirmed via the PCR analysis of vegetations. Cunninghamella endocarditis in the context of a systemic infection presented as an opportunistic infection affecting a child who had several risk factors. Mucormycosis is challenging to treat, with high mortality. Prophylactic treatment in beta-thalassemia patients with iron-chelator deprivation drugs, such as deferiprone, may help in preventing these particular fungal infections.
