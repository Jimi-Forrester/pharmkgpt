37055560|t|Topological differences and confounders of mental rotation in cervical dystonia and blepharospasm.
37055560|a|Mental rotation (mR) bases on imagination of actual movements. It remains unclear whether there is a specific pattern of mR impairment in focal dystonia. We aimed to investigate mR in patients with cervical dystonia (CD) and blepharospasm (BS) and to assess potential confounders. 23 CD patients and 23 healthy controls (HC) as well as 21 BS and 19 hemifacial spasm (HS) patients were matched for sex, age, and education level. Handedness, finger dexterity, general reaction time, and cognitive status were assessed. Disease severity was evaluated by clinical scales. During mR, photographs of body parts (head, hand, or foot) and a non-corporal object (car) were displayed at different angles rotated within their plane. Subjects were asked to judge laterality of the presented image by keystroke. Both speed and correctness were evaluated. Compared to HC, CD and HS patients performed worse in mR of hands, whereas BS group showed comparable performance. There was a significant association of prolonged mR reaction time (RT) with reduced MoCA scores and with increased RT in an unspecific reaction speed task. After exclusion of cognitively impaired patients, increased RT in the mR of hands was confined to CD group, but not HS. While the question of whether specific patterns of mR impairment reliably define a dystonic endophenotype remains elusive, our findings point to mR as a useful tool, when used carefully with control measures and tasks, which may be capable of identifying specific deficits that distinguish between subtypes of dystonia.
