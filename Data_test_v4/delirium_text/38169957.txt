38169957|a|Rose is a beautiful and fragrant plant with a variety of medicinal and substance uses. Various parts of rose such as fruits, flowers, leaves, and bark can be used in various product development, including cosmetics, food, pharmaceuticals, and engineering. The medical benefits of roses include the treatment of inflammation, diabetes, dysmenorrhea, depression, stress, seizures, and aging. Rose water is precious beauty water for skin care and has antibacterial effects on various microbiota. The surface of a rose petal exhibits a hierarchical structure comprising microscale papillae, with each papilla further featuring intricate nanofolds. With this structural feature, rose petals have high water contact angles together with antagonistic wetting properties. The hierarchical structures of rose petals were shown to have anti-reflection and light-harvesting abilities, which have the potential to be materials for various electronic products. Rose petals are an excellent biomimetic/bioinspired material that can be applied to the popular material graphene. This paper reviews the medical function and material application of roses. During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical materials or food shortages have become a global issue. Natural biomaterials could be a good alternative. Roses, with so many benefits, definitely deserve more exploration and promotion.
