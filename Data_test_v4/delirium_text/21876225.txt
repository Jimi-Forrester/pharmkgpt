21876225|a|Damage to and functional alteration of structures responsible for synaptic plasticity correlate with memory loss and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. The results of recent research in the pathomechanism of Alzheimer's disease emphasize the significance of cytoskeletal changes. The changes in actin dynamics and its regulation by actin-binding proteins have been proven in Alzheimer's disease, which may have a key role in the conformation and alteration of synapses and dendritic spines. The most important proteins in the regulation of actin dynamics are ADF/cofilin, kinases and drebrin. In this review, we summarize the physiological functions and complex regulation of these cytoskeletal proteins and their alterations in Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, the effects of some psychopharmacons on the actin cytoskeleton and cytoskeletal changes induced by stress are also summarized.
