38896306|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological condition characterized by impaired cognitive function and behavioral alterations. While AD research historically centered around mis-folded proteins, advances in mass spectrometry techniques have triggered increased exploration of the AD lipidome with lipid dysregulation emerging as a critical player in AD pathogenesis. Gangliosides are a class of glycosphingolipids enriched within the central nervous system. Previous work has suggested a shift in a-series gangliosides from complex (GM1) to simple (GM2 and GM3) species may be related to the development of neurodegenerative disease. In addition, complex gangliosides with 20 carbon sphingosine chains have been shown to increase in the aging brain. In this study, we utilized matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) to interrogate the in situ relationship of a-series gangliosides with either 18 or 20 carbon sphingosine chains (d18:1 or d20:1, respectively) in the post-mortem human AD brain. Here, we expanded upon previous literature and demonstrated a significant decrease in the GM1 d20:1 to GM1 d18:1 ratio in regions of the dentate gyrus and entorhinal cortex in AD relative to control brain tissue. Then, we demonstrated that the MALDI-MSI profile of GM3 co-localizes with histologically confirmed amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques and found a significant increase in both GM1 and GM3 in proximity to Abeta plaques. Collectively, this study demonstrates a perturbation of the ganglioside profile in AD, and validates a pipeline for MALDI-MSI and classic histological staining in the same tissue sections. This demonstrates feasibility for integrating untargeted mass spectrometry imaging approaches into a digital pathology framework.
