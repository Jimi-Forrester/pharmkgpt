34945156|a|BACKGROUND: we have observed the effect of insomnia treatment in clinical and prognostic differences of patients admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia in respiratory sub-intensive units that were administered a prolonged-release melatonin 2 mg (PRM 2 mg) therapy versus a group of patients out of therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 40 patients on prolonged-release melatonin 2 mg (PRM 2 mg) therapy versus a control group of 40 patients out of therapy. RESULTS: patients in the PRM 2 mg group had a shorter duration of therapy with non-invasive ventilation (5.2 +- 3.0 vs. 12.5 +- 4.2; p < 0.001), with a shorter stay in sub-intensive care (12.3 +- 3.2 vs. 20.1 +- 6.1; p < 0.001), and, therefore, a shorter overall duration of hospitalization (31.3 +- 6.8 vs. 34.3 +- 6.9 p = 0.03). In addition, a lower incidence of delirium was found (2.2 +- 1.1 vs. 3.3 +- 1.3; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A significant increase in sleep hours and a reduction in delirium episodes occurs in hospitalized insomniac patients treated with PRM 2 mg, compared to untreated patients. Based on these preliminary results, we can assume that there are benefits of prolonged-release melatonin 2 mg in COVID-19 therapy.
