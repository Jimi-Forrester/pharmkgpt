36014582|t|The Genus Broussonetia: An Updated Review of Phytochemistry, Pharmacology and Applications.
36014582|a|The Broussonetia genus (Moraceae), recognized for its value in many Chinese traditional herbs, mainly includes Broussonetia papyrifera (L.) L'Her. ex Vent. (BP), Broussonetia kazinoki Siebold (BK), and Broussonetia luzonica (Blanco) Bureau (BL). Hitherto, researchers have found 338 compounds isolated from BP, BK, and BL, which included flavonoids, polyphenols, phenylpropanoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, steroids, and others. Moreover, its active compounds and extracts have exhibited a variety of pharmacological effects such as antitumor, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, anti-obesity, antibacterial, and antiviral properties, and its use against skin wrinkles. In this review, the phytochemistry and pharmacology of Broussonetia are updated systematically, after its applications are first summarized. In addition, this review also discusses the limitations of investigations and the potential direction of Broussonetia. This review can help to further understand the phytochemistry, pharmacology, and other applications of Broussonetia, which paves the way for future research.
