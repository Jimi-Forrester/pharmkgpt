20350807|t|Molecular modelling, synthesis and acetylcholinesterase inhibition of ethyl 5-amino-2-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydrobenzo[b][1,8]naphthyridine-3-carboxylate.
20350807|a|In silico analysis of ethyl 5-amino-2-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydrobenzo[b][1,8]naphthyridine-3-carboxylate (2) predicts that this molecule should be successfully docked in the PAS, and easily accommodated in the CAS of AChE. The synthesis and the AChE/BuChE inhibition studies are reported, confirming that compound 2 is a potent and selective AChE inhibitor, and consequently, a new lead compound for further development into new dual CAS/PAS cholinergic agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
