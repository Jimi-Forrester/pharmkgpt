35419213|a|Background: Training programs aiming to improve delirium diagnosis and management skills increase nurses' care efficiency and improve patients' health outcomes. This study was conducted to examine the effect of delirium information training on patient care by intensive care nurses. Methods: In the research, one group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design was used. The study sample consisted of 30 nurses working in four intensive care units of a university hospital between November 05, 2018, and February 15, 2019. The Personal Information Form, the Checklist for the Care of the Patient in Delirium, and the Confusion Assessment Scale for the Intensive Care Unit were used to collect the data. Intensive care nurses were provided with information training supported by a training booklet in two sessions of 40 min each. Results: In the study, according to the Checklist for the Care of the Patient in Delirium, while the pre-test point average of the nurses was 6.17 +- 2.29, the post-test point average had increased to 11.17 +- 1.51 (p < 0.001). After the training, it was determined that there was a significant increase in the percentage of nurses who stated that they evaluated and detected whether their patients had pain, hallucinations, and delusions (p < 0.001). As a result, it has been determined that providing delirium information training to intensive care nurses positively affects the care of patients with delirium. In addition, it has been determined that with the Confusion Assessment Scale for Intensive Care Unit, nurses can provide the care they need to patients at risk in terms of delirium by identifying delirium.
