38945311|a|Endosomal acid base balance functions as a master orchestrator within the cell, engaging with many cellular pathways to maintain homeostasis. Mutations in the endosomal pH regulator Na+/H+ exchanger NHE6 may disrupt this delicate balancing act and cause monogenic Parkinsonism. Here, gene expression studies in post-mortem substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and normal controls were performed to investigate whether NHE6 represents a pathophysiological link between monogenic and sporadic PD. The substantia nigra in PD displayed down-regulation of NHE6, coincident with a loss of expression of several SNARE signalling pathway members, suggesting impaired membrane fusion and vesicle-recycling. Increased abundance of related NHE9 was also identified in the parkinsonian nigra that could reflect compensatory changes or be a consequence of neuronal dysfunction. The current model suggests the possibility that neurons expressing low levels of NHE6 are more susceptible to injury in PD, potentially directly contributing to the loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons and the genesis of the disease. These results have important implications for disease-modifying therapies as they suggest that endosomal pH correctors, including epigenetic modifiers that regulate NHE6 expression, may be beneficial for PD. Thus, aberrant endosomal acidification in the nigrostriatal pathway is a possible unifying pathomechanism in both monogenic and sporadic PD, with implications for understanding and treating this disorder. Replication of these observations in the post-mortem brains of Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia patients supports a model of conserved mechanisms underlying injury and death of neurons.
