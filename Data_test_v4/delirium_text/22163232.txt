22163232|a|AIM: To investigate the use of drugs with anticholinergic properties (DAPs) and their associations with delirium and mortality among elderly patients with comorbidities. METHODS: 425 patients (>=70 years of age) in geriatric wards and nursing homes were assessed. The use of DAPs was retrieved from their medical records. Delirium was diagnosed according to the DSM-IV criteria. RESULTS: Of the 341 patients (80.2%) treated with multiple DAPs (>=2), 92 patients (27.0%) suffered from delirium, whereas 14 of 84 patients (16.7%) without DAP treatment had delirium (p = 0.050). In a logistic regression analysis with age, gender, and Charlson Comorbidity Index as covariates, DAP treatment did not predict delirium (odds ratio 1.67, 95% confidence interval 0.87-3.21). The 2-year mortality was 49.3% (n = 168) in DAP users and 35.7% (n = 30) in non-users, respectively (p = 0.026). In the Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for age, gender, and comorbidity, DAPs did not predict mortality (hazard ratio 1.12, 95% confidence interval 0.75-1.68). CONCLUSION: The use of DAPs is very frequent among frail inpatients with comorbidities, but their use has no independent prognostic significance.
