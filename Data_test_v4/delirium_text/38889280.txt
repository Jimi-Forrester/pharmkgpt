38889280|a|BACKGROUND: We investigated the effects of apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 and its interactions with sociodemographic characteristics on cognitive measures in South Asians from the Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia for the Longitudinal Aging Study of India (LASI-DAD). METHODS: Linear regression was used to assess the association between APOE epsilon4 and global- and domain-specific cognitive function in 2563 participants (mean age 69.6 +- 7.3 years; 53% female). Effect modification by age, sex, and education were explored using interaction terms and subgroup analyses. RESULTS: APOE epsilon4 was inversely associated with most cognitive measures (p < 0.05). This association was stronger with advancing age for the Hindi Mental State Examination (HMSE) score (betaepsilon4xage = -0.44, p = 0.03), orientation (betaepsilon4xage = -0.07, p = 0.01), and language/fluency (betaepsilon4xage = -0.07, p = 0.01), as well as in females for memory (betaepsilon4xmale = 0.17, p = 0.02) and language/fluency (betaepsilon4xmale = 0.12, p = 0.03). DISCUSSION: APOE epsilon4 is associated with lower cognitive function in South Asians from India, with a more pronounced impact observed in females and older individuals. HIGHLIGHTS: APOE epsilon4 carriers had lower global and domain-specific cognitive performance. Females and older individuals may be more susceptible to epsilon4 effects. For most cognitive measures, there was no interaction between epsilon4 and education.
