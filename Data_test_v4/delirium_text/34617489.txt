34617489|a|OBJECTIVES: The feasibility of research into internet-delivered guided self-help Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for family carers of people with dementia is not known. This study assessed this in an uncontrolled feasibility study. METHOD: Family carers of people with dementia with mild to moderate anxiety or depression were recruited from primary and secondary healthcare services in the UK. Participants were offered eight, guided, self-help online ACT sessions adapted for the needs of family carers of people with dementia with optional online peer support groups. Pre-defined primary indicators of success included recruitment of 30 eligible carers over 6 months and >=70% completing at least two online sessions. RESULTS: Thirty-three participants (110% of the target sample) were recruited over 6 months and 30 participants (91%) completed two or more sessions, and thus both indicators of success were met. Further, 70% of participants completed seven or all eight sessions, and 27% of participants were lost to follow-up, but none of the reasons for early withdrawal were related to the intervention. CONCLUSION: This study supports the feasibility, including recruitment and treatment completion. A full-scale trial to assess the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of the intervention including its long-term effects is warranted.
