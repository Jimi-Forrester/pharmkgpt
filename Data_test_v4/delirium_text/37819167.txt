37819167|a|Neurogenesis is crucial during the human lifespan for the maintenance of synaptic plasticity and normal function. The impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis in adults may lead to neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease. Miquelianin (quercetin-3-O-beta-d-glucuronide, Q3GA) is a constituent of the nuciferine leaf polyphenol extract (NLPE), and it has protective effects against neurodegeneration. In this study, we examined the effect of the NLPE on neurogenesis and the mechanisms underlying Q3GA on neurogenesis. We fed 24-week-old male C57BL/6 mice with 0.1 or 0.25% NLPE for 2 weeks. NLPE treatment increased small spindle-shaped stem cell numbers in the subgranular zone and the number of doublecortin (DCX)- and neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN)-expressing neurons. HT22, a hippocampal cell line, treated with Q3GA revealed significant neurite growth and upregulated TrkR and PI3K/Akt levels. The evidence from a model of retinoic acid-induced SH-SY5Y cell differentiation showed that Q3GA or NLPE increases neurite growth significantly. Taken together, the NLPE containing Q3GA to promote neurogenesis involving the upregulation of TrkR and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway might be potentiated as an alternative strategy for the treatment of neurodegeneration.
