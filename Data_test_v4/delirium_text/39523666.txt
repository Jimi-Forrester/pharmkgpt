39523666|t|Treatment with medication for patients with psychosis within 2 days during waiting in the accident and emergency department and its correlation with length of in-patient stay: retrospective database study.
39523666|a|BACKGROUND: One of the 'critical goals' for psychiatric liaison services is reducing hospitalisation. Psychotropic medication is a treatment for psychosis, although research determining the efficacy of early medication administration is lacking. AIMS: To determine whether commencing psychotropic medication within 2 days of psychiatric liaison input in the accident and emergency (A&E) department is correlated with length of in-patient psychiatric admissions for patients with psychosis. METHOD: We gathered data on patients presenting to A&E sites covered by South London and Maudsley (SLaM) National Health Service Trust, who were subsequently admitted to and discharged from SLaM psychiatric in-patient wards with discharge diagnosis of psychosis between 2015 and 2020. The analysis set comprised 228 patients waiting in the A&E department under psychiatric liaison care for >=2 days, of which 140 were started on medication within those 2 days (group A) and 88 were not (group B). Group A was divided into A1 (patients restarted on previous psychotropic medication taken within 1 week) and A2 (others, including those new to psychotropic medication or with past usage). RESULTS: Although Kaplan-Meier survival curves with log-rank tests demonstrated no statistically significant difference of in-patient admission duration between groups A and B or groups B1 and B2, further analysis revealed that subgroup A1 had statistically significant shorter admissions than group B (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Restarting patients with psychosis on medication they were taking within the week before A&E department attendance, within 2 days of arrival at the A&E department, is associated with statistically significant shorter admissions. The limitation is a relatively small sample size.
