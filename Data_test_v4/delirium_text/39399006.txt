39399006|a|While substantial progress has been made in mapping the connectivity of cortical networks responsible for conscious awareness, neuroimaging analysis of subcortical arousal networks that modulate arousal (i.e., wakefulness) has been limited by a lack of a robust segmentation procedures for brainstem arousal nuclei. Automated segmentation of brainstem arousal nuclei is an essential step toward elucidating the physiology of arousal in human consciousness and the pathophysiology of disorders of consciousness. We created a probabilistic atlas of brainstem arousal nuclei built on diffusion MRI scans of five ex vivo human brain specimens scanned at 750 mum isotropic resolution. Labels of arousal nuclei used to generate the probabilistic atlas were manually annotated with reference to nucleus-specific immunostaining in two of the five brain specimens. We then developed a Bayesian segmentation algorithm that utilizes the probabilistic atlas as a generative model and automatically identifies brainstem arousal nuclei in a resolution- and contrast-agnostic manner. The segmentation method displayed high accuracy in both healthy and lesioned in vivo T1 MRI scans and high test-retest reliability across both T1 and T2 MRI contrasts. Finally, we show that the segmentation algorithm can detect volumetric changes and differences in magnetic susceptibility within brainstem arousal nuclei in Alzheimer's disease and traumatic coma, respectively. We release the probabilistic atlas and Bayesian segmentation tool in FreeSurfer to advance the study of human consciousness and its disorders.
