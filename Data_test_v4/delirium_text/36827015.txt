36827015|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of ultrasound-guided thoracic paravertebral nerve block on perioperative pain and postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobotomy. METHODS: Patients aged 60 to 80 years who underwent the surgery of thoracoscopic lobectomy were selected; ASA grades I to III and New York Heart Association (NYHA) grades I to II. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: group C (group Compaired) and group T (group Thoracic Paravertebral Nerve Block TPVB). Patients in group T received ultrason-guided TPVB while those in group C didn't received TPVB. Postoperative patient-controlled intravenous analgesia was administered to all the patients. The consumption of intraoperative opioids, cases of hipoxemia, operative time, and extubation time was also recorded. Pain scores (static and dynamic) were assessed at 2, 4, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours point after the operation. Pain scores, occurrence of postoperative delirium occurrence, postoperative complications, total amount of analgesic drugs, length of hospital stay, rescue analgesic requirement, and side effects were recorded within 5 days. RESULTS: Intraoperative dosages of sufentanil and remifentanil were significantly lower in group T (Table 1). The postoperative recovery time in group T was significantly shortened (Table 1). The VAS pain scores of group T at 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours after surgery were much lower. The consumption of intraoperative opioids, number of rescue analgesic requirements, and the occurrence of postoperative delirium incidence in group T was significantly reduced (Table 2). There were no differences in hipoxemia events, postoperative nausea, vomiting and pulmonary complications between the two groups (Table 2). CONCLUSION: Preoperative ultrasound-guided thoracic paravertebral nerve block (TPVB) can obviously decrease the intraoperative and postoperative opioids consumption, shorten the recovery time, reduce the number of rescue analgesia and the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobotomy.
