15992081|a|The low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are now not only used for the prophylaxis and treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but also for the management of acute coronary syndromes. Beside these approved usages, the LMWHs have been developed for indications such as thrombotic and ischaemic stroke, cancer-associated thrombotic and vascular disorders, Alzheimer's disease and a variety of inflammatory disorders. In the United States, there are three approved LMWHs (enoxaparin, dalteparin and ardeparin). In Canada, reviparin and tinzaparin are also approved. The European Union has taken the lead; eight LMWHs are approved for various indications. Certoparin represents one of the earlier LMWHs used for DVT prophylaxis and treatment, with additional indications currently under development. Certoparin represents an isoamyl nitrite depolymerised LMWH with comparable structural characteristics to other nitrous acid depolymerised products such as nadroparin and reviparin. While comparable in structure to dalteparin, this agent differs in function due to a secondary purification process that is employed in the manufacture of dalteparin. The preclinical pharmacology of this drug has been extensively investigated. Although indication specific dosing and the optimisation of use in, for example, acute coronary syndromes and thrombotic stroke, may be require, certoparin represents a typical LMWH with comparable performance characteristics to some other agents. This chapter describes some of the preclinical and clinical pharmacologic characteristics of this drug. This information will be useful in designing clinical trials for newer indications of this drug.
