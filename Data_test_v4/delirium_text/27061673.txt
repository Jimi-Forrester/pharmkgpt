27061673|a|Glutaminyl cyclase (QC) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and can be a potential target for the development of novel anti-AD agents. However, the study of QC inhibitors are still less. Here, phenol-4' (R1-), C5-OH (R2-) and C7-OH (R3-) modified apigenin derivatives were synthesized as a new class of human QC (hQC) inhibitors. The efficacy investigation of these compounds was performed by spectrophotometric assessment and the structure-activity relationship (SAR) was evaluated. Molecular docking was also carried out to analyze the binding mode of the synthesized flavonoid to the active site of hQC.
