31792184|a|Retrotransposons compose a staggering 40% of the mammalian genome. Among them, endogenous retroviruses (ERV) represent sequences that closely resemble the proviruses created from exogenous retroviral infection. ERVs make up 8 to 10% of human and mouse genomes and range from evolutionarily ancient sequences to recent acquisitions. Studies in Drosophila have provided a causal link between genomic retroviral elements and cognitive decline; however, in mammals, the role of ERVs in learning and memory remains unclear. Here we studied 2 independent murine models for ERV activation: muMT strain (lacking B cells and antibody production) and intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (ICVI-STZ). We conducted behavioral assessments (contextual fear memory and spatial learning), as well as gene and protein analysis (RNA sequencing, PCR, immunohistochemistry, and western blot assays). Mice lacking mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and mice lacking stimulator of IFN genes protein (STING), 2 downstream sensors of ERV activation, provided confirmation of ERV impact. We found that muMT mice and ICVI-STZ mice induced hippocampal ERV activation, as shown by increased gene and protein expression of the Gag sequence of the transposable element intracisternal A-particle. ERV activation was accompanied by significant hippocampus-related memory impairment in both models. Notably, the deficiency of the MAVS pathway was protective against ICVI-STZ-induced cognitive pathology. Overall, our results demonstrate that ERV activation is associated with cognitive impairment in mice. Moreover, they provide a molecular target for strategies aimed at attenuating retroviral element sensing, via MAVS, to treat dementia and neuropsychiatric disorders.
