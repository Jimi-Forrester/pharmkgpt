37509630|t|Neuropsychological Assessment in Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury: A Comprehensive Review with Clinical Recommendations.
37509630|a|Traumatic brain injury is damage to the brain occurring after birth, often resulting in the deterioration of cognitive, behavioural, and emotional functions. Neuropsychological evaluation can assist clinicians to better assess the patient's clinical condition, reach differential diagnoses, and develop interventional strategies. However, considering the multiple rating scales available, it is not easy to establish which tool is most suitable for the different brain injury conditions. The aim of this review is to investigate and describe the most used neurocognitive assessment tools in patients with traumatic brain injury to provide clinicians with clear indications on their use in clinical practice. Indeed, during the acute phase, after the head trauma, alertness and wakefulness of the patients affected by a disorder of consciousness can be assessed using different scales, such as the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised. In both postacute and chronic phases after traumatic brain injury, general cognitive assessment tools (such as the Mini Mental State Examination) or more specific cognitive tests (e.g., Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and Trail Making Test) could be administered according to the patient's functional status. In this way, clinicians may be aware of the patient's neuropsychological and cognitive level, so they can guarantee a personalized and tailored rehabilitation approach in this frail patient population.
