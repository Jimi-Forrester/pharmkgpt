37892135|t|Autophagy and Inflammation: Regulatory Roles in Viral Infections.
37892135|a|Autophagy is a highly conserved intracellular degradation pathway in eukaryotic organisms, playing an adaptive role in various pathophysiological processes throughout evolution. Inflammation is the immune system's response to external stimuli and tissue damage. However, persistent inflammatory reactions can lead to a range of inflammatory diseases and cancers. The interaction between autophagy and inflammation is particularly evident during viral infections. As a crucial regulator of inflammation, autophagy can either promote or inhibit the occurrence of inflammatory responses. In turn, inflammation can establish negative feedback loops by modulating autophagy to suppress excessive inflammatory reactions. This interaction is pivotal in the pathogenesis of viral diseases. Therefore, elucidating the regulatory roles of autophagy and inflammation in viral infections will significantly enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying related diseases. Furthermore, it will provide new insights and theoretical foundations for disease prevention, treatment, and drug development.
