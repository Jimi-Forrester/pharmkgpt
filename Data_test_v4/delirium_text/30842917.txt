30842917|t|Review of the many faces of synthetic cannabinoid toxicities.
30842917|a|INTRODUCTION: Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) are psychoactive substances that are gaining popularity for their availability and lack of detection by standardized drug tests. Although some users may perceive SCs as safer alternatives to marijuana, some SCs are more potent and result in more severe toxicities. METHODS: A search of the literature was conducted in the PubMed and SciFinder databases. Results in PubMed were limited to human studies, and only articles in English were included. RESULTS: Review of the literature illustrates the hazards associated with SC use. A range of severe toxicities affecting numerous systems has been identified, such as arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, psychosis, suicidal ideation, seizures, acute tubular necrosis, and intracranial hemorrhage. Additionally, a recent outbreak of coagulopathies and at least 4 associated deaths due to SCs tainted with brodifacoum have been reported. DISCUSSION: Synthetic cannabinoids may be perceived as a safer alternative to marijuana; however, SCs can be more potent at the cannabinoid receptors and in turn have greater toxicities. Limited information is available on the metabolism of SCs; however, cytochrome P450 pathways may be involved, which could result in drug interactions and unpredicted adverse effects. Toxicity with SC use is not just related to its effects, but also to additives that may taint these products and enhance their effects. Health care providers should be aware of the range of toxicities related to SC use, and tainted products such as these agents are not detected on routine drug screens.
