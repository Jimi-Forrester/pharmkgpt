37197329|t|Clinical Features, Brain-Structure Changes, and Cognitive Impairment in Basal Ganglia Infarcts: A Pilot Study.
37197329|a|Introduction: Stroke has been considered to raise the risk of dementia in several studies, but the relationship between brain structural changes and poststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is unclear. Methods: In this study, 23 PSCI patients with basal ganglia infarcts after 2 weeks and 29 age-matched controls underwent magnetic resonance imaging measuring cortical thickness and volume changes, as well as neuropsychological tests. CI was derived from a performance score <1.5 standard deviations for normally distributed scores. We compared Z scores in different cognitive domains and cortical thickness and volumes in two groups. Multiple linear regressions were used to investigate the relationship between cortical thickness and volumes and neuropsychological tests. Results: A majority of PSCI patients were in their 50s (55.19+-8.52 years). PSCI patients exhibited significantly decreased Z scores in multiple domains, such as memory, language, visuomotor speed, and attention/executive function. The volumes of the middle posterior corpus callosum, middle anterior corpus callosum, and hippocampus in PSCI patients were markedly lower than controls. The thickness of the right inferior temporal cortex and insula were significantly smaller than controls. It found that the reduced right hippocampus was related to executive dysfunction. Hippocampus dysfunction may be involved in language impairment (p<0.05) in PSCI patients with basal ganglia infarcts. Conclusion: These findings demonstrated that brain structure changed after ischemic stroke, and different gray-matter structural changes could lead to specific cognitive decline in PSCI patients with basal ganglia infarcts. Atrophy of the right hippocampus potentially serves as an imaging marker of early executive function of PSCI.
