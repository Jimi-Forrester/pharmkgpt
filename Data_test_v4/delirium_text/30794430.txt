30794430|a|M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are highly expressed in key areas that control cognition, such as the cortex and hippocampus, representing one potential therapeutic target for cognitive dysfunctions of Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. We have reported that M1 receptors facilitate cognition by promoting membrane insertion of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor AMPA receptor subunit 1 (GluA1) through phosphorylation at Ser845. However, the signaling pathway is still unclear. Here we showed that adenylyl cyclase inhibitor 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine and PKA inhibitor KT5720 inhibited enhancement of phosphorylation of Ser845 and membrane insertion of GluA1 induced by M1 receptor activation. Furthermore, PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and protein kinase B (Akt) inhibitor IV blocked the effects of M1 receptors as well. Remarkably, the increase of the activity of PI3K-Akt signaling induced by M1 receptor activation could be abolished by cAMP-PKA inhibitors. Moreover, inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1, an important downstream effector of PI3K-Akt, by short-term application of rapamycin attenuated the effects of M1 receptors on GluA1. Furthermore, such effect was unrelated to possible protein synthesis promoted by mTOR. Taken together, these data demonstrate that M1 receptor activation induces membrane insertion of GluA1 via a signaling linking cAMP-PKA and PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathways but is irrelevant to protein synthesis.-Zhao, L.-X., Ge, Y.-H., Li, J.-B., Xiong, C.-H., Law, P.-Y., Xu, J.-R., Qiu, Y., Chen, H.-Z.
