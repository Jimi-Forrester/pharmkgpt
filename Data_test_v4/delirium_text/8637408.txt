8637408|a|The present study assessed the safety and efficacy of the cholinesterase inhibitor, velnacrine, for treating the cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Patients (N = 236) meeting NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for Alzheimer's disease entered a double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging protocol (30, 75, 150, 225 mg/day each for one week) to identify velnacrine responders (> or = four point improvement on the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale [ADAScog]). After a two week drug washout, velnacrine responders were randomly assigned to their best velnacrine dose or placebo in a six week dose-replication protocol employing the ADAScog and the Clinical Global Improvement scale as primary outcome measures. During dose-replication, intent-to-treat analysis revealed that velnacrine patients scored significantly better than placebo patients on the ADAScog after two (p < 0.004), four (p < 0.025) and six (p < 0.001) weeks of treatment. No significant treatment effect on Clinical Global Improvement scores was observed. The primary adverse event was an asymptomatic elevation of liver transaminases found among 28% of the 236 treated patients. Cholinergic side effects including diarrhea (14%), nausea (11%) and vomiting (5%) were observed and 8% of patients experienced skin rash. The present study identified a subgroup of Alzheimer's patients who demonstrated a significant, but modest, improvement during velnacrine treatment on structured cognitive testing.
