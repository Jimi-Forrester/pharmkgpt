39488081|t|Streamlined turn-off fluorescence sensing of Donepezil: Enhancing evaluation in pharmaceutical formulations, quality control labs, and biological fluids at nano levels.
39488081|a|Donepezil (DPZ) is used to treat Alzheimer's disease by increasing acetylcholine in the brain, necessitating precise analytical methods for its evaluation. This study aims to develop and validate a new turn-off fluorescence sensing method for quantifying DPZ, enhancing its evaluation in pharmaceutical formulations, quality control laboratories, and biological fluids. By leveraging the fluorescence-quenching interplay between DPZ and tetrabromofluorescein, the assay parameters were fine-tuned to enhance the development of an ion-associated complex. The developed method demonstrated a measurement range from 40.0 to 800.0 ng/mL, with detection and quantification limits of 12.6 ng/mL and 38.0 ng/mL, respectively. However, the successful application of the method to commercial DPZ tablets and plasma samples confirmed its effectiveness for both quality control labs and clinical research settings. It ensured accurate content uniformity and high precision, making it ideal for routine DPZ monitoring. In contrast to previous methods, this approach emphasizes environmental sustainability, evaluated using advanced tools like the Eco score scale, AGREE, RGB12, and BAGI. These tools facilitated a thorough assessment of the method's ecological impact and sustainability, underscoring its advantage over traditional methods in terms of environmental responsibility.
