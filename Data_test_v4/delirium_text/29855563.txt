29855563|a|Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase, NDU) and complex IV (cytochrome-c-oxidase, COX) of the mitochondrial electron transport chain have been implicated in the pathophysiology of major psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SZ), as well as in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD). We conducted meta-analyses comparing complex I and IV in each disorder MDD, BD, SZ, AD, and PD, as well as in normal aging. The electronic databases Pubmed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Google Scholar, were searched for studies published between 1980 and 2018. Of 2049 screened studies, 125 articles were eligible for the meta-analyses. Complex I and IV were assessed in peripheral blood, muscle biopsy, or postmortem brain at the level of enzyme activity or subunits. Separate meta-analyses of mood disorder studies, MDD and BD, revealed moderate effect sizes for similar abnormality patterns in the expression of complex I with SZ in frontal cortex, cerebellum and striatum, whereas evidence for complex IV alterations was low. By contrast, the neurodegenerative disorders, AD and PD, showed strong effect sizes for shared deficits in complex I and IV, such as in peripheral blood, frontal cortex, cerebellum, and substantia nigra. Beyond the diseased state, there was an age-related robust decline in both complexes I and IV. In summary, the strongest support for a role for complex I and/or IV deficits, is in the pathophysiology of PD and AD, and evidence is less robust for MDD, BD, or SZ.
