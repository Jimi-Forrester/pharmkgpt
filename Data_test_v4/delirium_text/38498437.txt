38498437|a|In searching for compounds with antioxidant and antifungal activity, our study focused on the subshrub species Empetrum rubrum Vahl ex Willd. (Ericaceae). We measured the antioxidant activity of its methanolic extract (MEE) obtained from the aerial parts (leaves and stems) and of its methanolic extract (MEF) obtained from the lyophilized fruits. The antioxidant activity of the MEE and MEF was evaluated in vitro via a 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical and 2,2'-Azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) cationic radical. The results were expressed in gallic acid and Trolox equivalents for the DPPH and ABTS assays, respectively. The antioxidant activities, for the DPPH and ABTS assays, were also evaluated by considering the IC50 values. Concerning the antioxidant activity, the total phenolic content (TPC) in the MEE and MEF was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu method. Polyphenols contained in the leaves, stems, and fruits of E. rubrum were determined qualitatively by employing high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) analysis. The antifungal activity of the MEE obtained from the aerial parts of E. rubrum was tested against Rhizoctonia solani. The results of IC50 values measured by the DPPH and ABTS methods with MEE were 0.4145 +- 0.0068 mg mL-1 and 0.1088 +- 0.0023 mg mL-1, respectively, and the IC50 values for MEF were 6.4768 +- 0.0218 mg mL-1 and 0.7666 +- 0.0089 mg mL-1 measured by the DPPH and ABTS methods, respectively. The HPLC-MS analysis revealed the presence of anthocyanins, phenolic acids derivatives, and flavonols. In vitro, mycelial growth of this fungus was reduced from 90% to nearly 100% in the presence of MEE. The observed antifungal effect is related to the presence of the abovementioned phenols, detected in the MEE.
