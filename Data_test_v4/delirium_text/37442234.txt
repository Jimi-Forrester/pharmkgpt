37442234|a|Neurosteroids, which are steroids synthesized by the nervous system, can exert neuromodulatory and neuroprotective effects via genomic and non-genomic pathways. The neurosteroid and major steroid precursor pregnenolone has therapeutical potential in various diseases, such as psychiatric and pain disorders, and may play important roles in myelination, neuroinflammation, neurotransmission, and neuroplasticity. Although pregnenolone is synthesized by CYP11A1 in peripheral steroidogenic organs, our recent study showed that pregnenolone must be synthesized by another mitochondrial cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme other than CYP11A1 in human glial cells. Therefore, we sought to identify the CYP450 responsible for pregnenolone production in the human brain. Upon screening for CYP450s expressed in the human brain that have mitochondrial localization, we identified three enzyme candidates: CYP27A1, CYP1A1, and CYP1B1. We found that inhibition of CYP27A1 through inhibitors and siRNA knockdown did not negatively affect pregnenolone synthesis in human glial cells. Meanwhile, treatment of human glial cells with CYP1A1/CYP1B1 inhibitors significantly reduced pregnenolone production in the presence of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol. We performed siRNA knockdown of CYP1A1 or CYP1B1 in human glial cells and found that only CYP1B1 knockdown significantly decreased pregnenolone production. Furthermore, overexpression of mitochondria-targeted CYP1B1 significantly increased pregnenolone production under basal conditions and in the presence of hydroxycholesterols and LDL. Inhibition of CYP1A1 and/or CYP1B1 via inhibitors or siRNA knockdown did not significantly reduce pregnenolone synthesis in human adrenal cortical cells, implying that CYP1B1 is not a major pregnenolone-producing enzyme in the periphery. These data suggest that mitochondrial CYP1B1 is involved in pregnenolone synthesis in human glial cells.
