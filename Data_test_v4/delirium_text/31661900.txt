31661900|t|Reduced Cholinergic Activity in the Hippocampus of Hippocampal Cholinergic Neurostimulating Peptide Precursor Protein Knockout Mice.
31661900|a|The cholinergic efferent network from the medial septal nucleus to the hippocampus has an important role in learning and memory processes. This cholinergic projection can generate theta oscillations in the hippocampus to efficiently encode novel information. Hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide (HCNP) induces acetylcholine synthesis in medial septal nuclei. HCNP is processed from the N-terminal region of a 186 amino acid, 21 kD HCNP precursor protein called HCNP-pp (also known as Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1)). In this study, we generated HCNP-pp knockout (KO) mice and assessed their cholinergic septo-hippocampal projection, local field potentials in CA1, and behavioral phenotypes. No significant behavioral phenotype was observed in HCNP-pp KO mice. However, theta power in the CA1 of HCNP-pp KO mice was significantly reduced because of fewer cholineacetyltransferase-positive axons in the CA1 stratum oriens. These observations indicated disruption of cholinergic activity in the septo-hippocampal network. Our study demonstrates that HCNP may be a cholinergic regulator in the septo-hippocampal network.
