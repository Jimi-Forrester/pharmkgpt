35052921|t|Stability of Antimicrobials in Elastomeric Pumps: A Systematic Review.
35052921|a|Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAThttp) programs have become an important healthcare tool around the world. Portable elastomeric infusion pumps are functional devices for ambulatory delivery of antimicrobial drugs, and their stability is an essential point to guarantee an appropriate infusion administration. We conducted a systematic review to provide a synthesis and a critical evaluation of the current evidence regarding antimicrobial stability in elastomeric pumps. Data sources were PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Sciences. The review protocol was registered on the Center for Open Science, and it was carried out following the PRISMA guidelines. Studies were eligible if the aim was the evaluation of the physicochemical stability of an antimicrobial agent stored in an elastomeric device. Of the 613 papers identified, 33 met the inclusion criteria. The most studied group of antimicrobials was penicillins, followed by cephalosporins and carbapenems. In general, the stability results of the antimicrobials that have been studied in more than one article agree with each other, with the exception of ampicillin, flucloxacillin, and ceftazidime. The antibiotics that displayed a longer stability were glycopeptides and clindamycin. Regarding the stability of antifungals and antivirals, only caspofungin, voriconazole, and ganciclovir have been investigated. The information provided in this article should be considered in patient treatments within the OPAT setting. Further stability studies are needed to confirm the appropriate use of the antimicrobials included in this program to ensure optimal patient outcomes.
