36503209|a|PURPOSE: Investigations of the hemodynamic changes of the venous system in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have shown contradictory results. Herein, the biomechanical parameters of the internal jugular vein (IJV) and common carotid artery (CCA) of MS patients were extracted and compared to healthy individuals. METHODS: B-mode and Doppler sequential ultrasound images of 64 IJVs and CCAs of women including 22 healthy individuals, 22 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients, and 20 primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) patients were recorded and processed. The biomechanical parameters of the IJV and the CCA walls during three cardiac cycles were calculated. RESULTS: The IJV maximum and minimum pressures were higher in the MS patients than in the healthy subjects, by 31% and 19% in RRMS patients and 39% and 24% in PPMS patients. The venous wall thicknesses in RRMS and PPMS patients were 51% and 60% higher than in healthy subjects, respectively. IJV distensibility in RRMS and PPMS patients was 70% and 75% lower, and compliance was 40% and 59% lower than in healthy subjects. The maximum intima-media thicknesses of the CCAs were 38% and 24%, and the minimum intima-media thicknesses were 27% and 23% higher in RRMS and PPMS patients than in healthy individuals, respectively. The shear modulus of CCA walls in RRMS and PPMS patients was 17% and 31%, and the radial elastic moduli were 47% and 9% higher than in healthy individuals. CONCLUSION: Some physical and biomechanical parameters of the CCA and IJV showed significant differences between MS patients and healthy individuals.
