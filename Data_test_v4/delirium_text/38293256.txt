38293256|t|Complication rates after direct anterior vs posterior approach for hip hemiarthroplasty in elderly individuals with femoral neck fractures.
38293256|a|BACKGROUND: Dislocation rates after hemiarthroplasty reportedly vary from 1% to 17%. This serious complication is associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates. Approaches to this surgery are still debated, with no consensus regarding the superiority of any single approach. AIM: To compare early postoperative complications after implementing the direct anterior and posterior approaches (PL) for hip hemiarthroplasty after femoral neck fractures. METHODS: This is a comparative, retrospective, single-center cohort study conducted at a university hospital. Between March 2008 and December 2018, 273 patients (a total of 280 hips) underwent bipolar hemiarthroplasties (n = 280) for displaced femoral neck fractures using either the PL (n = 171) or the minimally invasive direct anterior approach (DAA) (n = 109). The choice of approach was related to the surgeons' practices; the implant types were similar and unrelated to the approach. Dislocation rates and other complications were reviewed after a minimum follow-up of 6 mo. RESULTS: Both treatment groups had similarly aged patients (mean age: 82 years), sex ratios, patient body mass indexes, and patient comorbidities. Surgical data (surgery delay time, operative time, and blood loss volume) did not differ significantly between the groups. The 30 d mortality rate was higher in the PL group (9.9%) than in the DAA group (3.7%), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.052). Among the one-month survivors, a significantly higher rate of dislocation was observed in the PL group (14/154; 9.1%) than in the DAA group (0/105; 0%) (P = 0.002). Of the 14 patients with dislocation, 8 underwent revision surgery for recurrent instability (posterior group), and one of them had 2 additional procedures due to a deep infection. The rate of other complications (e.g., perioperative and early postoperative periprosthetic fractures and infection-related complications) did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the DAA to bipolar hemiarthroplasty for patients with femoral neck fractures is associated with a lower dislocation rate (< 1%) than the PL.
