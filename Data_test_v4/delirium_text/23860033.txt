23860033|a|Dendritic spines are the site of most excitatory synapses, the loss of which correlates with cognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer disease. Substantial evidence indicates that amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, either insoluble fibrillar Abeta deposited into plaques or soluble nonfibrillar Abeta species, can cause spine loss but the concurrent contributions of fibrillar Abeta and nonfibrillar Abeta to spine loss has not been previously assessed. We used multiple-label immunohistochemistry to measure spine density, size, and F-actin content surrounding plaques in the cerebral cortex in the PSAPP mouse model of Abeta deposition. Our approach allowed us to measure fibrillar Abeta plaque content and an index of nonfibrillar Abeta species concurrently. We found that spine density was reduced within 6 mum of the plaque perimeter, remaining spines were more compact, and F-actin content per spine was increased. Measures of fibrillar Abeta plaque content were associated with reduced spine density near plaques, whereas measures of nonfibrillar Abeta species were associated with reduced spine density and size but not altered F-actin content. These findings suggest that strategies to preserve dendritic spines in AD patients may need to address both nonfibrillar and fibrillar forms of Abeta and that nonfibrillar Abeta may exert spine toxicity through pathways not mediated by depolymerization of F-actin.
