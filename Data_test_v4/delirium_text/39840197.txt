39840197|t|Beyond the Operating Room: A Narrative Review of Enhanced Recovery Strategies in Colorectal Surgery.
39840197|a|Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols have significantly transformed the management of patients undergoing colorectal surgery. This comprehensive review explores the key components and benefits of ERAS in colorectal procedures, focusing on preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative strategies aimed at improving patient outcomes. These strategies include preoperative patient education, multimodal analgesia, minimally invasive surgical techniques, and early mobilization. ERAS protocols reduce postoperative complications, shorten hospital stays, and enhance overall recovery, leading to better patient satisfaction and decreased healthcare costs. However, challenges such as patient adherence and managing high-risk patients remain critical areas for further research. Additionally, future research should focus on refining ERAS protocols, integrating novel technologies such as minimally invasive techniques, and evaluating long-term outcomes to further enhance the recovery process.
