31982159|a|Fibrauretine is the main active ingredient in rattan stems of Fibraurea recisa Pierre. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cognitive-enhancing effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of fibrauretine compatibilized with ginsenosides on Alzheimer's disease (AD) induced in mice with amyloid beta-protein (Abeta1-42). The results showed that the spatial learning and memory abilities of AD mice were significantly enhanced after combined treatment with fibrauretine and ginsenosides using the Morris water maze test. The levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and phosphorylated Tau protein (p-Tau) in brain tissue and the levels of nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in plasma were significantly increased in Abeta1-42-induced AD mice, and these effects were reversed after combined treatment with fibrauretine and ginsenosides. By contrast, a significant increase in the levels of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) was observed in the combined treatment group. The results of haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling (TUNEL) analysis, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blot analysis showed that the apoptosis rate, Bax, nuclear factor kappa-B p65 (NF-kappaBp65), cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 expression levels were obviously decreased and that the Bcl-2 expression levels were significantly increased in the hippocampi of mice treated with fibrauretine and ginsenosides. The results of this study show that the ameliorative effect of fibrauretine against AD can be significantly enhanced by compatibilization with ginsenosides. The underlying molecular mechanisms of fibrauretine may be related to antioxidation and anti-apoptosis.
