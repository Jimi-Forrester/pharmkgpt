19270826|a|Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments used in psychiatry to date. The mechanisms of ECT action, however, are the least understood and still unclear. As a tool to elucidate the mechanisms of action of ECT, we employed proteomic analysis based on the identification of differentially expressed proteins after exposure to repeated ECT in rat brains. The expression of proteins was visualized by silver stain after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Of 24 differentially expressed protein spots (p<0.05 by Student t-test), six different proteins from 7 spots were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of flight (MALDI-TOF)/mass spectrometry. Among the identified proteins, there were five dominantly expressed proteins in the ECT-treated rat brain tissues (p<0.05); S100 protein beta chain, 14-3-3 protein zeta/delta, similar to ubiquitin-like 1 (sentrin) activating enzyme subunit 1, suppressor of G2 allele of SKP1 homolog, and phosphatidylinositol transfer protein alpha. The expression of only one protein, ACY1 protein, was repressed (p<0.05). These findings likely serve for a better understanding of mechanisms involved in the therapeutic effects of ECT.
