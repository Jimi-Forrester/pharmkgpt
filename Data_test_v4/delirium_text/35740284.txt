35740284|a|The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of neuronal damage biomarkers (neurofilament light chain (NFL) and total tau protein (T-tau)) in the CSF of patients with autoimmune encephalitis (AE) with the presence of an underlying malignancy and to determine correlations with patient characteristics. The study comprised 21 patients with encephalitis associated with antibodies against intracellular (n = 11) and surface/synaptic antigens (extracellular, n = 10) and non-inflammatory disease controls (n = 10). Patients with AE associated with intracellular antigens had increased CSF-NFL (p = 0.003) but not T-tau levels compared to controls. When adjusted for age, CSF-NFL but not CSF-T-tau was higher in patients with encephalitis associated with intracellular antigens as compared to those with encephalitis associated with extracellular antigens (p = 0.032). Total tau and NFL levels were not significantly altered in patients with encephalitis associated with extracellular antigens compared to controls. NFL in the total cohort correlated with neurological signs of cerebellar dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, presence of CV2 positivity, presence of an underlying tumor and a more detrimental clinical outcome. AE patients with abnormal MRI findings displayed higher NFL levels compared to those without, albeit with no statistical significance (p = 0.07). Using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, CSF-NFL levels with a cut-off value of 969 pg/mL had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 76.19%, respectively, regarding the detection of underlying malignancies. Our findings suggest that neuronal integrity is preserved in autoimmune encephalitis associated with extracellular antigens and without the presence of tumor. However, highly increased NFL is observed in AE associated with intracellular antigens and presence of an underlying tumor. CSF-NFL could potentially be used as a diagnostic biomarker of underlying malignancies in the clinical setting of AE.
