38212785|t|Taming microglia: the promise of engineered microglia in treating neurological diseases.
38212785|a|Microglia, the CNS-resident immune cells, are implicated in many neurological diseases. Nearly one in six of the world's population suffers from neurological disorders, encompassing neurodegenerative and neuroautoimmune diseases, most with dysregulated neuroinflammation involved. Activated microglia become phagocytotic and secret various immune molecules, which are mediators of the brain immune microenvironment. Given their ability to penetrate through the blood-brain barrier in the neuroinflammatory context and their close interaction with neurons and other glial cells, microglia are potential therapeutic delivery vehicles and modulators of neuronal activity. Re-engineering microglia to treat neurological diseases is, thus, increasingly gaining attention. By altering gene expression, re-programmed microglia can be utilized to deliver therapeutics to targeted sites and control neuroinflammation in various neuroinflammatory diseases. This review addresses the current development in microglial engineering, including genetic targeting and therapeutic modulation. Furthermore, we discuss limitations to the genetic engineering techniques and models used to test the functionality of re-engineered microglia, including cell culture and animal models. Finally, we will discuss future directions for the application of engineered microglia in treating neurological diseases.
