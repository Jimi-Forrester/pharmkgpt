29726428|t|Effect of Nursing Assessment on Predictive Delirium Models in Hospitalised Patients.
29726428|a|Delirium is an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome which is common in elderly patients during their hospitalisation and is associated with an increased mortality and morbidity. Since delirium is a) often underdiagnosed and b) preventable if early signs are detected,igh expectations are set in delirium risk assessment during hospital admission. In our latest studies, we showed that delirium prediction using machine learning algorithms is possible based on the patients' health history. The aim of this study is to compare the influence of nursing assessment data on prediction models with clinical and demographic data. We approached the problem by a) comparing the performance of predictive models including nursing data with models based on clinical and demographic data only and b) analysing the feature importance of all available features. From our results we concluded that nursing assessment data can improve the performance of delirium prediction models better than demographic, laboratory, diagnosis, procedures, and previous transfers' data alone.
