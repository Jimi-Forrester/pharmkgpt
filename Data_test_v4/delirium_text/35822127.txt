35822127|t|Prevalence and Predictors of Potentially Inappropriate Medications Among Patients Aged >=65 Years on Hospital Admissions in Kuwait.
35822127|a|Background: Potentially inappropriate medications are major health concerns for patients aged >=65 years. To investigate the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications, Beer's criteria can be used. We estimated the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications prescription among patients aged >=65 years admitted to Kuwait's largest hospital and identified the predictors of prescribing a potentially inappropriate medication. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted retrospectively using inpatient records from the medical department at the Hospital in Kuwait from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. The latest version of Beer's criteria was used to identify potentially inappropriate medications in patients' medical records. Data were analyzed descriptively to estimate the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications and to describe participant characteristics. The predictors of potentially inappropriate medications prescribing were determined using binary logistic regression. Results: A total of 423 medical records of patients were collected. The mean age of the patients admitted was 76 +- 7 years, and 222 of them (52.5%) were women. Upon hospital admission, potentially inappropriate medication was prevalent in 58.4% of patients. The most prevalent potentially inappropriate medications identified were proton pump inhibitors (27.3%), diuretics (21.5%), antipsychotic agents (9%), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (5%), and methyldopa (4%). Polypharmacy, Alzheimer's disease, depression, irritable bowel syndrome, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease were predictors of potentially inappropriate medications prescription. Conclusion: A high prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication prescription was observed among patients aged >=65 years admitted to a hospital in Kuwait. The most likely predictor of potentially inappropriate medication prescription was polypharmacy.
