32438702|a|Fucoidan is a fucose-enriched polysaccharide, obtained from brown algae, with demonstrated antioxidant properties. However, traditional extraction methods using water or chemical-based extraction methods have reduced yield and produced hazardous by-products. In this study, we isolated fucoidan at a high yield using enzyme-assisted extraction; the Celluclast enzyme assisted extract of Undaria pinnatifida sporophylls (FCUS). To examine the antioxidant properties of FCUS, oxidative stress was induced with 2,2'-azobis (2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH) in Vero cells and zebrafish model. FCUS was composed of 30.4% sulfate and 52.3% fucose. Pre-treatment of Vero cells with FCUS dose dependently inhibited AAPH-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Moreover, FCUS remarkably reduced cell death, ROS generation, and lipid peroxidation production in zebrafish larvae. Overall, these findings indicate that the sulfate-rich fucoidan of FCUS, obtained with an eco-friendly process, could be implemented as a beneficial antioxidant agent in the functional food industry.
