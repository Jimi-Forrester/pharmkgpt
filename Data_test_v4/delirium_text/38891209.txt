38891209|t|Nursing Intervention to Prevent and Manage Delirium in Critically Ill Patients: A Scoping Review.
38891209|a|Delirium is an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome of multifactorial etiology with a high incidence in people admitted to intensive care units. In addition to reversible impairment of cognitive processes, it may be associated with changes in thinking and perception. If, in the past, it was considered an expected complication of severe disease, nowadays, delirium is associated with a poor short-term and long-term prognosis. Knowing that its prevention and early identification can reduce morbidity, mortality, and health costs, it is vital to investigate nursing interventions focused on delirium in critically ill patients. This study aimed to identify nursing interventions in the prevention and management of delirium in critically ill adults. The method used to answer the research question was a scoping review. The literature search was performed in the Medline (via PubMed), CINAHL (via EBSCOhost), Scopus, Web of Science, and JBI databases. The final sample included 15 articles. Several categories of non-pharmacological interventions were identified, addressing the modifiable risk factors that contribute to the development of delirium, and for which nurses have a privileged position in their minimization. No drug agent can, by itself, prevent or treat delirium. However, psychoactive drugs are justified to control hyperactive behaviors through cautious use. Early diagnosis, prevention, or treatment can reduce symptoms and improve the individual's quality of life. Therefore, nursing professionals must ensure harmonious coordination between non-pharmacological and pharmacological strategies.
