35326944|a|Background: Metabolic syndrome (MS) is highly prevalent in older adults; it constitutes a risk factor for cognitive deterioration, frailty, and Alzheimer's disease. For this reason, the WHO has pointed out the importance of the implementation of community programs for the training of healthy aging. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a community gerontology program framed in active aging on the control of metabolic syndrome in older adults. Methods: An experimental study was carried out in a convenience sample of 80 older adults diagnosed with MS according to the ATPIII criteria, comprising (1) experimental group (EG), n = 40; (2) control group (CG), n = 40. During a 6-month period, the EG participated in a supervised community gerontology program, and the CG was assessed monthly. Results: A statistically significant decrease was observed in the number of components for the diagnosis of MS. In this regard, of the total of participants with a diagnosis of MS in EG, only 28% maintained the diagnosis of MS (ATPIII >= 3 criteria), in contrast to 83% of the CG participants (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that health self-care training within the framework of active aging is effective for the control of MS in older adults.
