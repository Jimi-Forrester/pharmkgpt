28555889|t|Reduced muscle strength in ether lipid-deficient mice is accompanied by altered development and function of the neuromuscular junction.
28555889|a|Inherited deficiency in ether lipids, a subgroup of phospholipids whose biosynthesis needs peroxisomes, causes the fatal human disorder rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata. The exact roles of ether lipids in the mammalian organism and, therefore, the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are still largely enigmatic. Here, we used glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase knockout (Gnpat KO) mice to study the consequences of complete inactivation of ether lipid biosynthesis and documented substantial deficits in motor performance and muscle strength of these mice. We hypothesized that, probably in addition to previously described cerebellar abnormalities and myelination defects in the peripheral nervous system, an impairment of neuromuscular transmission contributes to the compromised motor abilities. Structurally, a morphologic examination of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in diaphragm muscle at different developmental stages revealed aberrant axonal branching and a strongly increased area of nerve innervation in Gnpat KO mice. Post-synaptically, acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters colocalized with nerve terminals within a widened endplate zone. In addition, we detected atypical AChR clustering, as indicated by decreased size and number of clusters following stimulation with agrin, in vitro. The turnover of AChRs was unaffected in ether lipid-deficient mice. Electrophysiological evaluation of the adult diaphragm indicated that although evoked potentials were unaltered in Gnpat KO mice, ether lipid deficiency leads to fewer spontaneous synaptic vesicle fusion events but, conversely, an increased post-synaptic response to spontaneous vesicle exocytosis. We conclude from our findings that ether lipids are essential for proper development and function of the NMJ and may, therefore, contribute to motor performance.
