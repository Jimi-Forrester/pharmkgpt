23409038|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) proteolysis is required for production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides that comprise beta-amyloid plaques in brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Recent AD therapeutic interest has been directed toward a group of anti-amyloidogenic compounds extracted from plants. We orally administered the brain penetrant, small molecule phenolic compound ferulic acid (FA) to the transgenic PSAPP mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis (bearing mutant human APP and presenilin-1 transgenes) and evaluated behavioral impairment and AD-like pathology. Oral FA treatment for 6 months reversed transgene-associated behavioral deficits including defective: hyperactivity, object recognition, and spatial working and reference memory, but did not alter wild-type mouse behavior. Furthermore, brain parenchymal and cerebral vascular beta-amyloid deposits as well as abundance of various Abeta species including oligomers were decreased in FA-treated PSAPP mice. These effects occurred with decreased cleavage of the beta-carboxyl-terminal APP fragment, reduced beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 protein stability and activity, attenuated neuroinflammation, and stabilized oxidative stress. As in vitro validation, we treated well-characterized mutant human APP-overexpressing murine neuron-like cells with FA and found significantly decreased Abeta production and reduced amyloidogenic APP proteolysis. Collectively, these results highlight that FA is a beta-secretase modulator with therapeutic potential against AD.
