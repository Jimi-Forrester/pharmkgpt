23594602|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative mental illness characterized by memory loss, multiple cognitive impairments, and changes in personality and behavior. The purpose of our study was to determine the interaction between monomeric and oligomeric amyloid-beta (Abeta) and phosphorylated tau in AD neurons. Using postmortem brains from AD patients at different stages of disease progression and control subjects, and also from AbetaPP, AbetaPPxPS1, and 3xTg-AD mice, we studied the physical interaction between Abeta and phosphorylated tau. Using immunohistological and double-immunofluorescence analyses, we also studied the localization of monomeric and oligomeric Abeta with phosphorylated tau. We found monomeric and oligomeric Abeta interacted with phosphorylated tau in neurons affected by AD. Further, these interactions progressively increased with the disease process. These findings led us to conclude that Abeta interacts with phosphorylated tau and may damage neuronal structure and function, particularly synapses, leading to cognitive decline in AD patients. Our findings suggest that binding sites between Abeta and phosphorylated tau need to be identified and molecules developed to inhibit this interaction.
