37057892|t|MHC class I and MHC class II reporter mice enable analysis of immune oligodendroglia in mouse models of multiple sclerosis.
37057892|a|Oligodendrocytes and their progenitors upregulate MHC pathways in response to inflammation, but the frequency of this phenotypic change is unknown and the features of these immune oligodendroglia are poorly defined. We generated MHC class I and II transgenic reporter mice to define their dynamics in response to inflammatory demyelination, providing a means to monitor MHC activation in diverse cell types in living mice and define their roles in aging, injury, and disease.
