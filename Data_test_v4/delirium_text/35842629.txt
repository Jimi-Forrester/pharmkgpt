35842629|a|BACKGROUND: With the aging of the population, high rates of cancer and comorbidity complexity, the end-of-life care for patients will be ever more important. Nurses have always played an essential role in end-of-life care. Insufficient education and training in end-of-life care has been regarded as a major reason of inadequate symptom recognition, symptom management, and communication which results in mental trauma for both the patient's family and attending health care providers. Undergraduate nurses do end-of-life care as part of their clinical learning. However, undergraduate nurses' perceptions of the education they received about end-of-life care are not documented. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to critically explore the current state of education regarding end-of-life care from the perspectives of undergraduate nurses. METHODS: We used a descriptive qualitative design. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted from May to August 2020, with a purposive sample of 15 fourth-year undergraduate nurses who finished the internship. Data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using content analysis. FINDINGS: Three main themes relating to undergraduate nurses' experiences of end-of-life care education emerged from the thematic analysis: 1) Universities provide foundational knowledge about end-of-life care, but it still needs improvement; 2) Clinical practice consolidates and drives undergraduate nurses' knowledge, skills and confidence about end-of-life care; and 3) cultural attitudes of patients' family toward disease and death sometimes impedes learning and knowledge translation about end-of-life care. CONCLUSION: Undergraduate nursing students benefit from not only theoretical content delivered in the university setting but also practice happened on clinical placement. The current undergraduate curriculum, related to end-of-life care, is disjointed. Meanwhile, undergraduate nurses' learning and knowledge translation of end-of-life care are impeded by cultural attitudes toward disease and death.
