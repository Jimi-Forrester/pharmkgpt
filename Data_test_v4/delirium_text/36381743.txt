36381743|a|Omega is a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) that has an essential impact on cognitive performance at all stages of life. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) are essential for brain functions. DHA, the dominant omega-3 in the brain, impacts neurotransmitters and functions of the brain. This systematic review aimed to assess the effects of omega-3 on brain functions. We searched for articles from 2010 to 2022 in PubMed, electronic databases: discover, academic search complete (EBSCO), and Cochrane. To increase search efficiency, search terms include database-specific indexed phrases and keywords. Search terms included "omega three," "DHA," "fish oil," "eicosapentaenoic acid," "EPA," "docosahexaenoic acid," "omega-3," "cognition," "brain," "mental health," and "PUFAs".We conducted a review of only randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that were published in English. We evaluated the quality of the studies using the Cochrane Collaboration bias assessment tool. Our search strategy yielded 174 articles, out of which 33 full-text articles were reviewed and nine articles were selected for data abstraction. The overall number of individuals in all nine studies was 1319. Of the participants, 591 (44.81%) were men, and 728 (55.19%) were women. Participants who received omega-3 were 700 (65.06%) compared to 376 (34.94%) who received a placebo, and their mean age was 45. Ingestion of omega-3 fatty acids increases learning, memory, cognitive well-being, and blood flow in the brain. Omega-3 treatments are advantageous, well-tolerated, and risk-free. Lonelier people, the elderly, and those who eat fewer healthy foods containing omega-3 may benefit from an omega-3 supplement. We suggest that natural omega-3 consumption through the diet should be promoted.
