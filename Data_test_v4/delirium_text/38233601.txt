38233601|a|The alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is a member of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor family and is composed of five alpha7 subunits arranged symmetrically around a central pore. It is localized in the central nervous system and immune cells and could be a target for treating Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Acetylcholine is a ligand that opens the channel, although prolonged application rapidly decreases the response. Ivermectin was reported as one of the positive allosteric modulators, since the binding of Ivermectin to the channel enhances acetylcholine-evoked alpha7 currents. One research has suggested that tilting motions of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor are responsible for channel opening and activation. To verify this hypothesis applies to alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, we utilized a diffracted X-ray tracking method to monitor the stable twisting and tilting motion of nAChR alpha7 without a ligand, with acetylcholine, with Ivermectin, and with both of them. The results show that the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor twists counterclockwise with the channel transiently opening, transitioning to a desensitized state in the presence of acetylcholine and clockwise without the channel opening in the presence of Ivermectin. We propose that the conformational transition of ACh-bound nAChR alpha7 may be due to the collective twisting of the five alpha7 subunits, resulting in the compression and movement, either downward or upward, of one or more subunits, thus manifesting tilting motions. These tilting motions possibly represent the transition from the resting state to channel opening and potentially to the desensitized state.
