33898131|a|Thyroid storm is an acute, life-threatening syndrome due to an exacerbation of thyrotoxicosis, which is when you have an excess of thyroid hormone in the body. Thyroid storm can be precipitated by infections, surgery, or untreated thyrotoxicosis. Multisystem involvement is often seen. Typical symptoms include fever and tachycardia, which are rather common, as well as more severe symptoms such as atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, hepatic failure, delirium and coma. The Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale is often used for the clinical diagnosis of thyroid storm. Prompt diagnosis and therapy are required to prevent complications and mortality in patients with thyroid storm. Here we present a case of thyroid storm in a patient that presented with psychosis and significant weight loss.
