36243287|a|Sepsis and systemic inflammation are often accompanied by severe encephalopathy, sleep disruption and delirium that strongly correlate with poor clinical outcomes including long-term cognitive deficits. The cardinal manifestations of delirium are fluctuating altered mental status and inattention, identified in critically ill patients by interactive bedside assessment. The lack of analogous assessments in mouse models or clear biomarkers is a challenge to preclinical studies of delirium. In this study, we utilized concurrent measures of telemetric EEG recordings and neurobehavioral tasks in mice to characterize inattention and persistent cognitive deficits following polymicrobial sepsis. During the 24-hour critical illness period for the mice, slow-wave EEG dominance, sleep disruption, and hypersensitivity to auditory stimuli in neurobehavioral tasks resembled clinical observations in delirious patients in which alterations in similar outcome measurements, although measured differently in mice and humans, are reported. Mice were tested for nest building ability 7 days after sepsis induction, when sickness behaviors and spontaneous activity had returned to baseline. Animals that showed persistent deficits determined by poor nest building at 7 days also exhibited molecular changes in hippocampal long-term potentiation compared to mice that returned to baseline cognitive performance. Together, these behavioral and electrophysiological biomarkers offer a robust mouse model with which to further probe molecular pathways underlying brain and behavioral changes during and after acute illness such as sepsis.
