39387518|t|Neuropsychiatric presentations of common dementia syndromes: A concise review for primary care team members.
39387518|a|Dementia is a syndrome characterized by cognitive changes which interfere with daily functioning. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are also pervasive and may even occur prior to any noticeable cognitive decline. Still, NPS are less associated with the early stages of the disease course, despite mounting research evidence that NPS present early and often in several dementia syndromes, even in the absence of cognitive decline (i.e., mild behavioral impairment [MBI]). Primary care teams are at the forefront of dementia care, yet they frequently report insufficient training in dementia diagnosis and management. This poses a serious problem considering that timely diagnosis of dementia is critical for optimal outcomes and maximum efficacy of intervention. We provide a concise narrative review of four dementia syndromes (Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia) and their associated neuropsychiatric presentations, as well as at-a-glance clinical guides, to help primary care team members recognize possible prodromal neurodegenerative disease and to prompt further workup. We also review next steps in the management of dementia and symptoms of MBI for primary care team members. As evidenced by the NPS profiles of these dementia syndromes, subacute new onset of psychiatric symptoms in an older adult should prompt consideration of an emerging dementia process and possible further workup of such, even in the absence of cognitive decline.
