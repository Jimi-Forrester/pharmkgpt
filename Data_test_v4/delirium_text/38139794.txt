38139794|t|Drug Discovery Based on Oxygen and Nitrogen (Non-)Heterocyclic Compounds Developed @LAQV-REQUIMTE/Aveiro.
38139794|a|Artur Silva's research group has a long history in the field of medicinal chemistry. The development of new synthetic methods for oxygen (mostly polyphenols, e.g., 2- and 3-styrylchromones, xanthones, flavones) and nitrogen (e.g., pyrazoles, triazoles, acridones, 4-quinolones) heterocyclic compounds in order to be assessed as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, and anticancer agents has been the main core work of our research interests. Additionally, the synthesis of steroid-type compounds as anti-Alzheimer drugs as well as of several chromophores as important dyes for cellular imaging broadened our research scope. In this review article, we intend to provide an enlightened appraisal of all the bioactive compounds and their biological properties that were synthesized and studied by our research group in the last two decades.
