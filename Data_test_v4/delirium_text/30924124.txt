30924124|a|After 15 years of research into Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics, including billions of US dollars provided by federal agencies, pharmaceutical companies, and private foundations, there are still no meaningful therapies that can delay the onset or slow the progression of AD. An understanding of the proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the hypothesis that pathogenic mechanisms in familial and sporadic forms of AD are very similar led to the assumption that pharmacological inhibition of secretases or immunological approaches to clear amyloid depositions in the brain would have been the core to drug discovery strategies and successful therapies. However, there are other understudied approaches including targeting genes, gene networks, and metabolic pathways outside the proteolytic processing of APP. The advancement of newly developed sequencing technologies and mass spectrometry, as well as the availability of animal models expressing human apolipoprotein E isoforms, has been critical in rationalizing additional AD therapeutics. The purpose of this review is to present one of those approaches, based on the role of ligand-activated nuclear liver X and retinoid X receptors in the brain. This therapeutic approach was initially proposed utilizing in vitro models 15 years ago and has since been examined in numerous studies using AD-like mouse models.
