39569220|t|Unscheduled Hospital Admission as a Prognostic Factor in the Oncologic Patient: A Retrospective Study.
39569220|a|Aims This research aimed to determine the correlation between survival, symptoms, and unscheduled admission in oncologic patients. Furthermore, this study aimed to develop a prognostic model that helps clinicians establish the indication of intervention by palliative care teams. Methodology A retrospective study of patients' digital clinical history registry was conducted to meet the two core objectives. The study population was patients with solid tumors undergoing unscheduled admissions to the oncology ward between January 1, 2018, and May 31, 2018. Demographic and clinical variables of those patients were analyzed. Specifically, the statistical analysis involved descriptive analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves, Log-Rank, and Chi-Squared Automatic Interaction Detection decision tree modeling. Results The results were obtained from 100 admissions of patients with an average age of 64. Of the patient cases examined, 67% (n = 67) were male. In 72% (n = 72) of the cases, patients presented with Stage IV tumors, and the most frequent primary tumor location among the admissions was lung, at 29% (n = 29). Intervention by the palliative care team occurred for 38% (n = 38) of patients. Mortality at 30, 90, 180, and 365 days was 34% (n = 34), 56% (n = 56), 71% (n = 71), and 78% (n = 78), respectively. Hepatic metastasis was the main predictor of mortality at 30 days (65%, n = 13) and at 90 days (90%, n = 18). In the absence of hepatic metastasis, the presence of more than one symptom predicted a mortality rate of 70% at 30 days. The main factor associated with mortality at 180 and 365 days was the tumor stage, with stage IV tumors having the highest mortality rate (84.7%, n = 61, and 90.3%, n = 65, respectively). Among the Stage IV population, the primary site shows a significant impact on survival, with colorectal/reproductive tumors being associated with decreased mortality. Conclusion Unscheduled admission is a negative prognostic factor in oncologic patients. An unscheduled admission can be expected to result in low survival in an oncologic patient, especially in those presenting with stage IV; involving non-colorectal/reproductive primaries; or presenting with pain, dyspnea, cachexia, or delirium.
