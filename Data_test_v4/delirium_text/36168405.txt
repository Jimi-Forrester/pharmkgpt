36168405|a|The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic toppled education delivery worldwide. Nursing education was no exception. The pandemic required nurse educators to quickly shift from face-to-face learning environments to remote and more virtual interactions. Educators were compelled to create and employ strategies to support nursing learners as they assimilated critical and complex knowledge, and skills from their homes, instead of classrooms and simulation laboratories. One modality of simulation which maintained engagement and connection with learners in the online environment was Mask-Ed  Simulation. This paper presents a snapshot of Mask-Ed  simulation activities across four higher education institutions globally during the COVID-19 pandemic.
