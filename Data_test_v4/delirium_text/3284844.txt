3284844|t|Sensory-perceptual alterations: delirium in the intensive care unit.
3284844|a|The delirium that is commonly associated with admission to an intensive care setting (intensive care unit [ICU] psychosis) may be terrifying to the patient, but may go undetected by the nurse. Our current understanding of this delirium is discussed according to incidence, defining characteristics, and etiologic or contributing factors such as predisposing patient factors, pharmacologic agents, and environmental factors. We examine several episodes of delirium that were recounted retrospectively by patients who were discharged from a surgical ICU. These episodes of delirium are examined with reference to sensory-perceptual, perceptual or sensory alterations. We discuss nursing interventions that help to prevent or lessen the impact of delirium before an ICU admission, during the ICU course, and after discharge from the ICU.
