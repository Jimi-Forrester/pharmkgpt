39190208|t|[Assessment of cognition: dementia and delirium : In consideration of the AWMF guidelines 038-013 and 084-002LG].
39190208|a|Cognitive disorders are multifaceted and the range of neuropsychological instruments is correspondingly extensive; however, most examiners have to limit themselves to a small selection in order to master them safely. In geriatric patients the various forms and stages of dementia dominate. Delirium must be distinguished from these as an acute life-threatening event. The personal and external medical history as well as clinical observation are the first steps in the assessment of cognition; the selection of test procedures is graduated and bears the patient's benefit in mind. When compiling a toolbox for use in one's own field of work, in addition to instruments focusing on different degrees of severity, alternatives should also be considered for use in the presence of comorbidities that reduce the validity (visual, hearing and fine motor disorders) and the examination situation should be taken into account.
