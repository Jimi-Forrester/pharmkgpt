23426888|t|Use of panitumumab in the treatment of acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas: A case report.
23426888|a|Two cases of stage IV acinar carcinoma of the pancreas are presented. The two patients were treated with several lines of chemotherapies active against colon cancer. At last-line, both patients received panitumumab monotherapy. We describe the tumour response to the different therapies. Our findings demonstrate that panitumumab produces objective responses when used as third-line treatment in the therapy of patients with acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas. Thus, we propose the consideration of the use of panitumumab in early lines of treatment.
