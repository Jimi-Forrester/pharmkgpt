29961900|t|Cancer; an induced disease of twentieth century! Induction of tolerance, increased entropy and 'Dark Energy': loss of biorhythms (Anabolism v. Catabolism).
29961900|a|Maintenance of health involves a synchronized network of catabolic and anabolic signals among organs/tissues/cells that requires differential bioenergetics from mitochondria and glycolysis (biological laws or biorhythms). We defined biological circadian rhythms as Yin (tumoricidal) and Yang (tumorigenic) arms of acute inflammation (effective immunity) involving immune and non-immune systems. Role of pathogens in altering immunity and inducing diseases and cancer has been documented for over a century. However, in 1955s decision makers in cancer/medical establishment allowed public (current baby boomers) to consume million doses of virus-contaminated polio vaccines. The risk of cancer incidence and mortality sharply rose from 5% (rate of hereditary/genetic or innate disease) in 1900s, to its current scary status of 33% or 50% among women and men, respectively. Despite better hygiene, modern detection technologies and discovery of antibiotics, baby boomers and subsequent 2-3 generations are sicker than previous generations at same age. American health status ranks last among other developed nations while America invests highest amount of resources for healthcare. In this perspective we present evidence that cancer is an induced disease of twentieth century, facilitated by a great deception of cancer/medical establishment for huge corporate profits. Unlike popularized opinions that cancer is 100, 200 or 1000 diseases, we demonstrate that cancer is only one disease; the severe disturbances in biorhythms (differential bioenergetics) or loss of balance in Yin and Yang of effective immunity. Cancer projects that are promoted and funded by decision makers are reductionist approaches, wrong and unethical and resulted in loss of millions of precious lives and financial toxicity to society. Public vaccination with pathogen-specific vaccines (e.g., flu, hepatitis, HPV, meningitis, measles) weakens, not promotes, immunity. Results of irresponsible projects on cancer sciences or vaccines are increased population of drug-dependent sick society. Outcome failure rates of claimed 'targeted' drugs, 'precision' or 'personalized' medicine are 90% (+- 5) for solid tumors. We demonstrate that aging, frequent exposures to environmental hazards, infections and pathogen-specific vaccines and ingredients are 'antigen overload' for immune system, skewing the Yin and Yang response profiles and leading to induction of 'mild', 'moderate' or 'severe' immune disorders. Induction of decoy or pattern recognition receptors (e.g., PRRs), such as IRAK-M or IL-1dRs ('designer' molecules) and associated genomic instability and over-expression of growth promoting factors (e.g., pyruvate kinases, mTOR and PI3Ks, histamine, PGE2, VEGF) could lead to immune tolerance, facilitating cancer cells to hijack anabolic machinery of immunity (Yang) for their increased growth requirements. Expression of constituent embryonic factors would negatively regulate differentiation of tumor cells through epithelial-mesenchymal-transition and create "dual negative feedback loop" that influence tissue metabolism under hypoxic conditions. It is further hypothesized that induction of tolerance creates 'dark energy' and increased entropy and temperature in cancer microenvironment allowing disorderly cancer proliferation and mitosis along with increased glucose metabolism via Crabtree and Pasteur Effects, under mitophagy and ribophagy, conditions that are toxic to host survival. Effective translational medicine into treatment requires systematic and logical studies of complex interactions of tumor cells with host environment that dictate clinical outcomes. Promoting effective immunity (biological circadian rhythms) are fundamental steps in correcting host differential bioenergetics and controlling cancer growth, preventing or delaying onset of diseases and maintaining public health. The author urges independent professionals and policy makers to take a closer look at cancer dilemma and stop the 'scientific/medical ponzi schemes' of a powerful group that control a drug-dependent sick society before all hopes for promoting public health evaporate.
