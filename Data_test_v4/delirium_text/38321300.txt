38321300|a|Food aspiration is one of the major health risks for elderly people in nursing homes which could lead to death. Moreover, misconducts in pharmacotherapy may represent a potential risk of adverse drug reactions. It is reported here the toxicological evaluation of a combined death by food aspiration and acute escitalopram intoxication of a psychiatric subject, occurred in a nursing home. An 89-year-old man, suffering from dysphagia and Alzheimer's, was resident in a nursing home. He was fed with a liquid diet administered directly in mouth using a syringe. The man was also being treated with escitalopram 10 mg tablet. One evening, after receiving the meal in the usual way, the man complained of sudden illness. Carried to the emergency room, the man died about 3 h later with a diagnosis of cardiogenic shock subsequentially to ab ingestis. The histological findings revealed the presence of exogenous material, probably food, up to the finest bronchial branches. The toxicological examination revealed the presence of escitalopram and its main metabolite, desmethylcitalopram: in the blood 1972 ng/ml and 285 ng/ml, in the brain 4657 ng/g and 1025 ng/g, in the gastric content 2317 ng/g and 423 ng/g, in the lung 21,771 ng/g and 468 ng/g, respectively. The bad practice of the nurses to dissolve the escitalopram tablet in the liquefied food and to administer the therapy with a syringe directly into the mouth emerged thanks this investigation. Following food aspiration, escitalopram was absorbed by inhalation route, reaching high concentrations in blood and tissues. The death occurred due to a combined mechanism between food aspiration and the escitalopram toxic action.
