39090675|t|Periareolar minimally invasive approach for cardiac surgery: a case series and description of technique with a review of literature.
39090675|a|BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) has garnered significant attention for its potential benefits, including decreased surgical trauma, accelerated recovery, and improved aesthetic outcomes. This case series aims to elucidate the technical aspects and assess the aesthetic, functional, and quality of life outcomes associated with the utilization of a periareolar incision approach in female patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: The periareolar MICS technique, performed with or without high-definition (HD) 3D endoscopic visualization, limited rib-spreading, and a periareolar incision spanning the 3 to 9 o'clock positions, was employed. We present a case series encompassing five female patients who underwent various cardiac procedures for different pathologies using this approach. RESULTS: No intraoperative complications occurred, and all patients experienced uneventful postoperative recoveries. The periareolar approach resulted in well-healed incisions with minimal scaring, preserving breast contour and yielding satisfactory cosmetic outcomes. Patients reported negligible pain levels and expressed contentment with the scar appearance. CONCLUSION: The periareolar incision technique in MICS represents an efficacious approach characterized by favorable aesthetic outcomes and enhanced patient experience. Further investigations are warranted to compare different MICS approaches with respect to pain management and their impact on quality-of-life domains.
