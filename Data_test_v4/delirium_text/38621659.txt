38621659|a|The study aims to identify psychological symptoms (depression and anxiety) and their relationship to the quality of life among dementia patients' caregivers, and whether there are differences in the level of each of them due to the gender variable. The study follows the correlational approach, with a sample of 174 dementia patients' caregivers. To pursue the analysis, the study uses 3 measurement tools: anxiety, depression, and quality of life. The results show that the level of depression, anxiety, and quality of life among dementia patients' caregivers is moderate. It also finds that there is a positive relationship between anxiety and depression, and there is a negative relationship between quality of life and anxiety and depression. There are no differences in the level of depression and anxiety due to gender, as the study finds female caregivers to have a higher level of quality of life.
