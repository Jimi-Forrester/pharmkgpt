24639916|a|Recent developments in brain imaging methods are on the verge of changing the evaluation of people with Parkinson's disease (PD). This includes an assortment of techniques ranging from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to iron-sensitive methods such as T2*, as well as adiabatic methods R1rho and R2rho, resting-state functional MRI, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Using a multi-modality approach that ascertains different aspects of the pathophysiology or pathology of PD, it may be possible to better characterize disease phenotypes as well as provide a surrogate of disease and a potential means to track disease progression.
