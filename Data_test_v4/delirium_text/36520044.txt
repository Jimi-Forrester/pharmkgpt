36520044|t|Boosting of tau protein aggregation by CD40 and CD48 gene expression in Alzheimer's disease.
36520044|a|Neurodegenerative diseases result from the interplay of abnormal gene expression and various pathological factors. Therefore, a disease-specific integrative genetic approach is required to understand the complexities and causes of target diseases. Recent studies have identified the correlation between genes encoding several transmembrane proteins, such as the cluster of differentiation (CD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. In this study, CD48 and CD40 gene expression in AD, a neurodegenerative disease, was analyzed to infer this link. Total RNA sequencing was performed using an Alzheimer's disease mouse model brain and blood, and gene expression was determined using a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We observed a marked elevation of CD48 and CD40 genes in Alzheimer's disease. Indeed, the upregulation of both CD48 and CD40 genes was significantly increased in the severe Alzheimer's disease group. With the elevation of CD48 and CD40 genes in Alzheimer's disease, associations of protein levels were also markedly increased in tissues. In addition, overexpression of CD48 and CD40 genes triggered tau aggregation, and co-expression of these genes accelerated aggregation. The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) signaling pathway was enriched by CD48 and CD40 gene expression: it was also associated with tau pathology. Our data suggested that the CD48 and CD40 genes are novel AD-related genes, and this approach may be useful as a diagnostic or therapeutic target for the disease.
