38539638|t|Association of the Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio with 90-Day Functional Outcomes in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke.
38539638|a|The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), an inflammatory marker, plays an important role in the inflammatory mechanisms of the pathophysiology and progression of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The aim of this study was to identify the potential factors associated with functional prognosis in AIS. A total of 303 AIS patients were enrolled in this study; baseline information of each participant, including demographic characteristics, medical history, laboratory data, and 90-day functional outcome, was collected. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that NLR, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score were found to be independent factors for poor functional outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to estimate the predictive value of the NLR for 90-day functional outcome, with the best predictive cutoff value being 3.06. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, three models were constructed: Model 1, adjusted for age, sex, SBP, and TOAST classification (AUC = 0.694); Model 2, further adjusted for the NIHSS score at admission (AUC = 0.826); and Model 3, additionally adjusted for the NLR (AUC = 0.829). The NLR at admission was an independent predictor of 90-day prognosis in patients with AIS. The risk factors related to poor 90-day functional outcomes were higher SBP, higher NLR, and a greater NIHSS score.
