32665038|t|Identification of potential crucial genes and key pathways in osteosarcoma.
32665038|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to identify the potential pathogenic and metastasis-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in osteosarcoma through bioinformatic analysis of Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. RESULTS: Gene expression profiles of GSE14359, GSE16088, and GSE33383, in total 112 osteosarcoma tissue samples and 7 osteoblasts, were analyzed. Seventy-four normal-primary DEGs (NPDEGs) and 764 primary-metastatic DEGs (PMDEGs) were screened. VAMP8, A2M, HLA-DRA, SPARCL1, HLA-DQA1, APOC1 and AQP1 were identified continuously upregulating during the oncogenesis and metastasis of osteosarcoma. The enriched functions and pathways of NPDEGs include procession and presentation of antigens, activation of MHC class II receptors and phagocytosis. The enriched functions and pathways of PMDEGs include mitotic nuclear division, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and focal adhesion. With protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyzed by Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) plug-in of Cytoscape software, one hub NPDEG (HLA-DRA) and 7 hub PMDEGs (CDK1, CDK20, CCNB1, MTIF2, MRPS7, VEGFA and EGF) were eventually selected, and the most significant pathways in NPDEGs module and PMDEGs module were enriched in the procession and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class II and the nuclear division, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: By integrated bioinformatic analysis, numerous DEGs related to osteosarcoma were screened, and the hub DEGs identified in this study are possibly part of the potential biomarkers for osteosarcoma. However, further experimental studies are still necessary to elucidate the biological function and mechanism of these genes.
