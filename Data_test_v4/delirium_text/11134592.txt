11134592|a|C-reactive protein (CRP) and amyloid P (AP) are pentraxins which are associated with many pathological lesions, including the amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of Alzheimer disease (AD). It has always been assumed that they are generated by liver and delivered to their sites of action by serum. Here we report by in situ hydridization, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry that the mRNAs and proteins of both CRP and AP are concentrated in pyramidal neurons and are upregulated in affected areas of AD brain. Controlling pentraxin production at the tissue level may be important in reducing inflammatory damage in AD.
