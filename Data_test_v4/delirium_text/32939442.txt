32939442|a|Focal intraretinal alterations have been studied to advance our understanding of the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. The current literature involving focal alterations in the intraretinal layers was reviewed through PubMed using the search terms "focal alteration", "region of interest", "optical coherence tomography", "glaucoma", "multiple sclerosis", "Alzheimer's disease", "Parkinson disease", "neurodegenerative diseases" and other related items. It was found that focal alterations of intraretinal layers were different in various neurodegenerative diseases. The typical focal thinning might help differentiate various ocular and cerebral diseases, track disease progression, and evaluate the outcome of clinical trials. Advanced exploration of focal intraretinal alterations will help to further validate their clinical and research utility.
