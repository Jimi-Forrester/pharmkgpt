35207630|t|A Non-Linear Relationship between Preoperative Total Bilirubin Level and Postoperative Delirium Incidence after Liver Transplantation.
35207630|a|This study aimed to explore the correlation between preoperative total bilirubin (TBil) level and postoperative delirium (POD) in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). All the OLT consecutively performed between April 2019 and March 2021 were retrospectively reviewed with data retrieved from a prospectively collected database. Logistic regression model and generalized additive model were used to identify both linear and non-linear relationships between TBil and POD. A two-piecewise regression model was performed to calculate the saturation effect. Subgroup analyses were performed using stratified logistic regression models. A total of 402 recipients were enrolled. After fully adjusted for covariates, TBil was indicated to have a non-linear relationship with POD. The two-piecewise regression model showed the inflection point was 20 mg/dL. On the left side of the inflection point, the incidence of POD increased by 5% per 1 mg/dL increment of TBil (p = 0.026). On the right side of the inflection point, the effect size had no statistical significance (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.90-1.05; p = 0.482). The relationship between preoperative TBil level and POD incidence is non-linear in OLT recipients. The incidence of POD is positively correlated with TBil level when it is below 20 mg/dL. A saturation effect is observed when TBil level reaches 20 mg/dL.
