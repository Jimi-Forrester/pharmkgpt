23907250|a|Pathological amino-acid substitutions in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and chemical gamma-secretase modulators affect the processing of APP by the gamma-secretase complex and the production of the amyloid-beta peptide Abeta42, the accumulation of which is considered causative of Alzheimer's disease. Here we demonstrate that mutations in the transmembrane domain of APP causing aggressive early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease affect both gamma- and epsilon-cleavage sites, by raising the Abeta42/40 ratio and inhibiting the production of AICD50-99, one of the two physiological APP intracellular domains (ICDs). This is in sharp contrast to gamma-secretase modulators, which shift Abeta42 production towards the shorter Abeta38, but unequivocally spare the epsilon-site and APP- and Notch-ICDs production. Molecular simulations suggest that familial Alzheimer's disease mutations modulate the flexibility of the APP transmembrane domain and the presentation of its gamma-site, modifying at the same time, the solvation of the epsilon-site.
