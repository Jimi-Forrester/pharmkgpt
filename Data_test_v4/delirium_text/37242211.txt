37242211|a|(1) Background: Mediterranean ketogenic nutrition (MKN) may directly target multiple neurobiological mechanisms associated with dementia risk in older adults. Despite its promise, this type of nutrition can be challenging to learn and adhere to in a healthy manner. Our team used the National Institutes of Health Obesity Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (NIH ORBIT) model to develop and pilot a program to help older adults with memory concerns use MKN. (2) Methods: Using a two-arm, randomized design, we evaluated an MKN Adherence (MKNA) program compared to an MKN education (MKNE) program (N = 58). The primary difference between study arms involved the use of motivational interviewing (MI) strategies and behavior change techniques (BCT) only in the MKNA arm. Participants were included if they evidenced subjective memory concerns or objective memory impairment on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Score 19 <= 26). Primary outcomes examined included feasibility, acceptability, adherence, and clinical outcomes associated with the program. (3) Results: Overall, there was relatively high program completion in both groups, with 79% of participants completing the 6-week program. The recruitment protocol required adjustment but was successful in reaching the target sample size. Retention (82%) and session attendance (91%) were higher in the MKNA arm compared to the MKNE (retention = 72%; attendance = 77%). Overall, most participants in both groups rated the program as "excellent" using the client satisfaction questionnaire. Participants in the MKNA arm evidenced higher objective and self-reported adherence to MKN during the 6-week program. Further, there was some evidence of clinical benefits of the program, although these effects diminished as adherence decreased in the 3 months follow-up. (4) Discussion: This pilot trial demonstrated that the MKN program incorporating MI and BCT strategies may better engage and retain participants than a nutrition education program alone, although participants in both groups reported high satisfaction.
