30186406|t|Downregulation of microRNA-1 attenuates glucose-induced apoptosis by regulating the liver X receptor alpha in cardiomyocytes.
30186406|a|Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by abnormal myocardial structure or performance. It has been suggested that microRNA-1 (miR-1) may be abnormally expressed in the hearts of patients with diabetes. In the present study, the role of miR-1 in glucose-induced apoptosis and its underlying mechanism of action was investigated in rat cardiomyocyte H9C2 cells. Cells were transfected with anti-miR-1 or miR-1-overexpression plasmids and the expression of miR-1 and liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. The proportion of apoptotic cells was determined using an Annexin-V-FITC apoptosis detection kit and the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi) was measured following staining with rhodamine 123. In addition, the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins was measured by western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that expression of miR-1 was significantly increased, whereas the expression of LXRalpha was significantly decreased in H9C2 cells following treatment with glucose. miR-1 knockdown significantly inhibited apoptosis, increased the DeltaPsi and suppressed the cleavage of poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase, caspase-3 and caspase-9. It also significantly downregulated the expression of Bcl-2 and upregulated the expression of Bax. In addition, it was demonstrated that miR-1 regulates LXRalpha; transfection with anti-miR-1 significantly increased the expression of LXRalpha. Furthermore, treatment of cells with the LXR agonist GW3965 inhibited apoptosis in glucose-induced anti-miR-1 cells. These results suggest a novel function of miR-1: The regulation of cardiomyocyte apoptosis via LXRalpha, and provide novel insights into regarding the complex mechanisms involved in DCM.
