35580144|a|Today, growing evidence indicates that patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Indeed, AD as one of the main causes of dementia in people aged more than 65 years can be aggravated by insulin resistance (IR) and other metabolic risk factors related to T2D which are also linked to the function of the brain. Remarkably, a new term called "type 3 diabetes" has been suggested for those people who are diagnosed with AD while also showing the symptoms of IR and T2D. In this regard, the role of genetic and epigenetic changes associated with AD has been confirmed by many studies. On the other hand, it should be noted that the insulin signaling pathway is highly regulated by various mechanisms, including epigenetic factors. Among these, the role of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs has been comprehensively studied with respect to the pathology of AD and the most well-known underlying mechanisms. Nevertheless, the number of studies exploring the association between ncRNAs and the downstream targets of the insulin signaling pathway in the development of AD has notably increased in recent years. With this in view, the present study aimed to review the interplay between different ncRNAs and the insulin signaling pathway targets in the pathogenesis of AD to find a new approach in the field of combining biomarkers or therapeutic targets for this disease.
