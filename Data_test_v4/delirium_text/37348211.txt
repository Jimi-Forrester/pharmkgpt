37348211|a|BACKGROUND: Post intensive care syndrome is defined as the presence of any impairment affecting the physical, psychiatric, or cognitive domains as a result of critical illnesses. OBJECTIVES: To explore functional, cognitive and psychological outcomes at 30 days post hospital discharge among survivors of COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome, who required mechanical ventilation. METHODS: Prospective cohort study. We included adult patients with COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome, invasively ventilated in two ICUs in Buenos Aires. We measured functional, cognitive and psychological impairments with Barthel index, Montreal Cognitive Assessment test, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and General Anxiety Disorder-7. Primary outcome was post-intensive care syndrome. Secondary outcome was mortality at 60 days. RESULTS: We admitted 40 patients, median age was 69 (60-75) and mostly male (75%). Mortality at 60 days was 37%. Cox regression analysis identified diabetes and Apache II as independent predictors of mortality. Out of 22 patients studied, 14 (64%) developed PICS after discharge. With a physical, cognitive and psychological impairment in 64%, 41% and 32% of patients, respectively. Obesity, days of mechanical ventilation, Apache II, vasopressors use, delirium duration and cumulative midazolam dose were associated with functional dependence. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a high prevalence of functional, cognitive and mental impairment at 30 days after hospital discharge in COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome survivors, invasively ventilated. The physical domain was the most frequently affected. These findings suggest the need for long-term follow-up of this population.
