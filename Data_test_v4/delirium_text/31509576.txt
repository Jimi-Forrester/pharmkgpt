31509576|a|Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), which is secreted by prostate, increases in some diseases such as prostate cancer. PAP is also present in the central nervous system. In this study we reveal that alpha-synuclein (Snca) gene is co-deleted/mutated in PAP null mouse. It is indicated that mice deficient in transmembrane PAP display neurological alterations. By using immunohistochemistry, cerebellar cortical neurons and zone and stripes pattern were studied in Pap-/- ;Snca-/- mouse cerebellum. We show that the Pap-/- ;Snca-/- cerebellar cortex development appears to be normal. Compartmentation genes expression such as zebrin II, HSP25, and P75NTR show the zone and stripe phenotype characteristic of the normal cerebellum. These data indicate that although aggregation of PAP and SNCA causes severe neurodegenerative diseases, PAP -/- with absence of the Snca does not appear to interrupt the cerebellar architecture development and zone and stripe pattern formation. These findings question the physiological and pathological role of SNCA and PAP during cerebellar development or suggest existence of the possible compensatory mechanisms in the absence of these genes.
