37434948|t|Case report: Chorea and cognitive decline in a young woman: instrumental and genetic assessment of a case originally diagnosed as multiple sclerosis.
37434948|a|We describe the case of a young woman affected by debilitating chorea and rapidly progressive cognitive decline. While her original diagnosis was multiple sclerosis, we performed a full instrumental and genetic assessement, though which we identified multiple genetic variants, including a novel variant of the APP gene. We propose some possible mechanisms by which such variants may contribute to neuroinflammation and ultimately lead to this devastating clinical course.
