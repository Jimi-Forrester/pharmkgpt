36117745|t|Geriatric Syndromes in Older Adults Hospitalized with COVID-19 in Montreal, Canada.
36117745|a|Background: Older adults are more vulnerable to severe infection and mortality due to COVID-19. They have atypical presentations of the disease without respiratory symptoms, making early diagnosis clinically challenging. We aimed to compare the baseline characteristics, presentation, and disease course of older (>=70 yrs & >=90 yrs) and younger (<70 yrs) patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods: Retrospective review of 429 consecutive patients hospitalized at two tertiary care hospitals in Montreal, Canada, with PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Baseline characteristics, presentation, in-hospital complications, and outcomes were recorded. Desegregation by age was performed to compare older versus younger individuals. Additional subgroup analyses were performed amongst patients >=70 stratifying by sex, living situation, and those presenting with geriatric syndromes compared to those without. Results: Patients >=70 (n=260) presented less frequently with respiratory symptoms compared to patients <70 (n=169) (52% vs. 32%). 11% of patients >=70 and 24% of patients >=90 presented with a geriatric syndrome as their sole symptom compared to 3% of those <70. Older adults were more likely to develop disease complications (including delirium, acute kidney injury, and hypernatremia) and had higher in-hospital mortality (32% vs. 13%). Subgroup analyses revealed heightened vulnerability to complications in older men, those from long-term care, and those with at least one geriatric syndrome upon presentation. Conclusions: Older adults presenting to hospital with COVID-19 often have no respiratory symptoms and can present with only a geriatric syndrome. New geriatric syndromes in older individuals should trigger evaluation for COVID-19 and consideration for early initiation of multidisciplinary care to prevent complications.
