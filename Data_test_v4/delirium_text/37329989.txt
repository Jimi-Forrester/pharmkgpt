37329989|a|MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of small non-coding RNA, roughly 21 - 22 nucleotides in length, which are master gene regulators. These miRNAs bind to the mRNA's 3' - untranslated region and regulate post-transcriptional gene regulation, thereby influencing various physiological and cellular processes. Another class of miRNAs known as mitochondrial miRNA (MitomiRs) has been found to either originate from the mitochondrial genome or be translocated directly into the mitochondria. Although the role of nuclear DNA encoded miRNA in the progression of various neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, etc. is well known, accumulating evidence suggests the possible role of deregulated mitomiRs in the progression of various neurodegenerative diseases with unknown mechanism. We have attempted to outline the current state of mitomiRs role in controlling mitochondrial gene expression and function through this review, paying particular attention to their contribution to neurological processes, their etiology, and their potential therapeutic use.
