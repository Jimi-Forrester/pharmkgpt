39459209|a|This review explores the potential health benefits and applications of phenolic secoiridoids derived from olive oil by-products in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As reviewed herein, polyphenols, such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate, epicatechin, and resveratrol, show in vitro and in vivo antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, and are particularly relevant in the context of AD, a leading cause of dementia globally. The olive oil industry, particularly in the Mediterranean region, produces significant amounts of waste, including leaves, pomace, and wastewater, which pose environmental challenges but also offer an untapped source of bioactive compounds. Despite promising in vitro and in vivo studies indicating that olive-derived polyphenols, such as oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol, may mitigate AD pathology, human clinical trials remain limited. The variability in extraction methods and the complex nature of AD further complicate research. Future studies should focus on standardizing the protocols and conducting robust clinical trials to fully assess the therapeutic potential of these compounds. This approach not only supports the development of new treatments for AD but also promotes environmental sustainability by valorizing olive oil industry waste.
