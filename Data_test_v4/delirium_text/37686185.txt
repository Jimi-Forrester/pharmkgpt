37686185|t|Advances in Research on Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Targets and Therapeutic Agents.
37686185|a|Diabetes mellitus is a chronic multifaceted disease with multiple potential complications, the treatment of which can only delay and prolong the terminal stage of the disease, i.e., type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The World Health Organization predicts that diabetes will be the seventh leading cause of death by 2030. Although many antidiabetic medicines have been successfully developed in recent years, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors, single-target drugs are gradually failing to meet the therapeutic requirements owing to the individual variability, diversity of pathogenesis, and organismal resistance. Therefore, there remains a need to investigate the pathogenesis of T2DM in more depth, identify multiple therapeutic targets, and provide improved glycemic control solutions. This review presents an overview of the mechanisms of action and the development of the latest therapeutic agents targeting T2DM in recent years. It also discusses emerging target-based therapies and new potential therapeutic targets that have emerged within the last three years. The aim of our review is to provide a theoretical basis for further advancement in targeted therapies for T2DM.
