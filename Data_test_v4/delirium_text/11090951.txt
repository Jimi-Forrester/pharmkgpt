11090951|a|Spontaneous, so-called 'conformational' diseases, specially of the neurodegenerative type like Alzheimer's, are linked to certain protein types which have the normal amino-acid sequence but are misfolded and accumulate due to resistance to proteolysis. In the case of prion diseases, the 'protein only' hypothesis assumes that the misconformation of a native protein could be initiated upon interaction with a sister-protein already in the misfolded state. There is an alternative to this sister protein contamination scheme, which assumes that the misconformation is acquired upon protein synthesis, that is de novo. Misfoldling and resistance to proteolysis could result from defects responsible for shortage or inactivity of the cellular factors in charge of protein folding and degradation. The defects could have a genetic origin (the gene of the faulty factor involved could have been mutated, or control and regulation of its expression could have been altered, etc.). Alternatively, the cell's actual biosynthetic and/or proteolytic resources could have become overloaded and unavailable, due to unscheduled mass-production of proteins resulting from unscheduled cell growth or proliferation, cell stress, etc. Xenobiotics, active for instance as endocrine proliferators, stressors, or inducing copious, unscheduled gene expression, etc. could give rise to shortage of cellular factors necessary for the production of native proteins and for proteolysis. Alternatively, xenobiotics could alter expression or activity of some of these factors. In both cases, the xenobiotic could be a 'conformational toxicant' by inducing misfolding of selected proteins. The xenobiotic could trigger some conformational disease if it targets a specific protein and tissue.
