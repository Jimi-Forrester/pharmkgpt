30341248|a|In consideration of its noninvasive administration and endogenous stimulation property, the enhancement of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) via low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) could be a novel strategy for aluminum (Al) overload-induced cerebral damage. LIPUS was pre-treated 7 days before concomitantly given with aluminum chloride (AlCl3) daily for a period of 42 days. Morris water maze and elevated plus maze were performed to analyze spatial learning and memory. Western Blot and immunoprecipitation were used to detect BDNF and histone acetylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) and histone H4 lysine 12 (H4K12) in the hippocampus. Assay of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) indicated the extent of oxidative damages. Aluminium exposure in rats can cause attenuated spatial learning and memory, followed by up-regulated histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) expression, down-regulated H3K9 and H4K12 acetylation at the PIII and PIV promoter of BDNF, all of which will eventually inhibit BDNF expression. LIPUS can recover reduced cognitive function by restoring histone acetylation and BDNF expression, accompanied with increased SOD, GSH, and GSH-Px activity. LIPUS treatment might alleviate aluminium exposure-induced cognitive decline by acetylation regulation of BDNF expression and reducing oxidative stress in the hippocampus.
