30948695|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium, which is one of the most disturbing postoperative complications in elderly patients, shows high morbidity in patients undergoing lung cancer surgery. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is considered a potential prophylactic agent for preventing patients' delirium after lung cancer surgery. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Medical records of lung cancer patients over 65 years old with radical pulmonary resection at Henan Provincial People's Hospital from January 2015 to December 2017, China, were evaluated. Patients, care-providers, and investigators were all blinded to group assignment. DEX was administered in the preoperative and intraoperative periods. The incidence of delirium was calculated based on the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). Scores of >=4 and 1-3 points represent the diagnoses of delirium and a pre-delirious state, respectively. RESULTS: During postoperative day 1 (POD 1) to POD 7, delirium occurs in both groups. During postoperative POD 1 to POD 7, the incidence of delirium is lower in the DEX group than that in the control group. Furthermore, there are more mild delirium patients but fewer moderate and severe delirium patients in the DEX group compared with the control group. Finally, patients in the DEX group have a shorter duration of delirium, lower numeric pain rating scale during movement and better sleep quality. CONCLUSION: Preoperative and intraoperative application of DEX can reduce the incidence and intensity of delirium after pulmonary resection in elderly patients with lung cancer.
