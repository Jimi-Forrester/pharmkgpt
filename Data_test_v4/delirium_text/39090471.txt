39090471|a|In an experimental model of Alzheimer's disease in mice, oral administration of trehalose disaccharide reduces neuroinflammation assessed by the expression level of microglia activation marker Iba1 and affects the neutrophil degranulation activity. A potential anti-inflammatory effect of 4% trehalose solution associated with a decrease in the activity of leukocyte elastase in plasma was revealed.
