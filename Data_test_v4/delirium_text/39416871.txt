39416871|t|Association between neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and short-term all-cause mortality in patients with cerebrovascular disease admitted to the intensive care unit-a study based on the MIMIC-IV database.
39416871|a|Background: Inflammation plays a crucial role in cerebrovascular disease (CVD) progression. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an important inflammatory marker, though its diagnostic role in CVD is still under investigation. This study evaluates the relationship between NLR and short-term all-cause mortality in patients with CVD admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: We conducted a retrospective study using data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) (v2.2) database, including 4,327 adult ICU-admitted CVD patients. NLR values at admission were analyzed alongside various mortality variables. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves assessed the relationship between NLR and short-term all-cause mortality. Predictive power, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of NLR for short-term mortality were investigated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Additionally, restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves and subgroup analyses were conducted. Results: Among the 4,327 patients, 3,600 survived (survival group) and 727 died (non-survival group) within 28 days of admission (mortality rate: 16.8%). A multivariate Cox regression analysis identified NLR as an independent predictor of 28-day all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 1.013; 95% confidence interval: 1.0086-1.0188; p < 0.001). The predictive model, incorporating NLR, age, gender, BMI, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), WBC counts, Platelet, INR, and CRP, achieved an AUC of 0.686 (95% confidence interval: 0.665-0.70). While platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio was also analyzed, its predictive efficiency was less pronounced compared to NLR. A best NLR threshold of 6.19 was determined, distinguishing survivors from non-survivors. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that patients with NLR >= 6.19 had significantly lower survival rates at 7-, 14-, 21-, and 28-days. Subgroup analyses indicated that NLR did not significantly interact with most subgroups. Conclusion: NLR may serve as an independent predictor for short-term all-cause mortality in ICU-admitted CVD patients, enhancing our understanding of the association between inflammatory biomarkers and CVD prognosis.
