38233921|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia is a global public health priority. The World Health Organization adopted a Global Action Plan on Dementia, with dementia awareness a priority. This study examined the knowledge, attitudes, and self-confidence with skills required for providing dementia care among primary health care providers in Vietnam. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 405 primary health care providers who worked at commune health stations and district health centers in eight provinces across Vietnam. RESULTS: The results showed that primary health care providers had poor knowledge and little confidence but more positive attitudes toward dementia care and management. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest the training needs for building capacity amongst primary health care providers, which will be critical as Vietnam's population ages.
