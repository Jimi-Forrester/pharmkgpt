39045667|t|The ageing central nervous system in multiple sclerosis: the imaging perspective.
39045667|a|The interaction between ageing and multiple sclerosis is complex and carries significant implications for patient care. Managing multiple sclerosis effectively requires an understanding of how ageing and multiple sclerosis impact brain structure and function. Ageing inherently induces brain changes, including reduced plasticity, diminished grey matter volume, and ischaemic lesion accumulation. When combined with multiple sclerosis pathology, these age-related alterations may worsen clinical disability. Ageing may also influence the response of multiple sclerosis patients to therapies and/or their side-effects, highlighting the importance of adjusted treatment considerations. Magnetic resonance MRI is highly sensitive to age- and multiple sclerosis-related processes. Accordingly, MRI can provide insights into the relationship between ageing and multiple sclerosis, enabling a better understanding of their pathophysiological interplay and informing treatment selection. This review summarizes current knowledge on the immuno-pathological and MRI aspects of ageing in the central nervous system in the context of multiple sclerosis. Starting from immunosenescence, ageing-related pathological mechanisms, and specific features like enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces, this review then explores clinical aspects, including late-onset multiple sclerosis, the influence of age on diagnostic criteria, and comorbidity effects on imaging features. The role of MRI in understanding neurodegeneration, iron dynamics, and myelin changes influenced by ageing and how MRI can contribute to defining treatment effects in ageing multiple sclerosis patients, are also discussed.
