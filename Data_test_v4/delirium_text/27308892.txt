The aim of the current study was to assess the influence of aqueous extract of cinnamon (CE) on the monosodium glutamate-induced non-transgenic rat model of AD (NTAD) established with insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia, neuronal loss, and cognitive impairment at a very early stage of life. METHODS: The experimental design included oral administration of CE (50 mg/kg body weight) for 20 weeks to 2-month and 10-month-old NTAD rats. Following the treatments, the animals attained 7 and 15 months of age, respectively. They were then subjected to behavioural testing, biochemical analysis, and stereology experiments. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that CE treatment improved the insulin sensitivity, increased phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (pGSK3beta), inhibited the cholinesterase activity, and improved the learning ability in NTAD rats. Histological evaluation has shown an increase in neuron count in the DG sub-field of hippocampus upon treatment with CE. DISCUSSION: These beneficial effects of CE are suggestive of considering cinnamon as a dietary supplement in modulating the metabolic changes and cognitive functions.
