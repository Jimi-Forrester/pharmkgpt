33063894|a|A scabies burrow is created by a mature female mite laying eggs through the stratum corneum, representing a kind of scabies eruption. We have noticed that the edges of the scabies burrow sometime appear as blackish-gray lines. We named these lines the "gray-edged line" sign, as a new feature of scabies burrows. The gray-edged line sign has the following two tendencies: (i) it is rarely seen on the palm or sole; and (ii) when the burrow follows a curved course, the gray-edged line often forms on the outer wall. Explaining the formation of this sign from clinical findings was difficult, so the aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the gray-edged line sign. This retrospective study involved collection of data from electronic medical records of patients treated for scabies in our department between April 2015 and February 2020. We treated 32 scabies patients, including 4 patients with the gray-edged line sign. We analyzed clinical features, dermoscopy, histopathology and special stains. Fontana-Masson staining showed melanin staining in three parts: feces; some keratinocytes around the scabies burrows; and the mouth and legs of the scabies mite. The gray-edged line sign appears to represent mite feces containing melanin.
