37992797|a|In the early stages of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD), there is a strong correlation between memory impairment and cortical levels of soluble amyloid-beta peptide oligomers (Abeta). It has become clear that Abeta disrupt glutamatergic synaptic function, which can in turn lead to the characteristic cognitive deficits of SAD, but the actual pathways are still not well understood. This opinion article describes the pathogenic mechanisms underlying cerebral amyloidosis. These mechanisms are dependent on the amyloid precursor protein and concern the synthesis of Abeta peptides with competition between the non-amyloidogenic pathway and the amyloidogenic pathway (i.e. a competition between the ADAM10 and BACE1 enzymes), on the one hand, and the various processes of Abeta residue clearance, on the other hand. This clearance mobilizes both endopeptidases (NEP, and IDE) and removal transporters across the blood-brain barrier (LRP1, ABCB1, and RAGE). Lipidated ApoE also plays a major role in all processes. The disturbance of these pathways induces an accumulation of Abeta. The description of the mechanisms reveals two key molecules in particular: (i) free estradiol, which has genomic and non-genomic action, and (ii) free DHA as a preferential ligand of PPARalpha-RXRalpha and PPARgamma-RXRalpha heterodimers. DHA and free estradiol are also self-regulating, and act in synergy. When a certain level of chronic DHA and free estradiol deficiency is reached, a permanent imbalance is established in the central nervous system. The consequences of these deficits are revealed in particular by the presence of Abeta peptide deposits, as well as other markers of the etiology of SAD.
