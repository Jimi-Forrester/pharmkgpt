9369525|t|Amyloid beta-protein toxicity and oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease.
9369525|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of memory and progressive decline of cognitive abilities. Although the pathogenesis of this disease is not known and is still under intensive investigation, there are several hypotheses which address certain aspects of the disease. This review focuses on the oxidative-stress hypothesis of AD and on novel antioxidative approaches to an effective neuroprotection for the prevention and therapy of this neurodegenerative disorder. The toxicity of the AD-associated amyloid beta-protein (Abeta), the induction of oxidative stress by Abeta in neurons, and potential sources of oxidative events in brain tissue are discussed.
