34955043|t|Understanding the Course of Critical Illness Through a Lifeworld Approach.
34955043|a|An increasing number of individuals receive and survive intensive care treatment; however, several individuals experience problems afterward, which may threaten recovery. Grounded in a lifeworld approach, the aim of this study was to explore and describe what intensive care patients experience as limiting and strengthening throughout their illness trajectories. Ten former intensive care patients were interviewed three to eight months after hospital discharge. Using Giorgi's phenomenological analysis, a general structure of gaining strength through a caring interaction with others was revealed. The structure consisted of three constituents: feeling safe through a caring presence, being seen and met as a unique person, and being supported to restore capacity. Being met with a humanistic approach and individualized care appeared to be important, and the findings are discussed within the framework of lifeworld-led care. To facilitate improved aftercare of the critically ill, more tailored support throughout the illness trajectory is needed.
