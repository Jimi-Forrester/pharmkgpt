37663597|a|Purpose of review: Several psychiatric disorders have been associated with an increased risk of developing a neurodegenerative disease and/or dementia. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a neurodevelopmental disorder, has been understudied in relation to dementia risk. We summarized existing literature investigating the risk of incident neurodegenerative disease or dementia associated with ADHD. Recent findings: We searched five databases for cohort, case-control, and clinical trial studies investigating associations between ADHD and neurodegenerative diseases/dementia in May 2023. Study characteristics were extracted by two independent raters, and risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Search terms yielded 2,137 articles, and seven studies (five cohort and two case-control studies) ultimately met inclusion criteria. Studies examined the following types of neurodegeneration: all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's and Lewy body diseases, vascular dementia, and mild cognitive impairment. Heterogeneity in study methodology, particularly covariates used in analyses and types of ratios for risk reported, prevented a meta-analysis and data were therefore summarized as a narrative synthesis. The majority of studies (4/7) demonstrated an overall low risk of bias. Summary: The current literature on risk of developing a neurodegenerative disease in ADHD is limited. Although the studies identified present evidence for a link between ADHD and subsequent development of dementia, the magnitude of the direct effect of ADHD on neurodegeneration is yet to be determined and better empirically designed studies are first needed. Furthermore, the mechanism of how or why ADHD is associated with an increased risk of developing a neurocognitive disorder is still unclear and should be explored in future studies.
