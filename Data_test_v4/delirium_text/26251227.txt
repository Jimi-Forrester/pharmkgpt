26251227|a|Inflammation is an innate mechanism that defends organisms against harmful stimuli. Inflammation leads to the production and secretion of proinflammatory mediators that activate and recruit immune cells to damaged tissues, including the brain, to resolve the cause of inflammation. In the central nervous system, inflammation is referred to as neuroinflammation, which occurs in various pathological conditions of the brain. The primary role of neuroinflammation is to protect the brain. However, prolonged and/or inappropriate inflammation can be harmful for the brain, from individual cells to the whole tissue. This review focuses on a particular type of inflammatory mediator, chemokines, and describes their complex effects both under physiological and pathophysiological conditions of the brain. The clinical relevance of the multiple characters of chemokines is highlighted with respect to acute and chronic inflammation of the brain, including their actions in stroke and Alzheimer's disease, respectively.
