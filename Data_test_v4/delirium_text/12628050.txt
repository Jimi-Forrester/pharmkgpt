12628050|a|Involvement by psychiatrists in the care of patients who are terminally ill has been limited historically; however, psychiatrists increasingly are participating in the care of these people who are facing the most challenging times of their lives. Pain management is considered to be an area of subspecialization for psychiatrists beyond their traditional role of being psychopharmacologists and psychotherapists. Biologically focused psychiatrists are able to address neuropsychiatric disorders, including pain and depression in the medically ill, and actively improve the quality of life for dying patients and their family members. This article provides a review of the recent literature that has addressed the involvement of psychiatrists in end-of-life care. Beginning with an example of the scientific aspects of cancer-related treatment from a patient's perspective, and into the major treatment considerations, this article addresses pain, its recognition, and management challenges when the end of life approaches. The prompt recognition of frequently overlooked and underestimated concomitant depressions, delirium, dementia, and other mental disorders is important for mental health specialists. The importance of psychiatric care for patients who are terminally ill and the role of psychiatrists in the phase of care also are discussed.
