20144674|a|Ubiquitin-C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) is a de-ubiquitinating enzyme expressed in the brain and reproductive tissues as well as certain cancers. The hydrolase activity of UCH-L1 has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease and cancer invasion; therefore, it may represent a therapeutic target for these diseases. The present study was undertaken to identify novel chemical modulators for the hydrolase activity of UCH-L1. To identify chemicals that bind to the active site of UCH-L1, we carried out in silico structure-based drug screening using human UCH-L1 crystal structure data (PDB ID: 2ETL) and virtual compound libraries containing 26,891 and 304,205 compounds. Among the compounds with the highest binding scores, we identified one that potentiates the hydrolase activity of UCH-L1, and six that inhibit the activity in enzymatic assays. These compounds may be useful for research on UCH-L1 function, and could lead to candidate therapeutics for UCH-L1-associated diseases.
