19604604|t|Knockout of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 gene reduces amyloid beta peptide burden in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
19604604|a|Accumulation of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) in the brain is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD); the underlying mechanism, however, is not well understood. In this study, we show that expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), a physiological inhibitor of tissue type and urokinase type plasminogen activators (tPA and uPA), increases with age in the brain of wild type and Abeta precursor protein-presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice as well as in AD patients. Most importantly, we show that knocking out the PAI-1 gene dramatically reduces Abeta burden in the brain of APP/PS1 mice but has no effect on the levels of full-length APP, alpha or beta C-terminal fragments. Furthermore, we show that knocking out the PAI-1 gene leads to increases in the activities of tPA and plasmin, and the plasmin activity inversely correlates with the amounts of SDS insoluble Abeta40 and Abeta42. Together, these data suggest that increased PAI-1 expression/activity contributes importantly to Abeta accumulation during aging and in AD probably by inhibiting plasminogen activation and thus Abeta degradation.
