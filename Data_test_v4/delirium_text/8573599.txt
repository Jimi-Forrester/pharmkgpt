8573599|t|The protein disease database of human body fluids: I. Rationale for the development of this database.
8573599|a|We are developing a relational database to facilitate quantitative and qualitative comparisons of proteins in human body fluids in normal and disease states. For decades researchers and clinicians have been studying proteins in body fluids such as serum, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid and urine. Currently, most clinicians evaluate only a few specific proteins in a body fluid such as plasma when they suspect that a patient has a disease. Now, however, high resolution two-dimensional protein electrophoresis allows the simultaneous evaluation of 1,500 to 3,000 proteins in complex solutions, such as the body fluids. This and other high resolution methods have encouraged us to collect the clinical data for the body fluid proteins into an easily accessed database. For this reason, it has been constructed on the Internet World Wide Web (WWW) under the title Protein Disease Database (PDD). In addition, this database will provide a linkage between the disease-associated protein alterations and images of the appropriate proteins on high-resolution electrophoretic gels of the body fluids. This effort requires the normalization of data to account for variations in methods of measurement. Initial efforts in the establishment of the PDD have been concentrated on alterations in the acute-phase proteins in individuals with acute and chronic diseases. Even at this early stage in the development of our database, it has proven to be useful as we have found that there appear to be several common acute-phase protein alterations in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid from patients with Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and major depression. Our goal is to provide access to the PDD so that systematic correlations and relationships between disease states can be examined and extended.
