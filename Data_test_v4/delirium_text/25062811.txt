25062811|a|Processing of misfolded proteins is important in order for the cell to maintain its normal functioning and homeostasis. Three systems control the quality of proteins: chaperone-mediated refolding, proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, and finally, when the two others fail, aggrephagy, as selective form of autophagy, degrades ubiquitin-labelled aggregated cargos. In this route misfolded proteins gradually form larger aggregates, aggresomes and they eventually become double membrane-wrapped organelles called autophagosomes, which become degraded when they fuse to lysosomes, for reuse by the cell. The stages, the main molecules participating in the process, and the regulation of aggrephagy are discussed here, as is the role of protein aggregation in protein accumulation diseases. In particular, we emphasize that both Alzheimer's disease and age-related macular degeneration, two of the most common pathologies in the aged, are characterized by altered protein clearance and deposits. Based on the hypothesis that manipulations of autophagy may be potentially useful in these and other aggregation-related diseases, we will discuss some promising therapeutic strategies to counteract protein aggregates-induced cellular toxicity.
