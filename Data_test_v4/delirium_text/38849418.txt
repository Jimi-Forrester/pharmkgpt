38849418|a|Dementia, and in particular Alzheimer's disease (AD), can be characterized by disrupted functional connectivity in the brain caused by beta-amyloid deposition in neural links. Non-pharmaceutical treatments for dementia have recently explored interventions involving the stimulation of neuronal populations in the gamma band. These interventions aim to restore brain network functionality by synchronizing rhythmic energy through various stimulation modalities. Entrainment, a newly proposed non-invasive sensory stimulation method, has shown promise in improving cognitive functions in dementia patients. This study investigates the effectiveness of entrainment in terms of promoting neural synchrony and spatial connectivity across the cortex. EEG signals were recorded during a 40 Hz auditory entrainment session conducted with a group of elderly participants with dementia. Phase locking value (PLV) between different intraregional and interregional sites was examined as an attribute of network synchronization, and connectivity of local and distant links were compared during the stimulation and rest trials. Our findings demonstrate enhanced neural synchrony between the frontal and parietal regions, which are key components of the brain's default mode network (DMN). The DMN operation is known to be impacted by dementia's progression, leading to reduced functional connectivity across the parieto-frontal pathways. Notably, entrainment alone significantly improves synchrony between these DMN components, suggesting its potential for restoring functional connectivity.
