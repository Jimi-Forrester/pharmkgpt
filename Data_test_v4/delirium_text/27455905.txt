27455905|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-associated neurodegenerative amyloid disease and is considered a social and clinical problem the last decades, particularly in the Western countries. Amyloid diseases are characterized by the deposition of typically aggregated protein/peptides in tissues that are associated with brain degeneration and progressive cognitive impairment. The amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles arise as a result of self-assembly into fibrillar material of amyloid-beta protein and hyperphosphorylated tau, respectively. Moreover, mounting evidence shows that oxidative and nitrosative stress plays a central role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as AD. Oleuropein belongs to a specific group of polyphenols, the secoiridoids, which are abundant in Oleaceae. Oleuropein aglycone is abundant in extra virgin olive oil and it is generated as a product of a glucosidase released when olive fruits are crushed. This secoiridoid compound has radical-scavenging activity and antioxidative effects and it is considered a promising target to prevent amyloid toxicity as an inhibitor of the oligomer nucleation and growth. The neuroprotective and antioxidant effects of flavonoids have been found to strongly depend on their structure and functional groups. Oleuropein aglycone counteracts amyloid aggregation and toxicity affecting different pathways: amyloid precursor protein processing, amyloid-beta peptide and tau aggregation, autophagy impairment, and neuroinflammation. In the current work, available literature on oleuropein aglycone effects as antioxidant and inhibitor of amyloid deposits in AD is reviewed. Moreover, we discuss the chemistry, food sources and bioavailability of oleuropein aglycone.
