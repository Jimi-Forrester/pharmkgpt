35649092|a|OBJECTIVE: to analyze the relationship between the Burnout dimensions and the work resilience of intensive care Nursing professionals in the COVID-19 pandemic in four hospitals from southern Brazil. METHOD: this is a multicenter and cross-sectional study, composed of 153 nurses and nursing technicians of the Intensive Care Units. Sociodemographic, health and work-related questions were collected, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory and Resilience at Work Scale 20 instruments were applied. The data were submitted to descriptive analysis and to bivariate and partial correlations (network analysis). RESULTS: work resilience presented an inverse correlation to emotional exhaustion (r=-0.545; p=0.01) and depersonalization (r=-0.419; p=0.01) and a direct one to professional achievement (r=0.680; p=0.01). The variable with the greatest influence on the correlation network was the perception of the impact of the pandemic on mental health. CONCLUSION: resilience interferes in the emotional exhaustion and low professional achievement domains of Burnout. Emotional exhaustion is conducted through minor psychological disorders, with an impact on the workers' physical and mental health variables. The development of institutional resilience should be encouraged in order to moderate the illness.
