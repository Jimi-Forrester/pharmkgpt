32005514|t|Intraoperative xenon for prevention of delirium after on-pump cardiac surgery: a randomised, observer-blind, controlled clinical trial.
32005514|a|BACKGROUND: Older patients undergoing cardiac surgery have a 40-60% risk of developing postoperative delirium (POD), which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In animals, xenon has been found to be neuroprotective. Little is known about its neuroprotective effects in humans. We evaluated whether xenon anaesthesia prevents POD in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: We conducted a randomised, observer-blind, controlled trial in which 190 patients 65 yr or older undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery were randomly allocated to xenon or sevoflurane anaesthesia. During cardiopulmonary bypass, propofol infusion was used for anaesthetic maintenance. Subjects were screened for POD daily during the first 5 postoperative days using the 3-Minute Diagnostic Interview for Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) or with a CAM version for patients in ICU (CAM-ICU). Other methods to detect delirium, such as chart review, were also used. Secondary outcomes included the duration and severity of POD, and postoperative cognitive function. RESULTS: The overall incidence of POD was 41% (78/190). There was no statistically significant difference in the POD incidence between the xenon and sevoflurane groups (42.7% [41/96] vs 39.4% [37/94], P=0.583). The odds ratio for POD when comparing xenon with sevoflurane was 1.18 (95% confidence interval, 0.65-2.16). CONCLUSIONS: In older patients undergoing cardiac surgery, xenon anaesthesia did not result in a significant reduction in POD. Based on these results alone, use of xenon cannot be recommended for this purpose.
