METHODS: APP/PS1 mice were used as AD mice models and exposed to HKL and 3-TYP. Morris water maze experiment was performed to appraise cognitive performance of mice. Hippocampal Abeta+ plaque deposition and neuronal survival was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and Nissl staining. Hippocampal neurons were dissociated from C57BL/6 mouse embryos. Hippocampal neuronal AD model was constructed by Abeta oligomers induction and treated with HKL, CsA and 3-TYP. Neuronal viability and apoptosis were detected by cell counting kit-8 assay and TUNEL staining. mRFP-eGFP-LC3 assay, MitoSOX Red, dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, and JC-1 staining were performed to monitor neuronal autophagosomes, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), neuronal ROS, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Autophagy-related proteins were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: In AD mice, HKL improved cognitive function, relieved hippocampal Abeta1-42 plaque deposition, promoted hippocampal neuron survival, and activated hippocampal SIRT3 expression and mitochondrial autophagy. These effects of HKL on AD mice were abolished by 3-TYP treatment. In hippocampal neuronal AD model, HKL increased neuronal activity, attenuated neuronal apoptosis and Abeta aggregation, activated SIRT3 and mitochondrial autophagy, reduced mitochondrial and neuronal ROS, and elevated mitochondrial membrane potential. CsA treatment and 3-TYP treatment abrogated the protection of HKL on hippocampal neuronal AD model. The promotion of mitochondrial autophagy by HKL in hippocampal neuronal AD model was counteracted by 3-TYP. CONCLUSIONS: HKL activates SIRT3-mediated mitochondrial autophagy to mitigate hippocampal neuronal damage in AD. HKL may be effective in treating AD.
