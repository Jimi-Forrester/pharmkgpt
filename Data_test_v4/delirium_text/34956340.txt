34956340|t|Bioinformatics Analysis of Long Non-coding RNA and Related Diseases: An Overview.
34956340|a|Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are usually located in the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells. The transcripts of lncRNAs are >200 nucleotides in length and do not encode proteins. Compared with small RNAs, lncRNAs have longer sequences, more complex spatial structures, and more diverse and complex mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression. LncRNAs are widely involved in the biological processes of cells, and in the occurrence and development of many human diseases. Many studies have shown that lncRNAs can induce the occurrence of diseases, and some lncRNAs undergo specific changes in tumor cells. Research into the roles of lncRNAs has covered the diagnosis of, for example, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and central nervous system diseases. The bioinformatics of lncRNAs has gradually become a research hotspot and has led to the discovery of a large number of lncRNAs and associated biological functions, and lncRNA databases and recognition models have been developed. In this review, the research progress of lncRNAs is discussed, and lncRNA-related databases and the mechanisms and modes of action of lncRNAs are described. In addition, disease-related lncRNA methods and the relationships between lncRNAs and human lung adenocarcinoma, rectal cancer, colon cancer, heart disease, and diabetes are discussed. Finally, the significance and existing problems of lncRNA research are considered.
