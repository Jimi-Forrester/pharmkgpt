33945268|a|Inhibition of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) and Abeta42 fibrillation have been established as the main models for the treatment of systemic lysozyme amyloidosis and Alzheimer's disease (AD), respectively. Several antiamyloidogenic nanomaterials have been developed over the period; however, their intracellular mechanism of action is still not well understood. In this context, plant-based, gold-conjugated, injectable, hydrophilic cellulose nanoonions (CNOs), viz., DH-CNO (~60 +- 5 nm) and LC-CNO (~55 +- 12 nm), were developed from their respective hydrophobic cellulose nanocrystals (DH-CNC and LC-CNC) using a single-step chemical template-mediated process. This unique nanocellulose architecture was chemically and morphologically characterized by various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. Further, the different biophysical studies documented marked the inhibition/disintegration potential of gold-conjugated LC-CNO against HEWL and Abeta42 peptide aggregation. It was further observed that inhibition of protein fibrillation could be achieved within ~10 min when the same materials were used under photoirradiation conditions. In vitro protein aggregation studies using HEK293 cells suggested that gold-conjugated LC-CNO could effectively reduce the cellular toxicity via regulation of oxidative stress and ion homeostasis. The outcome of the present study will help in designing cellulose-based novel functional nanochaperones against various neurodegenerative diseases.
