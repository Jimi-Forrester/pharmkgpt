39495572|t|Clear Minds: Unravelling Delirium in Older Adults.
39495572|a|With an explosive population growth of older adults, the incidence rates of neuropsychiatric syndromes, particularly delirium, are increasing in the community and hospital settings. Delirium is an acute disturbance in cognition and attention that may signify a serious medical, life-threatening condition and may mimic psychiatric-mental health issues. Although its prevalence rate is lower in the community, delirium affects up to 87% of hospitalized older adults and can cost up to $152 billion each year. Despite its common occurrence, delirium is often undetected in 50% to 60% across all care settings, delaying treatment and resulting in poor patient outcomes, such as increased mortality, prolonged hospital stays, cognitive and functional impairment, decreased quality of life, and institutionalization. The current article addresses strategies to recognize delirium and presents evidence-based approaches and future considerations for delirium management.
