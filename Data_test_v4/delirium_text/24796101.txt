24796101|t|[Metabolic syndrome].
24796101|a|Considerable attention has focused on the prevention of dementia in terms of non-genetic risk factors, including midlife obesity, especially visceral obesity associated with hyperglycemia, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Accumulating evidence has indicated that the increased insulin resistance in relation to visceral fat accumulation is potential risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia. Reducing the accumulating visceral fat may contribute to reduce the risk of on set and progression of AD and vascular dementia. Treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers in hypertension might slow the rate of cognitive decline in patients with AD by modulating insulin resistance.
