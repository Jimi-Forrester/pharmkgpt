35324716|a|In this work, Hexagonal Mesoporous Silica (HMS) and Santa Barbara Amorphous-15 (SBA-15) mesostructured silicas were synthesized and functionalized with sulfonic acid groups. The materials (HMS-SO3- and SBA-15-SO3-) were evaluated as strong cation exchange sorbents for sample extract clean-up, by solid phase extraction (SPE) and dispersive solid phase extraction, to determine atropine (At) and scopolamine (Sc) in commercial culinary aromatic herbs. Under optimized conditions, 0.25 g of sample was subject to solid-liquid extraction with acidified water (pH 1.0), and good recovery percentages were achieved for At and Sc using 75 mg of HMS-SO3- in SPE as the clean-up stage, prior to their determination by HPLC-MS/MS. The proposed method was validated in a thyme sample showing recoveries in the range of 70-92%, good linearity (R2 > 0.999), adequate precision (RSD <= 14%) and low limits (MDL 0.8-2.2 microg/kg and MQL 2.6-7.2 microg/kg for both analytes). Sixteen aromatic herbs samples (dried thyme, basil and coriander leaves) were analysed and At was found in fourteen samples over an interval of <5-42 mug/kg, whereas Sc was found in three of the sixteen samples studied (between <5-34 mug/kg). The amount of At and Sc found in some analysed samples confirms the importance of setting maximum levels of At and Sc in culinary aromatic herbs.
