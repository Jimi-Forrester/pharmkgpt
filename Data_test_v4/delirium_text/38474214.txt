38474214|t|New Light on Prions: Putative Role of PrPc in Pathophysiology of Mood Disorders.
38474214|a|Mood disorders are highly prevalent and heterogenous mental illnesses with devastating rates of mortality and treatment resistance. The molecular basis of those conditions involves complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Currently, there are no objective procedures for diagnosis, prognosis and personalization of patients' treatment. There is an urgent need to search for novel molecular targets for biomarkers in mood disorders. Cellular prion protein (PrPc) is infamous for its potential to convert its insoluble form, leading to neurodegeneration in Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. Meanwhile, in its physiological state, PrPc presents neuroprotective features and regulates neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. The aim of this study is to integrate the available knowledge about molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of PrPc on the pathophysiology of mood disorders. Our review indicates an important role of this protein in regulation of cognitive functions, emotions, sleep and biological rhythms, and its deficiency results in depressive-like behavior and cognitive impairment. PrPc plays a neuroprotective role against excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and inflammation, the main pathophysiological events in the course of mood disorders. Research indicates that PrPc may be a promising biomarker of cognitive decline. There is an urgent need of human studies to elucidate its potential utility in clinical practice.
