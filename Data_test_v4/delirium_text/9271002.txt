9271002|a|The effects of cadmium, copper, and zinc on beta APP metabolism were investigated in COS-7 and PC12 cells. Cadmium chloride (CdCl2) increased beta APP steady-state protein levels and decreased beta APP posttranslational processing. These changes were not accompanied by alterations in beta APP mRNA levels or splicing. In addition, cytosolic alpha-actin and G3PDH levels were not affected. Further, neither zinc (ZnCl2) nor copper (CuSO4) altered beta APP levels or affected its normal processing. Pulse-chase studies revealed that the rate of beta APP maturation decreased twofold in the presence of 25 microM CdCl2 compared to untreated controls. beta APP secretion from the cell also dramatically slowed. These two factors result in the accumulation of partially processed beta APP inside cells. The presence of CdCl2 also decreased the amount of an 8-kDa beta APP C-terminal fragment, indicating that the cellular compartment in which beta APP accumulates is not accessible to alpha-secretase. Studies using Brefeldin A suggest that this compartment may be the cis or medial Golgi. However, A beta production was proportionately increased. These data show that CdCl2 can modulate the beta APP cleavage to favor A beta. Finally, beta APP mis- metabolism was shown to be unrelated to the hsp70 induction elicited by CdCl2; both heat shock and CuSO4 induced hsp70 but had no effect on steady-state levels of beta APP, although heat shock did slow beta APP maturation. These data indicate that hsp70 alone cannot chaperone beta APP through an alternate processing pathway leading to A beta production.
