11187168|a|BACKGROUND: The aims of the study are to describe the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in palliative care and how to diagnose these disorders. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Literature search including cancer patients, palliative care, psychiatric conditions and diagnostics. RESULTS: Neuropsychiatric conditions such as delirium, dementia and amnestic disorder are prevalent (> 20%), especially in the terminal phase. Anxiety and depressive symptoms are also common and may be caused by the patients' medical condition. Probably less than 10% have anxiety or depressive disorders. However, methodological limitations make comparisons across studies difficult. The interview is the main basis for assessment of mental status. Doctor-centered interviewing techniques are needed in the assessment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Emotional symptoms are best explored by open-ended questions and facilitating techniques. Psychiatric somatic symptoms such as weight loss, fatigue or insomnia are not valid diagnostic criteria. Selfreport questionnaires and short-form screening instruments are best suited for monitoring the course of the disorders, but must be adapted for this specific population. INTERPRETATION: Neuropsychiatric conditions are the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in palliative care. Good interviewing skills are the main element in the diagnostic workup.
