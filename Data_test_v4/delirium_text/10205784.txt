10205784|a|This overviews recent understanding of the mechanisms of apoptosis on ischemia-induced neuronal cell death. Apoptosis is a prominent feature of the developing nervous system. Several lines of evidence suggest that apoptosis is also an important mechanism of cell death in adult brain in acute or chronic diseases such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease. In animal models of stroke, markers of apoptosis such as cytoplasmic and nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation appear in neurons. A variety of physiological and pathological stimuli can activate signal-transduction pathways that result in the sequential proteolytic activation of caspase family members. The activation of caspases can be inhibited by several molecules, including peptide aldehydes (caspase-1 and or caspase-3 inhibitors) and crmA that target the active-site cysteine of caspase family members, Bcl-2, IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis protein) and NAIP (neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein). Once activated, caspase-1 protease can activate the caspase family members and hydrolyze a discrete set of cellular targets. Poly (ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP), which appears to facilitate apoptosis, was recognized as a substrate of activated caspase-3. These results suggest that caspase family, bcl-2 family, IAP family and substrates such PARP contribute to mechanisms of cell death in ischemic brain injury. Inhibition of the caspase family, particularly by non-peptide inhibitors that cross the blood-brain barrier and easily penetrate neurons and glia, could provide novel treatments for stroke and other forms of brain and spinal cord injury in humans.
