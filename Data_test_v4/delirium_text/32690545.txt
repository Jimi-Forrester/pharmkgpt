32690545|t|Endosomal Trafficking in Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis.
32690545|a|Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders of early life, Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder of midlife, while Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder of late life. While they are phenotypically distinct, recent studies suggest that they share a biological pathway, retromer-dependent endosomal trafficking. A retromer is a multimodular protein assembly critical for sorting and trafficking cargo out of the endosome. As a lysosomal storage disease, all 13 of NCL's causative genes affect endolysosomal function, and at least four have been directly linked to retromer. PD has several known causative genes, with one directly linked to retromer and others causing endolysosomal dysfunction. AD has over 25 causative genes/risk factors, with several of them linked to retromer or endosomal trafficking dysfunction. In this article, we summarize the emerging evidence on the association of genes causing NCL with retromer function and endosomal trafficking, review the recent evidence linking NCL genes to AD, and discuss how NCL, AD, and PD converge on a shared molecular pathway. We also discuss this pathway's role in microglia and neurons, cell populations which are critical to proper brain homeostasis and whose dysfunction plays a key role in neurodegeneration.
