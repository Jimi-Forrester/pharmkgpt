39064222|a|Background: Mitral valve infective endocarditis (IE) still has a high mortality. Minimally invasive mitral valve surgery (MIMVS) is technically more challenging, especially in patients with endocarditis. Here, we compare the early postoperative outcome of patients with endocarditis and other indications for MIMVS. Methods: Two groups were formed, one consisting of patients who underwent surgery because of mitral valve endocarditis (IE group: n = 75) and the other group consisting of patients who had another indication for MIMVS (non-IE group: n = 862). Patients were observed for 30 postoperative days. Data were retrospectively reviewed and collected from January 2011 to September 2023. Results: Patients from the IE group were younger (60 vs. 68 years; p < 0.001) and had a higher preoperative history of stroke (26% vs. 6%; p < 0.001) with neurological symptoms (26% vs. 9%; p < 0.001). No difference was seen in overall surgery time (211 vs. 206 min; p = 0.71), time on cardiopulmonary bypass (137 vs. 137 min; p = 0.42) and aortic clamping time (76 vs. 78 min; p = 0.42). Concerning postoperative data, the IE group had a higher requirement of erythrocyte transfusion (2 vs. 0; p = 0.041). But no difference was seen in the need for a mitral valve redo procedure, bleeding, postoperative stroke, cerebral bleeding, new-onset dialysis, overall intubation time, sepsis, pacemaker implantation, wound healing disorders and 30-day mortality. Conclusions: Minimally invasive mitral valve surgery in patients with mitral valve endocarditis is feasible and safe. Infective endocarditis should not be considered as a contraindication for MIMVS.
