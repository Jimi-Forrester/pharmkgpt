38755498|a|The Covid-19 pandemic and the repeated lockdowns have caused substantial spiritual and existential suffering, not the least for persons with dementia who may have had more difficulties than others in grasping the reality of what was going on. Therefore, it is important to address spirituality within this sector of the population when considering global health and ethics and technology in a pandemic outbreak. This contribution starts firstly with a definition of spirituality and spiritual care. Secondly, based on the works of Elizabeth MacKinlay and Laura Dewitte, the article demonstrates how spirituality can be nurtured in the dementia ward through "spiritual reminiscence." Finally, I briefly reflect on how spiritual care in the dementia ward was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
