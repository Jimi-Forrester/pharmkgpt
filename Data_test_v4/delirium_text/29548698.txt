29548698|a|Disruption of the synaptic plasma membrane (SPM) induced by the aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides has been considered as a potential mechanism for the neurotoxicity of Abeta in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular basis of such membrane disruption process remains unclear, mainly because of the severe systematic heterogeneity problem that prevents the high-resolution studies. Our previous studies using a two-component phosphatidylcholine (PC)/phosphatidylglycerol (PG) model liposome showed the presence of Abeta-induced membrane disruptions that were either on the pathway or off the pathway of fibril formation. The present study focuses on a more biologically relevant model membrane with compositions that mimic the outer leaflet of SPMs. The main findings are: (1) the two competing membrane disruption effects discovered in PC/PG liposomes and their general peptide-to-lipid-molar-ratio dependence persist in the more complicated membrane models; (2) the SPM-mimic membrane promotes the formation of certain "on-fibrillation-pathway" intermediates with higher alpha-helical structural population, which lead to more rapid and significant of membrane content leakage; (3) although the "on-fibrillation-pathway" intermediate structures show dependence on membrane compositions, there seems to be a common final fibril structure grown from different liposomes, suggesting that there may be a predominant fibril structure for 40-residue Abeta (i.e. Abeta40) peptides in biologically-relevant membranes.
