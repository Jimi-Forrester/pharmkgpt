37468206|a|Background: COVID-19 and delayed hip surgery are well-known risk factors for thromboembolism in elderly patients. Case: We report the case of an 88-year-old female patient with COVID-19 and pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) who underwent delayed hip surgery 21 days after the injury. Heparinization and inferior vena cava (IVC) filters were used to treat and prevent PTE. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) sheaths were inserted as a precaution in case of emergencies during surgery; the procedure was performed without any specific event. Conclusions: COVID-19-infected patients suffering from a hip fracture have a high risk of thromboembolism, and therefore, require utmost attention for appropriate evaluation and prevention.
