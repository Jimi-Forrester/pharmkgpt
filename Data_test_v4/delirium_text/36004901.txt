36004901|t|Plant Polysaccharides in Engineered Pharmaceutical Gels.
36004901|a|Hydrogels are a great ally in the pharmaceutical and biomedical areas. They have a three-dimensional polymeric structure that allows the swelling of aqueous fluids, acting as an absorbent, or encapsulating bioactive agents for controlled drug release. Interestingly, plants are a source of biogels, specifically polysaccharides, composed of sugar monomers. The crosslinking of these polymeric chains forms an architecture similar to the extracellular matrix, enhancing the biocompatibility of such materials. Moreover, the rich hydroxyl monomers promote a hydrophilic behavior for these plant-derived polysaccharide gels, enabling their biodegradability and antimicrobial effects. From an economic point of view, such biogels help the circular economy, as a green material can be obtained with a low cost of production. As regards the bio aspect, it is astonishingly attractive since the raw materials (polysaccharides from plants-cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin, inulin, pectin, starch, guar, and cashew gums, etc.) might be produced sustainably. Such properties make viable the applications of these biogels in contact with the human body, especially incorporating drugs for controlled release. In this context, this review describes some sources of plant-derived polysaccharide gels, their biological function, main methods for extraction, remarkable applications, and properties in the health field.
