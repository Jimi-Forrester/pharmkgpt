34693550|t|Pharmacological report of recently designed multifunctional coumarin and coumarin-heterocycle derivatives.
34693550|a|Coumarin is a naturally available molecule and has been identified as a potent pharmacophore due to its pharmacological activity. Because of this, coumarin has been exploited synthetically to prepare a wide range of derivatives. In fact, most coumarin derivatives have been found to be less toxic, which is the most essential property for a drug molecule. Such molecules are being prepared for therapeutic use as broad-spectrum pharmacological agents. Microbial diseases including viral diseases have become very common and are responsible for many deaths worldwide. In particular, microbial drug resistance is a problem that needs to be tackled in an effective manner. Also, for Alzheimer's disease, which affects most elderly persons, no efficient chemotherapy exists. In addition, although diabetes, a metabolic syndrome, can be treated with many drugs, there is no complete cure. Thus, more potent antidiabetic agents are required for the management of diabetes. Likewise, for the treatment of a wide range of ailments caused by microbes, genetic factors, or lifestyle-related factors, an efficient drug regimen is needed. In view of this, coumarin derivatives are designed and evaluated. Here, coumarin derivatives that have been reported recently are compiled, classified and evaluated critically. This study briefly takes the structure-activity relationship into consideration and suggests the next suitable step. With a focus on the most potent molecules, the pharmacological activity of the evaluated molecules is described.
