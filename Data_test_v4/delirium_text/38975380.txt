38975380|t|The Clinical Role of Heart Rate Variability Assessment in Cognitively Impaired Patients and Its Applicability in Community Care Settings: A Systematic Review of the Literature.
38975380|a|Heart rate variability (HRV) correlates well with a person's overall physiological function. Clinically, HRV is successfully used in acute care to identify impending infections, but little is known about its potential in the management of chronic diseases like cognitive decline/dementia. The aim of this study was to identify the best available knowledge about HRV in cognitively impaired populations that might be applied to improve clinical practice in community settings. We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases published from January 2009 to August 2022. Eligible studies were selected using Covidence and each study underwent qualitative assessment using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool. At each stage of selection, each study was reviewed independently by two members of the team, and any disputes were discussed along the way. The literature identified that the brain regions controlling HRV are also those affected by dementias of Alzheimer's type (AD) and Lewy body types (DLB). HRV was impaired in both types, with DLB showing greater impairment in all HRV parameters compared to AD. No studies explored the temporal changes of HRV or its use in the clinical management of people with cognitive impairment (CI). The current lack of standardization of HRV recording and analysis limits its use in clinical practice. HRV may emerge as a potentially useful tool to identify people with early/preclinical memory impairment and help to differentiate AD from DLB. Longitudinal HRV measurement is emerging as a useful way to monitor disease progression and treatment response, and continuous HRV measurement may prove useful in the early identification of sepsis and its complications in patients no longer able to communicate their illness experiences.
