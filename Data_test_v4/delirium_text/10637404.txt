10637404|t|Sustained cognitive improvement following treatment of Alzheimer's disease with donepezil.
10637404|a|OBJECTIVES: To audit response to the anticholinesterase inhibitor donepezil in patients referred to a specialist memory clinic, to identify possible means of targeting the drug more accurately. DESIGN: All referrals to the clinic who were assessed and treated against a protocol, with structured follow-up. SUBJECTS: All referrals of any age with the diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease, mild to moderately severe. Main outcome measures Cognitive improvement as measured by serial ADAS-cog and MMSE examinations. RESULTS: Two hundred and eight-two patients commenced on treatment, improved cognitive functioning in over 65% of patients reaching 3 months (N=184), 51% on intention to treat analysis (N=231), with significantly greater improvement (p=0.03) in those aged 65 and under. Carer reports of behavioural improvement not always linked to cognitive improvement. Trend to increased response in those on concomitant antidepressants. CONCLUSION: Three-month assessment for response prior to agreeing continuation of treatment selects a group who maintain their response. Younger patients should be targeted for early assessment and treatment.
