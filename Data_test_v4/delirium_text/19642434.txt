19642434|t|[Symptomatic treatments (pain management excluded) for adults in palliative care].
19642434|a|Patients with evolutive and terminal desease often present 4 to 5 annoying symptoms, linked to the desease and implying a rigorous assessment as well as a treatment of the cause whenever possible. When all etiologic treatments have been used, the symptomatic treatments often allow to relieve the patient. This demands allying care and medication as well as mastering the available therapeutics so as to adapt the prescriptions at best. The present work essentially approaches the etiologies and symptomatic treatments of nausea and vomiting, hiccup, constipation, bowel obstruction, dyspnoea, congestion and death rattle and neuropsychic disfunctionning, in particular anxiety, depression and delirium. For the situations where the oral, transdermic and intravenous routes become difficult or impossible, medication to be administrated through subcutaneous routes are listed, with prudence, for not regulated.
