38261767|t|SIRT3 Activation a Promise in Drug Development? New Insights into SIRT3 Biology and Its Implications on the Drug Discovery Process.
38261767|a|Sirtuins catalyze deacetylation of lysine residues with a NAD+-dependent mechanism. In mammals, the sirtuin family is composed of seven members, divided into four subclasses that differ in substrate specificity, subcellular localization, regulation, as well as interactions with other proteins, both within and outside the epigenetic field. Recently, much interest has been growing in SIRT3, which is mainly involved in regulating mitochondrial metabolism. Moreover, SIRT3 seems to be protective in diseases such as age-related, neurodegenerative, liver, kidney, heart, and metabolic ones, as well as in cancer. In most cases, activating SIRT3 could be a promising strategy to tackle these health problems. Here, we summarize the main biological functions, substrates, and interactors of SIRT3, as well as several molecules reported in the literature that are able to modulate SIRT3 activity. Among the activators, some derive from natural products, others from library screening, and others from the classical medicinal chemistry approach.
