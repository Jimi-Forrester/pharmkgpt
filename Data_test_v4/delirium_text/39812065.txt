39812065|t|Foreign Contaminants Target Brain Health.
39812065|a|Neurodisease, caused by undesired substances, can lead to mental health conditions like depression, anxiety and neurocognitive problems like dementia. These substances can be referred to as contaminants that can cause damage, corruption, and infection or reduce brain functionality. Contaminants, whether conceptual or physical, have the ability to disrupt many processes. These observations motivate us to investigate contaminants and neurotoxicity collaboratively. This study investigates the link between pollutants and neuro-disease, examining transmission pathways and categorization. It also provides information on resources, causes, and challenges to minimize contamination risks. Contamination may cause various neuro-diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multi-system atrophy, Huntington's, autism spectrum disorder, psychiatric disorder, dementia, meningitis, encephalitis, schizophrenia, anxiety, and depression. The negative effects depend on the nature and extent of exposure. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using databases such as PubMed and Scopus, focusing on studies published till 2024. Studies were selected based on their examination of the relationship between environmental contaminants and brain health, emphasizing transmission pathways and the resulting neurological outcomes. Findings indicate that contaminants can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via nasal, gut, and auditory routes, triggering harmful neurophysiological processes. This review highlights the urgent need for increased global awareness, policy interventions, and preventive measures to mitigate the long-term impacts of environmental contaminants on brain health, particularly in emerging nations.
