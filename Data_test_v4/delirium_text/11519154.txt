11519154|t|[Side effects and its countermeasures of antidepressant].
11519154|a|We reviewed the side effects of antidepressants. Tricyclic antidepressants(TCAs) are associated with a higher frequency of adverse events than those of SSRIs and SNRIs, particularly with respect to anticholinergic-like effects(dry mouth, constipation, and blurred vision), delirium, and cardiovascular adverse events. On the other hand, SSRIs have some special side effects that include nausea, sexual dysfunction, and extrapyramidal symptoms. With regard to milnacipran, a member of the SNRI family, dysuria occurs at a higher frequency than with TCAs or SSRIs. When side effects occur, clinicians give patients symptomatic treatment or substitute the drugs that cause the adverse effects with other antidepressants that have different pharmacological effects.
