32301387|t|Important perioperative factors, guidelines and outcomes in the management of hip fracture.
32301387|a|Hip fractures are common injuries in the elderly and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. There are multiple perioperative factors that must be considered when managing these patients. These include analgesia, timing of surgery, choice of operation, type of anaesthesia, postoperative complications and comorbidities. Guidelines from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the National Hip Fracture Database have been updated to reflect many of the above, but the importance of psychosocial factors is still emerging. This article focuses on the evidence for the key perioperative factors in hip fracture management and the tools available to predict hip fracture outcome.
