34289895|a|The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is a nidus for neurodegenerative pathologies and therefore an important region in which to study polypathology. We investigated associations between neurodegenerative pathologies and the thickness of different MTL subregions measured using high-resolution post-mortem MRI. Tau, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), amyloid-beta and alpha-synuclein pathology were rated on a scale of 0 (absent)-3 (severe) in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (ERC) of 58 individuals with and without neurodegenerative diseases (median age 75.0 years, 60.3% male). Thickness measurements in ERC, Brodmann Area (BA) 35 and 36, parahippocampal cortex, subiculum, cornu ammonis (CA)1 and the stratum radiatum lacunosum moleculare (SRLM) were derived from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 mm3 post-mortem MRI scans of excised MTL specimens from the contralateral hemisphere using a semi-automated approach. Spearman's rank correlations were performed between neurodegenerative pathologies and thickness, correcting for age, sex and hemisphere, including all four proteinopathies in the model. We found significant associations of (1) TDP-43 with thickness in all subregions (r =  - 0.27 to r =  - 0.46), and (2) tau with BA35 (r =  - 0.31) and SRLM thickness (r =  - 0.33). In amyloid-beta and TDP-43 negative cases, we found strong significant associations of tau with ERC (r =  - 0.40), BA35 (r =  - 0.55), subiculum (r =  - 0.42) and CA1 thickness (r =  - 0.47). This unique dataset shows widespread MTL atrophy in relation to TDP-43 pathology and atrophy in regions affected early in Braak stageing and tau pathology. Moreover, the strong association of tau with thickness in early Braak regions in the absence of amyloid-beta suggests a role of Primary Age-Related Tauopathy in neurodegeneration.
