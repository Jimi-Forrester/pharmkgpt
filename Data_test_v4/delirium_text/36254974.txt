36254974|a|Microglia, the main driver of neuroinflammation, play a central role in the initiation and exacerbation of various neurodegenerative diseases and are now considered a promising therapeutic target. Previous studies on in vitro human microglia and in vivo rodent models lacked scalability, consistency, or physiological relevance, which deterred successful therapeutic outcomes for the past decade. Here we review human blood monocyte-derived microglia-like cells as a robust and consistent approach to generate a patient-specific microglia-like model that can be used in extensive cohort studies for drug testing. We will highlight the strength and applicability of human blood monocyte-derived microglia-like cells to increase translational outcomes by reviewing the advantages of human blood monocyte-derived microglia-like cells in addressing patient heterogeneity and stratification, the basis of personalized medicine.
