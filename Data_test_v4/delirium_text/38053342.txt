38053342|t|Preclinical Study of Dual-Wavelength Light-Emitting Diode Therapy in an Osteoarthritis Rat Model.
38053342|a|Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of light-emitting diode (LED) and their dual-wavelengths as a treatment strategy for osteoarthritis. Methods: We induced osteoarthritis in male Sprague-Dawley rats by intra-articular injection of sodium iodoacetate into the right rear knee joint. The animals with lesions were divided into an untreated group and an LED-treated group (n=7 each). In the LED-treated group, the lesioned knee was irradiated with lasers (850 and 940 nm) and dose (3.15 J/cm2) for 20 minutes per session, twice a week for 4 weeks. Knee joint tissues were stained and scanned using an in vivo micro-computed tomography (CT) scanner. Serum interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-18 levels were determined using enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay. Several functional tests (lines crossed, rotational movement, rearing, and latency to remain rotating rod) were performed 24 hours before LED treatment and at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after treatment. Results: LED-treated rats showed improved locomotor function and suppressed matrix-degrading cytokines. Micro-CT images indicated that LED therapy had a preserving effect on cartilage and cortical bone. Conclusion: LED treatment using wavelengths of 850 and 940 nm resulted in significant functional, anatomical, and histologic improvements without adverse events in a rat model. Further research is required to determine the optimal wavelength, duration, and combination method, which will maximize treatment effectiveness.
