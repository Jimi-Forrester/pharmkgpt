30687139|t|Mitochondria, Microglia, and the Immune System-How Are They Linked in Affective Disorders?
30687139|a|Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe mood disorder and frequently associated with alterations of the immune system characterized by enhanced levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and microglia activation in the brain. Increasing evidence suggests that dysfunction of mitochondria may play a key role in the pathogenesis of MDD. Mitochondria are regulators of numerous cellular functions including energy metabolism, maintenance of redox and calcium homeostasis, and cell death and therefore modulate many facets of the innate immune response. In depression-like behavior of rodents, mitochondrial perturbation and release of mitochondrial components have been shown to boost cytokine production and neuroinflammation. On the other hand, pro-inflammatory cytokines may influence mitochondrial functions such as oxidative phosphorylation, production of adenosine triphosphate, and reactive oxygen species, thereby aggravating inflammation. There is strong interest in a better understanding of immunometabolic pathways in MDD that may serve as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. Here, we review the interaction between mitochondrial metabolism and innate immunity in the pathophysiology of MDD. We specifically focus on immunometabolic processes that govern microglial and peripheral myeloid cell functions, both cellular components involved in neuroinflammation in depression-like behavior. We finally discuss microglial polarization and associated metabolic states in depression-associated behavior and in MDD.
