38791953|t|The Crosstalk between Nerves and Cancer-A Poorly Understood Phenomenon and New Possibilities.
38791953|a|INTRODUCTION: Crosstalk occurs between nerve and cancer cells. These interactions are important for cancer homeostasis and metabolism. Nerve cells influence the tumor microenvironment (TME) and participate in metastasis through neurogenesis, neural extension, and axonogenesis. We summarized the past and current literature on the interaction between nerves and cancer, with a special focus on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), prostate cancer (PCa), and the role of the nerve growth factor (NGF) in cancer. MATERIALS/METHODS: We reviewed PubMed and Google Scholar for the relevant literature on the relationship between nerves, neurotrophins, and cancer in general and specifically for both PCa and PDAC. RESULTS: The NGF helped sustain cancer cell proliferation and evade immune defense. It is a neuropeptide involved in neurogenic inflammation through the activation of several cells of the immune system by several proinflammatory cytokines. Both PCa and PDAC employ different strategies to evade immune defense. The prostate is richly innervated by both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, which helps in both growth control and homeostasis. Newly formed autonomic nerve fibers grow into cancer cells and contribute to cancer initiation and progression through the activation of beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic signaling. Surgical or chemical sympathectomy prevents the development of prostate cancer. Beta-blockers have a high therapeutic potential for cancer, although current clinical data have been contradictory. With a better understanding of the beta-receptors, one could identify specific receptors that could have an effect on prostate cancer development or act as therapeutic agents. CONCLUSION: The bidirectional crosstalk between the nervous system and cancer cells has emerged as a crucial regulator of cancer and its microenvironment. Denervation has been shown to be promising in vitro and in animal models. Additionally, there is a potential relationship between cancer and psychosocial biology through neurotransmitters and neurotrophins.
