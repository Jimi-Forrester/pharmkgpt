23207484|t|Very old adults with better memory function have higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and lower triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratios: KOCOA Project.
23207484|a|We cross-sectionally examined which lipid profiles are associated with better cognitive function among those aged 80 and older, free of dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating <=0.5), functionally independent, and community-dwelling. Our cohort consisted of 193 participants from the "Keys to Optimal Cognitive Aging (KOCOA) Project", a prospective cohort study in Okinawa, Japan. Higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and lower triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratios were associated with higher scores in memory performance after controlling for confounders. Further research is required to clarify the associations among LDL-C levels, TG/HDL-C ratios, and healthy cognitive aging.
