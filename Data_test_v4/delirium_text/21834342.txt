21834342|a|In the summer, alcohol consumption increases and the number of those requiring rehabilitation peaks at the end of the holiday season. Treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms early enough helps the patient to break the drinking cycle. Treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms will also prevent complications, such as convulsions and alcoholic delirium. Untreated alcoholic delirium is a life-threatening condition. Treatment aims to calm down the hyperactivity state of the autonomous nervous system, and correct electrolyte and fluid balance disturbances. Initiation of rehabilitation is determined by the severity of the patient's withdrawal symptoms. Benzodiazepines are the first-line drugs.
