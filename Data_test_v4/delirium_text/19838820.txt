19838820|t|Microarray profile of brain aging-related genes in the frontal cortex of SAMP8.
19838820|a|This study examined the protein expression profile changes in the brain of senescence-accelerated mice/prone 8 (SAMP8) model. Two approaches, namely microarray and RT-PCR, were used in the study. Four genes, which are orthologous to human, were found to differentially express in the aging brain of mice. In this study, we examined the differentially expressed genes in the frontal cortex of the SAMP8 mice of two different ages (4 and 12 month old). Four orthologous genes (i.e., guanine nucleotide binding protein-alpha q polypeptide, kinesin family member 1B, sortilin 1, and somatostatin) showed significant changes in expression with aging. This study may provide important information on the mechanism of aging or aging-related diseases such as Alzheimer's diseases.
