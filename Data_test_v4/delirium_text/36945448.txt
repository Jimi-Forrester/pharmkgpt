36945448|a|INTRODUCTION: Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS) is an important component of combined dementia neuropathology. However, the temporal evolution of its histologically-defined features is unknown. We investigated pre-mortem longitudinal hippocampal atrophy associated with HS, as well as with other dementia-associated pathologies. METHODS: We analyzed hippocampal volumes from MRI segmentations in 64 dementia patients with longitudinal MRI follow-up and post-mortem neuropathological evaluation, including HS assessment in the hippocampal head and body. RESULTS: Significant HS-associated hippocampal volume changes were observed thoughout the evaluated timespan, up to 11.75 years before death. These changes were independent of age and Alzheimera$ s Disease (AD) burden, and specifically driven by CA1 and subiculum. AD burden, but not HS, significantly associated with the rate of hippocampal atrophy. DISCUSSION: HS-associated volume changes are detectable on MRI earlier than 10 years before death. These findings could contribute to the derivation of volumetric cut-offs for in vivo differentiation between HS and AD.
