38313900|t|Navigating Adherence: Unraveling Factors Shaping Opioid Substitution Therapy Compliance.
38313900|a|Background and objective In drug-deaddiction programs, dropout is a major problem in any drug de-addiction program, as dependence is a chronic illness known to relapse frequently. Understanding factors that predict dropout can help design targeted interventions to promote follow-up. This study aimed to assess the various sociodemographic characteristics of opioid-dependent subjects on buprenorphine maintenance treatment and dropping out at or before the three-month follow-up period. Method In this study, the sociodemographic characteristics and quality of life (QOL) of 34 opioid-dependent subjects (males, 32, 94%; females, 2, 6%) on the day of their enrolment in an opioid substitution therapy (OST) center were assessed, and a comparison of sociodemographic and drug use pattern was made between those who followed up and those who dropped out by the end of three months. Results Statistical analysis of the various sociodemographic characteristics using appropriate tests yielded that predictors of good follow-up are younger age (F = 4.57907, P = 0.04008), better education (F = 5.07221, P = 0.031305), and being part of a nuclear family. Longer follow-up was associated with shorter opioid intake duration (F = 8.58908, P = 0.006195). Better social relationships, as evidenced by the social relationship domain score of QOL, predicted longer follow-up (F = 8.58908, P = 0.006195). Other characteristics analyzed did not yield significant associations. Conclusions The study unveils the complexity of opioid addiction recovery, revealing the interplay of age, education, family, addiction duration, and support, shaping one's resilience in recovery.
