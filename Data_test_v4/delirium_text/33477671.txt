33477671|a|Access to renal transplantation guarantees a substantial improvement in the clinical condition and quality of life (QoL) for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. In recent years, a greater number of older patients starting renal replacement therapies (RRT) have shown the long-term impact of conservative therapies for advanced CKD and the consequences of the uremic milieu, with a frail clinical condition that impacts not only their survival but also limits their access to transplantation. This process, referred to as "inflammaging," might be reversible with a tailored approach, such as RRT accompanied by specific nutritional support. In this review, we summarize the evidence demonstrating the presence of several proinflammatory substances in the Western diet (WD) and the positive effect of unprocessed food consumption and increased fruit and vegetable intake, suggesting a new approach to reduce inflammaging with the improvement of ESRD clinical status. We conclude that the Mediterranean diet (MD), because of its modulative effects on microbiota and its anti-inflammaging properties, may be a cornerstone in a more precise nutritional support for patients on the waiting list for kidney transplantation.
