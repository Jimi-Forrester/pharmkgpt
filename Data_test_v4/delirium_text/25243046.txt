25243046|t|AMYLOID CLEARING IMMUNOTHERAPY FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND THE RISK OF CEREBRAL AMYLOID ANGIOPATHY.
25243046|a|Immunization strategies which aid in the clearance of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques have raised new hopes for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Two particularly promising passive immunization therapies currently being investigated include intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) containing Abeta antibodies and specifically developed monoclonal antibodies for Abeta. These Abeta antibodies may reduce amyloid accumulation in the brain by binding to the amyloid peptide and drawing it in through the blood-brain barrier for subsequent removal from the capillaries. However, as this strategy aims at removing extracellular amyloid through cerebral vessels, a redistribution of amyloid pathology may manifest as increased cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). CAA occurs when Abeta becomes embedded in the walls of cerebral vessels associated with weakening of the vessel walls. Antibody mediated Abeta clearance from the parenchyma could significantly increase the Abeta burden in the vessel lumen and wall, therefore increasing the risk of vessel rupture and hemorrhage. This chapter will review the current literature on Abeta immunotherapy for AD and explore the mechanisms as well as possible risks of amyloid clearance treatment, particularly cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
