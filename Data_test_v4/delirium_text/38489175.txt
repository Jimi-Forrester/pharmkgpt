38489175|a|Background: The cholinergic neuronal loss in the basal forebrain and increasing brain oxidative stress are one of the main features of the brain suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Marrubium vulgare (M. vulgare), commonly known as 'white horehound,' possesses a variety of valuable properties, such as antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic activities. Moreover, it possesses neuromodulatory properties that could potentially impact short-term memory functions. Objective: The present study was undertaken to investigate the preventive effects of water M. vulgare extract on working memory, cholinergic neurotransmission, and oxidative stress in rats with scopolamine (Sco)-induced dementia. Methods: Male Wistar rats (200-250 g) were divided into four experimental groups. The plant extract was administered orally for 21 days, and Sco (2 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally for 11 consecutive days. The behavioral performance of the animals was evaluated by the T-maze test. The effect of the extract on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and antioxidant status in cortex and hippocampus were also monitored. Results: Our experimental data revealed that treatment with M. vulgare significantly increased the percentage of correct choices of rats with Sco-induced dementia in the T maze test (by 38%, p < 0.05). Additionally, it reduced AChE activity in the hippocampus (by 20%, p < 0.05) and alleviated oxidative stress induced by Sco, particularly in the cortex. Conclusions: M. vulgare water extract demonstrated working memory preserving effect in rats with Sco-induced dementia, AChE inhibitory activity and in vivo antioxidant potential, and deserve further attention.
