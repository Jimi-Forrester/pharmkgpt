23666177|t|The development of an in vivo gamma-secretase assay using zebrafish embryos.
23666177|a|Aberrant proteolytic processing of amyloid-beta protein precursor by gamma-secretase complexes may result in an imbalance between production and clearance of the Abeta proteolytic product and promote neuronal dysfunction and death. Presenilin proteins form the catalytic core of gamma-secretase complexes. The zebrafish, Danio rerio, is a versatile vertebrate model for investigating the molecular basis of Alzheimer's disease pathology. It possesses genes orthologous to human PSEN1 and PSEN2 (psen1 and psen2 respectively), and AbetaPP (appa and appb that are duplicates of an ancestral AbetaPP orthologue). Currently there is no in vivo assay appropriate for directly monitoring gamma-secretase activity. Here, we describe such an assay in which the level of a gamma-secretase substrate (a modified form of Appa protein) is observed in zebrafish embryos by western immunoblotting relative to a co-expressed protein not subject to gamma-secretase activity. We have used the assay to analyze the effects on gamma-secretase activity of blocking translation of transcripts of zebrafish psen1 and/or psen2.
