36819306|t|Adverse Drug Interaction Between Kratom and Amitriptyline With Gastrointestinal and Mild Hepatic Effects.
36819306|a|Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia, where it has been used historically for its various psychoactive and analgesic properties. In recent years, the popularity of kratom has surged in the United States as a supplement for treating opioid withdrawal/addiction, anxiety, depression, and chronic pain, among others. However, much of Kratom processing and sales remain largely unregulated, with little clinical research to demonstrate the effects of kratom on physiologic processes such as potential drug interactions. Here, we present a case of Kratom interaction with Amitriptyline in a patient recovering from Opioid Use Disorder.
