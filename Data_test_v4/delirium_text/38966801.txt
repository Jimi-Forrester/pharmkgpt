38966801|a|The molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain uncharacterized. Here, we identify genes, molecular pathways and cellular components associated with whole-brain dysregulation caused by amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau deposits in the living human brain. We obtained in-vivo resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), Abeta- and tau-PET for 47 cognitively unimpaired and 16 AD participants from the Translational Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia cohort. Adverse neuronal activity impacts by Abeta and tau were quantified with personalized dynamical models by fitting pathology-mediated computational signals to the participant's real rs-fMRIs. Then, we detected robust brain-wide associations between the spatial profiles of Abeta-tau impacts and gene expression in the neurotypical transcriptome (Allen Human Brain Atlas). Within the obtained distinctive signature of in-vivo neuronal dysfunction, several genes have prominent roles in microglial activation and in interactions with Abeta and tau. Moreover, cellular vulnerability estimations revealed strong association of microglial expression patterns with Abeta and tau's synergistic impact on neuronal activity (q < 0.001). These results further support the central role of the immune system and neuroinflammatory pathways in AD pathogenesis. Neuronal dysregulation by AD pathologies also associated with neurotypical synaptic and developmental processes. In addition, we identified drug candidates from the vast LINCS library to halt or reduce the observed Abeta-tau effects on neuronal activity. Top-ranked pharmacological interventions target inflammatory, cancer and cardiovascular pathways, including specific medications undergoing clinical evaluation in AD. Our findings, based on the examination of molecular-pathological-functional interactions in humans, may accelerate the process of bringing effective therapies into clinical practice.
