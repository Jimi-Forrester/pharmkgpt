33289701|t|Predicting the outcome of non-pharmacological treatment for patients with dementia-related mild cognitive impairment.
33289701|a|Dementia is a progressive cognitive syndrome, with few effective pharmacological treatments that can slow its progress. Hence, non-pharmacological treatments (NPTs) play an important role in improving patient symptoms and quality of life. Designing the optimal personalised NPT strategy relies on objectively and quantitatively predicting the treatment outcome. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) findings can reflect the cognitive status of patients with dementia, and thus potentially predict NPT outcome. In the present study, 16 participants with cognitive impairment underwent NPT for several months. Their cognitive performance was evaluated based on the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive at the beginning and end of the NPT period, while resting-state brain activity was evaluated using MEG during the NPT period. Our results showed that the spectral properties of MEG signals predicted the changes in cognitive performance scores. High frequency oscillatory intensity at the right superior frontal gyrus medial segment, opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus, triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus, post central gyrus, and angular gyrus predicted the changes in cognitive performance scores. Thus, resting-state brain activity may be a powerful tool in designing personalised NPT.
