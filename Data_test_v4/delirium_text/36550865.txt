36550865|t|Risk factors and long-term prognosis for postoperative hypoxemia in patients with acute type A aortic dissection: A retrospective observational study.
36550865|a|Hypoxemia is 1 of the most common complications in the patients with acute Type A aortic dissection (ATAAD). This study aimed to summarize the risk factors, management strategies and long-term prognosis for postoperative hypoxemia in ATAAD patients. Baseline characteristics and clinical data of all the patients were collected. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the PaO2/FiO2 after surgery: Hypoxemia group (n = 142) and Non-hypoxemia group (n = 68). The differences in gender, age, body mass index, operation time, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time, aortic cross-clamping time, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest time, preoperative PaO2/FiO2, postoperative PaO2/FiO2, PaO2/FiO2 before extubating, time of mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit stay, length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, and overall mortality were compared between the 2 groups. The incidence of postoperative hypoxemia in this study was 67.6% (142/210). body mass index (26.4 +- 3.8 vs 24.4 +- 3.3kg/m2, P < .001) in the hypoxemia group were markedly higher and CPB time (196.3 +- 41.0 vs 181.0 +- 37.3 minutes, P = .010) in the hypoxemia group were significantly longer than those in the non-hypoxemia group. While preoperative PaO2/FiO2 (229.7 +- 91.4 vs 299.7 +- 101.2mmHg, P < .001) was significantly lower than those in the non-hypoxemia group. In the hypoxemia group, PaO2/FiO2 before extubating was significantly higher than that after operation, and the difference was significant. Logistic regression analysis showed that overweight (odds ratio [OR]: 1.113, P = .030), CPB time (OR: 1.009, P = .043) and preoperative PaO2/FiO2 (OR: 0.994, P = .001) were independent risk factors for postoperative hypoxemia. Further follow-up results showed no significant difference in long-term mortality between the 2 groups. Logistic regression analysis revealed that PaO2/FiO2 before extubating (OR: 0.985, P < .001), paraplegia (OR: 10.994, P = .019), acute renal failure (OR: 12.590, P < .001), re-operation (OR: 4.721, P = .014) and re-admission to intensive care unit (OR: 13.727, P = .001) were independent risk factors for long-term mortality. Our results showed that overweight and prolonged CPB time were risk factors for postoperative hypoxemia in ATAAD patients. While PaO2/FiO2 before extubating were independent risk factors for long-term mortality, indicating that active correction of hypoxemia and maintain a higher PaO2/FiO2 before extubating may help to improve the prognosis of the ATAAD patients.
