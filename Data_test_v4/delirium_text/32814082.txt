32814082|t|Erythrocytes as markers of oxidative stress related pathologies.
32814082|a|Erythrocytes are deeply sensitive cells and important health indicators. During inflammatory response RBC, as a part of haematological system, are exposed to circulating inflammatory mediators and related oxidative stress. They present a highly specialized and organized cell membrane that interacts with inflammatory mediators and oxidative agents, leading to a variety of structural changes that promptly signal an abnormal situation. This review is aimed to provide an overview on erythrocyte involvement in physiological and pathological processes related to oxidative stress, such as aging, Down syndrome, neurodegenerative diseases, for instance Alzheimer Disease, erectile dysfunction and cardiovascular diseases. In particular this review will focus on the effects of oxidative stress on structural changes in the cell membrane and also on in the activity of erythrocyte enzymes such as membrane-bound, cytosolic glycohydrolases and RBC-eNOS. This review also underlines the potential clinical application of erythrocyte specific related parameters, which can be important tools not only for the study but also for the monitoring of several oxidative stress related diseases.
