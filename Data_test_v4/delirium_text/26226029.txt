26226029|t|A Phase 1c Trial Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of a New Aqueous Formulation of Alphaxalone with Propofol.
26226029|a|BACKGROUND: Phaxan  (PHAX, Chemic Labs, Canton, MA) is an aqueous solution of 10 mg/mL alphaxalone and 13% 7-sulfobutylether beta-cyclodextrin (betadex). In preclinical studies, PHAX is a fast onset-offset IV anesthetic like propofol, but causes less cardiovascular depression. This first-in-man study was designed to find the anesthetic dose of PHAX and to compare it with an equivalent dose of propofol for safety, efficacy, and quality of recovery from anesthesia and sedation. METHODS: The study adhered to compliance with Good Clinical Practices regulations (clinical trials registry number, ACTRN12611000343909). This randomized, double-blind study compared PHAX and propofol using a Bayesian algorithm to determine dose equivalence for effects on the bispectral index (BIS). Male volunteers, ASA physical status I, gave written informed consent (n = 12 per group; PHAX or propofol). Parameters assessed for 80 minutes after drug injection (single bolus dose) were pain on injection, involuntary movement, BIS, blood pressure, need for airway support, and, as measures of recovery from sedation, the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Arterial blood was withdrawn for biochemistry, hematology, and complement levels. RESULTS: No subject complained of pain on injection with PHAX, whereas 8 of the 12 subjects given propofol did. Nine PHAX and 8 propofol subjects reached BIS values of <=50: median (interquartile range [IQR]) mg/kg dose = 0.5 (0.5-0.6) for PHAX and 2.9 (2.4-3.0) for propofol. The lowest median BIS reached was 27 to 28 for both agents with no significant differences between them for timing of onset and recovery of BIS. The concomitant median changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures were -11% vs -19% for systolic and -25% vs -37% for diastolic in PHAX- and propofol-treated subjects, respectively. Nine of the 12 propofol-treated subjects and none of 12 PHAX-treated subjects required airway support. For subjects reaching an equivalent BIS of <=50: a Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale score of 0 was reached at a median of 5 (IQR, 5-10) and 15 (IQR, 10-20) minutes after PHAX and propofol, respectively; BIS returned to 90 at a mean of 21 (SD, 10.1) and 21 (SD, 9.2) minutes after PHAX and propofol, respectively; and Digit Symbol Substitution Test scores returned to predrug injection values at median of 50 (IQR, 35-72.5) and 42.5 (IQR, 35-76.3) minutes after PHAX and propofol, respectively. There was no increase in C3 and C4 complement fractions after either drug. CONCLUSIONS: PHAX causes fast-onset, short-duration anesthesia with fast cognitive recovery similar to propofol, but with less cardiovascular depression, or airway obstruction and no pain on injection.
