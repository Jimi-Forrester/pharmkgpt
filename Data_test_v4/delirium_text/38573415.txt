38573415|t|Amygdala-Targeted Relief of Neuropathic Pain: Efficacy of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in NLRP3 Pathway Suppression.
38573415|a|This study investigates the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a nonpharmacological approach to treating neuropathic pain (NP), a major challenge in clinical research. Conducted on male Sprague-Dawley rats with NP induced through chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve, the research assessed pain behaviors and the impact of rTMS on molecular interactions within the amygdala. Through a comprehensive analysis involving Mechanical Withdrawal Threshold (MWT), Thermal Withdrawal Latency (TWL), RNA transcriptome sequencing, RT-qPCR, Western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), the study focused on the expression and interaction of integrin alphavbeta3 and its receptor P2X7R. Findings reveal that rTMS significantly influences the expression of integrin alphavbeta3 in NP models, suggesting an inhibition of the NP-associated NLRP3 inflammatory pathway through the disruption of integrin alphavbeta3-P2X7R interactions. These outcomes highlight the potential of rTMS in alleviating NP by targeting molecular interactions within the amygdala, offering a promising therapeutic avenue for managing NP.
