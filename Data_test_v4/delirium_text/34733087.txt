34733087|t|The Gut-Brain Axis: Literature Overview and Psychiatric Applications.
34733087|a|IMPORTANCE: Literature exploring the relationship between the intestinal microbiome and its effects on general health and well-being has grown significantly in recent years, and our knowledge of this subject continues to grow. Mounting evidence indicates that the intestinal microbiome is a potential target for therapeutic intervention in psychiatric illness and in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease. It is reasonable to consider modulating not just a patient's neurochemistry, behavior, or cognitive habits, but also their intestinal microbiome in an effort to improve psychiatric symptoms. OBSERVATIONS: In this review paper, we show that intestinal microbiota possess the ability to directly influence both physical and mental well-being; therefore, should be included in future discussions regarding psychiatric treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians are encouraged to consider patients' gut health when evaluating and treating psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety and depression. Optimization and diversification of gut flora through the use of psychobiotics-probiotics that confer mental health benefits-may soon become standard practice in conjunction with traditional psychiatric treatment modalities such as pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.
