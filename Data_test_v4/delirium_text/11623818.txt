11623818|t|Morphine withdrawal, treatments 1900-30.
11623818|a|The treatments used between 1900 and 1930 for morphine withdrawal are discussed. The accounts are mainly taken from contemporary textbooks which contain fascinating descriptions of their authors' preferred methods and criticisms of regimes given by other therapists. Delirium, produced by atropine or similar substances, is advocated to cover withdrawal symptoms. The present paper draws parallels with current issues, e.g. withdrawal of opiate under cover of general anaesthesia, follow-up studies and cost-benefit analyses. The particular problems of addicted doctors in 1900-1930 are addressed as are the comparisons then made with non-medically qualified addicts. It is important we keep in mind past mistakes and over-valued ideas so as to reduce any similarly misplaced optimism in our current treatment options.
