30101061|t|Functional and structural connectivity of the amygdala underpins locus of control in mild cognitive impairment.
30101061|a|Locus of control (LOC) is an important personality trait. LOC over cognitive competency reflects an individual's perceived control of desired cognitive outcomes, which is critical for maintaining successful cognitive aging. It is important to understand the neural substrates of LOC over cognitive competency in older adults, especially for individuals at high risk of dementia. Here, we characterized a cohesive functional and structural connectivity profile underlying LOC among 55 older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), combining resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. The results showed that both functional and structural connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala were significantly correlated with external LOC. The functional connectivity mediated the correlation between structural connectivity and external LOC. In addition, aging-associated neurodegeneration moderated the relationship between structural connectivity and external LOC, showing that the structural connectivity was positively correlated with external LOC in low, but not high neurodegeneration. Our results suggest a critical role of the functional amygdala-frontal network, which may serve as a bridge between its white matter tract and LOC over cognitive competency in groups at high risk for dementia.
