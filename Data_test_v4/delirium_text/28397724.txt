28397724|t|Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms: Retrospective Analysis of 104 Cases over One Decade.
28397724|a|BACKGROUND: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a severe, life-threatening disorder caused by drugs. In the present study, we tried to explore the types of DRESS-inducing drugs, incubation period, features of skin rashes, accompanying visceral damage, and effectiveness of glucocorticoid therapy so as to inform clinical practice. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with a drug-induced rash, dermatitis, and DRESS admitted to our hospital from January 2006 to December 2015 were included in the study. The diagnosis followed the criteria and scoring system set by the European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS version 17.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA), and a value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Among 104 patients, 38 were male and 66 female (aged 18-83 years). The latent period was 13 (interquartile range [IQR]: 10-17) days. The most common allergy-inducing drugs were antibiotics (n = 37, 35.6%), followed by antiepileptic drugs and traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). Eighty-two cases (78.8%) had rash with area >50% body surface area (BSA). Liver damage occurred in 90% of cases. Patients were divided into oral antihistamine group and glucocorticoid/immunosuppressive agent/intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) group. Sex, age, incubation period, duration of hospital stay, and the number of patients with body temperature >=38.5 C were not significantly different between the two groups. However, the number of patients meeting the criteria of "definite" and "probable" (chi2 = 5.852, P = 0.016), with an eosinophilic granulocyte count of >=1.5 x 109/L (chi2 = 7.129, P = 0.008), and with rash area of >50% BSA (chi2 = 4.750, P = 0.029), was significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics were associated with allergic reactions, but TCMs also had an important role. Allergy resulting from repeat use of the same drug was more severe with a shorter incubation period. The most typical rash was widespread erythematous papules. Liver damage accounted for >90% of cases.
