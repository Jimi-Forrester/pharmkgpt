36159685|t|Mn3+/Mn4+ ion-doped carbon dots as fenton-like catalysts for fluorescence dual-signal detection of dopamine.
36159685|a|Carbon dots (CDs), a new zero-dimensional material, have ignited a revolution in the fields of sensing, bioimaging, and biomedicine. However, the difficulty of preparing CDs with Fenton-like catalytic properties has seriously hindered their application in the diagnosis of oxidation/reduction biomolecules or metal ions. Here, an innovative method was successfully established to synthesize Mn3+/Mn4+ ion-doped blue-green fluorescent CDs with Fenton-like catalytic properties using manganese acetate as the manganese source. Specifically, the CDs prepared here were equipped with functional groups of -COOH, NH2, C=O, and Mn-O, offering the possibility to function as a fluorescence sensor. More importantly, the introduction of manganese acetate resulted in the preparation of CDs with Fenton-like catalytic properties, and the dual-signal fluorescence detection of dopamine (DA) was realized with linear ranges of 100-275 nM and 325-525 nM, and the detection limits were 3 and 12 nM, respectively. In addition, due to the Fenton-like catalytic activity of Mn3+/Mn4+ ion-doped CDs, the material has broad application prospects in the detection of oxidation/reduction biomolecules or metal ions related to disease diagnosis and prevention.
