35243650|t|Editorial: Honouring John Hardy - A true pioneer in research.
35243650|a|This Editorial highlights the knighthood recognition of Sir John Hardy, Professor and Chair at the University College London, for his exceptional services to human health and dementia research. We also celebrate his successful trajectory in neurochemistry and neurogenetics, and acknowledge his long-standing contributions to the Journal of Neurochemistry as an author and editor. John Hardy's research identified key mutations linked to prevalent neurodegenerative diseases in humans and contributed to our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. As John's career has inspired many generations of researchers in neurochemistry, we present a brief Q&A interview with him on the occasion of his most recent recognition.
