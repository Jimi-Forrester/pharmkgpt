Pre-existing cognitive impairment is a predictor of POD. COVID-19 restricted use of in-person cognitive screens. The Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment (T-MoCA) can screen for cognitive dysfunction remotely. We evaluated the feasibility of administering T-MoCA in a multiethnic population during pre-operative testing televisits. Methods: Patients scheduled for surgery between July 2020 and August 2020 were asked to participate in the T-MoCA at the end of their preadmission testing (PAT) televisit. A retrospective chart review was conducted to collect patient comorbidities and demographics. Patients were stratified by negative (T-MoCA>=19) or positive (T-MoCA<19) for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and compared using 2-tailed chi2-tests. Univariate logistic regression was used to identify associations between patient characteristics and positive T-MoCA result. Results: Fifty out of 65 (77%) patients who consented to the T-MoCA completed the test. The average time to complete the assessment was 10.5 mins. Twenty two (44%) had a negative score and 28 (56%) had a positive score. Patients who had a positive T-MoCA were older (70.04+-7.61 yrs) compared to those with a negative T-MoCA (67.68+-4.69 yrs, p=0.007), although the distribution of patients above and below age 65 was not different (p=0.243). The two groups did not vary by gender, race/ethnicity, obesity, surgery type, or medical co-morbidities. When we examined our population for predictors of a positive T-MoCA, we found a trend toward men being less likely to score positive on T-MoCA (OR=0.33, 95% CI: 0.10-1.10, p=0.07) compared to women; and that patients with Hispanic race/ethnicity were more likely to test positive on the T-MoCA (OR=4.13, 95% CI: 0.84-20.28, p=0.08) compared to Non-Hispanic Whites. Conclusions: Implementation of the T-MoCA in a telemedicine-based PAT setting is feasible. In our cohort, most people who consented to the assessment completed it, and more than half scored positively, which may have important implications on the surgical plan and post-operative recovery. There may be limitations in using T-MoCA in certain populations, such as non-English preferred language, hearing difficulties, lack of focus, and use of external aids, which would need to be explored in a larger sample size.
