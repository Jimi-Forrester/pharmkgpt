10336891|a|The levels of mitochondrial DNA 4977 bp deletion (mtDNA4977) and mitochondrial DNA 8'-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (OH8dG) were determined in the same samples from two brain areas of healthy subjects and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. A positive correlation between the age-related increases of mtDNA4977 and of OH8dG levels was found in the brain of healthy individuals. On the contrary, in both brain areas of AD patients, mtDNA4977 levels were very low in the presence of high OH8dG amounts. These results might be explained assuming that the increase of OH8dG above a threshold level, as in AD patients, implies consequences for mtDNA replication and neuronal cell survival.
