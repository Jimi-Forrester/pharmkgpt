20601643|t|Current therapies and new strategies for the management of Alzheimer's disease.
20601643|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that currently affects millions of Americans. There is no cure at present and no real long-term hope for patients with AD. While partially effective in improving symptoms, currently available treatments approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) do not halt progression of AD, or address the underlying mechanism of the disease, in part because the etiology of AD is still an active area of investigation. Identification of risk factors and the pathogenic mechanism of AD hold the promise of bringing forth novel treatments and perhaps even a cure. In this review, we will summarize some of the risk factors for AD, AD diagnosis, and current treatments. Novel therapeutic strategies such as inhibition of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta), tau-mediated pathogenesis, and receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), as well as neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory approaches and the impact of cholesterol-lowering, botanical, and nutritional agents are also reviewed.
