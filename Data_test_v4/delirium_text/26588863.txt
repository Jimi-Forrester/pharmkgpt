26588863|a|INTRODUCTION: Individualized estimates of age at detectable amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation, distinct from amyloid positivity, allow for analysis of onset age of Abeta accumulation as an outcome measure to understand risk factors. METHODS: Using longitudinal Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography data from Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, we estimated the age at which each PiB+ individual began accumulating Abeta. We used survival analysis methods to quantify risk of accumulating Abeta and differences in onset age of Abeta accumulation in relation to APOE epsilon4 status and sex among 36 APOE epsilon4 carriers and 83 noncarriers. RESULTS: Age at onset of Abeta accumulation for the APOE epsilon4- and epsilon4+ groups was 73.1 and 60.7, respectively. APOE epsilon4 positivity conferred a threefold risk of accumulating Abeta after adjusting for sex and education. DISCUSSION: Estimation of onset age of amyloid accumulation may help gauge treatment efficacy in interventions to delay symptom onset in Alzheimer's disease.
