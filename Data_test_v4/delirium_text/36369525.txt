36369525|t|Development of microglia-targeting adeno-associated viral vectors as tools to study microglial behavior in vivo.
36369525|a|Here we describe the microglia-targeting adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors containing a 1.7-kb putative promoter region of microglia/macrophage-specific ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1), along with repeated miRNA target sites for microRNA (miR)-9 and miR-129-2-3p. The 1.7-kb genomic sequence upstream of the start codon in exon 1 of the Iba1 (Aif1) gene, functions as microglia preferential promoter in the striatum and cerebellum. Furthermore, ectopic transgene expression in non-microglial cells is markedly suppressed upon adding two sets of 4-repeated miRNA target sites for miR-9 and miR-129-2-3p, which are expressed exclusively in non-microglial cells and sponged AAV-derived mRNAs. Our vectors transduced ramified microglia in healthy tissues and reactive microglia in lipopolysaccharide-treated mice and a mouse model of neurodegenerative disease. Moreover, live fluorescent imaging allowed the monitoring of microglial motility and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. Thus, microglia-targeting AAV vectors are valuable for studying microglial pathophysiology and therapies, particularly in the striatum and cerebellum.
