35010632|t|Dietary Acid Load, Serum Polychlorinated Biphenyl Levels, and Mortality Following Breast Cancer in the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project.
35010632|a|Dietary acid load (DAL) may be associated with all-cause mortality (ACM) and breast cancer-specific mortality (BCM), and these associations may be modified by serum polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels. Participants included 519 women diagnosed with first primary in situ or invasive breast cancer in 1996/1997 with available lipid-corrected PCB data. After a median of 17 years, there were 217 deaths (73 BCM). Potential renal acid load (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP) scores calculated from a baseline food frequency questionnaire estimated DAL. Cox regression estimated covariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between PRAL and NEAP with mortality. We evaluated effect measure modification by total serum PCB levels (>median vs. <=median). PRAL quartile 4 versus quartile 1 was associated with an ACM HR of 1.31 (95%CI = 0.90-1.92). In the upper median of PCBs, ACM HRs were 1.43 (95%CI = 0.96-2.11) and 1.40 (95%CI = 0.94-2.07) for PRAL and NEAP upper medians, respectively. In the lower median of PCBs, the upper median of NEAP was inversely associated with BCM (HR = 0.40, 95%CI = 0.19-0.85). DAL may be associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality following breast cancer among women with high total serum PCB levels, but inversely associated with breast cancer mortality among women with low PCB levels.
