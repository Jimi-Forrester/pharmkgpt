38258907|a|The use of senolytic agents to remove senescent cells from atherosclerotic lesions is controversial. A common limitation of previous studies is the failure to rigorously define the effects of senolytic agent ABT-263 (Navitoclax) on smooth muscle cells (SMC) despite studies claiming that these cells are the major source of senescent cells. Moreover, there are no studies on the effect of ABT-263 on endothelial cells (EC), which - along with SMC - comprise 90% of alpha-smooth muscle actin+ (alpha-SMA+) myofibroblast-like cells in the protective fibrous cap. Here we tested the hypothesis that treatment of advanced atherosclerotic mice with ABT-263 will reduce lesion size and increase plaque stability. SMC (Myh11-CreERT2-eYFP) and EC (Cdh5-CreERT2-eYFP) lineage tracing Apoe-/- mice were fed a western diet (WD) for 18 weeks, followed by ABT-263 at 100 mg/kg/bw for 6 weeks or 50 mg/kg/bw for 9 weeks. ABT-263 treatment did not change lesion size or lumen area of the brachiocephalic artery (BCA). However, ABT-263 treatment reduced SMC by 90% and increased EC contributions to lesions via EC-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) by 60%. ABT-263 treatment also reduced alpha-SMA+ fibrous cap thickness by 60% and was associated with a > 50% mortality rate. Taken together, ABT-263 treatment of WD-fed Apoe-/- mice with advanced lesions resulted in multiple detrimental changes, including reduced indices of stability and increased mortality.
