37809219|t|The Catastrophic Effects of Psychogenic Polydipsia: A Case Report.
37809219|a|Patients with hyponatremia are at risk of severe complications including seizures, coma, and death. Psychiatric patients are particularly susceptible to death from hyponatremia due to the association between psychiatric conditions and psychogenic polydipsia, characterized by water intoxication. We report a case of a schizophrenic patient who presented with altered mental status, leading to a differential diagnosis narrowed through clinical investigations to include hypovolemic hyponatremia, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), and psychogenic polydipsia. This case underscores the need to inquire about schizophrenic patients' water intake, advocating for a standardized approach. The timely diagnosis of disorders causing electrolyte abnormalities can prevent severe complications and aid in the management of psychiatric patients.
