33217260|t|Delirium Associated with Salicylate and Acetaminophen Overdose in a Patient with COVID-19: A Case Report.
33217260|a|INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created numerous clinical challenges for physicians, in part due to its wide range of clinical manifestations and associated complications. CASE REPORT: Here we present the case of a 69-year-old man who was admitted to the emergency department with fever, dyspnea, and altered mental status. We believe the patient's condition was precipitated by a COVID-19 infection-induced delirium, a setting in which he ingested aspirin and acetaminophen in overdose that required lifesaving interventions. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the potential for neuropsychiatric effects in COVID-19 patients due to both direct viral central nervous system pathology and pandemic-related psychosocial stressors.
