36338523|a|The uncontrolled and metastatic nature of cancer makes it worse and more unpredictable. Hence, many therapy and medication are used to control and treat cancer. However, apart from this, many medications cause various side effects. In America, nearly 8% of patients admitted to the hospital are due to side effects. Cancer is more seen in people residing in developed countries related of their lifestyle. There are various phytoconstituents molecules in which resveratrol (RSV) is the best-fitted molecule for cancer due to its significantly less adverse effect on the body. RSV inhibits the initiation and progression of cell proliferation due to the modulation of various pathways like the phosphoinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. RSV downgraded cell cycle-regulated proteins like cyclin E, cyclin D1, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and induced the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, causing apoptosis or programmed cell death (PCD). A great benefit comes with some challenges, hence, RSV does suffer from poor solubility in water i.e. 0.05 mg/mL. It suffers from poor bioavailability due to being highly metabolized by the liver and intestine. Surprisingly, RSV metabolites also induce the metabolism of RSV. Hence, significantly less amount of RSV presented in the urine in the unchanged form. Due to some challenges like poor bioavailability, less aqueous solubility, and retention time in the body, researchers concluded to make the nanocarriers for better delivery. Adopting the technique of nano-formulations, increased topical penetration by up to 21%, improved nano-encapsulation and consequently improved bioavailability and permeability by many folds. Hence, the present review describes the complete profile of RSV and its nano-formulations for improving anti-cancer activity along with a patent survey.
