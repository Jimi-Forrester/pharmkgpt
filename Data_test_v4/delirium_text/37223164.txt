37223164|t|Delirium-Induced Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.
37223164|a|An 85-year-old woman presented with altered mental status and appeared to be actively agitated due to her medications. During her hospitalization, troponins trended up and an electrocardiogram (ECG) showed diffuse ST elevation. Echocardiogram showed an estimated ejection fraction of 40% with hypokinesis of the apex, suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. After several days of supportive care, the patient showed significant clinical improvement with normalization of ECG, cardiac enzymes, and echocardiographic findings. Although Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has been associated with diverse forms of physical or emotional stress, this report discusses a rare case of delirium state causing Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
