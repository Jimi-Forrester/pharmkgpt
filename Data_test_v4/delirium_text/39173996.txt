39173996|a|Repurposing antidiabetic drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. This review examines the potential of repurposing antidiabetic drugs for AD treatment, focusing on preclinical evidence, clinical trials, and observational studies. In addition, the review aims to explore challenges and opportunities in repurposing antidiabetic drugs for AD, emphasizing the importance of well-designed clinical trials that consider patient selection criteria, refined outcome measures, adverse effects, and combination therapies to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Preclinical evidence suggests that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors, metformin, thiazolidinediones, and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors exhibit neuroprotective effects in AD preclinical models. In preclinical studies, antidiabetic drugs have demonstrated neuroprotective effects by reducing amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques, tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairment. Antidiabetic drug classes, notably GLP-1 analogs and SGLT2 inhibitors, and a reduced risk of dementia in patients with diabetes mellitus. While the evidence for DPP4 inhibitors is mixed, some studies suggest a potential protective effect. On the other hand, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) and sulfonylureas may potentially increase the risk, especially in those experiencing recurrent hypoglycemic events. Repurposing antidiabetic drugs for AD is a promising therapeutic strategy, but challenges such as disease heterogeneity, limited biomarkers, and benefits versus risk evaluation need to be addressed. Ongoing clinical trials in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD patients without diabetes will be crucial in determining the clinical efficacy and safety of the antidiabetic drugs, paving the way for potential treatments for AD.
