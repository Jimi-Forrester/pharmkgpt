38560278|t|Variations in Electronic Health Record-Based Definitions of Diabetic Retinopathy Cohorts: A Literature Review and Quantitative Analysis.
38560278|a|Purpose: Use of the electronic health record (EHR) has motivated the need for data standardization. A gap in knowledge exists regarding variations in existing terminologies for defining diabetic retinopathy (DR) cohorts. This study aimed to review the literature and analyze variations regarding codified definitions of DR. Design: Literature review and quantitative analysis. Subjects: Published manuscripts. Methods: Four graders reviewed PubMed and Google Scholar for peer-reviewed studies. Studies were included if they used codified definitions of DR (e.g., billing codes). Data elements such as author names, publication year, purpose, data set type, and DR definitions were manually extracted. Each study was reviewed by >= 2 authors to validate inclusion eligibility. Quantitative analyses of the codified definitions were then performed to characterize the variation between DR cohort definitions. Main Outcome Measures: Number of studies included and numeric counts of billing codes used to define codified cohorts. Results: In total, 43 studies met the inclusion criteria. Half of the included studies used datasets based on structured EHR data (i.e., data registries, institutional EHR review), and half used claims data. All but 1 of the studies used billing codes such as the International Classification of Diseases 9th or 10th edition (ICD-9 or ICD-10), either alone or in addition to another terminology for defining disease. Of the 27 included studies that used ICD-9 and the 20 studies that used ICD-10 codes, the most common codes used pertained to the full spectrum of DR severity. Diabetic retinopathy complications (e.g., vitreous hemorrhage) were also used to define some DR cohorts. Conclusions: Substantial variations exist among codified definitions for DR cohorts within retrospective studies. Variable definitions may limit generalizability and reproducibility of retrospective studies. More work is needed to standardize disease cohorts.
