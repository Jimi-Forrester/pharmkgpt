30529024|a|It has been suggested that exercise training and probiotic supplementation could decelerate the progress of functional and biochemical deterioration in APP/PS1 transgenic mice (APP/PS1TG). APP/PS1TG mice were subjected to exercise training and probiotic treatments and functional, biochemical and microbiome markers were analyzed. Under these conditions the mice significantly outperformed controls on The Morris Maze Test, and the number of beta-amyloid plaques decreased in the hippocampus. B. thetaiotaomicron levels correlated highly with the results of the Morris Maze Test (p < 0.05), and this group of bacteria was significantly elevated in the microbiome of the APP/PS1TG mice compared to the wild type. L. johnsonii levels positively correlated with the beta amyloid content and area. Data revealed that exercise and probiotic treatment can decrease the progress of Alzheimer's Disease and the beneficial effects could be partly mediated by alteration of the microbiome.
