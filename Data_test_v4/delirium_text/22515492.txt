22515492|a|It is already known that progressive degeneration of cholinergic neurons in brain areas such as the hippocampus and the cortex leads to memory deficits, as observed in Alzheimer's disease. This work verified the effects of the infusion of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide associated to an attentional rehearsal on the density of alpha7 nicotinic cholinergic receptor (nAChR) in the brain of male Wistar rats. Animals received intracerebroventricular infusion of Abeta or vehicle (control - C) and their attention was stimulated weekly (Stimulated Abeta group: S-Abeta and Stimulated Control group: SC) or not (Non- Stimulated Abeta group: N-SAbeta and Non-Stimulated Control group: N-SC), using an active avoidance apparatus. Conditioned avoidance responses (CAR) were registered. Chronic infusion of Abeta caused a 37% reduction in CAR for N-SAbeta. In S-Abeta, this reduction was not observed. At the end, brains were extracted and autoradiography for alpha7 nAChR was conducted using [125I]-alpha-bungarotoxin. There was an increase in alpha7 density in hippocampus, cortex and amygdala of SAbeta animals, together with the memory preservation. In recent findings from our lab using mice infused with Abeta and the alpha7 antagonist methyllycaconitine, and stimulated weekly in the same apparatus, it was observed that memory maintenance was abolished. So, the increase in alpha7 density in brain areas related to memory might be related to a participation of this receptor in the long-lasting change in synaptic plasticity, which is important to improve and maintain memory consolidation.
