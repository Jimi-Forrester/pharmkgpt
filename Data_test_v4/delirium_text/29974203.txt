29974203|t|An open-label, multicenter, phase Ib study investigating the effect of apalutamide on ventricular repolarization in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer.
29974203|a|PURPOSE: Phase Ib study evaluating the effect of apalutamide, at therapeutic exposure, on ventricular repolarization by applying time-matched pharmacokinetics and electrocardiography (ECG) in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. Safety of daily apalutamide was also assessed. METHODS: Patients received 240 mg oral apalutamide daily. Time-matched ECGs were collected via continuous 12-lead Holter recording before apalutamide (Day - 1) and on Days 1 and 57 (Cycle 3 Day 1). Pharmacokinetics of apalutamide were assessed on Days 1 and 57 at matched time points of ECG collection. QT interval was corrected for heart rate using Fridericia correction (QTcF). The primary endpoint was the maximum mean change in QTcF (DeltaQTcF) from baseline to Cycle 3 Day 1 (steady state). Secondary endpoints were the effect of apalutamide on other ECG parameters, pharmacokinetics of apalutamide and its active metabolite, relationship between plasma concentrations of apalutamide and QTcF, and safety. RESULTS: Forty-five men were enrolled; 82% received treatment for >= 3 months. At steady state, the maximum DeltaQTcF was 12.4 ms and the upper bound of its associated 90% CI was 16.0 ms. No clinically meaningful effects of apalutamide were reported for heart rate or other ECG parameters. A concentration-dependent increase in QTcF was observed for apalutamide. Most adverse events (AEs) (73%) were grade 1-2 in severity. No patients discontinued due to QTc prolongation or AEs. CONCLUSION: The effect of apalutamide on QTc prolongation was modest and does not produce a clinically meaningful effect on ventricular repolarization. The AE profile was consistent with other studies of apalutamide.
