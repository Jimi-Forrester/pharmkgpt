31686822|a|INTRODUCTION: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common disorder and its frequency varies from 15% to 25% after major elective surgery. There are few data on the incidence of POD in Brazil. Here, we sought to assess the incidence of POD following transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and to examine precipitating and predisposing factors associated. METHOD: We performed a prospective observational study of elderly male patients undergoing TURP (N=55) in Northeast Brazil. Information on demographic, medical, cognitive and functional characteristics were collected. The participants were followed until hospital discharge. POD was diagnosed by the Confusion Assessment Method. RESULTS: A total of three participants (5.45%) were identified with POD. Episodes of delirium lasted 3+-1 days. The study sample consisted of a healthy population. Patients with POD had longer hospital stay and more precipitating factors. The POD group showed statistically significant lower Barthel index score (p<0.001) and higher Pfeffer's Functional Activities Questionnaire scores (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Loss of functional capacity was associated with POD in a healthy population of elderly patients undergoing TURP.
