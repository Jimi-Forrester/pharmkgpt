39821479|a|INTRODUCTION: Novel fluid biomarkers for tracking neurodegeneration specific to Alzheimer's disease (AD) are greatly needed. METHODS: Using two independent well-characterized cohorts (n = 881 in total), we investigated the group differences in plasma N-terminal tau (NT1-tau) fragments across different AD stages and their association with cross-sectional and longitudinal amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques, tau tangles, brain atrophy, and cognitive decline. RESULTS: Plasma NT1-tau significantly increased in symptomatic AD and displayed positive associations with Abeta PET (positron emission tomography) and tau PET. Higher baseline NT1-tau levels predicted greater tau PET, with 2- to 10-year intervals and faster longitudinal Abeta PET increases, AD-typical neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline. Plasma NT1-tau showed negative correlations with baseline regional brain volume and thickness, superior to plasma brain-derived tau (BD-tau) and neurofilament light (NfL) in Abeta-positive participants. DISCUSSION: This study suggests that plasma NT1-tau is an Abeta-dependent biomarker and outperforms BD-tau and NfL in detecting cross-sectional neurodegeneration in the AD continuum. HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma N-terminal tau (NT1-tau) was specifically increased in the A+/T+ stage. Plasma NT1-tau was positively associated with greater amyloid beta (Abeta) and tau PET (positron emission tomography) accumulations. Higher plasma NT1-tau predicted greater tau burden and faster Abeta increases. Plasma NT1-tau was more related to neurodegeneration than plasma brain-derived tau (BD-tau) and neurofilament light (NfL).
