35345746|a|Baclofen is a presynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist, which has been used to treat muscle spasms. Due to its low cost and low addiction potential, baclofen has been the muscle relaxant of choice for many years. This drug is metabolized in the kidneys, posing a threat to patients with underlying renal dysfunction, with complications ranging from drug toxicity to death. We present a case of baclofen toxicity in a patient with renal failure on hemodialysis, who presented with signs and symptoms of baclofen overdose after consuming 10 mg of the medication. The highlight of this case is the detailed history taking, verifying all home medications, and thorough physical examination of the patient.
