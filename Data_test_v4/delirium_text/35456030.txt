35456030|a|Mice fed soy-based diets exhibit increased weight gain compared to mice fed casein-based diets, and the effects are more pronounced in a model of fragile X syndrome (FXS; Fmr1KO). FXS is a neurodevelopmental disability characterized by intellectual impairment, seizures, autistic behavior, anxiety, and obesity. Here, we analyzed body weight as a function of mouse age, diet, and genotype to determine the effect of diet (soy, casein, and grain-based) on weight gain. We also assessed plasma protein biomarker expression and behavior in response to diet. Juvenile Fmr1KO mice fed a soy protein-based rodent chow throughout gestation and postnatal development exhibit increased weight gain compared to mice fed a casein-based purified ingredient diet or grain-based, low phytoestrogen chow. Adolescent and adult Fmr1KO mice fed a soy-based infant formula diet exhibited increased weight gain compared to reference diets. Increased body mass was due to increased lean mass. Wild-type male mice fed soy-based infant formula exhibited increased learning in a passive avoidance paradigm, and Fmr1KO male mice had a deficit in nest building. Thus, at the systems level, consumption of soy-based diets increases weight gain and affects behavior. At the molecular level, a soy-based infant formula diet was associated with altered expression of numerous plasma proteins, including the adipose hormone leptin and the beta-amyloid degrading enzyme neprilysin. In conclusion, single-source, soy-based diets may contribute to the development of obesity and the exacerbation of neurological phenotypes in developmental disabilities, such as FXS.
