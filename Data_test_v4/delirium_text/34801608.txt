34801608|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Velvet antler extracts (VAE) are composed of a variety of active substances and growth factors, and have been reported to improve sleep quality and memory. AIM OF THE STUDY: We aimed to explore the protective effects and mechanism of action for VAE on Alzheimer's disease (AD) using a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C. elegans were cultivated at 40% relative humidity on solid nematode growth medium (NGM) containing live E. coli (OP50) as the food source, with Strain N2 (normal) held at 20  C and the CL4176s (transgenic) held at 16  C. AD-like aggregation of Abeta peptide in the CL4176s strain is induced by lifting the temperature to 25  C. Nematodes were treated with three types of VAEs and Resveratrol (positive control). Analyses included qRT-PCR for quantification of gene transcripts of interest; ELISA for measuring levels of amyloid-beta protein; Thioflavin T fluorescent staining for localizing Abeta depositions; assays for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide dismutase activity (SOD). RESULTS: VAEs reduced beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) toxicity in the transgenic C. elegans model. An enzymatically-digested VAE (EDVAE) was superior to both a cold-water VAE (CWVAE) and a hot-water VAE (HWVAE) from the same velvet antler. EDVAE treatment reduced the severity of the Abeta-induced paralysis phenotype and decreased the amount of Abeta deposits in the AD model nematodes, and these effects were found to be significantly better than that of the positive control Resveratrol. In addition, EDVAE treatment reduced production of ROS (induced by Abeta), enhanced SOD activity, and elevated expression levels of antioxidant-related transcription factors, although it is not known whether these effects were achieved directly or indirectly. CONCLUSION: EDVAE had a protective role in Abeta-induced toxicity in the transgenic AD nematodes, possibly through reducing accumulation of toxic Abeta and enhancing the ability of nematodes to resist oxidative stress. Thus, EDVAE has potential to be an effective treatment to relieve the symptoms of AD.
