2459566|t|Selective silver impregnation of senile plaques: a method useful for computer imaging.
2459566|a|Most silver methods for the demonstration of senile plaques (SP) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) give variable staining of SP and often stain a variety of other structures (including normal axons, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), blood vessel reticulin, nucleoli of neurons, and nuclei of glia). A newly developed silver method for paraffin sections is described in this report that reliably stains densely arrayed fine processes in SP. Other structures, including NFT, are not darkly stained. The high-contrast staining of SP greatly facilitates the mapping and morphometry of SP using videomicroscopic image analysis systems and provides a new method for other research studies on SP and for diagnostic histopathology.
