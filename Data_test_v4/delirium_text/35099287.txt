35099287|t|Pilot Study of Lemborexant for Insomnia in Cancer Patients with Delirium.
35099287|a|Delirium occurs very frequently in cancer patients. Insomnia is a symptom of delirium. Lemborexant is a drug that regulates sleep-wake rhythms without causing extrapyramidal symptoms. Based on its ability to improve sleep, lemborexant is expected to have efficacy for insomnia with delirium. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of lemborexant for insomnia in cancer patients with delirium. A retrospective observational study was conducted between July 2020 and February 2021. Fourteen patients (six females; mean age,69 years) were included. Lemborexant was effective in 11 of 14 (78.6%) patients. Of 14 patients, 10 had hyperactive delirium. Lemborexant might have similar efficacy for insomnia with and without delirium when compared with previous studies. The efficacy rate of lemborexant was 70% for patients with insomnia and hyperactive delirium. This study might lead to dose reductions of antipsychotic medications and fewer extrapyramidal symptoms in cancer patients with delirium.
