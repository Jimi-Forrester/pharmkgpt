22546279|t|Examining the mechanisms that link beta-amyloid and alpha-synuclein pathologies.
22546279|a|beta-amyloid (Abeta) and alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) are aggregation-prone proteins typically associated with two distinct neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease. Yet alpha-syn was first found in association with AD plaques several years before being linked to Parkinson's disease or Lewy body formation. Nowadays, a large subset of AD patients (~50%) is well recognized to co-exhibit significant alpha-syn Lewy body pathology. Unfortunately, these AD Lewy body variant patients suffer from additional symptoms and an accelerated disease course. Basic research has begun to show that Abeta and alpha-syn may act synergistically to promote the aggregation and accumulation of each other. While the exact mechanisms by which these proteins interact remain unclear, growing evidence suggests that Abeta may drive alpha-syn pathology by impairing protein clearance, activating inflammation, enhancing phosphorylation, or directly promoting aggregation. This review examines the interactions between Abeta and alpha-syn and proposes potential mechanistic links between Abeta accumulation and alpha-syn pathogenesis.
