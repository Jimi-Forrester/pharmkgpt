24613704|a|BACKGROUND: Evidence has emerged indicating that the epsilon4 allele of APOE and PICALM interact in conferring risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The biologic basis of this interaction is unclear, but it is likely to have phenotypic relevance and contribute to the structural and clinical heterogeneity of AD. METHODS: The aim of this study was to investigate interaction effects of the APOE epsilon4 allele and the alleles at the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs3851179 located in the PICALM locus. We analyzed brain volumes and cognitive phenotypes of 165 patients with early AD dementia. RESULTS: There was a synergistic adverse effect of homozygosity for the PICALM risk allele G in rs3851179 and APOE epsilon4 on volume in prefrontal and performance on the Trail Making Test A, which is sensitive to processing speed and working memory function. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest a neural mechanism for APOE-PICALM interactions in patients with manifest AD and indicate that the PICALM genotype modulates both brain atrophy and cognitive performance in APOE epsilon4 carriers.
