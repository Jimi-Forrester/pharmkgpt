30211321|t|Sleep Deprivation in Intensive Care Unit - Systematic Review.
30211321|a|BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbances in intensive care unit (ICU) patients have been studied worldwide for over 30 years. Factors contributing to sleep disturbances are still being identified, and therapeutic procedures aimed at the mitigation of such ailments are consequently being developed. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to review the literature on sleep disturbances in intensive care unit patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: MEDLINE PubMed, OVID, Web of Science, and EBSCO databases have been searched using adequate keywords. RESULTS: Sleep disorders in ICUs were common among all of the analysed articles. Noise plays a significant role in sleep interruption (11.5 - 17% of awakenings). It was noted that the introduction of "white noise" into the ICU environment proved unsuccessful in reducing the magnitude of changing noise levels. Nursing care activities significantly disturb nocturnal rest, and 42.7 such procedures per every 12-hour night shift were registered. Aggregating nursing care interventions was suggested in order to reduce the number of stimuli experienced by the patient. CONCLUSION: Changes in sleep structure developing during an ICU stay may significantly contribute to sleep disorders once the hospitalisation is over.
