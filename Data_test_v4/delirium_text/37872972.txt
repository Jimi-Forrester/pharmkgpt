37872972|a|It is well documented that diabetes mellitus (DM) is strongly associated with cognitive decline and structural damage to the brain. Cognitive deficits appear early in DM and continue to worsen as the disease progresses, possibly due to different underlying mechanisms. Normal iron metabolism is necessary to maintain normal physiological functions of the brain, but iron deposition is one of the causes of some neurodegenerative diseases. Increasing evidence shows that iron overload not only increases the risk of DM, but also contributes to the development of cognitive impairment. The current review highlights the role of iron overload in diabetic cognitive impairment (DCI), including the specific location and regulation mechanism of iron deposition in the diabetic brain, the factors that trigger iron deposition, and the consequences of iron deposition. Finally, we also discuss possible therapies to improve DCI and brain iron deposition.
