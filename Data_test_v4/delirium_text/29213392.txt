29213392|t|Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease associated with a missense mutation at codon 200 of the prion protein gene in Brazil.
29213392|a|Genetic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (gCJD) represents less than 15% of CJD cases, and its clinical picture may be either indistinguishable from that of sporadic CJD (sCJD) or be atypical, usually with younger onset and longer duration. We report a case of 59-year old Brazilian man who presented rapidly progressive cognitive decline and cerebellar ataxia. EEG revealed periodic activity. A brother and a cousin of the patient had CJD. A point mutation at codon 200 (E200K) of the prion protein gene (PRNP) was found and death occurred 11 months after onset of symptoms. Autopsy was not performed. The clinical presentation of gCJD associated with E200K, which is the most frequent PRNP mutation, is quite similar to sCDJ. This is the first report of E200K mutation in Brazil, and it is possible that a more systematic search for its occurrence may show it to be relatively frequent in Brazil.
