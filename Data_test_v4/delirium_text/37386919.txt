37386919|t|A Case-Control Study of Cognitive Function in Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease Before and After Hemodialysis in Southern Spain.
37386919|a|BACKGROUND Cognitive problems are frequent in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) treated with hemodialysis. However, previous studies used only a single cognitive screening test or a small number of cognitive indices, which is inadequate for an exhaustive evaluation of cognitive deficits. This case-control study aimed to evaluate cognitive function in patients with ESRD before and after hemodialysis at centers in southern Spain, and included analysis of associations between cognitive function and duration of hemodialysis, biochemistry, body composition, and treatment variables. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cognitive performance was evaluated in 42 healthy participants (HPs) and in 43 ESRD patients, before and after hemodialysis. The tests measured verbal and visual memory, sustained/selective attention, and processing speed. The diagnostic criterion for ESRD was a glomerular filtration rate.
