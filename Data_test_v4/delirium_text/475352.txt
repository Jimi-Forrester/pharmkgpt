475352|t|Spinal fluid aluminum levels in patients with Alzheimer disease.
475352|a|Spinal fluid from 180 male patients was examined for aluminum levels. Values were coordinated for age and protein determinations.

Although in most instances no correlation could be made, 10 patients with Alzheimer disease showed significantly low levels of aluminum.
