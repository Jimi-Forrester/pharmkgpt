34762274|t|The aging venous system: from varicosities to vascular cognitive impairment.
34762274|a|Aging-induced pathological alterations of the circulatory system play a critical role in morbidity and mortality of older adults. While the importance of cellular and molecular mechanisms of arterial aging for increased cardiovascular risk in older adults is increasingly appreciated, aging processes of veins are much less studied and understood than those of arteries. In this review, age-related cellular and morphological alterations in the venous system are presented. Similarities and dissimilarities between arterial and venous aging are highlighted, and shared molecular mechanisms of arterial and venous aging are considered. The pathogenesis of venous diseases affecting older adults, including varicose veins, chronic venous insufficiency, and deep vein thrombosis, is discussed, and the potential contribution of venous pathologies to the onset of vascular cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases is emphasized. It is our hope that a greater appreciation of the cellular and molecular processes of vascular aging will stimulate further investigation into strategies aimed at preventing or retarding age-related venous pathologies.
