36909817|t|Association between simulated ketamine exposures and oxygen saturations in children.
36909817|a|Aim: We performed a real-world data analysis to evaluate the relationship between simulated ketamine exposures and oxygen desaturation in children. Materials & methods: A previously developed population pharmacokinetic model was used to simulate exposures and evaluate target attainment, as well as the association with oxygen desaturation in children <=17 years treated with intravenous ketamine. Results: In 2022 children, there was no significant association between simulated plasma ketamine concentrations and oxygen saturation; however, a higher cumulative area under the curve was associated with increased odds of progression to significant desaturation (<85%), though magnitude of effect was small. Conclusion: By leveraging a population pharmacokinetic model and real-world data, we confirmed there is no relationship between simulated ketamine plasma concentration and oxygen desaturation.
