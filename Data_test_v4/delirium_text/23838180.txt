23838180|t|Focus issue: uncovering the mechanisms of neurological disease.
23838180|a|This week, Science Signaling highlights research that uses computational and cell biology approaches to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying diseases of the central nervous system. In particular, research featured explores the neuronal response to stress due to excess excitatory stimuli, multiple roles for presenilin in Alzheimer's disease, and mechanisms through which autism may arise. In addition, new molecular targets for treating an aggressive form of brain cancer are presented. Not only do these articles provide potential mechanisms for the development of therapies, they also illuminate the intricacies of synaptic signaling and the complexity of forming and maintaining appropriate synaptic connections.
