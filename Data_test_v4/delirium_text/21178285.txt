21178285|t|Strain- and age-related alteration of proteins in the brain of SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice.
21178285|a|In order to discover and identify the key protein biomarkers in the aging process, we performed a differential proteomic analysis of hippocampus and cortex in 5- and 15-month old senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) as well as in control strain SAM/resistant 1 (SAMR1). Using 2-DE combined with MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry, about 1700 protein spots were isolated, and three groups of differentially expressed proteins were identified. The first group contained the strain-specific and non-age-related differential proteins that were differentially expressed in SAMP8 compared with SAMR1 mice. The changes might be implicated in the genetic difference between SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice; specifically, the proteins ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L3, mitofilin, adenylate kinase 4, and an unnamed protein product (gi 12847201). The proteins in the second group were age-specific, which were differentially expressed between 5- and 15-month old SAM mice. Those proteins are particularly interesting since the changes were aging-related and some of them were previously reported to be expressed in Alzheimer's disease patients. These proteins included N-myc downstream regulated gene 2, enolase 2, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, myosin, and two unnamed protein products (gi 74214304 and gi 74178239). The protein in the third group was SAMP8 specific-age-related protein, which was identified as heme binding protein 1. The present study provides new information about SAMP8 specific and aging-related protein changes in brain. Further investigations will be performed to reveal the significance of these proteins in brain aging process and the potential roles as biomarkers for effective diagnosis and therapy.
