39409805|t|Impact of High-Dose Supplemental Paprika Extract Feeding on Egg Storage and Biochemical Parameters in Laying Hens.
39409805|a|This study aimed to evaluate the effects of paprika extract supplementation on egg storage and blood biochemical parameters in 63-week-old Rhode Island Red (RIR) and Silky Fowl (SF) hens. The hens were divided into three groups: a control group with a basal diet and two groups receiving the basal diet with paprika extract. The trial lasted 28 days, with egg quality (yolk color and albumen pH) assessed after storing eggs at 25  C for 21 days. A total of 144 eggs were used in 42 treatments (two breeds, three diets, and seven storage periods) with three eggs examined each (four eggs were used on day 0 and five eggs on day 21). Additionally, the yolk carotenoid content, yolk color, and pH of eggs stored at 4  C and 25  C were compared. Results showed that yolk color fan score (YCFS) decreased with storage, and SF had a higher albumen pH than RIR, with both breeds exhibiting an increase in pH over time. HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and the HDL-C to total cholesterol ratio were significantly influenced by breed, diet, and their interaction. The HDL-C level in SF was affected linearly and quadratically by diet, while no such trend was observed in RIR. The study concluded that paprika extract affects egg quality and blood lipid profiles differently in different breeds, highlighting breed-specific responses to dietary supplementation.
