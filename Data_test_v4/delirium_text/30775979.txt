30775979|t|Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Reduced Plasma Insulin Precede Decreased AKT Phosphorylation and GLUT3 Translocation in the Hippocampus of Old 3xTg-AD Mice.
30775979|a|Several studies have demonstrated that mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can exhibit impaired peripheral glucose tolerance. Further, in the APP/PS1 mouse model, this is observed prior to the appearance of AD-related neuropathology (e.g., amyloid-beta plaques; Abeta) or cognitive impairment. In the current study, we examined whether impaired glucose tolerance also preceded AD-like changes in the triple transgenic model of AD (3xTg-AD). Glucose tolerance testing (GTT), insulin ELISAs, and insulin tolerance testing (ITT) were performed at ages prior to (1-3 months and 6-8 months old) and post-pathology (16-18 months old). Additionally, we examined for altered insulin signaling in the hippocampus. Western blots were used to evaluate the two-primary insulin signaling pathways: PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK. Since the PI3K/AKT pathway affects several downstream targets associated with metabolism (e.g., GSK3, glucose transporters), western blots were used to examine possible alterations in the expression, translocation, or activation of these targets. We found that 3xTg-AD mice display impaired glucose tolerance as early as 1 month of age, concomitant with a decrease in plasma insulin levels well prior to the detection of plaques (~14 months old), aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau (~18 months old), and cognitive decline (>=18 months old). These alterations in peripheral metabolism were seen at all time points examined. In comparison, PI3K/AKT, but not MAPK/ERK, signaling was altered in the hippocampus only in 18-20-month-old 3xTg-AD mice, a time point at which there was a reduction in GLUT3 translocation to the plasma membrane. Taken together, our results provide further evidence that disruptions in energy metabolism may represent a foundational step in the development of AD.
