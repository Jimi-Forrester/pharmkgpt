14507468|a|Aluminum is environmentally abundant but not an essential trace element. Although there is increasing evidence suggesting the implication of aluminum in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, it is still controversial. We found and report here that aluminum maltolate, a stable and hydrophilic aluminum complex, causes death of primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Degenerated neurons were TUNEL-positive. Immunohistochemical detection of synapsin I and microtubule associated protein 2 revealed the synapse loss between neurons intoxicated by aluminum maltolate. To explore the mechanism underlying its neurotoxicity, we administered various pharmacological compounds prior to the application of aluminum maltolate, and found that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) markedly attenuated the neurotoxicity. Furthermore, aluminum maltolate inhibited the elevation of intracellular calcium levels caused by BDNF. Our results suggest the involvement of BDNF in the molecular mechanism underlying neurotoxicity induced by aluminum maltolate.
