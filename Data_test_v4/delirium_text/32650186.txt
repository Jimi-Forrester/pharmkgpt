32650186|t|The relationship between DNA methylation in neurotrophic genes and age as evidenced from three independent cohorts: differences by delirium status.
32650186|a|We previously reported the association between DNA methylation (DNAm) of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes and age. In addition, neurotrophic factors are known to be associated with age and neurocognitive disorders. Therefore, we hypothesized that DNAm of neurotrophic genes change with age, especially in delirium patients. DNAm was analyzed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 or HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip Kit in 3 independent cohorts: blood from 383 Grady Trauma Project subjects, brain from 21 neurosurgery patients, and blood from 87 inpatients with and without delirium. Both blood and brain samples showed that most of the DNAm of neurotrophic genes were positively correlated with age. Furthermore, DNAm of neurotrophic genes was more positively correlated with age in delirium cases than in non-delirium controls. These findings support our hypothesis that the neurotrophic genes may be epigenetically modulated with age, and this process may be contributing to the pathophysiology of delirium.
