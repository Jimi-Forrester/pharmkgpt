37352178|a|PURPOSE: To analyze the long-term consequences of critical COVID-19, regarding physical, mental, cognitive and functional impairments, and to describe its evolution through time. METHODS: Prospective cohort study, with consecutive inclusion of patients admitted due to SARS-CoV-2 to intensive care units(ICU) of a tertiary-care center, between May/2020 and September/2021. All included patients were included in Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine(PRM) inpatient programs during ICU stay. Eligible patients were evaluated on PRM appointments 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge. In each visit, physical examination and a predefined set of scales were applied, aiming to comprehensively evaluate the three domains (physical, mental and cognitive) of post-intensive care syndrome and the patients' functionality. Statistical analysis encompassed descriptive and univariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 42 patients were included: 66.7% males, mean age of 62 yo. In the physical domain, 6 months after ICU discharge, there was a significant reduction in quality of life (p-value = 0.034), muscle strength (p-value = 0.002), gait ability (p-value<0.001) and balance (p-values<0.001) and increased fatigue levels (p-value = 0.009), in comparison with reference values. Yet, a significative positive evolution was observed in all referred subdomains (p-values<0.05). Nevertheless, 12 months after discharge, muscle strength (p-value = 0.001), gait (p-value<0.001) and balance (p-value<0.001) were still significantly compromised. Regarding the mental domain, both at 6 and 12 months after discharge, the levels of anxiety and depression were significantly increased (p-values<0.001). Nonetheless, a positive evolution was also found (p-values<0.02). Cognitive performance was significantly impaired in comparison with reference values, both at 6 and 12 months (p-value<0.001). Yet, a global improvement was also depicted (p-value = 0.003). Six months after ICU discharge, 54.8% were autonomous in activities of daily living, a value that improved to 74.0% in the subsequent 6 months (p-value = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Critical COVID-19 survivors present significant physical, mental and cognitive impairments 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge, despite their positive evolution through time.
