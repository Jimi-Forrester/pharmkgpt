16197805|t|Role of microglia in the central nervous system's immune response.
16197805|a|Microglial cells comprise a network of endogenous immunocompetent cells that pervade the brain and spinal cord. The primary function of this system is to provide continuous surveillance of the parenchyma and protect the central nervous system (CNS) during injury and disease. Here we discuss the involvement of microglia during brain aging and aging-related neurodegenerative disease, i.e. Alzheimer's disease, and briefly summarize their possible roles in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In addition, we provide an overview of the neuroinflammation associated with primary brain tumors and how microglial tumor cytotoxicity could be targeted for immunotherapeutic approaches designed to treat these lesions.
