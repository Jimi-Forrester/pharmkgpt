38577810|t|Single-nucleus transcriptomics uncovers a geroprotective role of YAP in primate gingival aging.
38577810|a|Aging has a profound impact on the gingiva and significantly increases its susceptibility to periodontitis, a worldwide prevalent inflammatory disease. However, a systematic characterization and comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanism underlying gingival aging is still lacking. Here, we systematically dissected the phenotypic characteristics of gingiva during aging in primates and constructed the first single-nucleus transcriptomic landscape of gingival aging, by which a panel of cell type-specific signatures were elucidated. Epithelial cells were identified as the most affected cell types by aging in the gingiva. Further analyses pinpointed the crucial role of YAP in epithelial self-renew and homeostasis, which declined during aging in epithelial cells, especially in basal cells. The decline of YAP activity during aging was confirmed in the human gingival tissues, and downregulation of YAP in human primary gingival keratinocytes recapitulated the major phenotypic defects observed in the aged primate gingiva while overexpression of YAP showed rejuvenation effects. Our work provides an in-depth understanding of gingival aging and serves as a rich resource for developing novel strategies to combat aging-associated gingival diseases, with the ultimate goal of advancing periodontal health and promoting healthy aging.
