35625451|t|Oral Microbiome Research on Oral Lichen Planus: Current Findings and Perspectives.
35625451|a|Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the oral mucosa with an unknown etiology. The role of oral microbes in the development of OLP has gained researchers' interest. In this review, we summarized the findings of studies focused on the relationship between OLP and oral microbiome, which includes the composition of oral microbiota, molecules produced by oral microbiota or the host, and the oral environment of the host. According to the studies, the oral microbial community in OLP patients undergoes dysbiosis, and the microbial dysbiosis in OLP patients is more prominent in the buccal mucosa than in the saliva. However, no same microorganisms have been suggested to be associated with OLP in multiple investigations, implying that the functional aspects of the oral microbiota are more important in OLP development than the composition of the oral microbiota. According to studies on host factors that make up the oral environment, signal pathways involved in cellular processes, such as keratinization, inflammation, and T cell responses are triggered in OLP. Studies on the functional aspects of the oral microbiota, as well as interactions between the host and the oral microbiota, are still lacking, and more research is required.
