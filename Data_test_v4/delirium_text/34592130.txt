34592130|t|Bio-chemical markers of chronic, non-infectious disease in the human tear film.
34592130|a|The tear film is a thin, moist layer covering the ocular surface and is laden with proteins, peptides, lipids, mucins, electrolytes and cellular debris which function to maintain the healthy status of the ocular surface. In many cases of ocular or systemic disease, the integrity of this layer is changed and/or the balance of its constituents is disturbed. Since tears are easy and quick to collect and can be stored for long periods, they have the potential to be a valuable source of information relevant to many disease states. The purpose of this review is to collate information on the known biomarkers of systemic disease that have been identified in tears. The range of conditions covered includes diabetes mellitus, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, migraine, systemic sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, thyroid disorders and cancer.
