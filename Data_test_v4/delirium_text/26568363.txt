26568363|a|INTRODUCTION: The importance of microglia in most neurodegenerative pathologies, from Parkinson's disease to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, is increasingly recognized. Until few years ago, microglial activation in pathological conditions was considered dangerous to neurons due to its causing inflammation. Today we know that these glial cells also play a crucial physiological and neuroprotective role, which is altered in neurodegenerative conditions. AREAS COVERED: The neuroinflammatory hypothesis for neurodegenerative diseases has led to the trial of anti-inflammatory agents as therapeutics with largely disappointing results. New information about the physiopathological role of microglia has highlighted the importance of immunomodulation as a potential new therapeutic approach. This review summarizes knowledge on microglia as a potential therapeutic target in the most common neurodegenerative diseases, with focus on compounds directed toward the modulation of microglial immune response through specific molecular pathways. EXPERT OPINION: Here we support the innovative concept of targeting microglial cells by modulating their activity, rather than simply trying to counteract their inflammatory neurotoxicity, as a potential therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases. The advantage of this therapeutic approach could be to reduce neuroinflammation and toxicity, while at the same time strengthening intrinsic neuroprotective properties of microglia and promoting neuroregeneration.
