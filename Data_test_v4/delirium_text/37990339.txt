37990339|a|BACKGROUND: Participant retention is a key factor that affects clinical trial integrity. Trial protocols estimate attrition as a function of sample size calculations. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an area of active treatment development. We aimed to quantify the association between trial duration and completion rates and provide guidance for estimating attrition in AD trial protocols. METHODS: Using the Alzforum and ClinicalTrials.gov databases, we analyzed retention data from 125 mild-to-moderate AD and 12 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) clinical trials. We compared the rates of completion between trial arms (active vs. control) and ran regression models to test the hypothesis that trials with longer study duration have lower trial completion using all available data and restricting to placebo data. Our primary outcome was the odds of trial completion for a 6-month increase in trial duration. From the regression model, we estimated the proportion of participants completing 6-, 12-, and 18-month trials. RESULTS: We found that 21 (17%) mild-to-moderate AD trials and 1 (8%) MCI trial demonstrated greater dropout in treatment compared to placebo arms. For every 6-month increase in trial duration, there was a 27% decrease in the odds of trial completion (OR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.66, 0.81; p < 0.001) among participants in mild-to-moderate AD trials and a 55% decrease (OR = 0.45; 95% CI 0.36, 0.57; p < 0.001) among participants in MCI trials. The proportion of participants in the placebo group completing 6-, 12-, and 18-month trials were estimated to be 85.2%, 80.0%, and 73.3% for mild-to-moderate AD trials and 91.9%, 84.2%, and 71.3% for MCI trials, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Longer duration trials may be underpowered to demonstrate estimated treatment effects and may suffer from a greater risk of bias than do shorter trials.
