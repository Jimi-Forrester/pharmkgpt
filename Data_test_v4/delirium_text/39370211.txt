39370211|a|Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are produced, secreted, and targeted by most human cells, including cells that compose nervous system tissues. EVs carry several types of biomolecules, such as lipids, proteins and microRNA, and can function as signaling agents in physiological and pathological processes. In this chapter, we will focus on EVs and their cargo secreted by brain cells, especially neurons and glia, and how these aspects are affected in pathological conditions. The chapter covers neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as several psychiatric disorders, namely schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and major depressive disorder. This chapter also addresses other types of neurological dysfunctions, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury. EVs can cross the blood brain barrier, and thus brain EVs may be detected in more accessible peripheral tissue, such as circulating blood. Alterations in EV composition and contents can therefore impart valuable clues into the molecular etiology of these disorders, and serve biomarkers regarding disease prevalence, progression and treatment. EVs can also be used to carry drugs and biomolecules into brain tissue, considered as a promising drug delivery agent for neurological diseases. Therefore, although this area of research is still in its early development, it offers great potential in further elucidating and in treating neurological disorders.
