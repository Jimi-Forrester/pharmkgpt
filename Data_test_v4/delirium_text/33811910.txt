33811910|a|Survivors of COVID-19 are a vulnerable population, with complex needs because of lingering symptoms and complications across multiple organ systems. Those who required hospitalization or intensive care are also at risk for post-hospital syndrome and post-ICU syndromes, with attendant cognitive, psychological, and physical impairments, and high levels of health care utilization. Effective ambulatory care for COVID-19 survivors requires coordination across multiple subspecialties, which can be burdensome if not well coordinated. With growing recognition of these needs, post-COVID-19 clinics are being created across the country. We describe the design and implementation of multidisciplinary post-COVID-19 clinics at two academic health systems, Johns Hopkins and the University of California-San Francisco. We highlight components of the model which should be replicated across sites, while acknowledging opportunities to tailor offerings to the local institutional context. Our goal is to provide a replicable framework for others to create these much-needed care delivery models for survivors of COVID-19.
