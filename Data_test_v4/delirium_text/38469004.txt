38469004|t|Rehabilitation Strategies for Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome: Physiotherapy Interventions and Management Approaches.
38469004|a|Korsakoff syndrome and Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) show neurological and cognitive deficits. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) is a compound neurological condition. The cause of this neurological condition could be the consumption of alcohol regularly for a chronic duration. A tailored rehabilitation protocol that focuses on cognitive and physical deficiencies was implemented along with thiamine supplementation for managing a case of a 49-year-old male patient who had a history of high alcohol consumption and was exhibiting typical signs of WKS. After planning a proper physiotherapy plan, it is necessary to look after the patient's progress along with re-evaluation, which reveals notable gains in cognitive function, memory, and functional independence. There is a dearth of research on the impact of physical therapy in managing WKS. The above case report reflects the benefits of combining physiotherapy, cognitive rehabilitation, and balance training to improve patient functionality and independence. Tailored rehabilitation interventions like the Benson relaxation method (BRM), brain gym exercises, Frenkel's exercise, electrical stimulation, sensorimotor training, basic body awareness therapy (BBAT), and gait training can be used to enhance a patient's quality of life. Addressing individual needs is essential in managing WKS, focusing on the importance of comprehensive care beyond cognitive rehabilitation alone.
