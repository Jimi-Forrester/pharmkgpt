38934848|a|BACKGROUND: We aimed to clarify the predictive value of cerebral small-vessel disease and intracranial large artery disease (LAD) observed in magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and magnetic resonance angiography on future vascular events and cognitive impairment. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were derived from a Japanese cohort with evidence of cerebral vessel disease on magnetic resonance imaging. This study included 862 participants who underwent magnetic resonance angiography after excluding patients with a modified Rankin Scale score >1 and Mini-Mental State Examination score <24. We evaluated small-vessel disease such as white matter hyperintensities and lacunes in magnetic resonance imaging and LAD with magnetic resonance angiography. Outcomes were incident stroke, dementia, acute coronary syndrome, and all-cause death. Over a median follow-up period of 4.5 years, 54 incident stroke, 39 cases of dementia, and 27 cases of acute coronary syndrome were documented. Both small-vessel disease (white matter hyperintensities and lacunes) and LAD were associated with stroke; however, only white matter hyperintensities were related to dementia. In contrast, only LAD was associated with acute coronary syndrome. Among the 357 patients with no prior history of stroke, coronary or peripheral artery disease, or atrial fibrillation, white matter hyperintensities emerged as the sole predictor of future stroke and dementia, while LAD was the sole predictor of acute coronary syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Among cerebral vessels, small-vessel disease could underlie the cognitive impairment while LAD was associated with coronary artery disease as atherosclerotic vessel disease.
