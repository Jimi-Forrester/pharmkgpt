29775139|t|Burden and Strain among Familial Caregivers of Patients with Dementia in China.
29775139|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is one of a variety of progressive and ultimately fatal neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized by a number of nervous and mental symptoms and behavior disorders. These problems are likely to cause burden and strain on caregivers. In this study, we demonstrated the level and relationship of burden and strain among caregivers of dementia patients in China. METHODS: A total of 212 caregivers of family members with dementia responded to the survey. A 22-item of the Zarit Burden Interview and a 13-item Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) were used. RESULTS: The results showed that women comprised 88.2% of caregivers, and 58.5% of caregivers reported a level of medium burden. Over one-half of the caregivers reported a level of high strain, with the low income group being more likely to have high levels of burden and strain. CONCLUSION: Chinese familial caregivers of patients with dementia experience a moderate level of burden and a high level of strain. The main strain factors that affected the burden were changes in personal plans, time demands, and emotional adjustment.
