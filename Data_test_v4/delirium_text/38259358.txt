38259358|a|The human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) has a rich and pre-programmed microbiome. This microbiome is essential for physiological functions such as digestion, immunity, metabolism, and structural integrity, and of prime concern to us in conducting this study is the nervous system communication. This two-way communication between the GIT and central nervous system (CNS) is known as the gut-brain axis (GBA) and has implications for neurocritical disease. A change in any factor relating to this microbiome is known as gut dysbiosis; this can lead to aberrant communication through the GBA and in turn, can contribute to disease states. The primary objective of this study is to determine the cause-specific dysbiotic organisms in neuro-critically ill patients and their effects. We performed this study by searching published literature as per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies that defined gastrointestinal dysbiosis in neuro-critically ill patients were retrieved using Boolean search from 2000 to 2023 via PubMed and Google Scholar and narrowed the results down to five prospective case-control studies. We performed their quality assessment. The results concluded that in neurocritical illnesses such as encephalitis, brain tumors, intracerebral hemorrhage, and ischemic stroke, fluctuations in specific microbiota correlated with disease severity and prognosis. Moreover, the inhabiting population of dysbiotic organisms in neuro-critically ill patients were different in different diseases and there were no similarities in the composition of gut microbiota in these diseases. Taking stroke patients as an example; increased Enterobacteriaceae and lower Lachnospiraceae microbiome levels were found in patients with a higher stroke dysbiosis index (SDI). Those patients who developed stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) displayed higher levels of Enterococcus species. In conclusion, dysbiosis has a major effect on neuro-critically ill patients' disease states and dysbiotic organisms can be used as a biomarker for disease. Further prospective studies on this topic are warranted for potential neurological and prognostic correlations.
