16344101|a|The function of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the tissue that secretes it, the choroid plexus (CP), has traditionally been thought of as both providing physical protection to the brain through buoyancy and facilitating the removal of brain metabolites through the bulk drainage of CSF. More recent studies suggest, however, that the CP-CSF system plays a much more active role in the development, homeostasis, and repair of the central nervous system (CNS). The highly specialized choroidal tissue synthesizes trophic and angiogenic factors, chemorepellents, and carrier proteins, and is strategically positioned within the ventricular cavities to supply the CNS with these biologically active substances. Through polarized transport systems and receptor-mediated transcytosis across the choroidal epithelium, the CP, a part of the blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB), controls the entry of nutrients, such as amino acids and nucleosides, and peptide hormones, such as leptin and prolactin, from the periphery into the brain. The CP also plays an important role in the clearance of toxins and drugs. During CNS development, CP-derived growth factors, such as members of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily and retinoic acid, play an important role in controlling the patterning of neuronal differentiation in various brain regions. In the adult CNS, the CP appears to be critically involved in neuronal repair processes and the restoration of the brain microenvironment after traumatic and ischemic brain injury. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that the CP acts as a nursery for neuronal and astrocytic progenitor cells. The advancement of our knowledge of the neuroprotective capabilities of the CP may therefore facilitate the development of novel therapies for ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury. In the later stages of life, the CP-CSF axis shows a decline in all aspects of its function, including CSF secretion and protein synthesis, which may in themselves increase the risk for development of late-life diseases, such as normal pressure hydrocephalus and Alzheimer's disease. The understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the dysfunction of the CP-CSF system in the elderly may help discover the treatments needed to reverse the negative effects of aging that lead to global CNS failure.
