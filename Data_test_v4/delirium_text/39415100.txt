39415100|a|BACKGROUND: Persons with dementia frequently experience mealtime behavioral problems that can result in reduced or lack of intake of food or fluids. Multiple underlying causes and expressions of mealtime behavioral problems complicate its interpretation and intervention, because problems originating from cognitive and functional decline and behavioral changes may interact. Healthcare professionals and family caregivers may encounter a variety of practical and moral dilemmas in dealing with these problems. We aimed at a better understanding of mealtime behavioral problems and related complex issues in nursing home residents with dementia from a daily practice perspective. METHODS: We used a mixed-method Group Concept Mapping approach in this study, and collected data online with a panel of 67 healthcare professionals, researchers and relatives from across The Netherlands. The participants contributed to either or all of the following phases: (1) the generation of ideas (brainstorm), (2) sorting, and (3) rating of the ideas. Subsequent phases included data analysis with Groupwisdom  software and interpretation of the results. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis resulted in a concept map visualizing the coherence and importance of ideas. Bridging values were calculated, with low values indicating a distinct, clear concept. RESULTS: Brainstorming resulted in 285 statements representing 85 ideas. The concept map visualized three categories capturing ten clusters which describe the management of mealtime behavioral problems, causes of mealtime behavioral problems, and expressions and interpretations of mealtime behavioral problems. Concepts reflecting direct consequences, ethical components, and considerations to handle challenging situations overlapped on the concept map with the highest bridging values (range 0.58-0.87). CONCLUSION: This study added to unraveling the complex nature of mealtime behavioral problems, as perceived in practice. It is recommended to comprehensively analyze all components in the management of these problems, in particular being aware of ethical factors and align care for residents with dementia accordingly.
