36337409|t|Postoperative myoclonic movement following mandibular cyst enucleation under general anesthesia: A case report.
36337409|a|Postoperative myoclonic movement (PMM) is an uncommon side effect after general anesthesia (GA), and the exact cause of this neurologic complication is still unknown. Many factors such as anesthesia, psychological stresses, and surgical stress could trigger PMM. We are here reporting a case of PMM in the post-anesthetic care unit (PACU) following general anesthesia in an apparently healthy patient.
