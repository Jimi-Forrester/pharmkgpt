RECENT FINDINGS: Dementia clinical syndromes are frequently caused by mixed pathologies, leading to varied clinical presentations that include memory loss, behavioral changes, communication challenges, safety concerns, and loss of independent function. Medications for treating dementia currently target cognitive and behavioral symptoms, although disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer disease may be making their way into widespread clinical practice soon. Identification and treatment of co-occurring medical problems, such as obstructive sleep apnea, adverse medication effects, mood disorders, hearing loss, pain, alcohol misuse, and vascular risk factors, may mitigate the impact of these conditions on cognitive decline. Mobilization of clinical and community-based interprofessional teams will ensure that people with dementia and their care partners have the expertise, support, and access to resources they need. Addressing goals of care early in the disease course will allow people with dementia to contribute to their care plan by expressing their wishes. SUMMARY: Developing a structured approach to treating common causes of dementia and related comorbid medical conditions, identifying a local network of interprofessional clinical and community-based referrals, and providing readily available educational resources will help clinicians provide quality dementia care management that extends beyond the clinic visit. Encouraging patients and families to engage in clinical research will advance the identification of effective therapies, preventive strategies, and quality care models for the future.
