39607636|t|Molecular and Cellular Foundations of Aging of the Brain: Anti-aging Strategies in Alzheimer's Disease.
39607636|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a condition characterized by the gradual degeneration of the nervous system that poses significant challenges to cognitive function and overall mental health. Given the increasing global life expectancy, there is an urgent need for effective strategies to prevent and manage Alzheimer's disease, with a particular focus on anti-aging interventions. Recent scientific advancements have unveiled several promising strategies for combating Alzheimer's disease (AD), ranging from lifestyle interventions to cutting-edge pharmacological treatments and therapies targeting the underlying biological processes of aging and AD. Regular physical exercise, cognitive engagement, a balanced diet, and social interaction serve as key pillars in maintaining brain health. At the same time, therapies target key pathological mechanisms of AD, such as amyloid-beta accumulation, tau abnormalities, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and synaptic loss, offering potential breakthroughs in treatment. Moreover, cutting-edge innovations such as gene therapy, stem cell transplantation, and novel drug delivery systems are emerging as potential game-changers in the fight against AD. This review critically evaluates the latest research on anti-aging interventions and their potential in preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) by exploring the connections between aging mechanisms and AD pathogenesis. It provides a comprehensive analysis of both well-established and emerging strategies, while also identifying key gaps in current knowledge to guide future research efforts.
