32608563|a|Ferroptosis, a form of iron-dependent cell death caused by lipid peroxidation, has been implicated in neurological and other disorders. However, the mechanism of ferroptosis in oligodendrocytes is unclear. We tested the susceptibility of MO3.13 cells, an oligodendrocyte line, to ferroptosis after erastin treatment. Immature MO3.13 cells were more susceptible to erastin-induced ferroptosis than chemically differentiated mature MO3.13 cells. Increased expression of solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11), which encodes a cystine/glutamate transporter, and greater glutathione concentrations were observed in mature compared with immature MO3.13 cells, linking glutathione to the resistance of mature MO3.13 cells to erastin-induced ferroptosis. These findings highlight the usefulness of immature MO3.13 cells in studies of ferroptosis and investigations into neuropathologies that involve oligodendrocytes.
