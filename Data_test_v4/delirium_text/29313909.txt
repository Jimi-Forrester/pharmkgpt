29313909|t|Peri-operative neurological complications.
29313909|a|Brain injury from cardiac surgery is an important source of patient morbidity and mortality. The relationship between risk of brain injury and advanced age portends a rising frequency of these complications due to an increasing proportion of elderly patients undergoing cardiac surgery. This review will explore the aetiology and risk factors for peri-operative stroke, postoperative cognitive dysfunction and postoperative delirium. The prevention of each of these conditions will also be discussed, with a focus on brain protection strategies and the avoidance of cerebral embolism and hypoperfusion.
