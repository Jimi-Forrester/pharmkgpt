23407718|a|OBJECTIVE: To test for an association between the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele and dementias with synucleinopathy. DESIGN: Genetic case-control association study. SETTING: Academic research. PATIENTS: Autopsied subjects were classified into 5 categories: dementia with high-level Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathologic changes (NCs) but without Lewy body disease (LBD) NCs (AD group; n=244), dementia with LBDNCs and high-level ADNCs (LBD-AD group; n=224), dementia with LBDNCs and no or low levels of ADNCs (pure DLB [pDLB] group; n=91), Parkinson disease dementia (PDD) with no or low levels of ADNCs (n=81), and control group (n=269). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The APOE allele frequencies. RESULTS The APOE epsilon4 allele frequency was significantly higher in the AD (38.1%), LBD-AD (40.6%), pDLB (31.9%), and PDD (19.1%) groups compared with the control group (7.2%; overall chi(2)(4)=185.25; P=5.56 x 10(-39)), and it was higher in the pDLB group than the PDD group (P= .01). In an age-adjusted and sex-adjusted dominant model, epsilon4 was strongly associated with AD (odds ratio, 9.9; 95% CI, 6.4-15.3), LBD-AD (odds ratio, 12.6; 95% CI, 8.1-19.8), pDLB (odds ratio, 6.1; 95% CI, 3.5-10.5), and PDD (odds ratio, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.7-5.6). CONCLUSIONS The APOE epsilon4 allele is a strong risk factor across the LBD spectrum and occurs at an increased frequency in pDLB relative to PDD. This suggests that epsilon4 increases the likelihood of presenting with dementia in the context of a pure synucleinopathy. The elevated epsilon4 frequency in the pDLB and PDD groups, in which the overall brain neuritic plaque burden was low, indicates that apoE might contribute to neurodegeneration through mechanisms unrelated to amyloid processing.
