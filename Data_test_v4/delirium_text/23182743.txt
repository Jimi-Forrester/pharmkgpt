23182743|a|The developmental potential of human embryos has important implications in assisted reproduction and depends, among other factors, on oocyte competency. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a member of the superfamily of immunoglobulin cell-surface molecules that are constitutively expressed during embryonic development. RAGE is down-regulated in homeostasis in adult life. This study measured the concentration of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) in follicular fluid obtained from the leading follicle after ovarian stimulation of 54 women undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Corresponding embryos and sRAGE concentrations in follicular fluid were evaluated and correlations were investigated by multi-adjusted regression analysis. High intrafollicular sRAGE concentrations predicted poor-quality embryos (n=45, OR=0.986; P=0.026), adjusted for patient age, body mass index and oocyte quality, showing an inverse association between intrafollicular sRAGE concentrations and embryo development. The developmental potential of human embryos has important implications in assisted reproduction, and it depends, among other factors, on oocyte competency. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a molecule constitutively expressed during embryonic development, but it is down-regulated in adult life. RAGE is frequently associated with pro-inflammatory responses, and it is implicated as an underlying condition in immune disorders, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and cancer. In addition to activating the pro-inflammatory responses, RAGE down-regulates cellular defence mechanisms. The present study measured the concentrations of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) in follicular fluid samples obtained from leading follicles of women undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). This prospective cohort study included 54 patients undergoing ICSI, and follicular fluid samples were obtained from the leading follicle after ovarian stimulation. The corresponding embryos were evaluated and correlations with intrafollicular sRAGE concentrations were investigated using multi-adjusted regression analysis. We observed that high intrafollicular concentrations of sRAGE predicted poor embryo quality. Our findings suggest an association between high concentrations of intrafollicular sRAGE and poor embryo development following ovarian stimulation for ICSI.
