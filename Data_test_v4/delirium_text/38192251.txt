38192251|t|The Effect of Biomaterials on Human Dental Pulp Stem Cell Neural Differentiation: A Scoping Review.
38192251|a|Neural cells are the most important components of the nervous system and have the duty of electrical signal transmission. Damage to these cells can lead to neurological disorders. Scientists have discovered different methods, such as stem cell therapy, to heal or regenerate damaged neural cells. Dental stem cells are among the different cells used in this method. This review attempts to evaluate the effect of biomaterials mentioned in the cited papers on differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) into neural cells for use in stem cell therapy of neurological disorders. We searched international databases for articles about the effect of biomaterials on neuronal differentiation of hDPSCs. The relevant articles were screened by title, abstract, and full text, followed by selection and data extraction. Totally, we identified 731 articles and chose 18 for inclusion in the study. A total of four studies employed polymeric scaffolds, four assessed chitosan scaffolds (CS), two utilised hydrogel scaffolds, one investigation utilised decellularised extracellular matrix (ECM), and six studies applied the floating sphere technique. hDPSCs could heal nerve damage in regenerative medicine. In the third iteration of nerve conduits, scaffolds, stem cells, regulated growth factor release, and ECM proteins restore major nerve damage. hDPSCs must differentiate into neural cells or neuron-like cells to regenerate nerves. Plastic-adherent cultures, floating dentosphere cultures, CS, polymeric scaffolds, hydrogels, and ECM mimics have been used to differentiate hDPSCs. According to our findings, the floating dentosphere technique and 3D-PLAS are currently the two best techniques since they result in neuroprogenitor cells, which are the starting point of differentiation and they can turn into any desired neural cell.
