19788928|t|Prostaglandin E2 at new glance: novel insights in functional diversity offer therapeutic chances.
19788928|a|Prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) is the most abundant eicosanoid and a very potent lipid mediator. PGE(2) is produced predominantly from arachidonic acid by its tightly regulated cyclooxygenases (COX) and prostaglandin E synthases (PGES). Secreted PGE(2) acts in an autocrine or paracrine manner through its four cognate G protein coupled receptors EP1 to EP4. Under physiological conditions, PGE(2) is key in many biological functions, such as regulation of immune responses, blood pressure, gastrointestinal integrity, and fertility. Deregulated PGE(2) synthesis or degradation is associated with severe pathological conditions like chronic inflammation, Alzheimer's disease, or tumorigenesis. Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of COX enzymes and PGE(2) receptor antagonism is of great therapeutic interest.
