34870152|a|Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, has been approved for use in the treatment of severe COVID-19, which is characterised by hyperinflammation and associated lung damage. However, dexamethasone shows no clinical benefit in the treatment of less severe disease, and prolonged treatment may lead to immunosuppression and an increased risk of opportunistic infections. Hence there is a need for more specific anti-inflammatory therapies which also prevent severe disease. The NLRP3 inflammasome is an intracellular signalling complex which is responsible for the cleavage and release of the cytokines IL-1beta and IL-18 and has also been shown to be inhibited by dexamethasone. NLRP3 inflammasome activation is strongly correlated with COVID-19 severity and part of dexamethasone's clinical effect in COVID-19 may be via NLRP3 inhibition. Specific NLRP3 inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. In this review, we evaluate the evidence supporting the use of dexamethasone and speculate on the potential use of NLRP3 inhibitors to treat COVID-19 as a more specific approach that may not have the liabilities of dexamethasone.
