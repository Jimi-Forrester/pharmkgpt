39674824|t|Evolving strategies for addressing CAR T-cell toxicities.
39674824|a|The field of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has grown from a fully experimental concept to now boasting a multitude of treatments including six FDA-approved products targeting various hematologic malignancies. Yet, along with their efficacy, these therapies come with side effects requiring timely and thoughtful interventions. In this review, we discuss the most common toxicities associated with CAR T-cells to date, highlighting risk factors, prognostication, implications for critical care management, patient experience optimization, and ongoing work in the field of toxicity mitigation. Understanding the current state of the field and standards of practice is critical in order to improve and manage potential toxicities of both current and novel CAR T-cell therapies as they are applied in the clinic.
