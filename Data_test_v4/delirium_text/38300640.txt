38300640|t|Association of Plasma Markers of Alzheimer's Disease, Neurodegeneration, and Neuroinflammation with the Choroid Plexus Integrity in Aging.
38300640|a|The choroid plexus (CP) is a vital brain structure essential for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production. Moreover, alterations in the CP's structure and function are implicated in molecular conditions and neuropathologies including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. Our goal is to provide the first characterization of the association between variation in the CP microstructure and macrostructure/volume using advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methodology, and blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (Ass42/40 ratio; pTau181), neuroinflammation and neuronal injury (GFAP; NfL). We hypothesized that plasma biomarkers of brain pathology are associated with disordered CP structure. Moreover, since cerebral microstructural changes can precede macrostructural changes, we also conjecture that these differences would be evident in the CP microstructural integrity. Our cross-sectional study was conducted on a cohort of 108 well-characterized individuals, spanning 22-94 years of age, after excluding participants with cognitive impairments and non-exploitable MR imaging data. Established automated segmentation methods were used to identify the CP volume/macrostructure using structural MR images, while the microstructural integrity of the CP was assessed using our advanced quantitative high-resolution MR imaging of longitudinal and transverse relaxation times (T1 and T2). After adjusting for relevant covariates, positive associations were observed between pTau181, NfL and GFAP and all MRI metrics. These associations reached significance (p<0.05) except for CP volume vs. pTau181 (p=0.14), CP volume vs. NfL (p=0.35), and T2 vs. NFL (p=0.07). Further, negative associations between Ass42/40 and all MRI metrics were observed but reached significance only for Ass42/40 vs. T2 (p=0.04). These novel findings demonstrate that reduced CP macrostructural and microstructural integrity is positively associated with blood-based biomarkers of AD pathology, neurodegeneration/neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Degradation of the CP structure may co-occur with AD pathology and neuroinflammation ahead of clinically detectable cognitive impairment, making the CP a potential structure of interest for early disease detection or treatment monitoring.
