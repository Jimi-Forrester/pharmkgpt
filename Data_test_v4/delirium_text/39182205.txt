39182205|a|PURPOSE: Remimazolam is often used for perioperative sedation due to its rapid onset and offset. However, the possible association between remimazolam and postoperative delirium (POD) remains undetermined. The present study evaluated whether remimazolam increased the incidence of POD compared with dexmedetomidine in elderly patients undergoing orthopedic surgery of the lower extremities. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients aged >= 65 years who had undergone orthopedic surgery of the lower extremities under spinal anesthesia from January 2020 to November 2022 and were sedated with continuous intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine or remimazolam. The incidence of POD was assessed through a validated comprehensive review process of each patient's medical records. The effect of remimazolam on the occurrence of POD compared with dexmedetomidine was evaluated by propensity score weighted multivariable logistic models. RESULTS: A total of 447 patients were included in the final analysis. The crude incidence of POD within 3 days after surgery was 7.5% (17/226) in the dexmedetomidine group and 11.8% (26/221) in the remimazolam group, increasing to 9.7% (22/226) and 15.8% (35/221), respectively (p = 0.073), within 5 days. The multivariable models showed that, compared with dexmedetomidine, intraoperative sedation with remimazolam significantly increased the occurrence of POD within 3 days (odds ratio [OR] 2.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31 to 3.82, p = 0.003) and 5 days (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.40, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Compared with dexmedetomidine, remimazolam infusion may be associated with a higher risk of POD in elderly patients undergoing orthopedic surgery of the lower extremities under spinal anesthesia.
