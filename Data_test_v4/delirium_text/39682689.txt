39682689|a|BACKGROUND: Regular physical activity plays a crucial role in modulating cellular metabolism and mitigating the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Multiple Sclerosis. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to evaluate the molecular mechanisms by which exercise influences cellular metabolism, with a focus on its potential as a therapeutic intervention for neurological disorders. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted using peer-reviewed scientific articles, with a focus on the period between 2015 and 2024, to analyze the effects of exercise on mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and metabolic health. RESULTS: The findings indicate that exercise promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, enhances oxidative phosphorylation, and reduces reactive oxygen species, contributing to improved energy production and cellular resilience. These metabolic adaptations are associated with delayed disease progression and reduced symptoms in patients with neurodegenerative conditions. Additionally, integrating exercise with nutritional strategies may further enhance therapeutic outcomes by addressing metabolic disturbances comprehensively. CONCLUSIONS: This review concludes that personalized exercise protocols should be developed to optimize metabolic benefits for patients with neurological diseases, while future research should focus on biomarker development for individualized treatment approaches. These findings highlight the importance of non-pharmacological interventions in managing neurodegenerative diseases.
