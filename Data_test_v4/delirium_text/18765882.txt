18765882|a|BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Cerebral hypoxia is known to be involved in many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and cerebrovascular dementia. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of flavonoids from aerial part of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (SSF) on potassium cyanide (KCN) -induced hypoxic cytotoxicity in rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12, and to understand the probable mechanism. METHODS: The rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 was subjected to hypoxia by 200 microM KCN for 30 min. The cytotoxicity of KCN was assessed by cell viability assay, morphological observation, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, malondialdehyde (MDA) production, and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Na+-K+-ATPase measurements. The effects of SSF on the changes induced by KCN in PC12 cells were detected. RESULTS: Treatment of PC12 cells with 200 micriM KCN for 30 min increased cell death when compared with control, as assayed by MTT reduction, morphological observation and lactate dehydrogenase release measurement. These cell lesions were accompanied by disorders in SOD and Na+-K+-ATPase activities as well as MDA production. In contrast, the PC12 cells pre-treated with SSF for 24 h prior to 200 microM KCN exposure have shown protection against hypoxic toxicity. The KCN - induced decreased cell viability and activities of SOD and Na+-K+-ATPase, as well as increased MDA production were reversed by SSF pre-treatment. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: SSF exerted neuroprotections against KCN - induced hypoxic cytotoxicity in PC12 cells and the probable mechanisms involved free radicals and energy metabolism. Our findings may have implications in future in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
