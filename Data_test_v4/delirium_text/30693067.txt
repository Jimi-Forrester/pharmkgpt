30693067|t|Effect of Alkaloid Extract from African Jointfir (Gnetum africanum) Leaves on Manganese-Induced Toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster.
30693067|a|Metal-induced toxicity in fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is one of the established models for studying neurotoxicity and neurodegenerative diseases. Phytochemicals, especially alkaloids, have been reported to exhibit neuroprotection. Here, we assessed the protective effect of alkaloid extract from African Jointfir (Gnetum africanum) leaf on manganese- (Mn-) induced toxicity in wild type fruit fly. Flies were exposed to 10 mM Mn, the alkaloid extract and cotreatment of Mn plus extract, respectively. The survival rate and locomotor performance of the flies were assessed 5 days posttreatment, at which point the flies were homogenized and assayed for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, nitric oxide (NO), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Results showed that the extract significantly reverted Mn-induced reduction in the survival rate and locomotor performance of the flies. Furthermore, the extract counteracted the Mn-induced elevation in AChE activity, NO, and ROS levels. The alkaloid extract of the African Jointfir leaf may hence be a source of useful phytochemicals for the development of novel therapies for the management of neurodegeneration.
