34267610|a|Brain-related disorders are leading global health problems. Various internal and external factors are involved in the progression of brain-related disorders. Inflammatory pathways, oxidative stresses, apoptosis, and deregulations of various channels are critical players in brain-related disorder pathogenesis. Among these players, aquaporins (AQP) have critical roles in various physiological and pathological conditions. AQPs are water channel molecules that permit water to cross the hydrophobic lipid bilayers of cellular membranes. AQP4 is one of the important members of AQP family. AQPs are involved in controlling apoptosis pathways in brain-related disorders. In this regard, several reports have evaluated the pathological effects of AQP4 by targeting the apoptosis-related processes in brain-related disorders. Here, for the first time, we highlight the impact of AQP4 on apoptosis-related processes in brain-related disorders.
