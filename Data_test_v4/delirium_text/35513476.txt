35513476|a|Tau accumulation and progressive loss of neurons are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aggregation of tau has been associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). While ER stress and the UPR have been linked to AD, the contribution of these pathways to tau-mediated neuronal death is still unknown. We tested the hypothesis that reducing C/EBP Homologous Protein (CHOP), a UPR induced transcription factor associated with cell death, would mitigate tau-mediated neurotoxicity through the ER stress pathway. To evaluate this, 8.5-month-old male rTg4510 tau transgenic mice were injected with a CHOP-targeting or scramble shRNA AAV9 that also expressed EGFP. Following behavioral assessment, brain tissue was collected at 12 months, when ER stress and neuronal loss is ongoing. No behavioral differences in locomotion, anxiety-like behavior, or learning and memory were found in shCHOP mice. Unexpectedly, mice expressing shCHOP had higher levels of CHOP, which did not affect neuronal count, UPR effector (ATF4), or tau tangles. Overall, this suggests that CHOP is a not a main contributor to neuronal death in rTg4510 mice. Taken together with previous studies, we conclude that ER stress, including CHOP upregulation, does not worsen outcomes in the tauopathic brain.
