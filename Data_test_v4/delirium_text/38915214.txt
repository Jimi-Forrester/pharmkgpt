38915214|a|ABSTRACT: Neurological diseases are a major health concern, and brain injury is a typical pathological process in various neurological disorders. Different biomarkers in the blood or the cerebrospinal fluid are associated with specific physiological and pathological processes. They are vital in identifying, diagnosing, and treating brain injuries. In this review, we described biomarkers for neuronal cell body injury (neuron-specific enolase, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1, alphaII-spectrin), axonal injury (neurofilament proteins, tau), astrocyte injury (S100beta, glial fibrillary acidic protein), demyelination (myelin basic protein), autoantibodies, and other emerging biomarkers (extracellular vesicles, microRNAs). We aimed to summarize the applications of these biomarkers and their related interests and limits in the diagnosis and prognosis for neurological diseases, including traumatic brain injury, status epilepticus, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and infection. In addition, a reasonable outlook for brain injury biomarkers as ideal detection tools for neurological diseases is presented.
