20580132|t|A PIN1 polymorphism that prevents its suppression by AP4 associates with delayed onset of Alzheimer's disease.
20580132|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is characterized by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles composed of tau and senile plaques of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP). Pin1 is a unique prolyl isomerase that has been shown to protect against age-dependent neurodegeneration by acting on phosphorylated tau and APP to suppress tangle formation and amyloidogenic APP processing. Here we report a functional polymorphism, rs2287839, in the Pin1 promoter that is significantly associated with a 3-year delay in the average age at onset (AAO) of late-onset AD in a Chinese population. More significantly, the Pin1 polymorphism rs2287839 is located within the consensus binding motif for the brain-selective transcription factor, AP4 (CAGCTG) and almost completely abolishes the ability of AP4 to bind and suppress the Pin1 promoter, as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and promoter luciferase assay. Moreover, overexpression or knockdown of AP4 resulted in an 80% reduction or 2-fold increase in endogenous Pin1 levels, respectively. Thus, AP4 is a novel transcriptional repressor of Pin1 expression and the Pin1 promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identified in this study that prevents such suppression is associated with delayed onset of AD. These results indicate that regulation of Pin1 by AP4 plays a critical role in determining age at onset of AD and might be a novel therapeutic target to delay the onset of AD.
