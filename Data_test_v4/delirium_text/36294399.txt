36294399|t|Intraoperative Assessment of Surgical Stress Response Using Nociception Monitor under General Anesthesia and Postoperative Complications: A Narrative Review.
36294399|a|We present a narrative review focusing on the new role of nociception monitor in intraoperative anesthetic management. Higher invasiveness of surgery elicits a higher degree of surgical stress responses including neuroendocrine-metabolic and inflammatory-immune responses, which are associated with the occurrence of major postoperative complications. Conversely, anesthetic management mitigates these responses. Furthermore, improper attenuation of nociceptive input and related autonomic effects may induce increased stress response that may adversely influence outcome even in minimally invasive surgeries. The original role of nociception monitor, which is to assess a balance between nociception caused by surgical trauma and anti-nociception due to anesthesia, may allow an assessment of surgical stress response. The goal of this review is to inform healthcare professionals providing anesthetic management that nociception monitors may provide intraoperative data associated with surgical stress responses, and to inspire new research into the effects of nociception monitor-guided anesthesia on postoperative complications.
