35214742|a|This study aimed to observe adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs) that affected recovery within two weeks after COVID-19 vaccination and investigate their risks in propensity-score-matched populations. Data were collected from 447,346 reports from the VAERS between 1 January 2021 and 31 July 2021. Propensity-score-matched populations were constructed by adjusting for demographic characteristics and 11 underlying diseases in eligible subjects who received 1 of 3 COVID-19 vaccines: 19,462 Ad26.COV2.S, 120,580 mRNA-1273, and 100,752 BNT162b2. We observed that 88 suspected AEFIs (22 in Ad26.COV2.S, 62 in mRNA-1273, and 54 in BNT162b2) were associated with an increased risk of delayed recovery within 2 weeks after COVID-19 vaccinations. Nervous system, musculoskeletal and connective tissue, gastrointestinal, skin, and subcutaneous tissue disorders were the most common AEFIs after COVID-19 vaccination. Interestingly, four local and systemic reactions affected recovery in different vaccine recipients during our study period: asthenic conditions and febrile disorders in Ad26.COV2.S and mRNA-1273; general signs and symptoms in mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2; injection site reactions in Ad26.COV2.S and BNT162b2. Although it is necessary to confirm a causal relationship with COVID-19 vaccinations, some symptoms, including paralysis, allergic disorders, breathing abnormalities, and visual impairment, may hinder the recovery of these recipients.
