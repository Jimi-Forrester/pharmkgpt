36194395|a|BACKGROUND: Abnormal sleep is commonly observed in the ICU and is associated with delirium and increased mortality. If sedation is necessary, it is often performed with gamma-aminobutyric acid agonists such as propofol or midazolam leading to an absence of restorative sleep. We aim to evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine on sleep quality and quantity. METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients were included. The study was conducted as a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with two parallel groups: 20 patients were treated with dexmedetomidine, and 10 with placebo. Two 16 h of polysomnography recordings were done for each patient on two consecutive nights. Patients were randomized to dexmedetomidine or placebo after the first recording, thus providing a control recording for all patients. Dexmedetomidine was administered during the second recording (6 p.m.-6 a.m.). OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of dexmedetomidine versus. placebo on sleep - quality and quantity. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Sleep quality, total sleep time (TST), Sleep efficiency (SE), and Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep determined by Polysomnography (PSG). SECONDARY OUTCOME: Delirium and daytime function determined by Confusion Assessment Method of the Intensive Care Unit and physical activity. Alertness and wakefulness were determined by RASS (Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale). RESULTS: SE were increased in the dexmedetomidine group by; 37.6% (29.7;45.6 95% CI) versus 3.7% (-11.4;18.8 95% CI) (p < .001) and TST were prolonged by 271 min. (210;324 95% CI) versus 27 min. (-82;135 95% CI), (p < .001). No significant difference in REM sleep, delirium physical activity, or RASS score was found except for RASS night two. CONCLUSION: Total sleep time and sleep efficiency were significantly increased, without elimination of REM sleep, in mechanically ventilated ICU patients randomized to dexmedetomidine, when compared to a control PSG recording performed during non-sedation/standard care.
