34411006|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is often treated on a subjective basis and per the discretion of the attending physician because of a lack of pharmacological evidence in the literature. To address this knowledge gap, we aimed to examine the efficacy of a hypnotic drug, suvorexant, as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of delirium. METHODS: Fifty-seven patients were targeted. Of the 57 patients, 39 were in the subolexant group, 17 in the antipsychotic group, and 1 was taking antidepressants. The Delirium Rating Scale-Revised 98 was used to evaluate the symptoms of delirium before and 3 and 7 days after drug administration. In addition, the medical history, occurrence of adverse effects, white blood cell count, and C-reactive protein level of participants were examined. RESULTS: Both drugs exhibited therapeutic effects on delirium, but suvorexant had a more pronounced effect. Furthermore, the suvorexant group exhibited decreased levels of C-reactive protein, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect. Suvorexant seems to improve the symptoms of inflammation-related delirium without any serious adverse effects, suggesting that it can be explored as a safe treatment option for clinical use in future studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings will be relevant for physicians interested in learning about new pharmacological treatment options and researchers interested in validating our results.
