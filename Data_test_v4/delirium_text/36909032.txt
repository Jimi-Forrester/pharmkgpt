36909032|t|Distributed Caregiving for Cognitively Impaired Individuals: A Case Report.
36909032|a|Many caregivers of people with cognitive impairment spend a significant amount of their time helping patients with instrumental daily functions. Distributed caregiving is an innovative model designed to reduce an individual caregiver's time burden and increase the likelihood of continued independent living for the patient. Echo Show and Google Home platforms were used to enable the participation of remote family members in caregiving, specifically the socialization and entertainment of a person with cognitive impairment. Caregiver interviews, review of medical records, and case study analysis were used to measure caregiver burden, after distributing some components of caregiving to distant family members with human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence. This case explores the use of Alexa, Echo Show, and other commercial technologies in the management of a patient with cognitive impairment. The human-in-the-loop system introduced in this case study is a creative, accessible, low-cost, and sustainable way to potentially reduce caregiver burden and improve patient outcomes with targeted intervention. Targeted distributed caregiving reduced time spent in caregiving, reduced caregiver guilt and frustration, improved patient's compliance with requests for behavior changes (e.g., voiding before leaving the house), and improved the relationship between the caregiver and the person with cognitive impairment. This case study demonstrates how distributed caregiving, including human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence, can lead to better use of technology in reducing the social isolation of persons with cognitive impairment and in reducing caregiver burden.
