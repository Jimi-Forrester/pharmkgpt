39839177|t|Neuropsychiatric Manifestations of Syphilis.
39839177|a|Neurosyphilis is a condition characterized by insidious onset of encephalopathy and delirium. The infrequency with which it is encountered makes neurosyphilis a formidable diagnostic challenge. We present a rare case of a 71-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), undifferentiated arthritis and alcohol use disorder who was brought to the emergency department after he was found altered, confused, and paranoid. His hospital stay was eventful for multiple episodes of agitation that were difficult to control despite benzodiazepines and high doses of antipsychotics. After an extensive workup, he was found to have neurosyphilis and his delirium resolved following a brief period of treatment. This case illustrates the importance of early suspicion for neurosyphilis as a cause of delirium, especially in endemic areas and in patients with focal neurologic findings.
