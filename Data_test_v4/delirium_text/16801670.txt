16801670|t|Family history of dementia is a risk factor for Lewy body disease.
16801670|a|Genetic factors are important in Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease but have not been well characterized in Lewy body dementia (LBD). The authors obtained family history in patients from an autopsy series of AD and LBD and in living healthy controls. A family history of dementia was more common in both LBD and AD compared with controls, suggesting that genetic factors are as important in LBD as they are in AD.
