35607267|t|A 62-Year-Old Man Presenting with Bilateral Tremor of the Upper Limb After a Diagnosis of COVID-19 with Confirmed Volumetric Brain Loss.
35607267|a|BACKGROUND The SARS-CoV-2 viral infection is associated with respiratory and multi-organ systemic disease. It has been shown to affect the central nervous system and produce varied neurological symptoms, including ischemic strokes, seizures, and encephalitis. Neurological manifestations of this viral infection are thought to be due to neurotropic reactions on the central nervous system or post-infectious immune-mediated damage. This report presents a case of bilateral tremor of the upper limbs more than 6 weeks after a diagnosis of COVID-19, with confirmed volumetric brain loss shown by follow-up brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with 3-dimensional volumetric NeuroQuant image analysis. CASE REPORT We report a case of new-onset tremors in a 62-year-old man after SARS-CoV-2 infection. MRI of the brain was performed shortly after the onset of tremors, and a follow-up MRI after 2 months showed evidence of rapid parenchymal volume, loss of midbrain substance, and increased cerebrospinal fluid volume within 2 months of the initial examination. CONCLUSIONS This case report shows central neurological effects of COVID-19, which can be evaluated by quantitative volumetric MRI analysis, although further studies are warranted to determine how this type of brain imaging can be used to evaluate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection over time.
