34944621|a|According to statistics 2020, female breast cancer (BRCA) became the most commonly diagnosed malignancy worldwide. Prognosis of BRCA patients is still poor, especially in population with advanced or metastatic. Particular functions of each members of the solute carrier 35A (SLC35A) gene family in human BRCA are still unknown regardless of awareness that they play critical roles in tumorigenesis and progression. Using integrated bioinformatics analyses to identify therapeutic targets for specific cancers based on transcriptomics, proteomics, and high-throughput sequencing, we obtained new information and a better understanding of potential underlying molecular mechanisms. Leveraging BRCA dataset that belongs to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which were employed to clarify SLC35A gene expression levels. Then we used a bioinformatics approach to investigate biological processes connected to SLC35A family genes in BRCA development. Beside that, the Kaplan-Meier estimator was leveraged to explore predictive values of SLC35A family genes in BCRA patients. Among individuals of this family gene, expression levels of SLC35A2 were substantially related to poor prognostic values, result from a hazard ratio of 1.3 (with 95 percent confidence interval (95% CI: 1.18-1.44), the p for trend (ptrend) is 3.1 x 10-7). Furthermore, a functional enrichment analysis showed that SLC35A2 was correlated with hypoxia-inducible factor 1A (HIF1A), heat shock protein (HSP), E2 transcription factor (E2F), DNA damage, and cell cycle-related signaling. Infiltration levels observed in specific types of immune cell, especially the cluster of differentiation found on macrophages and neutrophils, were positively linked with SLC35A2 expression in multiple BRCA subclasses (luminal A, luminal B, basal, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2). Collectively, SLC35A2 expression was associated with a lower recurrence-free survival rate, suggesting that it could be used as a biomarker in treating BRCA.
