36425052|t|The Effect of Aluminum Exposure on Maternal Health and Fetal Growth in Rats.
36425052|a|Background This study was performed on female rats to study the effect of oral administration of low dose versus high dose of aluminum chloride (AlCl3) during the period of organogenesis on the maternal and fetal growth parameters. Methods In this study, female mature nulliparous Sprague-Dawley albino rats were used. After mating and confirmation of pregnancy, successfully mated females were divided into three groups (six rats each): control group, low-dose (LD) AlCl3 group, and high-dose (HD) AlCl3 group. The rats were sacrificed at gestational day 20 (GD20) when the liver and kidneys were excised and weighed. Also, the gravid uterine horns were excised and weighed, the placentae and fetuses were extracted and weighed, and fetal growth parameters were assessed. Results Maternal AlCl3 exposure produced an increase in preimplantation losses and resorptions in LD and HD AlCl3 groups. Consequently, there was a decrease in the number of corpora lutea, total implantations, live fetuses, and litter size. Also, the body weight gain, gravid uterine, placental and maternal liver, and maternal kidney weights of both AlCl3-treated groups were significantly reduced in comparison with the control group. There was a statistically significant reduction in fetal biparietal diameter (BPD), head length (HL), crown-rump length (CRL), and fetal body weight. All the above changes were dose-dependent, being more evident with the high dose of AlCl3. Conclusion AlCl3 exposure during pregnancy results in different degrees of adverse effects on maternal weight gain and fetal growth and organ parameters, which followed a dose-dependent manner.
