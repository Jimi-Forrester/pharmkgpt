30366255|t|Investigating alkyl nitrates as nitric oxide releasing precursors of multitarget acetylcholinesterase-monoamine oxidase B inhibitors.
30366255|a|Herein we envisaged the possibility of exploiting alkyl nitrates as precursors of alcohol-bearing dual inhibitors targeting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and monoamine oxidase B (MAO B), key enzymes in neurodegenerative syndromes such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), through biotransformation unmasking an alcoholic function upon nitric oxide (NO) release. The cooperation to neuroprotection of low fluxes of NO and target enzymes' inhibition by the alcohol metabolites might return a multitargeting effect. The in vitro screening towards ChEs and MAOs of a collection of 21 primary alcohols disclosed a subset of dual inhibitors, among which three diverse chemotypes were selected to study the corresponding nitrates. Nitrate 14 proved to be a brain permeant, potent AChE-MAO B inhibitor by itself. Moreover, it protected human SH-SY5Y lines against rotenone and hydrogen peroxide with a poor inherent cytotoxicity and showed a slow conversion profile to its alcohol metabolite 9d that still behaved as bimodal and neuroprotective molecule.
