39235580|t|A Retrospective Tribute to Dr. Harish Pant (1938-2023) and His Seminal Work on Cyclin Dependent Kinase 5.
39235580|a|Dr. Harish Chandra Pant was Chief of the Section on Neuronal Cytoskeletal Protein Regulation within the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the NIH. A main focus of his group was understanding the mechanisms regulating neuronal cytoskeletal phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of neurofilaments can increase filament stability and confer resistance to proteolysis, but aberrant hyperphosphorylation of neurofilaments can be found in the neurofibrillary tangles that are seen with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer disease (AD). Through his work, Harish would inevitably come across cyclin dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a key kinase that can phosphorylate neurofilaments at KSPXK motifs. Cdk5 differs from other Cdks in that its activity is mainly in post-mitotic neurons rather than being involved in the cell cycle in dividing cells. With continued interest in Cdk5, Harish and his group were instrumental in identifying important roles for this neuronal kinase in not only neuronal cytoskeleton phosphorylation but also in neuronal development, synaptogenesis, and neuronal survival. Here, we review the accomplishments of Harish in characterizing the functions of Cdk5 and its involvement in neuronal health and disease.
