37996846|t|Efficacy of a modified FRAIL scale in predicting the peri-operative outcome of hepatectomy in older adults (aged >= 75 years): a model development study.
37996846|a|BACKGROUND: The FRAIL scale for evaluating frailty consists of five items: fatigue, resistance, aerobic, illness, and loss of weight. However, it is difficult to obtain a specific weight loss value. Since the Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT) is simple, accurate, and easy to perform, we replaced weight loss with the TUGT in the FRAIL scale, with the remaining four items unchanged, and named it the FRAIT scale. The aim of this study was to determine the value of the FRAIT scale in predicting the peri-operative outcome of hepatectomy. METHODS: This model development study was conducted between January 2017 and December 2021. The reliability, validity and area under the curve (AUC) of the FRAIL/FRAIT scales were calculated. The frailty status of patients aged >= 75 years who underwent hepatectomy was measured using the FRAIL/FRAIT scales. Logistic regression was used to compare the relationship between FRAIL/FRAIT scores/grades and perioperative outcomes. RESULTS: The AUCs for predicting operation duration, intraoperative bleeding, complications, and death based on the FRAIL score were 0.692, 0.740, 0.709, and 0.733, respectively, and those based on the FRAIT score were 0.700, 0.745, 0.708, and 0.724, respectively. The AUCs for predicting operation duration, intraoperative bleeding, complications, and death based on the FRAIL grade were 0.693, 0.735, 0.695, and 0.755, respectively, and those based on the FRAIT grades were 0.700, 0.758, 0.699, and 0.750, respectively. The FRAIL score has three effective predictors (intraoperative bleeding, complications, and death), while the FRAIT score has four effective predictors (operation duration, intraoperative bleeding, complications, and death). The FRAIL grade has two effective predictors (intraoperative bleeding and death), while the FRAIT grade has three effective predictors (operation duration, intraoperative bleeding, and death). CONCLUSIONS: This study describes a new and more effective tool for the assessment of preoperative frailty in older adults undergoing hepatectomy. The items of the FRAIT scale are easier to obtain than those of the FRAIL scale, and the predictive effect of the FRAIT scale is stronger than that of the FRAIL scale.
