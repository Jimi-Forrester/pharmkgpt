27965233|t|Research in Review: Advancing Critical Care Practice.
27965233|a|Research published in 2016 identified strategies to enhance acute and critical care, initiated discussions on professional roles and responsibilities, clarified complex care issues, and led to robust debate. Some of this important work addressed strategies to prevent delirium and pressure ulcers, considerations for pain management within the context of the opioid abuse crisis, strategies to guide fluid resuscitation in patients with sepsis and heart failure, and ways to enhance care for family members of intensive care patients. The new sepsis definitions highlight the importance of detecting and providing care to patients with sepsis outside of critical care areas. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy is an example of the advancement of research in genomics and personalized medicine and of the need to understand the care implications of these therapies. Other research topics include interprofessional collaboration and shared decision-making as well as nurses' role in family conferences. Resources such as policies related to medical futility and inappropriate care and the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses' healthy work environment standards may inform conversations and provide strategies to address these complex issues.
