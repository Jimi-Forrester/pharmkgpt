32414948|t|Asymmetry of Fibrillar Plaque Burden in Amyloid Mouse Models.
32414948|a|Asymmetries of amyloid-beta (Abeta) burden are well known in Alzheimer disease (AD) but did not receive attention in Abeta mouse models of Alzheimer disease. Therefore, we investigated Abeta asymmetries in Abeta mouse models examined by Abeta small-animal PET and tested if such asymmetries have an association with microglial activation. Methods: We analyzed 523 cross-sectional Abeta PET scans of 5 different Abeta mouse models (APP/PS1, PS2APP, APP-SL70, AppNL-G-F , and APPswe) together with 136 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) PET scans for microglial activation. The asymmetry index (AI) was calculated between tracer uptake in both hemispheres. AIs of Abeta PET were analyzed in correlation with TSPO PET AIs. Extrapolated required sample sizes were compared between analyses of single and combined hemispheres. Results: Relevant asymmetries of Abeta deposition were identified in at least 30% of all investigated mice. There was a significant correlation between AIs of Abeta PET and TSPO PET in 4 investigated Abeta mouse models (APP/PS1: R = 0.593, P = 0.001; PS2APP: R = 0.485, P = 0.019; APP-SL70: R = 0.410, P = 0.037; AppNL-G-F : R = 0.385, P = 0.002). Asymmetry was associated with higher variance of tracer uptake in single hemispheres, leading to higher required sample sizes. Conclusion: Asymmetry of fibrillar plaque neuropathology occurs frequently in Abeta mouse models and acts as a potential confounder in experimental designs. Concomitant asymmetry of microglial activation indicates a neuroinflammatory component to hemispheric predominance of fibrillary amyloidosis.
