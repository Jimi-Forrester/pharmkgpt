39816189|a|The largest risk factor for dementia is age. Heterochronic blood exchange studies have uncovered age-related blood factors that demonstrate 'pro-aging' or 'pro-youthful' effects on the mouse brain. The clinical relevance and combined effects of these factors for humans is unclear. We examined five previously identified brain rejuvenation factors in cerebrospinal fluid of adults with autosomal dominant forms of frontotemporal dementia and sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Our frontotemporal dementia cohort included 100 observationally followed adults carrying autosomal dominant frontotemporal dementia mutations (Mage = 49.6; 50% female; 43% C9orf72, 24% GRN, 33% MAPT) and 62 non-carriers (Mage = 52.6; 45% female) with cerebrospinal fluid analysed on Somascan, and longitudinal (Mvisits = 3 years, range 1-7 years) neuropsychological and functional assessments and plasma neurofilament light chain. Our Alzheimer's disease cohort included 35 adults with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (Mage = 69.4; 60% female) and 56 controls (Mage = 68.8, 50% female) who completed the same cerebrospinal fluid and clinical outcome measures cross-sectionally. Levels of C-C motif chemokine ligand 11, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2, beta-2-micorglobulin, bone gamma-carboxyglutamate protein (aka Osteocalcin) and colony stimulating factor 2 in cerebrospinal fluid were linearly combined into a composite score, with higher values reflecting 'pro-youthful' levels. In genetic frontotemporal dementia, higher baseline cerebrospinal fluid rejuvenation proteins predicted slower decline across cognitive, functional, and neurofilament light chain trajectories; estimates were similar across genotypes. In transdiagnostic analyses, higher cerebrospinal fluid rejuvenation proteins associated with better functional, cognitive, and neurofilament light chain outcomes in adults with sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Proteins with pre-clinical evidence for brain rejuvenation show translational clinical relevance in adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and warrant further investigation.
