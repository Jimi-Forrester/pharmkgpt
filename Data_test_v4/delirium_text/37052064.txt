37052064|t|Is There a "Black Friday" for Geriatric Hip Fracture Surgery?
37052064|a|OBJECTIVES: Reports show an increase in the short-term mortality rates of hip fracture patients admitted on weekends. However, there are few studies on whether there is a similar effect in Friday admissions of geriatric hip fracture patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Friday admission on mortality and clinical outcomes in elderly patients with hip fractures. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed at a single orthopaedic trauma centre and included all patients who underwent hip fracture surgery between January 2018 and December 2021. Patient characteristics, including age, sex, BMI, fracture type, time of admission, ASA grade, comorbidities, and laboratory examinations, were collected. Data pertaining to surgery and hospitalization were extracted from the electronic medical record system and tabulated. The corresponding follow-up was performed. The Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to evaluate the distributions of all continuous variables for normality. The overall data were analyzed by Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables, as appropriate. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to further test for the independent influencing factors of prolonged time to surgery. RESULTS: A total of 596 patients were included, and 83 patients (13.9%) were admitted on Friday. There was no evidence supporting that Friday admission had an effect on mortality and outcomes, including length of stay, total hospital costs and postoperative complications. However, the patients admitted on Friday had delayed surgery. Then, patients were regrouped into two groups according to whether surgery was delayed, and 317 patients (53.2%) underwent delayed surgery. The multivariate analysis showed that younger age (p = 0.014), Friday admission (p < 0.001), ASA classification III-IV (p = 0.019), femoral neck fracture (p = 0.002), time from injury to admission more than 24 h (p = 0.025), and diabetes (p = 0.023) were risk factors for delayed surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality and adverse outcome rates for elderly hip fracture patients admitted on Friday were similar to those admitted at other time periods. However, Friday admission was identified as one of the risk factors for delayed surgery.
