33803287|t|Neuroimaging Correlates of Cognitive Dysfunction in Adults with Multiple Sclerosis.
33803287|a|Cognitive impairment is a frequent and meaningful symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS), caused by the accrual of brain structural damage only partially counteracted by effective functional reorganization. As both these aspects can be successfully investigated through the application of advanced neuroimaging, here, we offer an up-to-date overview of the latest findings on structural, functional and metabolic correlates of cognitive impairment in adults with MS, focusing on the mechanisms sustaining damage accrual and on the identification of useful imaging markers of cognitive decline.
