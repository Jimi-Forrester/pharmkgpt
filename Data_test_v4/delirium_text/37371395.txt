37371395|t|Improving Visual Working Memory with Cholinergic Deep Brain Stimulation.
37371395|a|Acetylcholine is a critical modulatory neurotransmitter for cognitive function. Cholinergic drugs improve cognitive performance and enhance neuronal activity in the sensory and association cortices. An alternative means of improving cognitive function is through the use of deep brain stimulation. Prior animal studies have demonstrated that stimulation of the nucleus basalis of Meynert through DBS improves cognitive performance on a visual working memory task to the same degree as cholinesterase inhibitors. Additionally, unlike current pharmacological treatments for neurocognitive disorders, DBS does not lose efficacy over time and adverse effects are rare. These findings suggest that DBS may be a promising alternative for treating cognitive impairments in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Thus, further research and human trials should be considered to assess the potential of DBS as a therapeutic treatment for these disorders.
