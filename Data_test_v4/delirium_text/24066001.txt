24066001|a|BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma is a highly progressive cancer in the case of late diagnosis which is frequently associated with HBV and HCV viral infections. OBJECTIVES: To identify differentially expressed serum proteins among three main stages of HCV infection and healthy individuals, and their comparisons with sera from patients with the same stage of HBV infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was performed on 47 sera from healthy volunteers, those with chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC patients associated with HBV and HCV infections. RESULTS: Among these, 62 spots were differentially expressed (>= 1.5 fold; P < 0.05), of which 42 spots that corresponded to 15 proteins were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. CD5-like antigen (CD5L) was differentially expressed between cirrhosis and HCC patients with HCV infection. Leucine-rich alpha2-glycoprotein (LRG) and haptoglobin (HP) alpha2 isoforms differed in the HCC that was associated with either HCV or HBV infections. CONCLUSIONS: CD5L might be a useful biomarker for early diagnosis of HCC in HCV cirrhotic patients. LRG and HP alpha2 isoforms could be potential markers for distinguishing viral HCC. Our results also further support the presence of varying molecules involved in hepatocarcinogenesis in HBV when compared with HCV infection.
