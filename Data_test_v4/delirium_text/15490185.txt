15490185|t|[Neuroprotection against glaucoma remains a concept].
15490185|a|According to estimates made by WHO, approximately 105 million people are affected worldwide by glaucoma. This can be defined as progressive optic neuropathy with structural damage of the optic nerve head and death of retinal ganglion cells. Although elevated IOP is considered responsible for glaucoma, lowering the pressure often does not result in improvement. For this reason, other etiological factors are presumed, which are presented in the following contribution. The role of neuroprotective agents in the treatment of glaucoma is discussed. The pattern of ganglion cell death specific to glaucoma seems to suggest that certain ganglion cells could be more sensitive than others. The theory of "cumulative damage" in this case includes the hypothesis that the delayed onset of many neurodegenerative diseases such as glaucoma, Alzheimer's disease, or Parkinson's disease can be attributed to the age-related accumulation of toxic substances in the ganglion cells. On the contrary, the theory of "singular damage" is based on the assumption that certain ganglion cells are in a state of reduced homeostasis caused by the expression of so-called mutant response genes. Therapeutic approaches worthy of consideration based on their side effect profile and efficacy in animal trials, are presented.
