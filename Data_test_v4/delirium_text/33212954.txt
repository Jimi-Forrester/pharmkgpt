33212954|t|The Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/Unfolded Protein Response and Their Contributions to Parkinson's Disease Physiopathology.
33212954|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial age-related movement disorder in which defects of both mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have been reported. The unfolded protein response (UPR) has emerged as a key cellular dysfunction associated with the etiology of the disease. The UPR involves a coordinated response initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum that grants the correct folding of proteins. This review gives insights on the ER and its functioning; the UPR signaling cascades; and the link between ER stress, UPR activation, and physiopathology of PD. Thus, post-mortem studies and data obtained by either in vitro and in vivo pharmacological approaches or by genetic modulation of PD causative genes are described. Further, we discuss the relevance and impact of the UPR to sporadic and genetic PD pathology.
