30554452|t|Operative and anaesthetic factors influencing on delirium in the intensive care unit: An Analysis of electronic health records.
30554452|a|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To analyse the operation, anaesthesia and recovery-related factors affecting the occurrence of delirium in the intensive care unit. BACKGROUND: The occurrence rate of postoperative delirium is high in surgical patients. Postoperative delirium most frequently occurs usually within 3 days after an operation. DESIGN: This study used a secondary data analysis based on a case-control study. METHODS: This study analysed data extracted from the electronic health records at a university hospital from October 2009-July 2015. One hundred and eighty patients with delirium admitted to the intensive care unit through the recovery room after surgery, and 720 nondelirium controls were included. A total of 17 variables were selected, and hierarchical logistic regression was performed to identify operative and anaesthetic factors influencing on delirium. STROBE statement was applied for reporting this study. RESULTS: The operation, anaesthesia and recovery-related factors increasing the risk of delirium included Class II or higher in the classification system of American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, continuous remifentanil infusion and lower than seven-point postanaesthesia recovery score at the time of admission to the recovery room. CONCLUSION: The operative and anaesthetic factors influencing the occurrence of delirium should be assessed when a patient is admitted to the ICU following an operation even if a patient is conscious. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Identifying operative and anaesthetic risk factors for delirium can improve the prevention intervention and the patient outcome in the intensive care unit.
