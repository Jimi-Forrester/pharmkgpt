37920027|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease, and its incidence increases yearly. Because AD patients will have cognitive impairment and personality changes, it has caused a heavy burden on the family and society. Image genetics takes the structure and function of the brain as a phenotype and studies the influence of genetic variation on the structure and function of the brain. Based on the structural magnetic resonance imaging data and transcriptome data of AD and healthy control samples in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Disease database, this paper proposed the use of an orthogonal structured sparse canonical correlation analysis for diagnostic information fusion algorithm. The algorithm added structural constraints to the region of interest (ROI) of the brain. Integrating the diagnostic information of samples can improve the correlation performance between samples. The results showed that the algorithm could extract the correlation between the two modal data and discovered the brain regions most affected by multiple risk genes and their biological significance. In addition, we also verified the diagnostic significance of risk ROIs and risk genes for AD. The code of the proposed algorithm is available at https://github.com/Wanguangyu111/OSSCCA-DIF.
