37986371|t|Leptin and risk factors for atherosclerosis: A review.
37986371|a|Leptin is a hormone secreted primarily by adipose tissue. It regulates an organism's metabolism, energy balance, and body weight through a negative feedback mechanism. When a person or animal has low body fat and little energy, the leptin level in the body decreases, and conversely, when there is an excess of nutrients, the leptin level increases, giving a feeling of satiety. However, when leptin levels are abnormal (too high or too low) for a number of reasons, it can negatively affect your health, inducing inflammatory responses, obesity, and other problems. Many studies have shown that abnormal leptin levels, such as hyperleptinemia, are closely associated with common risk factors for atherosclerosis (AS). This review systematically states the relationship between leptin and common risk factors for AS (inflammation, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and sleep disorders) and provides some new thoughts on the future direction of research on both. Because the abnormal level of leptin will have adverse effects on multiple atherosclerotic risk factors, how to regulate the leptin level of patients with AS, and whether we can treat and prevent AS by intervening the leptin level, these may be our new research directions in the future.
