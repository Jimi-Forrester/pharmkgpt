38929561|t|Persistence of COVID-19 Symptoms and Quality of Life at Three and Twelve Months after Hospital Discharge.
38929561|a|Background and Objectives: Medical and public recognition of "long-COVID or post-COVID syndrome", as well as its impact on the quality of life (QoL), is required to better address the disease burden. Objectives: We aimed to describe the persistence of COVID-19 symptoms and QoL among patients at three and twelve months after their discharge from the hospital. Materials and Methods: We conducted an observational, prospective, and longitudinal analytic study from September 2021 to April 2022. To measure QoL, we used a validated version of the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). Results: We included 68 patients in the study. A total of 54 (79.4%) patients reported at least one persistent symptom at three months vs. 52 (76.4%) at twelve months (p = 0.804). Some persistent symptoms (myalgia, alopecia, and cough) decreased significantly at twelve months (50% vs. 30.9%, 29.4% vs. 13.2%, and 23.5% vs. 7.4%; respectively, p = 0.007); in contrast, other persistent symptoms (sleep-wake and memory disorders) were more frequent (5.9% vs. 32.4% and 4.4% vs. 20.6%; respectively, p = <=0.001). Regarding QoL, a statistically significant improvement was observed in some scores over time, p = <=0.037. At twelve months, dyspnea, myalgia, and depression were risk factors associated with a poor physical component summary (PCS), p = <=0.027, whereas anxiety, depression, and fatigue were associated with a poor mental component summary (MCS), p = <=0.015. Conclusion: As the proportion of persistent symptoms at twelve months is high, we suggest that patients must continue under long-term follow up to reclassify, diagnose, and treat new onset symptoms/diseases.
