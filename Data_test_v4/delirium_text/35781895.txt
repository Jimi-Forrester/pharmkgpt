35781895|a|"Desert hyacinths" are a remarkable group of parasitic plants belonging to genus Cistanche, including more than 20 accepted species typically occurring in deserts or coastal dunes parasitizing roots of shrubs. Several Cistanche species have long been a source of traditional herbal medicine or food, being C. deserticola and C. tubulosa the most used in China. This manuscript reports the isolation and identification of some phenylethanoid and iridoid glycosides, obtained from the hydroalcoholic extract of C. phelypaea collected in Spain. The present study aims to characterize the antioxidant activity of C. phelypaea metabolites in the light of their application in nutraceutical and cosmeceutical industries and the effect of acetoside, the most abundant metabolite in C. phelypaea extract, on human keratinocyte and pluripotent stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Our study demonstrated that acetoside, besides its strong antioxidant potential, can preserve the proliferative potential of human basal keratinocytes and the stemness of mesenchymal progenitors necessary for tissue morphogenesis and renewal. Therefore, acetoside can be of practical relevance for the clinical application of human stem cell cultures in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.
