32993772|a|BACKGROUND: Several studies have investigated the value of alpha-synuclein assay in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients in the differential diagnosis of these two pathologies. However, very few studies have focused on this assay in AD and DLB patients at the MCI stage. METHODS: All patients were enrolled under a hospital clinical research protocol from the tertiary Memory Clinic (CM2R) of Alsace, France, by an experienced team of clinicians. A total of 166 patients were included in this study: 21 control subjects (CS), 51 patients with DLB at the prodromal stage (pro-DLB), 16 patients with DLB at the demented stage (DLB-d), 33 AD patients at the prodromal stage (pro-AD), 32 AD patients at the demented stage (AD-d), and 13 patients with mixed pathology (AD+DLB). CSF levels of total alpha-synuclein were assessed using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for alpha-synuclein (AJ Roboscreen). Alzheimer's biomarkers (t-Tau, P-Tau, Abeta42, and Abeta40) were also measured. RESULTS: The alpha-synuclein assays showed a significant difference between the AD and DLB groups. Total alpha-synuclein levels were significantly higher in AD patients than in DLB patients. However, the ROC curves show a moderate discriminating power between AD and DLB (AUC = 0.78) which does not improve the discriminating power of the combination of Alzheimer biomarkers (AUC = 0.95 with or without alpha-synuclein). Interestingly, the levels appeared to be altered from the prodromal stage in both AD and DLB. CONCLUSIONS: The modification of total alpha-synuclein levels in the CSF of patients occurs early, from the prodromal stage. The adding of alpha-synuclein total to the combination of Alzheimer's biomarker does not improve the differential diagnosis between AD and DLB.
