38523049|t|Non-pharmacological interventions for preventing emergence delirium in children under general anesthesia: A scoping review.
38523049|a|PROBLEM: The phenomenon of emergence delirium in pediatric patients undergoing general anesthesia has garnered increasing attention in the academic community. While formal non-pharmaceutical interventions have demonstrated efficacy in mitigating this phenomenon, the diversity of intervention types and their varying degrees of effectiveness necessitate further discussion. A scoping review was conducted to identify and explicate the categorization, content elements, and outcomes measures of non-pharmacological interventions utilized to forestall the onset of emergence delirium in children undergoing general anesthesia. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: This review was conducted in accordance with the Arksey and O'Malley's methodology framework and PRISMA-ScR. It encompassed experimental and quasi-experimental studies that involved any non-pharmacological interventions during the perioperative period to prevent emergence delirium in children aged 0 to 18 years undergoing general anesthesia for elective surgery. SAMPLE: Thirty-two articles met the inclusion criteria, of which 29 were randomized controlled trials. The total sample size of the population was 4633. RESULTS: The scoping review revealed 10 non-pharmacological interventions, that included distraction intervention, visual preconditioning, virtual reality, parental participation, maternal voice, light drinking, acupuncture, auditory stimulation, monochromic light and breathing training. Emergence delirium, preoperative anxiety, and postoperative pain were the primary outcomes, and four assessment instruments were employed to measure the extent and incidence of emergence delirium. CONCLUSION: Numerous non-pharmacological interventions have been employed to prevent emergence delirium. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of some interventions is not yet evident. IMPLICATIONS: The utilization of visual preconditioning and distraction interventions appears to be an emerging area of interest.
