37619764|a|The importance of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in human physiology is well recognized. As the NAD+ concentration in human skin, blood, liver, muscle and brain are thought to decrease with age, finding ways to increase NAD+ status could possibly influence the ageing process and associated metabolic sequelae. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) is a precursor for NAD+ biosynthesis, and in vitro/in vivo studies have demonstrated that NMN supplementation increases NAD+ concentration and could mitigate ageing-related disorders such as oxidative stress, DNA damage, neurodegeneration and inflammatory responses. The promotion of NMN as an anti-ageing health supplement has gained popularity due to such findings; however, since most studies evaluating the effects of NMN have been conducted in cell or animal models, a concern remains regarding the safety and physiological effects of NMN supplementation in the human population. Nonetheless, a dozen human clinical trials with NMN supplementation are currently underway. This review summarizes the current progress of these trials and NMN/NAD+ biology to clarify the potential effects of NMN supplementation and to shed light on future study directions.
