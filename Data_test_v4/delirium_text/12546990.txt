12546990|a|Treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), represents a major challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. These disorders have common and unique molecular pathological characteristics that result in serious reductions in nervous-system functionality. Key to developing novel and efficacious therapeutics is the discovery of new gene targets. Genomic, proteomics and bioinformatic analyses are identifying vast amounts of genes whose expression is associated with the pathology of a specific disease. Extensive validation studies performed in parallel with drug development are crucial for the selection of appropriate target genes. This review outlines some of the current progress in gene discovery for neurodegenerative disease.
