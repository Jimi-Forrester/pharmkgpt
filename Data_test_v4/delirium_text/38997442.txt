38997442|t|Obesity-induced inflammation: connecting the periphery to the brain.
38997442|a|Obesity is often associated with a chronic, low-grade inflammatory state affecting the entire body. This sustained inflammatory state disrupts the coordinated communication between the periphery and the brain, which has a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis through humoural, nutrient-mediated, immune and nervous signalling pathways. The inflammatory changes induced by obesity specifically affect communication interfaces, including the blood-brain barrier, glymphatic system and meninges. Consequently, brain areas near the third ventricle, including the hypothalamus and other cognition-relevant regions, become susceptible to impairments, resulting in energy homeostasis dysregulation and an elevated risk of cognitive impairments such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia. This Review explores the intricate communication between the brain and the periphery, highlighting the effect of obesity-induced inflammation on brain function.
