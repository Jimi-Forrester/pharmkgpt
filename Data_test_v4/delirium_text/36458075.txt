36458075|a|Context: Telemedicine has become one of the essential modes of healthcare delivery. Different aspects of the physician-patient relationship during tele and in-person consultation need to be studied. Aims: This study aimed to compare perceived empathy and therapeutic relationship between tele and in-person consultation and assess the patient's satisfaction during teleconsultation for substance use disorder (SUD). Methodology: We consecutively recruited 100 adult patients with SUD, registered to the tele-addiction service between June and September 2020, and experienced both video and in-person consultations. We assessed therapeutic relationships, perceived empathy (for teleconsultation and in-person consultation), and patients' satisfaction (with teleconsultation) with specific scales. We compared the scores of the therapeutic relationship and physician empathy scales for tele and in-person consultation. Results: The mean age of the patients was 35.5 (+-10.4) years. Sixty percent had alcohol, followed by opioids (42%) and cannabis dependence (24%). Sixty percent of patients had comorbid tobacco dependence. Telehealth satisfaction (TSS) rating shows around 40% of patients had difficulty accessing the telehealth service and 7% felt their privacy was poorly respected. The mean total therapeutic relation (STAR) (t = -14.4; P <.001), positive collaboration (t = -12.8; P <.001), positive clinical input (t = -11.9; P <.001), and total Patient's Perceptions of Physician Empathy (PPPE) score (t = -8.4; P < .001) were lower in the teleconsultation than in-person consultation group. TSS was positively correlated with positive collaboration, positive clinician input, and STAR total score. Conclusions: Our study suggests a stronger therapeutic relationship and higher physician empathy during in-person consultations. Poor accessibility and privacy concerns were critical challenges in telehealth service. TSS and therapeutic relationships positively influence each other.
