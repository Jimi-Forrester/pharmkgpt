39728750|a|Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease associated with numerous complications, including cardiovascular diseases, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, a class of novel antidiabetic agents, have demonstrated promising therapeutic effects beyond glycemic control, with potential benefits extending to the cardiovascular and renal systems. Recently, research has increasingly focused on exploring the potential role of SGLT-2 inhibitors in preventing dementia. The aim of this review is to summarize the current research suggesting that SGLT-2 inhibitors, such as empagliflozin and dapagliflozin, may have neuroprotective effects that reduce dementia risk and improve cognitive function in type 2 diabetes patients. These benefits are likely due to better glycemic control, reduced oxidative stress, and less advanced glycation end-product (AGE) formation, all linked to neurodegeneration. Despite these promising findings, existing studies are limited by small sample sizes and short follow-up durations, which may not adequately capture long-term outcomes. To establish more robust evidence, larger-scale, long-term randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving diverse populations are needed. These studies should involve diverse populations and focus on understanding the mechanisms behind the neuroprotective effects. Addressing these limitations will provide clearer guidelines for using SGLT-2 inhibitors in dementia prevention and management. This will help improve therapeutic strategies for cognitive health in diabetic patients.
