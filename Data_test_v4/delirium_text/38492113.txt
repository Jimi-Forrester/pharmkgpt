38492113|a|Previous studies have observed relationships between pancreatitis and gut microbiota; however, specific changes in gut microbiota abundance and underlying mechanisms in pancreatitis remain unknown. Metabolites are important for gut microbiota to fulfil their biological functions, and changes in the metabolic and immune environments are closely linked to changes in microbiota abundance. We aimed to clarify the mechanisms of gut-pancreas interactions and explore the possible role of metabolites and the immune system. To this end, we conducted two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis to evaluate the casual links between four different types of pancreatitis and gut microbiota, metabolites, and inflammatory cytokines. A two-step MR analysis was conducted to further evaluate the probable mediating pathways involving metabolites and inflammatory cytokines in the causal relationship between pancreatitis and gut microbiota. In total, six potential mediators were identified in the causal relationship between pancreatitis and gut microbiota. Nineteen species of gut microbiota and seven inflammatory cytokines were genetically associated with the four types of pancreatitis. Metabolites involved in glucose and amino acid metabolisms were genetically associated with chronic pancreatitis, and those involved in lipid metabolism were genetically associated with acute pancreatitis. Our study identified alterations in the gut microbiota, metabolites, and inflammatory cytokines in pancreatitis at the genetic level and found six potential mediators of the pancreas-gut axis, which may provide insights into the precise diagnosis of pancreatitis and treatment interventions for gut microbiota to prevent the exacerbation of pancreatitis. Future studies could elucidate the mechanism underlying the association between pancreatitis and the gut microbiota.
