37284590|t|Synthesis of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-containing peptidomimetics by tandem of Groebke-Blackburn-Bienayme and Ugi reactions.
37284590|a|Peptidomimetics with a substituted imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine fragment were synthesized by a tandem of Groebke-Blackburn-Bienayme and Ugi reactions. The target products contain substituted imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine and peptidomimetic moieties as pharmacophores with four diversity points introduced from readily available starting materials, including scaffold diversity. A small focused compound library of 20 Ugi products was prepared and screened for antibacterial activity.
