38727282|t|Choline Metabolites Reverse Differentially the Habituation Deficit and Elevated Memory of Tau Null Drosophila.
38727282|a|Impaired neuronal plasticity and cognitive decline are cardinal features of Alzheimer's disease and related Tauopathies. Aberrantly modified Tau protein and neurotransmitter imbalance, predominantly involving acetylcholine, have been linked to these symptoms. In Drosophila, we have shown that dTau loss specifically enhances associative long-term olfactory memory, impairs foot shock habituation, and deregulates proteins involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter levels, particularly acetylcholine. Interestingly, upon choline treatment, the habituation and memory performance of mutants are restored to that of control flies. Based on these surprising results, we decided to use our well-established genetic model to understand how habituation deficits and memory performance correlate with different aspects of choline physiology as an essential component of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, the lipid phosphatidylcholine, and the osmoregulator betaine. The results revealed that the two observed phenotypes are reversed by different choline metabolites, implying that they are governed by different underlying mechanisms. This work can contribute to a broader knowledge about the physiologic function of Tau, which may be translated into understanding the mechanisms of Tauopathies.
