24714193|t|Synthesis of extended uridine phosphonates derived from an allosteric P2Y2 receptor ligand.
24714193|a|In this study we report the synthesis of C5/C6-fused uridine phosphonates that are structurally related to earlier reported allosteric P2Y2 receptor ligands. A silyl-Hilbert-Johnson reaction of six quinazoline-2,4-(1H,3H)-dione-like base moieties with a suitable ribofuranosephosphonate afforded the desired analogues after full deprotection. In contrast to the parent 5-(4-fluoropheny)uridine phosphonate, the present extended-base uridine phosphonates essentially failed to modulate the P2Y2 receptor.
