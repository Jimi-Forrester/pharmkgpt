31423222|t|Effect of inhibiting ACAT-1 expression on the growth and metastasis of Lewis lung carcinoma.
31423222|a|Accumulating evidence suggests that acetyl-CoA acetryltransferase 1 (ACAT-1) may mediate tumor development and metastasis. However, the specific function served by ACAT-1 in lung cancer is not well understood. Therefore, the present study initially verified that ACAT-1 was overexpressed in Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tissues compared with non-LLC mice and that this overexpression promoted the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of these LLC samples. Western blotting, immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry allowed the present study to determine that the ACAT-1 inhibitor avasimibe significantly reduced the expression of ACAT-1 in LLC compared with LLC cells that are not treated with avasimibe (P<0.05). A combination of Cell Counting Kit-8 and wound healing assays demonstrated that downregulating ACAT-1 expression sufficiently inhibited the proliferation of LLC cells. Avasimibe promoted LLC cell apoptosis as assessed by a Annexin V/propidium iodide double staining assay. Furthermore, avasimibe inhibited tumor growth in vivo and improved immune responses, with tissue biopsies from LLC model mice exhibiting higher levels of ACAT-1 compared with in healthy controls. Altogether, the results of the present study reveal that avasimibe may inhibit the progression of LLC by downregulating the expression of ACAT-1, which may thus be a potential novel therapeutic target for lung cancer treatment.
