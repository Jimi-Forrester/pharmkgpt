28713688|a|AIM: To identify factors associated with depressive symptoms among inpatients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study performed in a subsample of a large cross-sectional research that investigated affective disorders and suicide behaviour among inpatients hospitalized in non-surgical wards of the University Hospital of the Federal University of Minas Gerais from November 2013 to October 2015. Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained through a structured interview and medical record review. Depression was assessed by the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, with scores >= 8 considered as positive screening for depression. We used the Fagestrom Test for Nicotine Dependence to characterize nicotine dependence. For assessing resilience and early-life trauma, we used the raw scores of the Wagnild and Young Resilience Scale and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, respectively. RESULTS: At endpoint, we included 137 subjects. Thirty-eight (27.7%) subjects presented depressive symptoms and nine (23.7%) of those were receiving antidepressant treatment during hospitalization. The female sex; a lower mean educational level; a greater prevalence of previous suicide attempts; a higher level of pain; a higher prevalence of family antecedents of mental disorders; a lower resilience score; and higher childhood trauma score were the factors significantly associated with screening positive for major depression (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the factors independently associated with the depressive symptoms were a higher childhood trauma severity (OR = 1.06; P = 0.004); moderate to severe nicotine dependence (OR = 8.58; P = 0.008); and the number of previous hospital admissions (OR = 1.11; P = 0.034). The obtained logistic model was considered valid, indicating that the three factors together distinguished between having or not depressive symptoms, and correctly classified 74.6% of individuals in the sample. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that inpatients presenting both CVD and a positive screening for depression are more prone to have antecedents of childhood trauma, nicotine dependence and a higher number of previous hospitalizations.
