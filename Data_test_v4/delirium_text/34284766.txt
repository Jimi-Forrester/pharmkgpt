34284766|a|BACKGROUND: To determine the association between oral health condition and development of frailty over a 12-month period in community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: Population-based, case-cohort study derived from the Cohort of Obesity, Sarcopenia, and Frailty of Older Mexican Adults (COSFOMA) study, including data from years 2015 and 2016. Using latent class analysis, we determined the oral health condition of older adults with teeth (t0), i.e., functional teeth, presence of coronal caries, root caries, periodontal disease, dental calculus, dental biofilm, root remains, xerostomia, and need for dental prosthesis. Edentulous was considered as a separate class. Criteria of the Frailty Phenotype (t1) by Fried et al. were used: weight loss, self-report of exhaustion, walking speed, decreased muscle strength, and low physical activity. The presence of three or more criteria indicated a frail condition. The strength of the association (odds ratio, OR) between oral health condition and development of frailty was estimated through bivariate analysis. Multiple logistic regression was used to adjust for the other variables of study: sociodemographic data (sex, age, marital status, level of education, paid work activity, and living alone), comorbidities, cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms, nutritional status, and use of oral health services. RESULTS: 663 non-frail older adults were evaluated, with a mean age of 68.1 years (SD +- 6.1), of whom 55.7% were women. In t0, a three-class model with an acceptable value was obtained (entropy = 0.796). The study participants were classified as: edentulous persons (6.9%); Class 1 = Acceptable oral health (57.9%); Class 2 = Somewhat acceptable oral health (13.9%); and Class 3 = Poor oral health (21.3%). In t1, 18.0% (n = 97) of participants developed frailty. Using Acceptable oral health (Class 1) as a reference, we observed that older adults with edentulism (OR 4.1, OR adjusted 2.3) and Poor oral health (OR 2.4, OR adjusted 2.2) were at an increased risk of developing frailty compared to those with Acceptable oral health. CONCLUSION: Older adults with edentulism and poor oral health had an increased risk of developing frailty over a 12-month period.
