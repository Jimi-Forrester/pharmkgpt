37034776|a|Objective Middle-aged and elderly people in China probably suffer from hypertension. There is a close relationship between obesity-and lipid-related index and hypertension, which is recognized by recent studies. However, these studies have not systematically compared the relationship between the two. We aim to find the most effective obesity-and lipid-related index for predicting hypertension. Method A total of 9488 middle-aged and elderly people in China participated in this study. In this study, the subjects were divided into male and female groups by the definition of the 2018 Chinese Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension. Searching for the best predictors among 13 obesity-and lipid-related indicators through binary logistic regression analyses and receiver operator curve (ROC). These 13 indicators are body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-height ratio (WHtR), conicity index (CI), visceral adiposity index (VAI), Chinese visceral adiposity index (CVAI), lipid accumulation product (LAP), a body shape index (ABSI), body roundness index (BRI), triglyceride glucose index (TyG-index) and its correlation index (TyG-BMI, TyG-WC, TyG-WHtR) Results After adjusting bias, all 13 indexes are risk factors for hypertension. In ROC curve analysis, thirteen obesity-and lipid-related factors can predict the occurrence of hypertension. Among them, CVAI has the best prediction effect (male: AUC = 0.660, female: AUC = 0.699). AUC for WHtR was equal to that for BRI and TyG -WHtR in identifying hypertension in male. Similarly, AUC of TyG-BMI and BMI were the same. In females, AUC for WHtR and BRI were the same when predicting hypertension. AUC of ABSI was much lower than other test indexes. Conclusion In predicting hypertension, thirteen obesity-and lipid-related factors are effective. In addition, in males and females, CVAI is the best indicator to indicate hypertension. TyG-WHtR, WHtR, and BRI performed well in predicting metabolic syndrome in both males and females. ABSI has a poor ability to predict hypertension.
