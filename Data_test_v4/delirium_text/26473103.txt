26473103|a|BACKGROUND: Preoperative anxiety is associated with adverse clinical, behavioral, and psychological outcomes. Various effective interventions targeting preoperative anxiety in children exist. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the educational intervention by residents on children and maternal anxiety and their satisfaction from anxiety management. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After obtaining the institutional ethics committee approval and written informed parental consent, 36 ASA-I, II children (age range, 8 - 10 years) underwent small operations were included in this prospective randomized study. The participants were allocated into the intervention (n =18) and control (n =18) groups. Children in the first group were prepared routinely. In the second group children and their mothers received data about anesthesia and operation by the booklet. Children-maternal anxiety was assessed using the anxiety level form, at the night and in the morning before surgery. Few days after surgery mothers, residents, and children experiences and satisfaction from anxiety management were assessed in the focus group discussion. RESULTS: Mean scores and standard deviations of state anxiety in the intervention group before and after training were 33.1 +- 5.5 and 30.8 +- 6, respectively (P = 0.06). In the control group it was 32 +- 6.5 on the night and 34.1 +- 6.7 in the morning before surgery (P = 0.00). Comparison between groups was not significant (P = 0.6) and (P = 0.1). The mean levels of anxiety in the control group mothers on the night before and in the morning of surgery were 39.2 +- 13.1 and 42.8 +- 14 (P = 0.00), respectively. In the intervention group, mothers' anxiety before education was 41 +- 12.7 and after education it was 35.6 +- 9.5 (P = 0.04). Comparison between groups was not significant (P = 0.7) and (P = 0.1). According to the focus group discussions, booklet study, provided education, sympathy of medical team, spiritual issues and beliefs reduced anxiety and fear of surgery. Anesthesia and lack of knowledge of what will happen, crying and restlessness of children increased preoperative anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the preoperative anxiety was reduced by explaining anesthesia and surgery to the mothers and children (in mothers it was significant P < 0.05). Since there is a direct relation between mothers' and their children's anxiety, using an effective method to reduce anxiety in children and their mothers together at the same time would be very useful for children and their mothers.
