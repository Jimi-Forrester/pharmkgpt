9793379|a|We report here a case of neuropsychiatric lupus erythematosus with organic brain syndrome and transverse myelitis which was successfully managed by plasmapheresis. A 27-year-old female with facial rash, arthralgia and fever was diagnosed as having SLE and treated with oral prednisolone (PSL) in June 1996. After 6 weeks she demonstrated muscle pain and a spiking temperature. The dose of PSL was increased but clinical symptoms did not improve. In August, pulse methyl-PSL was performed and she subsequently-developed delirium, impairment of orientation, memory and perception, which were followed by paraplegia of the lower extremities and loss of sphincter control. Intravenous bolus cyclophosphamide was not effective, but liver dysfunction, bone marrow suppression and respiratory failure due to an infection of pneumocystis carinii were observed. We then performed plasmapheresis or immunoabsorption several times. After this treatment steady improvement was observed. High values of antiribosomal P protein antibodies in the serum and interleukin-6 in the cerebrospinal fluid decreased. Small foci of increased signal intensity detected on cranial magnetic resonance imaging and hypoperfused areas on single-photon emission CT diminished. The patient was maintained on low-dose PSL and no recurrence has been observed 15 months from the onset.
