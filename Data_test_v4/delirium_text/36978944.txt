36978944|t|First Insight into the Neuroprotective and Antibacterial Effects of Phlorotannins Isolated from the Cell Walls of Brown Algae Fucus vesiculosus and Pelvetia canaliculata.
36978944|a|Phaeophyceae (brown algae) essentially contribute to biotopes of cold and temperate seas. Their thalli are rich in biologically active natural products, which are strongly and universally dominated with phlorotannins-polyphenols of complex and diverse structure based on multiple differently arranged phloroglucinol units and well known as strong antioxidants with a broad spectrum of biological activities. In the algal cells, phlorotannins can either accumulate in the cytoplasm or can be secreted into the cell wall (CW). The biological activities of extractable intracellular phlorotannins have been comprehensively characterized, whereas the properties of the CW-bound polyphenol fraction are still mostly unknown. Recently, we identified dibenzodioxin bonding as the principal structural feature of the CW-bound phlorotannins in fucoid algae, whereas soluble intracellular phlorotannins rely on aryl and ether bonds. However, profiles of biological activity associated with these structural differences are still unknown. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time we address the antioxidant, cytotoxic, neuroprotective, and antibacterial properties of the CW-bound phlorotannin fractions isolated from two representatives of the order Fucales-Fucus vesiculosus and Pelvetia canaliculata. The CW-bound phlorotannins appeared to be softer antioxidants, stronger antibacterial agents and were featured with essentially less cytotoxicity in comparison to the intracellular fraction. However, the neuroprotective effects of both sub-cellular phlorotannin fractions of F. vesiculosus and P. canaliculata were similar. Thus, due to their lower cytotoxicity, CW-bound phlorotannins can be considered as promising antioxidants and neuroprotectors.
