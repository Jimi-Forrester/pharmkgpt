33603973|t|Structure-Activity and Brain Kinetics Relationships of 18F-Labeled Benzimidazopyridine Derivatives as Tau PET Tracers.
33603973|a|Noninvasive imaging of tau aggregates with a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer is useful for the diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, we found that benzimidazopyridine (BIP) is an attractive scaffold for developing PET and single photon computed emission tomography tracers targeting tau aggregates. In this study, we designed and synthesized five novel 18F-labeled compounds with various substituted groups or atoms at the 7-position of the BIP scaffold. In in vitro autoradiographic studies, all 18F-labeled BIP derivatives selectively bound to tau aggregates deposited in AD brain sections. On the other hand, the initial brain uptake of these compounds was affected by the type of substituted group or halogen atom introduced into the 7-position of the BIP scaffold. Among these compounds, [18F]Me-BIPF showed the highest brain uptake (6.79% ID/g at 2 min postinjection) and 2 min/60 min ratio (3.59). These results suggest that appropriate introduction of the substituted group or atom into the 7-position of the BIP scaffold may be effective for developing useful tau PET tracers.
