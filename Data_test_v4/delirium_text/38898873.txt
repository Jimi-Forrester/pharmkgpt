38898873|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive frailty, characterized by the coexistence of cognitive impairment and physical frailty, represents a multifaceted challenge in the aging population. The role of cardiovascular risk factors in this complex interplay is not yet fully understood. AIM: To investigate the relationships between cardiovascular risk factors and older persons with cognitive frailty by pooling data from two cohorts of studies in Malaysia. METHODS: A comprehensive approach was employed, with a total of 512 community-dwelling older persons aged 60 years and above, involving two cohorts of older persons from previous studies. Datasets related to cardiovascular risks, namely sociodemographic factors, and cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, anthropometric characteristics and biochemical profiles, were pooled for analysis. Cognitive frailty was defined based on the Clinical Dementia Rating scale and Fried frailty score. Cardiovascular risk was determined using Framingham risk score. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 21. RESULTS: Of the study participants, 46.3% exhibited cognitive frailty. Cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension (OR:1.60; 95%CI: 1.12-2.30), low fat-free mass (OR:0.96; 95%CI: 0.94-0.98), high percentage body fat (OR:1.04; 95%CI: 1.02-1.06), high waist circumference (OR:1.02; 95%CI: 1.01-1.04), high fasting blood glucose (OR:1.64; 95%CI: 1.11-2.43), high Framingham risk score (OR:1.65; 95%CI: 1.17-2.31), together with sociodemographic factors, i.e., being single (OR 3.38; 95%CI: 2.26-5.05) and low household income (OR 2.18; 95%CI: 1.44-3.30) were found to be associated with cognitive frailty. CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular-risk specific risk factors and sociodemographic factors were associated with risk of cognitive frailty, a prodromal stage of dementia. Early identification and management of cardiovascular risk factors, particularly among specific group of the population might mitigate the risk of cognitive frailty, hence preventing dementia.
