33809219|t|Critical Effects on Akt Signaling in Adult Zebrafish Brain Following Alterations in Light Exposure.
33809219|a|Evidence from human and animal studies indicate that disrupted light cycles leads to alterations of the sleep state, poor cognition, and the risk of developing neuroinflammatory and generalized health disorders. Zebrafish exhibit a diurnal circadian rhythm and are an increasingly popular model in studies of neurophysiology and neuropathophysiology. Here, we investigate the effect of alterations in light cycle on the adult zebrafish brain: we measured the effect of altered, unpredictable light exposure in adult zebrafish telencephalon, homologous to mammalian hippocampus, and the optic tectum, a significant visual processing center with extensive telencephalon connections. The expression of heat shock protein-70 (HSP70), an important cell stress mediator, was significantly decreased in optic tectum of adult zebrafish brain following four days of altered light exposure. Further, pSer473-Akt (protein kinase B) was significantly reduced in telencephalon following light cycle alteration, and pSer9-GSK3beta (glycogen synthase kinase-3beta) was significantly reduced in both the telencephalon and optic tectum of light-altered fish. Animals exposed to five minutes of environmental enrichment showed significant increase in pSer473Akt, which was significantly attenuated by four days of altered light exposure. These data show for the first time that unpredictable light exposure alters HSP70 expression and dysregulates Akt-GSK3beta signaling in the adult zebrafish brain.
