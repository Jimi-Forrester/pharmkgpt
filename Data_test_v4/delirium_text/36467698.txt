36467698|a|Genome-wide profiling of rhythmic gene expression has offered new avenues for studying the contribution of circadian clock to diverse biological processes. Sleep has been considered one of the most important physiological processes that are regulated by the circadian clock, however, the effects of chronic sleep loss on rhythmic gene expression remain poorly understood. In the present study, we exploited Drosophila sleep mutants insomniac 1 (inc 1 ) and wide awake D2 (wake D2 ) as models for chronic sleep loss. We profiled the transcriptomes of head tissues collected from 4-week-old wild type flies, inc 1 and wake D2 at timepoints around the clock. Analysis of gene oscillation revealed a substantial loss of rhythmicity in inc 1 and wake D2 compared to wild type flies, with most of the affected genes common to both mutants. The disruption of gene oscillation was not due to changes in average gene expression levels. We also identified a subset of genes whose loss of rhythmicity was shared among animals with chronic sleep loss and old flies, suggesting a contribution of aging to chronic, sleep-loss-induced disruption of gene oscillation.
