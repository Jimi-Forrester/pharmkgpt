36476432|t|NMDA Inhibitors: A Potential Contrivance to Assist in Management of Alzheimer's Disease
36476432|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an increasingly common neurodegenerative disease that attractsthe attention of researchers and medical community in order to develop new, safe and moreeffective drugs. Currently available drugs could only slow the AD progression and relieve thesymptoms, in addition to being linked to moderate-to-severe side effects. N-methyl D-aspartate(NMDA) receptors antagonists were reported to have the ability to block the glutamate-mediatedexcitotoxic activity being good therapeutic targets for several neurodegenerative diseases, includingAD. Based on data obtained so far, this review provides an overview over the use of NMDAantagonists for AD treatment, starting with a key emphasis on present features and future aspectsregarding the use of NMDA antagonists for AD, and lastly a key focus is also given on its use inprecision medicine.
