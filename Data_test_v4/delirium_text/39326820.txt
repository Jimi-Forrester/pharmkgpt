39326820|t|Serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) in neurological disorders: Pain or gain.
39326820|a|Serum/Glucocorticoid Regulated Kinase 1 (SGK1), a serine/threonine kinase, is ubiquitous across a wide range of tissues, orchestrating numerous signaling pathways and associated with various human diseases. SGK1 has been extensively explored in diverse types of immune and inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular disorders, as well as cancer metastasis. These studies link SGK1 to cellular proliferation, survival, metabolism, membrane transport, and drug resistance. Recently, increasing research has focused on SGK1's role in neurological disorders, including a variety of neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease), brain injuries (e.g., cerebral ischemia and traumatic brain injury), psychiatric conditions (e.g., depression and drug addiction). SGK1 is emerging as an increasingly compelling therapeutic target across the spectrum of neurological disorders, supported by the availability of several effective agents. However, the conclusions of many studies observing the prevalence and function of SGK1 in neurological disorders are contradictory, necessitating a review of the SGK1 research within neurological disorders. Herein, we review recent literature on SGK1's primary functions within the nervous system and its impacts within different neurological disorders. We summarize significant findings, identify research gaps, and outline possible future research directions based on the current understanding of SGK1 to help further progress the understanding and treatment of neurological disorders.
