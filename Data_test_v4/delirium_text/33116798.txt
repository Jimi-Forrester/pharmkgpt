33116798|a|BACKGROUND: Imaging-guided celiac plexus neurolysis using ultrasound (US) guidance via a transabdominal approach and endoscopic-ultrasound (EUS) has been increasingly applied for the treatment of pancreatic cancer-associated abdominal pain. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the application of ultrasound-guided and fluoroscopy-assisted celiac plexus neurolysis in a patient with advanced pancreatic cancer suffering from refractory abdominal pain for which oral opioid treatment was ineffective. CASE REPORT: We report a case of ultrasound-guided and fluoroscopy-assisted celiac plexus neurolysis in a patient with advanced pancreatic cancer with refractory abdominal pain. With the patient in the prone position, celiac plexus neurolysis was performed under real-time US guidance. The transducer was placed below the costal margin and a puncture needle with an ultrasound enhancement tip was inserted in-plane aiming for the lateral anterior end of the vertebral body. The correct needle tip position was confirmed by the C-arm with contrast material located anterior to the vertebral body and posterior to the diaphragm. CONCLUSION: We highlight the use of an US-guided and fluoroscopy-assisted posterior approach for use in celiac plexus neurolysis procedures, particularly in patients suffering from contraindications from the US or EUS-guided anterior approaches.
