27719660|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and loss of cholinergic neurons. LITERATURE REVIEW: The localization of Abeta plaques particularly in the cholinergic neuron-rich areas has led to the discovery that Abeta binds to alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) with very high affinity. This discovery has led to extensive exploration of the possible outcomes of this binding, ranging from the subcellular signaling pathways to its effects on behavioral and cognitive functions. Intriguingly, there are conflicting reports about the effects of this Abeta and alpha7 nAChR interaction; a few studies report a neuroprotective role of this interaction while others claim that it is neurotoxic. CONCLUSION: This review focuses on the neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects of Abeta and alpha7 nAChR interaction and its implications on different cell signaling pathways and other physiological functions. Moreover, the implications this interaction might have on Alzheimer's disease therapy are also discussed.
