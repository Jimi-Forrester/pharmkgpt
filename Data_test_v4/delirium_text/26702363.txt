26702363|t|Optimizing Sedation Management to Promote Early Mobilization for Critically Ill Children.
26702363|a|Achieving successful early mobilization for the intubated, critically ill child is dependent on optimizing sedation and analgesia. Finding the fine balance between oversedation and undersedation can be challenging. The ideal is for a child to be lucid and interactive during the daytime and demonstrate normal circadian rhythm for sleep with rest at night. Being alert during the day facilitates active participation in therapy including potential ambulation, while decreasing the risk of delirium during mechanical ventilation. An active state during the day with frequent mobilization promotes restorative sleep at night, which brings with it multiple benefits for healing and recovery. Indeed, this ideal may not be physiologically feasible given a child's critical illness and trajectory, but defining it as the "gold standard" for early mobilization provides a consistent goal for the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) hospitalization. As such, goal-directed, patient-specific sedation plans are integral to creating a culture of mobility in the PICU. We review currently available sedation strategies for mechanically ventilated children for successful implementation of early mobilization in the PICU, as well as pharmacologic considerations for specific classes of sedative-analgesics.
