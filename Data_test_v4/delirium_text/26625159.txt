26625159|t|Relationship of Hippocampal Volume to Amyloid Burden across Diagnostic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease.
26625159|a|AIMS: To assess how hippocampal volume (HV) from volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (vMRI) is related to the amyloid status at different stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its relevance to patient care. METHODS: We evaluated the ability of HV to predict the florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid positive/negative status by group in healthy controls (HC, n = 170) and early/late mild cognitive impairment (EMCI, n = 252; LMCI, n = 136), and AD dementia (n = 75) subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Grand Opportunity (ADNI-GO) and ADNI2. Logistic regression analyses, including elastic net classification modeling with 10-fold cross-validation, were used with age and education as covariates. RESULTS: HV predicted amyloid status only in LMCI using either logistic regression [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.71, p < 0.001] or elastic net classification modeling [positive predictive value (PPV) = 72.7%]. In EMCI, age (AUC = 0.70, p < 0.0001) and age and/or education (PPV = 63.1%), but not HV, predicted amyloid status. CONCLUSION: Using clinical neuroimaging, HV predicted amyloid status only in LMCI, suggesting that HV is not a biomarker surrogate for amyloid PET in clinical applications across the full diagnostic spectrum.
