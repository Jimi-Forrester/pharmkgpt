38367039|a|Methylmercury (MeHg) is a well-known environmental neurotoxicant that causes severe brain disorders such as Minamata disease. Although some patients with Minamata disease develop olfactory dysfunction, the underlying pathomechanism is largely unknown. We examined the effects of MeHg on the olfactory system using a model of MeHg poisoning in which mice were administered 30 ppm MeHg in drinking water for 8 weeks. Mice exposed to MeHg displayed significant mercury accumulation in the olfactory pathway, including the nasal mucosa, olfactory bulb, and olfactory cortex. The olfactory epithelium was partially atrophied, and olfactory sensory neurons were diminished. The olfactory bulb exhibited an increase in apoptotic cells, hypertrophic astrocytes, and amoeboid microglia, mainly in the granular cell layer. Neuronal cell death was observed in the olfactory cortex, particularly in the ventral tenia tecta. Neuronal cell death was also remarkable in higher-order areas such as the orbitofrontal cortex. Correlation analysis showed that neuronal loss in the olfactory cortex was strongly correlated with the plasma mercury concentration. Our results indicate that MeHg is an olfactory toxicant that damages the central regions involved in odor perception. The model described herein is useful for analyzing the mechanisms and treatments of olfactory dysfunction in MeHg-intoxicated patients.
