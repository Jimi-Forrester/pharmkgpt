38099854|a|As the most prevalent chronic liver disease globally, NAFLD encompasses a pathological process that ranges from simple steatosis to NASH, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC, closely associated with numerous extrahepatic diseases. While the initial etiology was believed to be hepatocyte injury caused by lipid toxicity from accumulated triglycerides, recent studies suggest that an imbalance of cholesterol homeostasis is of greater significance. The role of nuclear receptors in regulating liver cholesterol homeostasis has been demonstrated to be crucial. This review summarizes the roles and regulatory mechanisms of nuclear receptors in the 3 main aspects of cholesterol production, excretion, and storage in the liver, as well as their cross talk in reverse cholesterol transport. It is hoped that this review will offer new insights and theoretical foundations for the study of the pathogenesis and progression of NAFLD and provide new research directions for extrahepatic diseases associated with NAFLD.
