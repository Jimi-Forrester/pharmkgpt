36288928|a|Cerebral amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are several molecular species of Abeta, including Abeta40, Abeta42, and Abeta43, and the pathological roles of Abeta43 have attracted particular attention in recent years. Abeta43 is mainly deposited as senile plaques (SPs) in AD brains, and is known to be more amyloidogenic and neurotoxic than Abeta42 and Abeta40. Abeta40 and Abeta42 deposition have been demonstrated in several animal species, while Abeta43 deposition has not been studied in animals. The brains of sea lions, dogs, and cats exhibit unique age-related Abeta pathologies. In the present study, the deposition patterns of Abeta40, Abeta42, and Abeta43 were examined immunohistochemically in the brains of aged dogs (n=52), sea lions (n=5), and cats (n=17). In dogs, most cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) lesions and primitive SPs were positive for Abeta42, Abeta43, and Abeta40. However, diffuse SPs and capillary CAA lesions were negative for Abeta40. In sea lions, all SPs and most CAA lesions were positive for Abeta42, Abeta43, and Abeta40, while capillary CAA lesions were negative for Abeta40. In cats, Abeta42-immunopositive granular aggregates and arteriole and capillary CAA lesions were positive for Abeta43, but negative for Abeta40. Double-labelling immunohistochemistry revealed the co-localization of Abeta42 and Abeta43. These findings suggest that Abeta43 and Abeta42 are frequently deposited in the brains of Carnivora animals and may play an important role in Abeta pathology.
