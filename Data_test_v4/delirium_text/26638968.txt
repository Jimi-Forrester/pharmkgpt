26638968|a|INTRODUCTION: Delirium is a common neurocognitive syndrome that takes place during hospitalizations, associated with worse global outcomes in patients who present it. Despite this, it is usually under-recognized as a disease that needs specific treatment. OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate of prevalence of delirium in Internal Medicine Service patients and evaluate missed diagnosis of the syndrome made by attending physicians, medical residents or interns in charge. METHODS: This is a descriptive observational study carried out in the Internal Medicine Service of Dr. Eduardo Pereira Hospital (April 12 - May 12, 2014) evaluating 125 patients who were admitted to this service. Through the Confusion Assessment Method Instrument, the prevalence of delirium disease and the number of missed diagnosis was established. RESULTS: One hundred and two (102) patients met the inclusion criteria. Nineteen (19) (18.6%) of them were diagnosed with delirium. In the diagnosed patient group, 13 (68.4%) were women. Delirium diagnosis was missed in eight patients (42.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of delirium in this specific Hospital is as expected, according to the literature. Considering the diagnostic tools available, it is crucial to train health workers to improve recognition and management of this syndrome.
