38601378|t|Japanese Encephalitis Outbreak in Young Adults of Bastar District in Chhattisgarh: A Short Observational Study.
38601378|a|Background Instant infections in children due to acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) were reported in a tribal district of Bastar in Chattisgarh, India, between August 2018 and August 2019. Objective The study was conducted to explore the possibility of a viral cause indicating an outbreak. Methods Clinical surveys and serological investigation tests were conducted to identify the viral etiology. The Bastar area in Chhattisgarh reported factors such as paddy fields near homes, a high pig-to-cattle ratio, a significant presence of Culex vishnui mosquitoes, low socioeconomic status, and a lack of health awareness among the tribal people. Result This study, conducted at the Late Baliram Kashyap Memorial Government Medical College in Jagdalpur, Bastar, Chhattisgarh, India, analyzed 128 samples from fever cases out of 213 patients visiting the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) testing center. Among these samples, 71 cases exhibited AES, and subsequent JEV IgM ELISA testing identified 18 cases as JEV-positive, signifying recent JEV infections. Notably, the overwhelming majority (94.44%) of JEV-positive patients were under 16 years old, highlighting the heightened vulnerability of children to JEV illness in the Bastar region. Although male patients accounted for 61.11% of the JEV-positive cases compared to 38.88% of female patients, statistical analysis revealed that this gender disparity was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.18). Conclusion The study emphasizes the significance of identifying the etiology and delivering evidence-based care to patients with AES. Improved diagnosis and management of AES may result from a greater comprehension of the advantages and disadvantages associated with the application and administration of common laboratory and diagnostic algorithms.
