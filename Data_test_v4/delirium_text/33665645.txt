33665645|a|COVID-19 disproportionately affects older people, with likelihood of severe complications and death mirroring that of other age-associated diseases. Inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) has been shown to delay or reverse many age-related phenotypes, including declining immune function. Rapamycin (sirolimus) and rapamycin derivatives are US Food and Drug Administration-approved inhibitors of mTORC1 with broad clinical utility and well established dosing and safety profiles. Based on preclinical and clinical evidence, a strong case can be made for immediate large-scale clinical trials to assess whether rapamycin and other mTORC1 inhibitors can prevent COVID-19 infection in these populations and also to determine whether these drugs can improve outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19.
