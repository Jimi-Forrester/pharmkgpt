35365805|a|Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), caused by mutations in Presenilin (PSEN1/2) and Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) genes, is associated with an early age at onset (AAO) of symptoms. AAO is relatively consistent within families and between carriers of the same mutations, but differs markedly between individuals carrying different mutations. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of why certain mutations manifest several decades earlier than others is extremely important in elucidating the foundations of pathogenesis and AAO. Pathogenic mutations affect the protease (PSEN/gamma-secretase) and the substrate (APP) that generate amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides. Altered Abeta metabolism has long been associated with AD pathogenesis, with absolute or relative increases in Abeta42 levels most commonly implicated in the disease development. However, analyses addressing the relationships between these Abeta42 increments and AAO are inconsistent. Here, we investigated this central aspect of AD pathophysiology via comprehensive analysis of 25 FAD-linked Abeta profiles. Hypothesis- and data-driven approaches demonstrate linear correlations between mutation-driven alterations in Abeta profiles and AAO. In addition, our studies show that the Abeta (37 + 38 + 40) / (42 + 43) ratio offers predictive value in the assessment of 'unclear' PSEN1 variants. Of note, the analysis of PSEN1 variants presenting additionally with spastic paraparesis, indicates that a different mechanism underlies the aetiology of this distinct clinical phenotype. This study thus delivers valuable assays for fundamental, clinical and genetic research as well as supports therapeutic interventions aimed at shifting Abeta profiles towards shorter Abeta peptides.
