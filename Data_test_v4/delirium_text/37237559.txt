37237559|t|Age and Sex Determine Electrocardiogram Parameters in the Octodon degus.
37237559|a|Cardiovascular diseases represent the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, and age is an important risk factor. Preclinical models provide supportive evidence toward age-related cardiac changes, as well as allow for the study of pathological aspects of the disease. In the present work, we evaluated the electrocardiogram (ECG) recording in the O. degus during the aging process in both females and males. Taking into account the age and sex, our study provides the normal ranges for the heart rate, duration and voltage of the ECG waves and intervals, as well as electrical axis deviation. We found that the QRS complex duration and QTc significantly increased with age, whereas the heart rate significantly decreased. On the other hand, the P wave, PR and QTc segments durations, S wave voltage and electrical axis were found to be significantly different between males and females. The heart rhythm was also altered in aged animals, resulting in an increased incidence of arrhythmias, especially in males. Based on these results, we suggest that this rodent model could be useful for cardiovascular research, including impacts of aging and biological sex.
