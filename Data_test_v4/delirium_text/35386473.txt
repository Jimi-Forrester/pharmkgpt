35386473|a|Introduction: Drawing on the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (AT[N]) model, the study examined whether the tau positron emission tomography (PET) biomarker [18F]AV-1451 was associated with episodic memory problems beyond what was predicted by the amyloid beta (Abeta) PET in Down syndrome (DS). Methods: Data from 123 non-demented adults with DS (M  = 47 years, standard deviation = 6.34) were analyzed. The Cued Recall Test assessed episodic memory. Tau PET standardized update value ratio (SUVR) was assessed across Braak regions as continuous and binary (high tau [TH] vs. low tau [TL]) variable. Global PET Abeta SUVR was assessed as binary variable (Abeta- vs. Abeta+). Results: In models adjusting for controls, tau SUVR was negatively associated with episodic memory performance in the Abeta+ but not Abeta- group. The Abeta+/TH group evidenced significantly worse episodic memory than the Abeta+/TL group. Discussion: Similar to late-onset and autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (AD), high tau was an indicator of early prodromal AD in DS.
