36077275|t|Secondary Metabolites with Biomedical Applications from Plants of the Sarraceniaceae Family.
36077275|a|Carnivorous plants have fascinated researchers and hobbyists for centuries because of their mode of nutrition which is unlike that of other plants. They are able to produce bioactive compounds used to attract, capture and digest prey but also as a defense mechanism against microorganisms and free radicals. The main purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the secondary metabolites with significant biological activity found in the Sarraceniaceae family. The review also underlines the necessity of future studies for the biochemical characterization of the less investigated species. Darlingtonia, Heliamphora and Sarracenia plants are rich in compounds with potential pharmaceutical and medical uses. These belong to several classes such as flavonoids, with flavonol glycosides being the most abundant, monoterpenes, triterpenes, sesquiterpenes, fatty acids, alkaloids and others. Some of them are well characterized in terms of chemical properties and biological activity and have widespread commercial applications. The review also discusses biological activity of whole extracts and commercially available products derived from Sarraceniaceae plants. In conclusion, this review underscores that Sarraceniaceae species contain numerous substances with the potential to advance health. Future perspectives should focus on the discovery of new molecules and increasing the production of known compounds using biotechnological methods.
