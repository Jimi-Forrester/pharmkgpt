37641070|t|A review of anti-tumour effects of Ganoderma lucidum in gastrointestinal cancer.
37641070|a|Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer is the most common cancer in the world and one of the main causes of cancer-related death. Clinically, surgical excision and chemotherapy are the main treatment methods for GI cancer, which is unfortunately accompanied with serious adverse reactions and drug toxicity, bringing irreversible damage to patients and seriously affecting the quality of life. Ganoderma lucidum (G. lucidum) has a long history of medicinal and edible use in China. Its bioactive compounds mainly include polysaccharides, triterpenes, and proteins, which have potential anti-tumor activities by inhibiting proliferation, inducing apoptosis, inhibiting metastasis, and regulating autophagy. Currently, there is no in-depth review on the anti-tumor effect of G. lucidum in GI cancer. Therefore, this review is an attempt to compile the basic characteristics, anti-GI caner mechanisms, and clinical application of G. lucidum, aiming to provide a reference for further research on the role of G. lucidum in the prevention and treatment of GI cancer from the perspective of traditional Chinese and western medicine.
