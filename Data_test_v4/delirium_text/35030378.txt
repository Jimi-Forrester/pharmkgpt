35030378|a|There have been increasing reports of atypical neuropsychological symptoms among patients hospitalized with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although numerous pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed to account for the association between COVID-19 and delirium, few studies have examined factors associated with its development and none have done so in the context of a veteran sample. The current study exploratorily examined demographic and medical variables that might be associated with delirium among a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 positive veterans. Demographic and medical data were extracted from the computerized patient records of 162 veterans who were admitted to a large southeastern Veterans Affairs hospital for COVID-19 complications between March 1, 2020 and April 20, 2020. At the zero-order level, age, a history of cardiovascular illness, length of stay, intensive care unit admission, initiation of new dialysis, and the development of new thromboembolic or cardiac findings were associated with delirium. However, when simultaneously examining the impact of these predictor variables in a logistic regression, only length of stay and new cardiac findings increased the odds of delirium. Findings highlight the importance of continued investigation into factors that may account for neuropsychiatric dysfunction among COVID-19 patients.
