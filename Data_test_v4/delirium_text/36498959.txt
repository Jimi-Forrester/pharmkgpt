36498959|t|RNA-Binding Proteins as Epigenetic Regulators of Brain Functions and Their Involvement in Neurodegeneration.
36498959|a|A central aspect of nervous system development and function is the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA fate, which implies time- and site-dependent translation, in response to cues originating from cell-to-cell crosstalk. Such events are fundamental for the establishment of brain cell asymmetry, as well as of long-lasting modifications of synapses (long-term potentiation: LTP), responsible for learning, memory, and higher cognitive functions. Post-transcriptional regulation is in turn dependent on RNA-binding proteins that, by recognizing and binding brief RNA sequences, base modifications, or secondary/tertiary structures, are able to control maturation, localization, stability, and translation of the transcripts. Notably, most RBPs contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that are thought to be involved in the formation of membrane-less structures, probably due to liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Such structures are evidenced as a variety of granules that contain proteins and different classes of RNAs. The other side of the peculiar properties of IDRs is, however, that, under altered cellular conditions, they are also prone to form aggregates, as observed in neurodegeneration. Interestingly, RBPs, as part of both normal and aggregated complexes, are also able to enter extracellular vesicles (EVs), and in doing so, they can also reach cells other than those that produced them.
