36514093|a|BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity after surgery is an important risk factor for postoperative complications. Compared to conventional physiotherapy, activity-promoting video games are often more motivating and engaging for patients with physical impairments. This effect could be enhanced by immersive virtual reality (VR) applications that visually, aurally and haptically simulate a virtual environment and provide a more interactive experience. The use of VR-based fitness games in the early postoperative phase could contribute to improved mobilisation and have beneficial psychological effects. Currently, there is no data on the use of VR-based fitness games in the early postoperative period after colorectal surgery. METHODS: This pilot trial features a single-centre, randomised, two-arm study design with a 1:1 allocation. Patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery for colorectal cancer or liver metastases of colorectal cancer will be recruited. Participants will be randomly assigned to an intervention group or a control group. Patients randomised to the intervention group will perform immersive virtual reality-based fitness exercises during their postoperative hospital stay. Feasibility and clinical outcomes will be assessed. DISCUSSION: Early mobilisation after surgery is crucial for reducing many postoperative complications. VR-based interventions are easy to use and often inexpensive, especially compared to interventions that require more medical staff and equipment. VR-based interventions could serve as an alternative or complement to regular physiotherapy and enhance mobilisation after surgery. The proposed pilot study will be the first step to evaluate the feasibility of VR-based interventions in the perioperative period, with the aim of improving the postoperative rehabilitation of cancer patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial has been registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS) Nr. DRKS00024888 , on April 13, 2021, WHO Universal Trial Number (UTN) U1111-1261-5968.
