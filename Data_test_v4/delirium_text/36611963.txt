36611963|t|Fullerenols Prevent Neuron Death and Reduce Oxidative Stress in Drosophila Huntington's Disease Model.
36611963|a|Huntington's disease (HD) is one of the human neurodegenerative diseases for which there is no effective treatment. Therefore, there is a strong demand for a novel neuroprotective agent that can alleviate its course. Fullerene derivatives are considered to be such agents; however, they need to be comprehensively investigated in model organisms. In this work, neuroprotective activity of C60(OH)30 and C120O(OH)44 fullerenols was analyzed for the first time in a Drosophila transgenic model of HD. Lifespan, behavior, oxidative stress level and age-related neurodegeneration were assessed in flies with the pathogenic Huntingtin protein expression in nerve cells. Feed supplementation with hydroxylated C60 fullerene and C120O dimer oxide molecules was shown to diminish the oxidative stress level and neurodegenerative processes in the flies' brains. Thus, fullerenes displayed neuroprotective activity in this model.
