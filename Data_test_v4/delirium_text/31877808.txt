31877808|t|Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms among Pediatric In-Patients with Dengue Fever: A Case-Control Study.
31877808|a|BACKGROUND: Psychiatric symptoms have been reported in adult patients with dengue fever (DF); however, information on pediatric patients remains inadequate. We sought to identify the prevalence and predictors of depressive and anxiety symptoms and identify other psychiatric symptoms among pediatric patients with DF. This case-control study involved pediatric in-patients (n = 225) who had clinical or serologic-confirmed DF and healthy school-based controls (n = 260). Participants completed the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS). RESULTS: The prevalence of depressive (13.3%) and anxiety (34.2%) symptoms among pediatric patients with DF was significantly (p < 0.001) higher than that among controls (3.5% and 16.2%, respectively). Multiple linear regression analysis found that age, family history of DF, <=2 days of hospitalization, myalgia, and arthralgia were predictors of increased depressive and anxiety symptoms among the patients. Further, 26.7% of pediatric patients reported irritability, agitation, visual hallucinations, and aggressiveness. CONCLUSION: Pediatric patients present depressive and anxiety symptoms whose levels were associated with social and clinical factors. However, whether these symptoms are present only during the infection or may still persist after recovery or are brought by children's adverse reactions to hospitalization are unknown, and thus, further studies are needed.
