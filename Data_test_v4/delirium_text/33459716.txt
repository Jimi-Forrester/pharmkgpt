33459716|t|Learning Deficits Accompanied by Microglial Proliferation After the Long-Term Post-Injection of Alzheimer's Disease Brain Extract in Mouse Brains.
33459716|a|BACKGROUND: Human tauopathy brain injections into the mouse brain induce the development of tau aggregates, which spread to functionally connected brain regions; however, the features of this neurotoxicity remain unclear. One reason may be short observational periods because previous studies mostly used mutated-tau transgenic mice and needed to complete the study before these mice developed neurofibrillary tangles. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether long-term incubation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain in the mouse brain cause functional decline. METHODS: We herein used Tg601 mice, which overexpress wild-type human tau, and non-transgenic littermates (NTg) and injected an insoluble fraction of the AD brain into the unilateral hippocampus. RESULTS: After a long-term (17-19 months) post-injection, mice exhibited learning deficits detected by the Barnes maze test. Aggregated tau pathology in the bilateral hippocampus was more prominent in Tg601 mice than in NTg mice. No significant changes were observed in the number of Neu-N positive cells or astrocytes in the hippocampus, whereas that of Iba-I-positive microglia increased after the AD brain injection. CONCLUSION: These results potentially implicate tau propagation in functional decline and indicate that long-term changes in non-mutated tau mice may reflect human pathological conditions.
