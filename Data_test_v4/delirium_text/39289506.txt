39289506|t|Retention of ES cell-derived 129S genome drives NLRP1 hypersensitivity and transcriptional deregulation in Nlrp3tm1Flv mice.
39289506|a|Immune response genes are highly polymorphic in humans and mice, with heterogeneity amongst loci driving strain-specific host defence responses. The inadvertent retention of polymorphic loci can introduce confounding phenotypes, leading to erroneous conclusions, and impeding scientific advancement. In this study, we employ a combination of RNAseq and variant calling analyses to identify a substantial region of 129S genome, including the highly polymorphic Nlrp1 locus, proximal to Nlrp3, in one of the most commonly used mouse models of NLRP3 deficiency (Nlrp3tm1Flv). We show that the presence of the Nlrp1129S locus leads to an increase in NLRP1B protein expression, and a sensitising of Nlrp3tm1Flv macrophages to NLRP1 inflammasome activation, independent of NLRP3 deficiency. Retention of 129S genome further leads to protein sequence differences and altered gene regulation across multiple cell types, including of the key tissue-resident macrophage marker, TIM4. Using alternative models of NLRP3 deficiency, including a previously undescribed conditional Nlrp3 allele enabling precise temporal and cell-type specific control over Nlrp3 deletion, we further show that NLRP3 contributes to Talabostat-driven IL-1beta release. Our study also establishes a generic framework to identify functionally relevant SNPs and assess genomic contamination in transgenic mice using RNAseq data. This allows for unambiguous attribution of phenotypes to the target gene and advances the precision and reliability of research in the field of host defence responses.
