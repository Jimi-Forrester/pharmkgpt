39213081|t|Normative Scores on the Clock Drawing Test Among Older Adults from a Large Population Survey in Norway: The HUNT Study.
39213081|a|Background: The Clock Drawing Test (CDT) is used to screen for Alzheimer's disease and other dementia disorders. Normative scores on the version from the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) do not exist in the Nordic countries. Objective: To examine the normative scores of the CDT among adults aged 70 years and older. Methods: We included 4,023 cognitively healthy persons aged 70-97 years from a population survey in Norway. They were examined with the CDT, which has a total score between zero and three. A multiple multinominal regression model was applied with a CDT score as the dependent categorical variable and estimated the probabilities of scoring a particular score, stratified by age, sex, and education. These probabilities correspond to an expected proportion of the normative population scoring at, or below a given percentile. Results: None scored zero, 2.1% scored one, 14.9% scored two, and 83% scored three. Higher age, female sex and fewer years of schooling were associated with poorer performance. Scores of zero and one deviated from the normative score regardless of age, sex and education. A score of two was within the norm for a female older than 81 and a male older than 85. Conclusions: The majority (83%) of people 70 years and older had a score of three on the CDT. Lower age, male sex, and higher education were associated with a better performance. Scores of zero and one were below the normative score. Except for the very old, a score of two was also well below the normative score.
