35662264|t|Structural retinal changes in cerebral small vessel disease.
35662264|a|Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is an important contributor to cognitive impairment and stroke. Previous research has suggested associations with alterations in single retinal layers. We have assessed changes of all individual retinal layers in CSVD using high-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) for the first time. Subjects with recent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) underwent macular and peripapillary retinal imaging using OCT for this case-control study. Number and volume ratio index (WMRI) of white matter lesions (WML) were determined on MRI. Data were analyzed using multiple linear regression models. 27 CSVD patients and 9 control participants were included. Ganglion cell layer (GCL) volume was significantly reduced in patients with CSVD compared to age-matched controls (p = 0.008). In patients with CSVD, larger foveal outer plexiform layer (OPL) volume and decreased temporal peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness were significantly associated with a higher WMRI in linear regression when controlling for age (p <= 0.033). Decreased foveal GCL volume and temporal-inferior RNFL thickness at Bruch's membrane opening (MRW), and increased temporal MRW were associated with a higher WML burden (p <= 0.037). Thus, we identified alterations in several OCT layers in individuals with CSVD (GCL, OPL, MRW and RNFL). Their potential diagnostic value merits further study.
