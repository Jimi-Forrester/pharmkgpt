37915255|t|ATG5 (autophagy related 5) in microglia controls hippocampal neurogenesis in Alzheimer disease.
37915255|a|Macroautophagy/autophagy is the intracellular degradation process of cytoplasmic content and damaged organelles. Autophagy is strongly associated with the progression of Alzheimer disease (AD). Microglia are brain-resident macrophages, and recent studies indicate that autophagy in microglia protects neurons from neurodegeneration. Postnatal neurogenesis, the generation of new neurons from adult neural stem cells (NSCs), is impaired in AD patients as well as in AD animal models. However, the extent to which microglial autophagy influences adult NSCs and neurogenesis in AD animal models has not been studied. Here, we showed that conditional knock out (cKO) of Atg5 (autophagy related 5) in microglia inhibited postnatal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, but not in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of a 5xFAD mouse model. Interestingly, the protection of neurogenesis by Atg5 in microglia was only observed in female AD mice. To confirm the roles of autophagy in microglia for postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis, we generated additional cKO mice to delete autophagy essential genes Rb1cc1 or Atg14 in microglia. However, these rb1cc1 cKO and atg14 cKO mice did not exhibit neurogenesis defects in the context of a female AD mouse model. Last, we used the CSF1R antagonist to deplete ATG5-deficient microglia and this intervention restored neurogenesis in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice. These results indicate that microglial ATG5 is essential to maintain postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis in a mouse model of AD. Our findings further support the notion that ATG5 in microglia supports NSC health and may prevent neurodegeneration.
