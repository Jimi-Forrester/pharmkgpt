36243678|t|Transcriptomes of Clusterin- and S100B-transfected neuronal cells elucidate protective mechanisms against hypoxia and oxidative stress in the hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) brain.
36243678|a|BACKGROUND: The hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) exhibits impressive diving skills and can tolerate extended durations of asphyxia, hypoxia and oxidative stress, without suffering from irreversible neuronal damage. Thus, when exposed to hypoxia in vitro, neurons of fresh cortical and hippocampal tissue from hooded seals maintained their membrane potential 4-5 times longer than neurons of mice. We aimed to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the intrinsic neuronal hypoxia tolerance. Previous comparative transcriptomics of the visual cortex have revealed that S100B and clusterin (apolipoprotein J), two stress proteins that are involved in neurological disorders characterized by hypoxic conditions, have a remarkably high expression in hooded seals compared to ferrets. When overexpressed in murine neuronal cells (HN33), S100B and clusterin had neuroprotective effects when cells were exposed to hypoxia. However, their specific roles in hypoxia have remained largely unknown. METHODS: In order to shed light on potential molecular pathways or interaction partners, we exposed HN33 cells transfected with either S100B, soluble clusterin (sCLU) or nuclear clusterin (nCLU) to normoxia, hypoxia and oxidative stress for 24 h. We then determined cell viability and compared the transcriptomes of transfected cells to control cells. Potential pathways and upstream regulators were identified via Gene Ontology (GO) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). RESULTS: HN33 cells transfected with sCLU and S100B demonstrated improved glycolytic capacity and reduced aerobic respiration at normoxic conditions. Additionally, sCLU appeared to enhance pathways for cellular homeostasis to counteract stress-induced aggregation of proteins. S100B-transfected cells sustained lowered energy-intensive synaptic signaling. In response to hypoxia, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathways were considerably elevated in nCLU- and sCLU-transfected cells. In a previous study, S100B and sCLU decreased the amount of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation in HN33 cells in response to oxidative stress, but in the present study, these functional effects were not mirrored in gene expression changes. CONCLUSIONS: sCLU and S100B overexpression increased neuronal survival by decreasing aerobic metabolism and synaptic signaling in advance to hypoxia and oxidative stress conditions, possibly to reduce energy expenditure and the build-up of deleterious reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, a high expression of CLU isoforms and S100B is likely beneficial during hypoxic conditions.
