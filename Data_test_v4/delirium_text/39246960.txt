39246960|t|The Diagnostic Challenge of a Dyshidrosiform Bullous Pemphigoid: A Palmar Puzzle.
39246960|a|We present a unique case of an 89-year-old male with Alzheimer's disease who developed hemorrhagic blisters on his palms, which ruptured with time and were followed by pruritic erythematous lesions across his chest, upper back, lower abdomen, and thighs. The patient was diagnosed with dyshidrosiform bullous pemphigoid (DBP), an uncommon variant of the autoimmune condition bullous pemphigoid characterized by cutaneous and mucosal blistering, which commonly appears as vesiculobullous eruptions in the palmoplantar areas and may spread to other parts of the body. Less than 100 cases of DBP have been documented in the medical literature. Since DBP is difficult to identify and treat due to its clinical appearance similar to pompholyx, we reviewed the treatment of DBP and included clinical images and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) staining technique images to better establish the diagnosis.
