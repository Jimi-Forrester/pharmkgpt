26191501|a|INTRODUCTION: Fruits of oleaster (Elaeagnus angustifolia L.) were used in traditional medicine to treat various diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the phenol and flavonoid contents and antioxidant activity of methanol extracts from the fruit peel, flesh and seed of seven genotypes of oleaster. METHODS: The phenol and flavonoid contents were determined using spectrophotometric methods. Antioxidant and antiradical activities were determined using reducing power, ferric-reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) and ability to scavenge DPPH radical assays. RESULTS: Significant differences ( P < 0.05) were found in phenol and flavonoid contents and antioxidant activity among components of fruit and within various genotypes. CONCLUSION: RESULTS indicated that oleaster has good fruit quality varying among different genotypes. Seeds of fruits have excellent antioxidant activity and phenolic contents in comparison to flesh and peel.
