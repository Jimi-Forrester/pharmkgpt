35340050|t|Serum Beta-Synuclein Is Higher in Down Syndrome and Precedes Rise of pTau181.
35340050|a|This exploratory case-control study investigates the synaptic marker beta-synuclein in serum and plasma pTau181 in adults with Down syndrome (DS) with (sDS, n = 14) and without (aDS, n = 47) clinical symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD) as well as euploid controls (n = 23). Beta-synuclein was higher in aDS and more pronounced in sDS (p < 0.0001), whereas pTau181 was only higher in sDS (p < 0.0001). Both markers showed good discriminatory power (area under the curve > 0.90) to distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic AD. The data indicate that synaptic alterations belong to the earliest AD-associated events in DS and highlight the value of serum beta-synuclein as a potential early marker of AD.
