39329725|t|Considerations for Using Neuroblastoma Cell Lines to Examine the Roles of Iron and Ferroptosis in Neurodegeneration.
39329725|a|Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of programmed cell death that is influenced by biological processes such as iron metabolism and senescence. As brain iron levels increase with aging, ferroptosis is also implicated in the development of age-related pathologic conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). Indeed, inhibitors of ferroptosis have been shown to be protective in models of degenerative brain disorders like AD/ADRD. Given the inaccessibility of the living human brain for metabolic studies, the goal of this work was to characterize an in vitro model for understanding how aging and iron availability influence neuronal iron metabolism and ferroptosis. First, the human (SH-SY5Y) and mouse (Neuro-2a) neuroblastoma lines were terminally differentiated into mature neurons by culturing in all-trans-retinoic acid for at least 72 h. Despite demonstrating all signs of neuronal differentiation and maturation, including increased expression of the iron storage protein ferritin, we discovered that differentiation conferred ferroptosis resistance in both cell lines. Gene expression data indicates differentiated neurons increase their capacity to protect against iron-mediated oxidative damage by augmenting cystine import, and subsequently increasing intracellular cysteine levels, to promote glutathione production and glutathione peroxidase activity (GPX). In support of this hypothesis, we found that culturing differentiated neurons in cysteine-depleted media sensitized them to GPX4 inhibition, and that these effects are mitigated by cystine supplementation. Such findings are important as they provide guidance for the use of in vitro experimental models to investigate the role of ferroptosis in neurodegeneration in pathologies such as ADRD.
