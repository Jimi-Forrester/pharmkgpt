37686098|t|Preservation of Biomarkers Associated with Alzheimer's Disease (Amyloid Peptides 1-38, 1-40, 1-42, Tau Protein, Beclin 1) in the Blood of Neonates after Perinatal Asphyxia.
37686098|a|Perinatal asphyxia is a complex disease involving massive death of brain cells in full-term newborns. The most impressive consequence of perinatal asphyxia is a neurodegenerative brain injury called hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Management of newborns after perinatal asphyxia is very difficult due to the lack of measurable biomarkers that would be able to assess the severity of the brain injury in the future, help in the selection of therapy, assess the results of treatment and determine the prognosis for the future. Thus, these limitations make long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes unpredictable during life. Quantifying biomarkers that can detect subclinical changes at a stage where routine brain monitoring or imaging is still mute would be a major advance in the care of neonates with brain neurodegeneration after asphyxia. Understanding the effect of perinatal asphyxia on changes in blood neurodegenerative biomarkers over time, which would be commonly used to assess the severity of postpartum encephalopathy, would be an important step in developing precision in predicting the consequences of brain injuries. We urgently need more accurate early predictive markers to guide clinicians when to use neuroprotective therapy. The needed neurodegenerative biomarkers may represent neuronal pathological changes that can be recognized by new technologies such as genomic and proteomic. Nevertheless, the simultaneous blood tau protein and various amyloid changes with the addition of an autophagy marker beclin 1 after perinatal asphyxia have not been studied. We decided to evaluate serum biomarkers of neuronal injury characteristic for Alzheimer's disease such as amyloid peptides (1-38, 1-40 and 1-42), tau protein and beclin 1, which can predict the progression of brain neurodegeneration in future. In this paper, we report for the first time the significant changes in the above molecules in the blood after asphyxia compared to healthy controls during the 1-7, 8-14 and 15+ days ELISA test.
