METHODS: We embedded an analysis of website access in a cohort study conducted in intensive care units with flexible visiting hours in Brazil. Family members were guided to access an educational website designed to help them understand the processes and emotions associated with an intensive care unit stay. Subjects were evaluated for baseline data within the first 48 hours following enrollment and outcome assessment at up to 7 days after patient discharge from the intensive care unit, death, or until the 30th day of the study. The main outcomes were satisfaction using the Critical Care Family Needs Inventory and the presence of anxiety and depression symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: A total of 532 family members were evaluated during the study period. Of these, 61 (11.5%) accessed the website. After adjustments, family members who accessed the website had significantly better mean Critical Care Family Needs Inventory scores (152.8 versus 145.2, p = 0.01) and a lower prevalence of probable clinical anxiety (prevalence ratio 0.35; 95%CI 0.14 - 0.89) than family members who did not access the website. There were no differences regarding symptoms of depression. CONCLUSION: Access to an educational website was associated with higher family satisfaction with care and a lower prevalence of clinical anxiety.
