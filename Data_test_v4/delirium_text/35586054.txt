35586054|a|High blood pressure (BP) plays an important role in the pathogenesis and development of cardiovascular diseases and multi-organ damages. Music has been well known to elicit emotional changes, such as anxiolytic effects. However, whether music therapy lowers BP in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and the potential mechanism remains unknown. SHRs were, respectively exposed to white noise (WN), Western classical music (WM), Chinese classical music (CCM), rock music (RM), and bisoprolol treatment. WN and WM did not lower systemic BP, but CCM and RM significantly lowered BPs in SHRs. The effects of CCM therapy on lowering systemic BPs is comparable to that of bisoprolol at the dose of low to medium. Combination of CCM treatment with bisoprolol further improved systemic BPs and myocardial hypertrophy in SHRs, compared to CCM treatment or bisoprolol alone. Furthermore, IHC and WB analysis indicated that CCM therapy inhibited the beta1/cAMP/PKA and alpha1/PLC/PKC signalings, but didn't alter the beta2/PI3K/Akt signaling. Above all, CCM therapy lowers systemic BPs and alleviates myocardial hypertrophy in hypertensive rats, which may be caused by the inhibitions of beta1/cAMP/PKA and alpha1/PLC/PKC signalings.
