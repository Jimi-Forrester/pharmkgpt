32851604|t|Association of Dexamethasone with Shunt Requirement, Early Disability, and Medical Complications in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.
32851604|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Current guidelines do not support the routine use of corticosteroids in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). However, corticosteroids use in aSAH has been practiced at some centers by convention. The aim of the study was to determine the incidence of hydrocephalus requiring ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement as well as functional outcome on discharge and adverse events attributed to corticosteroids in patients with aSAH treated with different dexamethasone (DXM) treatment schemes. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 206 patients with aSAH stratified to three groups based on the DXM treatment scheme: no corticosteroids, short course of DXM (S-DXM; 4 mg every 6 h for 1 day followed by a daily total dose reduction by 25% and then by 50% on last day), and long course of DXM (L-DXM; 4 mg every 6 h for 5-7 days followed by reduction by 50% every other day). The primary outcome measure was the placement of a VPS, and the secondary outcome was a good functional outcome [modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-3] at hospital discharge. Safety measures were the incidence of infection (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, ventriculitis, meningitis), presence of delirium, and hyperglycemia. RESULTS: There was no difference in the rate of external ventricular drain (EVD) (p = 0.164) and VPS placement (p = 0.792), nor in the rate of good outcome (p = 0.928) among three defined treatment regimens. Moreover, the median duration of treatment with EVD did not differ between subjects treated with no corticosteroids, S-DXM, and L-DXM (p = 0.905), and the probability of EVD removal was similar when stratified according to treatment regimens (log-rank; p = 0.256). Patients who received L-DXM had significantly more complications as compared to patients, who received no corticosteroids or S-DXM (78.4% vs. 58.6%; p = 0.005). After adjustment, L-DXM remained independently associated with increased risk of combined adverse events (OR = 2.72; 95%CI, 1.30-5.72; p = 0.008), infection (OR = 3.45; 95%CI, 1.63-7.30; p = 0.001) and hyperglycemia (OR = 2.05; 95%CI, 1.04-4.04; p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: DXM use among patients with aSAH did not relate to the rate of EVD and VPS placement, duration of EVD treatment, and functional disability at discharge but increased the risk of medical complications.
