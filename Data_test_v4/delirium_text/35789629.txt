35789629|a|The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on children's and caregivers' mental health. We investigated psychopathological symptoms in a group of non-at-risk and a group of at-risk mothers and their school-age children from the pre-pandemic period to the lockdown period and to the post-lockdown period. We used the SCL-90/R to assess mothers' psychological symptoms, the CBCL 11/2-5, and the CBCL 6-18 for the perceived children's emotional-behavioral functioning. Analysis of variance was conducted to assess significant differences in the groups over the three assessment points. Linear regressions were run to investigate the effect of maternal psychological symptoms on their children's functioning. In the non-at-risk group, maternal psychopathological symptoms significantly varied during the pandemic. Children's Aggression scores decreased after the lockdown, while Depression scores significantly increased during lockdown and after. The mothers in the at- risk group presented overall decreasing scores over the three assessment points. Children's Aggression scores did not increase during lockdown. Depression scores did not show significant changes over the three assessment points. Overall, our results showed that mothers' psychopathological risk did not influence specific areas of children's emotional/behavioral functioning, but it had an effect on the general offspring psychological well-being.
