32868002|t|The effect of methionine and folic acid administered in ovo on the hematological parameters of chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus).
32868002|a|Methionine (Met), an essential amino acid in poultry diets, when overdosed may cause hyperhomocysteinemia, which is mainly a trigger for cardiovascular diseases in humans. Homocysteine is neutralized (remethylated) in the presence of folic acid (FA), which also plays an important role in hematopoiesis and participates in the synthesis of DNA, and its deficiencies may result in the development of neural tube defects. One of the basic tools in studying the impact of both xenobiotics and nutrients on the animal organism is hematological analysis. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of in ovo supplementation with Met and FA on the hematological parameters of broiler chickens. On the 17th day of incubation, embryonated eggs (Ross 308) were injected with 5 or 25 mg of Met per egg (M5 and M25), 3 and 15 mg of FA per egg (F3 and F15), or a mixture of these 2 compounds (M5/F3 and M25/F15). The broilers were reared in accordance with welfare regulations and fed with commercial diets ad libitum. Blood samples were collected on the first, seventh, and 35th day of rearing (D1, D7, and D35), and complete hematological analysis was performed. The observed changes in red blood cell parameters probably result from physiological changes occurring during bird growth. Mean erythrocyte volume decreased with the age of chickens in the control, M5, and M25 groups, but not in those supplied with FA. Among supplemented groups, the number of white blood cells on D1 was lower only in group M5 than in the sham (C) group. The analysis of leukograms showed no significant differences between the groups. Comparing D1 with D7 in the group injected with a higher dose of Met and FA (MF25/15), a statistically significant increase in the percentage of lymphocytes and a significant decrease in the percentage of heterophils were observed. In addition, in the group injected with a higher FA dose (F15), there was statistically significant reduction in the percentage of eosinophils and a significant increase in the percentage of monocytes at day 7 compared with day 1. It seems that Met supplementation led to temporary immunosuppression in the animals.
