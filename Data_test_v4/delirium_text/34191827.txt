34191827|a|PURPOSE: The cumulative effect of medication inhibiting acetylcholine activity-also known as anticholinergic burden (AB)-can lead to functional and cognitive decline, falls, and death. Given that studies on the population prevalence of AB are rare, we aimed to describe it in a large and unselected population sample. METHODS: Using the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD) with claims data from ~20% of the German population we analyzed outpatient drug dispensations in 2016. Based on the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) scale, we classified persons into four categories and determined the cumulative AB as continuous variable. RESULTS: Among 16,470,946 persons (54% female), the prevalence of clinically relevant AB (ACB>=3) was 10% (women) and 7% (men). Below age 40 it was highest in persons <=18 years (6% both sexes). At older ages (50-59 vs. 90-99 years), prevalence of ACB>=3 increased from 7% to 26% (men) and from 10% to 32% (women). Medication classes contributing to the cumulative AB differed by age: antihistamines, antibiotics, glucocorticoids (<=19 years), antidepressants (20-49 years), antidepressants, cardiovascular medication, antidiabetics (50-64 years), and additionally medication for urinary incontinence/overactive bladder (>=65 years). Medication dispensed by general physicians contributed most to the cumulative AB. CONCLUSION: Although a clinically relevant AB is particularly common in older persons, prevalence in younger age groups was up to 7%. Given the risks associated with AB in older persons, targeted interventions at the prescriber level are needed. Furthermore, risks associated with AB in younger persons should be explored.
