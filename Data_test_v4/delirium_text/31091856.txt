31091856|t|Validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale
31091856|a|Background/aim: The modifiedYa l ePreoperative Anxiety Scale (m-YPAS) is widely used to measure children's anxiety levels. The aim of this study was to translate the m-YPAS into Turkish and test its validity and reliability in Turkish children. Materials and methods: The English version of the m-YPAS was translated into Turkish using the forward-back-forward translation technique. This study enrolled 120 children. The m-YPAS was administered to 120 children who were recorded on video. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) was used for only 30 of 120 children. The videotapes were evaluated by two experienced observers [an anesthesiologist, ObA(an), and a psychologist, ObB(ps)]. The interrater reliability, concurrent validity, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were analyzed. Results: The  mean  age  of  the  children  was  7.8  +-  2.2  years.The  weighted  kappa  values  of  the  m-YPAS  between  observers  were  in  substantial agreement (kappaw = 0.74-0.80) and almost perfect agreement (kappaw = 0.84-0.85). The Cronbach alpha values were high [alpha = 0.85 for ObA(an) and alpha = 0.86 for ObB(ps)]. The correlation between m-YPAS and STAIC showed good agreement (P < 0.05). The sensitivity and specificity were high, and the predictive value was 92.86%. Conclusion: The Turkish version of the m-YPAS can be applied as a reliable and valid observational questionnaire for Turkish children.
