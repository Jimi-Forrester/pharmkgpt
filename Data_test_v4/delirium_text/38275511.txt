38275511|t|Global Neuropsychopharmacological Prescription Trends in Adults with Schizophrenia, Clinical Correlates and Implications for Practice: A Scoping Review.
38275511|a|It is important to examine the psychotropic prescription practices in schizophrenia, as it can inform regarding changing treatment choices and related patient profiles. No recent reviews have evaluated the global neuropsychopharmacological prescription patterns in adults with schizophrenia. A systematic search of the literature published from 2002 to 2023 found 88 empirical papers pertinent to the utilization of psychotropic agents. Globally, there were wide inter-country and inter-regional variations in the prescription of psychotropic agents. Overall, over time there was an absolute increase in the prescription rate of second-generation antipsychotics (up to 50%), mood stabilizers (up to 15%), and antidepressants (up to 17%), with an observed absolute decrease in the rate of antipsychotic polypharmacy (up to 15%), use of high dose antipsychotic (up to 12% in Asia), clozapine (up to 9%) and antipsychotic long-acting injectables (up to 10%). Prescription patterns were mainly associated with specific socio-demographic (such as age), illness (such as illness duration), and treatment factors (such as adherence). Further work, including more evidence in adjunctive neuropsychopharmacological treatments, pharmaco-economic considerations, and examination of cohorts in prospective studies, can proffer insights into changing prescription trends relevant to different treatment settings and predictors of such trends for enhancement of clinical management in schizophrenia.
