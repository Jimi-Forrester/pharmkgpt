31315570|a|BACKGROUND: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is a life- threatening condition with high rate of disability and mortality. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) and Factor XIIIA (F13A) genes are involved in the pathogenetic mechanism of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH). We evaluated the association of promoter methylation status of APOE and F13A gene and risk of aSAH. METHODS: For evaluating the effect of hypermethylation in the promoter region of these genes with risk of aSAH, we conducted a case -control study with 50 aSAH patients and 50 healthy control. The methylation pattern was analysed using methylation specific PCR. The risk factors associated with poor outcome after aSAH was also analysed in this study. The outcome was assessed using Glasgow outcome score (GOS) after 3 months from the initial bleed. RESULTS: The frequency of APOE and F13A methylation pattern showed insignificant association with risk of aSAH in this study. Gender stratification analysis suggests that F13A promoter methylation status was significantly associated with the risk of aSAH in male gender. Age, aneurysm located at the anterior communicating artery and diabetes mellitus showed significant association with poor outcome after aSAH. CONCLUSION: There was no significant association with APOE promoter methylation with the risk as well as outcome of patients after aSAH. F13A promoter methylation status was significantly associated with risk of aSAH in male gender, with no significant association with outcome after aSAH.
