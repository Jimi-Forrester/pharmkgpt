18630774|a|BACKGROUND: Children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have a higher rate of adverse post-extubation respiratory events, such as laryngospasm, upper airway obstruction, apnea, desaturation and/or need for re-intubation. They are overly sensitive to sedatives and narcotics. Although the etiology of OSA is primarily obstruction (mechanical or neuromuscular), a central element may contribute to OSA. Caffeine citrate has been shown to be effective in treating apnea of prematurity. This study evaluated whether the administration of caffeine benzoate to children with OSA decreases the number of children who experience adverse post-extubation respiratory events. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study, children with OSA scheduled for adenotonsillectomy (T&A) received either caffeine benzoate, 20 mg/kg IV, (caffeine group, n = 36) or saline (placebo group, n = 36). The primary outcome evaluated the number of children who developed adverse post-extubation respiratory events, and the secondary outcome was the incidence of those events. RESULTS: The results demonstrated the two groups differed in the number of children who developed adverse post-extubation respiratory events (p = 0.032). The overall incidence of adverse postoperative respiratory events was less in the caffeine group than the placebo group (p = 0.0196). CONCLUSION: In children with OSA scheduled for T&A, administration of caffeine benzoate, 20 mg/kg IV, decreased the number of children who developed adverse post-extubation respiratory events and decreased the overall incidence of adverse post-extubation respiratory events. PACU duration, hospital discharge time and postoperative delirium did not differ between groups.
