38487010|t|A novel dual serotonin transporter and M-channel inhibitor D01 for antidepression and cognitive improvement.
38487010|a|Cognitive dysfunction is a core symptom common in psychiatric disorders including depression that is primarily managed by antidepressants lacking efficacy in improving cognition. In this study, we report a novel dual serotonin transporter and voltage-gated potassium Kv7/KCNQ/M-channel inhibitor D01 (a 2-methyl-3-aryloxy-3-heteroarylpropylamines derivative) that exhibits both anti-depression effects and improvements in cognition. D01 inhibits serotonin transporters (Ki = 30.1 +- 6.9 nmol/L) and M channels (IC50 = 10.1 +- 2.4 mumol/L). D01 also reduces the immobility duration in the mouse FST and TST assays in a dose-dependent manner without a stimulatory effect on locomotion. Intragastric administrations of D01 (20 and 40 mg/kg) can significantly shorten the immobility time in a mouse model of chronic restraint stress (CRS)-induced depression-like behavior. Additionally, D01 dose-dependently improves the cognitive deficit induced by CRS in Morris water maze test and increases the exploration time with novel objects in normal or scopolamine-induced cognitive deficits in mice, but not fluoxetine. Furthermore, D01 reverses the long-term potentiation (LTP) inhibition induced by scopolamine. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that D01, a dual-target serotonin reuptake and M channel inhibitor, is highly effective in the treatment-resistant depression and cognitive deficits, thus holding potential for development as therapy of depression with cognitive deficits.
