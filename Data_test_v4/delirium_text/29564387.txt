29564387|a|Traditional nuclear medicine ligands were designed to target cellular receptors or transporters with a binding pocket and a defined structure-activity relationship. More recently, tracers have been developed to target pathological protein aggregations, which have less well-defined structure-activity relationships. Aggregations of proteins such as tau, alpha-synuclein, and beta-amyloid (Abeta) have been identified in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias, and Parkinson's disease (PD). Indeed, Abeta deposition is a hallmark of AD, and detection methods have evolved from coloured dyes to modern 18F-labelled positron emission tomography (PET) tracers. Such tracers are becoming increasingly established in routine clinical practice for evaluation of Abeta neuritic plaque density in the brains of adults who are being evaluated for AD and other causes of cognitive impairment. While similar in structure, there are key differences between the available compounds in terms of dosing/dosimetry, pharmacokinetics, and interpretation of visual reads. In the future, quantification of Abeta-PET may further improve its utility. Tracers are now being developed for evaluation of tau protein, which is associated with decreased cognitive function and neurodegenerative changes in AD, and is implicated in the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative diseases. While no compound has yet been approved for tau imaging in clinical use, it is a very active area of research. Development of tau tracers comprises in-depth characterisation of existing radiotracers, clinical validation, a better understanding of uptake patterns, test-retest/dosimetry data, and neuropathological correlations with PET. Tau imaging may allow early, more accurate diagnosis, and monitoring of disease progression, in a range of conditions. Another marker for which imaging modalities are needed is alpha-synuclein, which has potential for conditions including PD and dementia with Lewy bodies. Efforts to develop a suitable tracer are ongoing, but are still in their infancy. In conclusion, several PET tracers for detection of pathological protein depositions are now available for clinical use, particularly PET tracers that bind to Abeta plaques. Tau-PET tracers are currently in clinical development, and alpha-synuclein protein deposition tracers are at early stage of research. These tracers will continue to change our understanding of complex disease processes.
