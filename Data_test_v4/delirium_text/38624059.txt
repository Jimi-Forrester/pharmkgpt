38624059|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship of sarcopenia with systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), monocyte to high-density lipoprotein ratio (MHR) and platelet parameters in geriatric patients. METHODS: We designed a cross-sectional retrospective study in patients presented to a geriatric outpatient clinic for the first time. The diagnosis of sarcopenia was made in accordance with the EWGSOP2 criteria. SIRI, MHR, mean platelet volume /Platelet count (MPV/Plt), platelet distribution width /Platelet (PDW/Plt), platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were calculated from fasting blood test results at the time of admission. RESULTS: Among 262 patients, 79 patients (30.1%) with sarcopenia had significantly higher frequencies of delirium, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease and probable depression (p=0.010; p=0.018; p=0.034; p<0.001). Malnutrition scores and cognitive impairment scores were significantly lower in sarcopenic group (p<0.001 for both). Patients with sarcopenia had significantly higher MHR, SIRI and C-reactive protein values than patients without sarcopenia (p<0.001; p=0.001 and p=0.006, respectively). No significant difference was found between the groups in terms of MPV/Plt, PDW/Plt, PLR (p=0.605; p=0.920; p=0.510). Area under the curve for MHR was 0.675 (95% CI: 0.604-0.746, p0.99. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of higher MHR and SIRI in geriatric sarcopenia patients supports low-grade chronic inflammation in the pathophysiology of sarcopenia. These non-invasive, cost-effective and simple parameters based on traditional peripheral blood cell counts may be warning signs for sarcopenia in the geriatric population (Tab. 3, Fig. 1, Ref. 25).
