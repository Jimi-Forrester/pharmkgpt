8128838|a|After reviewing the evidence for cholinergic pathology in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders, this paper reviews strategies for treating dementia using cholinomimetic drugs. Special attention is paid to cholinesterase inhibitors, particularly tacrine, the drug recently approved by the FDA. New studies suggesting that muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic receptor active drugs may be more effective will be reviewed. Brief mention will be made of strategies to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
