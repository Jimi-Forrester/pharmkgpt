37113743|t|Role of Gut Microbiota and Oxidative Stress in the Progression of Transplant-Related Complications following Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.
37113743|a|Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), also known as bone marrow transplantation, has curative potential for various hematologic malignancies but is associated with risks such as graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), severe bloodstream infection, viral pneumonia, idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), lung fibrosis, and sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), which severely deteriorate clinical outcomes and limit the wide application of HSCT. Recent research has provided important insights into the effects of gut microbiota and oxidative stress (OS) on HSCT complications. Therefore, based on recent studies, we describe intestinal dysbiosis and OS in patients with HSCT and review recent molecular findings underlying the causal relationships of gut microbiota, OS, and transplant-related complications, focusing particularly on the involvement of gut microbiota-mediated OS in postengraftment complications. Also, we discuss the use of antioxidative and anti-inflammatory probiotics to manipulate gut microbiota and OS, which have been associated with promising effects in improving HSCT outcomes.
