37238988|t|Biomarkers of Spinal Cord Injury in Patients Undergoing Complex Endovascular Aortic Repair Procedures-A Narrative Review of Current Literature.
37238988|a|Complex endovascular aortic repair (coEVAR) of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA) has greatly evolved in the past decades. Despite substantial improvements of postoperative care, spinal cord injury (SCI) remains the most devastating complication of coEVAR being associated with impaired patient outcome and having an impact on long-term survival. The rising number of challenges of coEVAR, essentially associated with an extensive coverage of critical blood vessels supplying the spinal cord, resulted in the implementation of dedicated SCI prevention protocols. In addition to maintenance of adequate spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP), early detection of SCI plays an integral role in intra- and postoperative patient care. However, this is challenging due to difficulties with clinical neurological examinations during patient sedation in the postoperative setting. There is a rising amount of evidence, suggesting that subclinical forms of SCI might be accompanied by an elevation of biochemical markers, specific to neuronal tissue damage. Addressing this hypothesis, several studies have attempted to assess the potential of selected biomarkers with regard to early SCI diagnosis. In this review, we discuss biomarkers measured in patients undergoing coEVAR. Once validated in future prospective clinical studies, biomarkers of neuronal tissue damage may potentially add to the armamentarium of modalities for early SCI diagnosis and risk stratification.
