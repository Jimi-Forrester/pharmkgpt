35805160|t|High-Fat Diet Alters the Retinal Pigment Epithelium and Choroidal Transcriptome in the Absence of Gut Microbiota.
35805160|a|Relationships between retinal disease, diet, and the gut microbiome have started to emerge. In particular, high-fat diets (HFDs) are associated with the prevalence and progression of several retinal diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR). These effects are thought to be partly mediated by the gut microbiome, which modulates interactions between diet and host homeostasis. Nevertheless, the effects of HFDs on the retina and adjacent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid at the transcriptional level, independent of gut microbiota, are not well-understood. In this study, we performed the high-throughput RNA-sequencing of germ-free (GF) mice to explore the transcriptional changes induced by HFD in the RPE/choroid. After filtering and cleaning the data, 649 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, with 616 genes transcriptionally upregulated and 33 genes downregulated by HFD compared to a normal diet (ND). Enrichment analysis for gene ontology (GO) using the DEGs was performed to analyze over-represented biological processes in the RPE/choroid of GF-HFD mice relative to GF-ND mice. GO analysis revealed the upregulation of processes related to angiogenesis, immune response, and the inflammatory response. Additionally, molecular functions that were altered involved extracellular matrix (ECM) binding, ECM structural constituents, and heparin binding. This study demonstrates novel data showing that HFDs can alter RPE/choroid tissue transcription in the absence of the gut microbiome.
