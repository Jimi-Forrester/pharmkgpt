38574472|a|INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to evaluate peripheral nerve block (PNB) effectiveness on postoperative pain management and surgical outcomes for displaced femoral-neck fracture in geriatric patients (>70 years) who underwent bipolar hemiarthroplasty (BHA). METHODS: From January 2017 to December 2021, 231 geriatric patients with displaced femoral-neck fracture who consecutively underwent BHA were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) group (n=132) who received only intravenous (IV) PCA for postoperative pain management, and all others who received PNB with IV PCA (PNB+PCA) such as femoral nerve block or fascia iliaca compartment block after surgery (n=99). Primary outcomes were postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) at rest and during activity at 6, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes were postoperative complications, changes in hemoglobin (Hb), length of hospital stay, and total morphine usage after surgery. RESULTS: Postoperative resting VAS at 6 hours and 48 hours was significantly lower in the PNB+PCA group compared with the PCA group (p=0.075, p=0.0318, respectively). However, there was no significant difference in either resting VAS at 24 hours or active VAS. Complications of pneumonia and delirium until one month postoperative were significantly lower in the PNB + PCA group than the PCA group (p=0.0022, p=0.0055, respectively). CONCLUSION: PNB with IV PCA seems to have a beneficial effect on geriatric femoral-neck patients who underwent BHA with postoperative analgesia for reducing postoperative resting pain and complications, especially pneumonia and delirium.
