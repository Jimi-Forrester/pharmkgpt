39723298|t|A Case of Posterior Cortical Atrophy in Alzheimer's Disease.
39723298|a|This is a case of a 67-year-old male diagnosed with posterior cortical atrophy. Posterior cortical atrophy is an underdiagnosed phenomenon seen in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. When this condition manifests in patients with Alzheimer's disease, it is known as a visual variant of Alzheimer's disease. This condition leads to visual disturbances that are due to processing errors in the brain, leaving cognitive functioning unchanged. Patients tend to undergo years of unnecessary ophthalmologic workup leading to unnecessary cost and frustration to the patient. The presentation and diagnostic workup of this disease are discussed in this case report.
