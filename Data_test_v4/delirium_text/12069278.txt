12069278|t|Cerebrovascular disease and cognitive dysfunction.
12069278|a|As the general population ages, the progressive cognitive decline that occurs with aging and dementia is having a significant socioeconomic impact on society. Vascular dementia associated with cerebral vascular disease is now the third most common cause of dementia. Recent evidence has revealed a new and significant etiopathogenetic role of cerebrovascular pathology, as well as newly determined risk factors for the development of neurocognitive deficits and other forms of dementia including Alzheimer's disease. In this article, we summarize the experimental and clinical data linking cerebrovascular pathology to neurocognitive decline and dementia.
