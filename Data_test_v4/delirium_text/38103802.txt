38103802|a|BACKGROUND: The use of technology allows surgeons increased precision in component positioning in total hip arthroplasty (THA). The objective of this study was to compare (1) perioperative complications and (2) resource utilizations between robotic-assisted (RA) and computer-navigated (CN) versus conventional instrumenttaion (CI) THA. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using a large national database to identify patients undergoing unilateral, primary elective THA from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019 using RA, CN, or CI. There were 1,372,300 total patients identified and included RA (29,735), CN (28,480), and CI (1,314,085) THA. Demographics, complications, lengths of stay, dispositions, and costs were compared between the cohorts. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: The use of RA THA led to lower rates of intraoperative fracture (0.22% versus 0.39%), delirium (0.1% versus 0.2%), postoperative anemia (14.4% versus 16.7%), higher myocardial infarction (0.13% versus 0.08%), renal failure (1.7% versus 1.6%), blood transfusion (2.0% versus 1.9%), and wound dehiscence (0.02% versus 0.01%) compared to CI THA. The use of CN led to lower rates of respiratory complication (0.5% versus 0.8%), renal failure (1.1% versus 1.6%), blood transfusion (1.3% versus 1.9%), and pulmonary embolism (0.02% versus 0.1%) compared to CI THA. Total costs were increased in RA ($17,729 versus $15,977) and CN ($22,529 versus $15,977). Lengths of hospital stay were decreased in RA (1.8 versus 1.9 days) and CN (1.7 versus 1.9 days). CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative complication rates vary in technology-assisted THA, with higher rates in RA THA and lower rates in CN THA, relative to CI THA. Both RA THA and CN THA were associated with more costs, shorter postoperative hospital stays, and higher rates of discharge home compared to CI THA.
