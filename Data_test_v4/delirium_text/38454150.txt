38454150|t|Mendelian randomization study of the relationship between blood and urine biomarkers and schizophrenia in the UK Biobank cohort.
38454150|a|BACKGROUND: The identification of suitable biomarkers is of crucial clinical importance for the early diagnosis of treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). This study aims to comprehensively analyze the association between TRS and blood and urine biomarkers. METHODS: Candidate TRS-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained from a recent genome-wide association study. The UK Biobank cohort, comprising 376,807 subjects with blood and urine biomarker testing data, was used to calculate the polygenic risk score (PRS) for TRS. Pearson correlation analyses were performed to evaluate the correlation between TRS PRS and each of the biomarkers, using calculated TRS PRS as the instrumental variables. Bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to assess potential causal associations between candidate biomarkers with TRS. RESULTS: Here we identify a significant association between TRS PRS and phosphate (r = 0.007, P = 1.96 x 10-4). Sex subgroup analyses identify seven and three candidate biomarkers associated with TRS PRS in male and female participants, respectively. For example, total protein and phosphate for males, creatinine and phosphate for females. Bidirectional two-sample MR analyses indicate that TRS is negatively associated with cholesterol (estimate = -0.363, P  = 0.008). Conversely, TRS is positively associated with total protein (estimate = 0.137, P  = 0.027), mean corpuscular volume (estimate = 0.032, P  = 2.25 x 10-5), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (estimate = 0.018, P  = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide insights into the roles of blood and urine biomarkers in the early detection and treatment of TRS.
