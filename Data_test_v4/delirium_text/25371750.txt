25371750|t|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor exerts neuroprotective actions against amyloid beta-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells.
25371750|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains demonstrate decreased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and increased levels of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta), which is neurotoxic. The present study assessed the impact of BDNF on the toxic effects of Abeta25-35-induced apoptosis and the effects on BDNF-mediated signaling using the MTT assay, western blotting and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Abeta25-35 was found to induce an apoptosis, dose-dependent effect on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, which peaked at a concentration of 20 muM after 24 h. A combination of Abeta25-35 and BDNF treatment increased the levels of Akt and decreased the level of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. These findings indicated that BDNF administration exerted a neuroprotective effect against the toxicity of the Abeta25-35-induced apoptosis in these cells, which was accompanied by phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt activation and GSK3beta phosphorylation. The mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying neuronal degeneration induced by the Abeta peptide remain to be further elucidated.
