36606589|t|Paradigms and Success Stories of Natural Products in Drug Discovery against.
36606589|a|Neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) are multifaceted complex disorders that have put a great health and economic burden around the globe nowadays. The multi-factorial nature of NDDs has presented a great challenge in drug discovery and continuous efforts are in progress in search of suitable therapeutic candidates. Nature has a great wealth of active principles in its lap that has cured the human population since ancient times. Natural products have revealed several benefits over conventional synthetic medications and scientists have shifted their vision towards exploring the therapeutic potentials of natural products in the past few years. The structural mimicking of natural compounds to endogenous ligands has presented them as a potential therapeutic candidate to prevent the development of NDDs. In the presented review, authors have summarized demographical facts about various NDDs including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and various types of sclerosis in the brain. The significant findings of new active principles of natural origin along with their therapeutic potentials on NDDs have been included. Also, a description of clinical trials and patents on natural products has been enlisted in this compilation. Although natural products have shown promising success in drug discovery against NDDs, still their use is associated with several ethical issues which need to be solved in the upcoming time.
