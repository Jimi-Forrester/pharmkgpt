39364454|t|Postoperative Delirium and Neurocognitive Disorders: A Comprehensive Review of Pathophysiology, Risk Factors, and Management Strategies.
39364454|a|Postoperative delirium (POD) and neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) are common and serious complications that can occur after surgery, particularly in older adults and those with preexisting cognitive impairments. These conditions are associated with significant morbidity, increased healthcare costs, and reduced quality of life. Understanding the underlying mechanisms, risk factors, and effective management strategies for POD and NCDs is critical for improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare systems. This comprehensive review aims to synthesize current knowledge on the pathophysiology, risk factors, and management strategies for POD and NCDs. It explores the neurobiological and molecular mechanisms contributing to these conditions, identifies the patient-related, surgical, and environmental factors that increase risk, and evaluates pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches to prevention and treatment. A thorough literature review was conducted using recent studies, clinical guidelines, and expert consensus to provide a detailed overview of the pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, prevention, and management of POD and NCDs. The pathophysiology of POD and NCDs involves complex interactions between neuroinflammatory processes, neurotransmitter imbalances, and brain network disruptions. Risk factors include advanced age, preexisting cognitive impairment, type and duration of surgery, and perioperative complications. Management strategies emphasize a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating preoperative optimization, careful intraoperative management, and postoperative interventions. Pharmacological treatments, such as antipsychotics, and non-pharmacological approaches, including environmental modifications and cognitive rehabilitation, play crucial roles in management. Postoperative delirium and NCDs are multifactorial conditions with significant impacts on surgical outcomes. Effective management requires a comprehensive understanding of their pathophysiology and risk factors and the implementation of targeted prevention and treatment strategies. Future research should focus on personalized approaches to prevention and treatment, further elucidation of mechanisms, and developing predictive models to enhance care for patients at risk of these neurocognitive complications.
