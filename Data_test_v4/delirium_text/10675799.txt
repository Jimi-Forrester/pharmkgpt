10675799|a|Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that risk factors for vascular disease are also risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The gene for the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) has recently been reported to be associated with risk for AD. We have investigated the possibility of such an association in 98 clinic-based and 73 community-based AD cases versus 175 community-based controls and find a gender-specific association of ACE genotype with AD in the female clinic population. These data suggest that gender may interact with genetic factors to influence risk for AD. Gender-specific risk for AD has been previously reported, and a biological rationale for involvement of ACE in the AD process is supported by studies exploring the relationship between AD and vascular risk factors such as hypertension. However, the results may also be a consequence of the known anomalies that arise in genetic association studies as a consequence of sample selection.
