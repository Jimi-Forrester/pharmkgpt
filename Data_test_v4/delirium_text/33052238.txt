33052238|t|ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction driven by PU.1-regulated NOX4-p22phox activation in Abeta-induced retinal pigment epithelial cell injury.
33052238|a|Rationale: Amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition, an essential pathological process in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), causes retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) degeneration driven mostly by oxidative stress. However, despite intense investigations, the extent to which overoxidation contributes to Abeta-mediated RPE damage and its potential mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Methods: We performed tandem mass-tagged (TMT) mass spectrometry (MS) and bioinformatic analysis of the RPE-choroid complex in an Abeta1-40-induced mouse model of retinal degeneration to obtain a comprehensive proteomic profile. Key regulators in this model were confirmed by reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection, mitochondrial ROS assay, oxygen consumption rate (OCR) measurement, gene knockout experiment, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and luciferase assay. Results: A total of 4243 proteins were identified, 1069 of which were significantly affected by Abeta1-40 and found to be enriched in oxidation-related pathways by bioinformatic analysis. Moreover, NADPH oxidases were identified as hub proteins in Abeta1-40-mediated oxidative stress, as evidenced by mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species overproduction. By motif and binding site analyses, we found that the transcription factor PU.1/Spi1 acted as a master regulator of the activation of NADPH oxidases, especially the NOX4-p22phox complex. Also, PU.1 silencing impeded RPE oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction and rescued the retinal structure and function. Conclusion: Our study suggests that PU.1 is a novel therapeutic target for AMD, and the regulation of PU.1 expression represents a potentially novel approach against excessive oxidative stress in Abeta-driven RPE injury.
