35706446|t|The Inflamm-Aging Model Identifies Key Risk Factors in Atherosclerosis.
35706446|a|Background: Atherosclerosis, one of the main threats to human life and health, is driven by abnormal inflammation (i.e., chronic inflammation or oxidative stress) during accelerated aging. Many studies have shown that inflamm-aging exerts a significant impact on the occurrence of atherosclerosis, particularly by inducing an immune homeostasis imbalance. However, the potential mechanism by which inflamm-aging induces atherosclerosis needs to be studied more thoroughly, and there is currently a lack of powerful prediction models. Methods: First, an improved inflamm-aging prediction model was constructed by integrating aging, inflammation, and disease markers with the help of machine learning methods; then, inflamm-aging scores were calculated. In addition, the causal relationship between aging and disease was identified using Mendelian randomization. A series of risk factors were also identified by causal analysis, sensitivity analysis, and network analysis. Results: Our results revealed an accelerated inflamm-aging pattern in atherosclerosis and suggested a causal relationship between inflamm-aging and atherosclerosis. Mechanisms involving inflammation, nutritional balance, vascular homeostasis, and oxidative stress were found to be driving factors of atherosclerosis in the context of inflamm-aging. Conclusion: In summary, we developed a model integrating crucial risk factors in inflamm-aging and atherosclerosis. Our computation pipeline could be used to explore potential mechanisms of related diseases.
