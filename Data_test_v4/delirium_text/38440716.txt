38440716|a|Introduction: The efficacy of olaparib for treatment-related neuroendocrine prostate cancer is unknown. Here, we report a case of treatment-related neuroendocrine prostate cancer with a BRCA2 mutation that was treated with olaparib with 1-year efficacy. Case presentation: A 75-year-old man initially diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma developed treatment-related neuroendocrine prostate cancer after 10-year androgen deprivation therapy. Despite the initial temporary effects of etoposide and carboplatin, the patient experienced prostate bed tumor recurrence 1 year after chemotherapy cessation. FoundationOne  detected a BRCA2 gene mutation, and olaparib was initiated after repeating one chemotherapy course using the same chemotherapeutic agents. The patient received olaparib with sustained tumor regression for 1 year without severe side effects. Conclusion: Olaparib may be the treatment of choice for treatment-related neuroendocrine prostate cancer in patients with BRCA mutations.
