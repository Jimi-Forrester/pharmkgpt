36605552|t|Identification of candidate genes associated with clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease.
36605552|a|Background and objective: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, with its pathology like beta-amyloid and phosphorylated tau beginning several years before the clinical onset. The aim is to identify genetic risk factors associated with the onset of AD. Methods: We collected three microarray data of post-mortem brains of AD patients and the healthy from the GEO database and screened differentially expressed genes between AD and healthy control. GO/KEGG analysis was applied to identify AD-related pathways. Then we distinguished differential expressed genes between symptomatic and asymptomatic AD. Feature importance with logistic regression analysis is adopted to identify the most critical genes with symptomatic AD. Results: Data was collected from three datasets, including 184 AD patients and 132 healthy controls. We found 66 genes to be differently expressed between AD and the control. The pathway enriched in the process of exocytosis, synapse, and metabolism and identified 19 candidate genes, four of which (VSNL1, RTN1, FGF12, and ENC1) are vital. Conclusion: VSNL1, RTN1, FGF12, and ENC1 may be the essential genes that progress asymptomatic AD to symptomatic AD. Moreover, they may serve as genetic risk factors to identify high-risk individuals showing an earlier onset of AD.
