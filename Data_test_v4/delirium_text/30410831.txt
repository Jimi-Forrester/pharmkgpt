30410831|a|Non-motor symptoms appear earlier than the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Gustatory rhinorrhea is a rare presentation of Parkinson's disease. We report a case of 70-year-old male who presented to the outpatient department (OPD) with watery secretions on thought or site of food. Symptomatic treatment was advised along with many investigations for the cause. Twenty-two months later the patient developed fine tremors of hands which were evident of Parkinson's disease.
