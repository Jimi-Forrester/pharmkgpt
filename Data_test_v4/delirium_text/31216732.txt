31216732|t|Body Weight Variation Patterns as Predictors of Cognitive Decline over a 5 Year Follow-Up among Community-Dwelling Elderly (MAPT Study).
31216732|a|This study aimed to analyze associations between weight variation patterns and changes in cognitive function and hippocampal volume among non-demented, community-dwelling elderly. Sample was formed of 1394 adults >70 years (63.9% female), all volunteers from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT). Weight loss was defined as >=5% of body weight decrease in the first year of follow-up; weight gain as >=5% of weight increase; and stability if <5% weight variation. Cognition was examined by a Z-score combining four tests. Measures were assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months of follow-up. Hippocampal volume was evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging in 349 subjects in the first year and at 36 months. Mixed models were performed. From the 1394 participants, 5.5% (n = 76) presented weight loss, and 9.0% (n = 125) presented weight gain. Cognitive Z-score decreased among all groups after 5 years, but decline was more pronounced among those who presented weight loss (adjusted between-group mean difference vs. stable: -0.24, 95%CI: -0.41 to -0.07; p = 0.006). After 3 years, hippocampal atrophy was observed among all groups, but no between-group differences were found. In conclusion, weight loss >=5% in the first year predicted higher cognitive decline over a 5 year follow-up among community-dwelling elderly, independently of body mass index.
