28888918|a|Psychopharmacological treatment with antipsychotic drugs is an essential part of guideline-based treatment strategies in psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders, and delusional disorders. Other mental disorders frequently treated with antipsychotic drugs are bipolar disorders, and major depressive disorder. Furthermore, antipsychotic drugs are often given in emergency and surgical units for the treatment of metabolic or postoperative delirium. Antipsychotic drugs can exert direct and indirect effects on the vascular system, potentially leading to severe complications such as thromboembolism. Therefore, knowledge of vascular side effects of antipsychotic drugs is important for clinicians. This clinical orientated review article covers direct and indirect effects of antipsychotics on the vascular system.
