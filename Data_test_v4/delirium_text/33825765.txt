33825765|a|CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Rapid antidepressant effects associated with ketamine have shifted the landscape for the development of therapeutics to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) from a monoaminergic to glutamatergic model. Treatment with ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, may be effective, but has many non-glutamatergic targets, and clinical and logistical problems are potential challenges. These factors underscore the importance of manipulations of binding mechanics to produce antidepressant effects without concomitant clinical side effects. This will require identification of efficient biomarkers to monitor target engagement. The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a widely used electrophysiological signature linked to the activity of NMDA receptors (NMDAR) in humans and animals and validated in pre-clinical and clinical studies of ketamine. In this review, we explore the flexibility of the MMN and its capabilities for reliable use in drug development for NMDAR antagonists in MDD. We supplement this with findings from our own research with three distinct NMDAR antagonists. The research described illustrates that there are important distinctions between the mechanisms of NMDAR antagonism, which are further crystallized when considering the paradigm used to study the MMN. We conclude that the lack of standardized methodology currently prevents MMN from being ready for common use in drug discovery.
