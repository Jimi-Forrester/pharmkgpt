38996387|t|The Importance of Prion Research.
38996387|a|Over the past four decades, prion diseases have received considerable research attention owing to their potential to be transmitted within and across species as well as their consequences for human and animal health. The unprecedented nature of prions has led to the discovery of a paradigm of templated protein misfolding that underlies a diverse range of both disease-related and normal biological processes. Indeed, the "prion-like" misfolding and propagation of protein aggregates is now recognized as a common underlying disease mechanism in human neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and the prion principle has led to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for these illnesses. Despite these advances, research into the fundamental biology of prion diseases has declined, likely due to their rarity and the absence of an acute human health crisis. Given the past translational influence, continued research on the etiology, pathogenesis, and transmission of prion disease should remain a priority. In this review we highlight several important "unsolved mysteries" in the prion disease research field and how solving them may be crucial for the development of effective therapeutics, preventing future outbreaks of prion disease, and understanding the pathobiology of more common human neurodegenerative disorders.
