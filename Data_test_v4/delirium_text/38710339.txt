38710339|a|Understanding the psychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer s disease (AD) is crucial for advancing precision medicine and therapeutic strategies. The relationship between AD behavioral symptoms and asymmetry in spatial tau PET patterns is not well-known. Braak tau progression implicates the temporal lobes early. However, the clinical and pathological implications of temporal tau laterality remain unexplored. This cross-sectional study investigated the correlation between temporal tau PET asymmetry and behavior assessed using the neuropsychiatric inventory and composite scores for memory, executive function, and language, using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. In the entire cohort, continuous right and left temporal tau contributions to behavior and cognition were evaluated, controlling for age, sex, education, and tau burden on the contralateral side. Additionally, a temporal tau laterality index was calculated to define "asymmetry-extreme" groups (individuals with laterality indices greater than two standard deviations from the mean). 695 individuals (age = 73.9 +- 7.6 years, 372 (53.5 %) females) were included, comprising 281 (40%) cognitively unimpaired (CU) amyloid negative, 185 (27%) CU amyloid positive, and 229 (33%) impaired (CI) amyloid positive participants. In the full cohort analysis, right temporal tau was associated with worse behavior (B = 8.14, p-value = 0.007), and left temporal tau was associated with worse language (B = 1.4, p-value < 0.001). Categorization into asymmetry-extreme groups revealed 20 right- and 27 left-asymmetric participants. Within these extreme groups, there was additional heterogeneity along the anterior-posterior dimension. Asymmetrical tau burden is associated with distinct behavioral and cognitive profiles. Wide multi-cultural implementation of social cognition measures is needed to understand right-sided asymmetry in AD.
