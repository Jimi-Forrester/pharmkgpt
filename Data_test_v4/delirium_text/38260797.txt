38260797|t|Uncovering transcriptomic biomarkers for enhanced diagnosis of methamphetamine use disorder: a comprehensive review.
38260797|a|Introduction: Methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) is a chronic relapsing disorder characterized by compulsive Methamphetamine (MA) use despite its detrimental effects on physical, psychological, and social well-being. The development of MUD is a complex process that involves the interplay of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. The treatment of MUD remains a significant challenge, with no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies currently available. Current diagnostic criteria for MUD rely primarily on self-reporting and behavioral assessments, which have inherent limitations owing to their subjective nature. This lack of objective biomarkers and unidimensional approaches may not fully capture the unique features and consequences of MA addiction. Methods: We performed a literature search for this review using the Boolean search in the PubMed database. Results: This review explores existing technologies for identifying transcriptomic biomarkers for MUD diagnosis. We examined non-invasive tissues and scrutinized transcriptomic biomarkers relevant to MUD. Additionally, we investigated transcriptomic biomarkers identified for diagnosing, predicting, and monitoring MUD in non-invasive tissues. Discussion: Developing and validating non-invasive MUD biomarkers could address these limitations, foster more precise and reliable diagnostic approaches, and ultimately enhance the quality of care for individuals with MA addiction.
