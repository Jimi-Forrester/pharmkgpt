35944091|t|LC/MS Q-TOF Metabolomic Investigation of Amino Acids and Dipeptides in Pleurotus ostreatus Grown on Different Substrates.
35944091|a|The well-established correlation between diet and health arouses great interest in seeking new health-promoting functional foods that may contribute to improving health and well-being. Herein, the metabolomic investigation of Pleurotus ostreatus samples grown on two different substrates (black poplar wood logs, WS, and lignocellulosic byproducts, LcS) revealed the high potential of such a mushroom as a source of bioactive species. The liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry combined with quadrupole time-of-flight (LC/MS Q-TOF) analysis allowed the identification of essential and nonessential amino acids along with the outstanding presence of dipeptides. Multivariate statistical models highlighted important differences in the expression of both classes of compounds arising from the growth of P. ostreatus strains on WS and LcS. The former, in particular, was correlated to an increased expression of carnitine-based amino acid derivatives and proline-based dipeptides. This finding may represent a potential strategy to drive the expression of bioactive compounds of interest to obtain enriched mushrooms or useful functional ingredients from them.
