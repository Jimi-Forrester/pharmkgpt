20379339|a|BACKGROUND: Paediatric anaesthesia comprises newborn, infants and children, necessitating a variety of techniques and approaches. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This review is based on textbooks in paediatric anaesthesia, papers from major anaesthetic journals and many years of clinical experience. RESULTS: Only a few Norwegian university hospitals have full-time paediatric anaesthesiologists. Anaesthesia in infants is associated with a higher frequency of morbidity and mortality than in adults; laryngospasm and emergency delirium are more common. Calculation of the amount of intravenous fluid and medication doses must be based on weight. Techniques such as mask inhalation for induction and caudal regional anaesthesia are used more frequently in children. Disease and congenital malformations can lead to anaesthetic problems. It is therefore important for the anaesthesiologist to have all available information preoperatively. INTERPRETATION: Paediatric anaesthesia presents special challenges. Safe practice requires experience and knowledge of age-related anatomy, physiology and pathology.
