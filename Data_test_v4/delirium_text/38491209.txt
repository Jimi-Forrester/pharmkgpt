38491209|t|Differential connectivity of the posterior piriform cortex in Parkinson's disease and postviral olfactory dysfunction: an fMRI study.
38491209|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a common feature of both postviral upper respiratory tract infections (PV) and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Our aim was to investigate potential differences in the connectivity of the posterior piriform cortex, a major component of the olfactory cortex, between PV and PD patients. Fifteen healthy controls (median age 66 years, 9 men), 15 PV (median age 63 years, 7 men) and 14 PD patients (median age 70 years, 9 men) were examined with task-based olfactory fMRI, including two odors: peach and fish. fMRI data were analyzed with the co-activation pattern (CAP) toolbox, which allows a dynamic temporal assessment of posterior piriform cortex (PPC) connectivity. CAP analysis revealed 2 distinct brain networks interacting with the PPC. The first network included regions related to emotion recognition and attention, such as the anterior cingulate and the middle frontal gyri. The occurrences of this network were significantly fewer in PD patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.023), with no significant differences among PV patients and the other groups. The second network revealed a dissociation between the olfactory cortex (piriform and entorhinal cortices), the anterior cingulate gyrus and the middle frontal gyri. This second network was significantly more active during the latter part of the stimulation, across all groups, possibly due to habituation. Our study shows how the PPC interacts with areas that regulate higher order processing and how this network is substantially affected in PD. Our findings also suggest that olfactory habituation is independent of disease.
