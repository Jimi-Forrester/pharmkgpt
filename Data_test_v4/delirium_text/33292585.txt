33292585|t|Targeting ferroptosis in breast cancer.
33292585|a|Ferroptosis is a recently discovered distinct type of regulated cell death caused by the accumulation of lipid-based ROS. Metabolism and expression of specific genes affect the occurrence of ferroptosis, making it a promising therapeutic target to manage cancer. Here, we describe the current status of ferroptosis studies in breast cancer and trace the key regulators of ferroptosis back to previous studies. We also compare ferroptosis to common regulated cell death patterns and discuss the sensitivity to ferroptosis in different subtypes of breast cancer. We propose that viewing ferroptosis-related studies from a historical angle will accelerate the development of ferroptosis-based biomarkers and therapeutic strategies in breast cancer.
