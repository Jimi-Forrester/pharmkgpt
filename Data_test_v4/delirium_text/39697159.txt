39697159|a|BACKGROUND: Effective clearance of lipid-rich debris by macrophages is critical for neural repair and regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI). Interleukin-3 (IL-3) has been implicated in programming microglia to cluster and clear pathological aggregates in neurodegenerative disease. Yet, the influence of IL-3 on lipid debris clearance post-SCI is not well characterized. METHODS: We established a mouse model of spinal cord compression injury to investigate the role of IL-3. Blockage of IL-3 was achieved through intrathecal delivery of an IL-3-neutralizing antibody, while IL-3 activation was augmented via in situ injection of recombinant IL-3 into the lesion site immediately post-SCI. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to determine IL-3 and IL-3Ralpha sources and distribution, lipid droplet accumulation, neuron preservation, and axon regeneration after SCI. The Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) and footprint analysis were employed to evaluate locomotor function recovery. RESULTS: We found that IL-3 expression was significantly upregulated post-SCI, peaking at 14 days post-injury (dpi) and persisting until 28 dpi. Notably, IL-3 was primarily secreted by astrocytes surrounding the lesion epicenter. Correspondingly, IL-3Ralpha was predominantly observed in macrophages within the injury core, also elevating at 14 dpi. Neutralization of IL-3 led to increased lipid droplet accumulation, along with markedly widespread of macrophages and decreased neuronal survival, resulting in severe motor deficits compared to controls. Conversely, in situ injection of IL-3 reduced lipid droplet accumulation in macrophages, preserved neurons, promoted axon regeneration, and ultimately contributed to the recovery of motor function after SCI. CONCLUSION: Our findings shed light on the role of IL-3 in modulating macrophage phagocytic activity and suggest that the IL-3/IL-3Ralpha pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for enhancing neural repair and functional recovery after SCI.
