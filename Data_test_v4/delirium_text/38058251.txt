38058251|t|UK Medical Cannabis Registry: An analysis of clinical outcomes of medicinal cannabis therapy for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
38058251|a|AIM: This study aims to analyze the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and safety outcomes in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients treated with cannabis-based medicinal products (CBMPs). METHODS: Patients were identified from the UK Medical Cannabis Registry. Primary outcomes were changes in the following patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months from baseline: EQ-5D-5L index value, generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire, and the single-item sleep quality score (SQS). Secondary outcomes assessed the incidence of adverse events. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.050. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria. Significant improvements were identified in general HRQoL assessed by EQ-5D-5L index value at 1, 3, and 6 months (p < 0.050). Improvements were also identified in GAD-7 and SQS scores at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months (p < 0.010). 61 (89.71%) adverse events were recorded by 11 (16.18%) participants, of which most were moderate (n = 26, 38.24%). CONCLUSION: An association between CBMP treatment and improvements in anxiety, sleep quality, and general HRQoL was observed in patients with ADHD. Treatment was well tolerated at 12 months. Results must be interpreted with caution as a causative effect cannot be proven. These results, however, do provide additional support for future evaluation within randomized controlled trials.
