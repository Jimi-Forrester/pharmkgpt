31001073|t|Icariin Attenuates M1 Activation of Microglia and Abeta Plaque Accumulation in the Hippocampus and Prefrontal Cortex by Up-Regulating PPARgamma in Restraint/Isolation-Stressed APP/PS1 Mice.
31001073|a|BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that psychosocial stress is involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis; it induces M1 microglia polarization and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to neurotoxic outcomes and decreased beta-amyloid (Abeta) clearance. Icariin has been proven to be an effective anti-inflammatory agent and to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPARgamma) which induces the M2 phenotype in the microglia. However, whether restraint/isolation stress reduces the clearance ability of microglia by priming and polarizing microglia to the M1 phenotype, and the effects of icariin in attenuating the inflammatory response and relieving the pathological changes of AD are still unclear. METHODS: APP/PS1 mice (male, aged 3 months) were randomly divided into a control group, a restraint/isolation stress group, and a restraint/isolation stress + icariin group. The restraint/isolation stress group was subjected to a paradigm to build a depressive animal model. Sucrose preference, open field, elevated plus maze, and Y maze test were used to assess the stress paradigm. The Morris water maze test was performed to evaluate spatial reference learning and memory. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry were used to identify the microglia phenotype and Abeta accumulation. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of PPARgamma in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). RESULTS: Restraint/isolation stress induced significant depressive-like behaviors in APP/PS1 mice at 4 months of age and memory impairment at 10 months of age, while 6 months of icariin administration relieved the memory damage. Restraint/isolation stressed mice had elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, decreased anti-inflammatory cytokines, increased Abeta plaque accumulation and more M1 phenotype microglia in the hippocampus and PFC at 10 months of age, while 6 months of icariin administration relieved these changes. Moreover, restraint/isolation stressed mice had down-regulated PPARgamma expression in the hippocampus and PFC at 10 months of age, while 6 months of icariin administration reversed the alteration, especially in the hippocampus. CONCLUSION: Restraint/isolation stress induced depressive-like behaviors and spatial memory damage, over-expression of M1 microglia markers and more severe Abeta accumulation by suppressing PPARgamma in APP/PS1 mice. Icariin can be considered a new treatment option as it induces the switch of the microglia phenotype by activating PPARgamma.
