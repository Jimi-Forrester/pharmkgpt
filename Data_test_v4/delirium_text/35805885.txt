35805885|t|Exploration of Somatostatin Binding Mechanism to Somatostatin Receptor Subtype 4.
35805885|a|Somatostatin (also named as growth hormone-inhibiting hormone or somatotropin release-inhibiting factor) is a regulatory peptide important for the proper functioning of the endocrine system, local inflammatory reactions, mood and motor coordination, and behavioral responses to stress. Somatostatin exerts its effects via binding to G-protein-coupled somatostatin receptors of which the fourth subtype (SSTR4) is a particularly important receptor mediating analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-depressant effects without endocrine actions. Thus, SSTR4 agonists are promising drug candidates. Although the knowledge of the atomic resolution-binding modes of SST would be essential for drug development, experimental elucidation of the structures of SSTR4 and its complexes is still awaiting. In the present study, structures of the somatostatin-SSTR4 complex were produced using an unbiased, blind docking approach. Beyond the static structures, the binding mechanism of SST was also elucidated in the explicit water molecular dynamics (MD) calculations, and key binding modes (external, intermediate, and internal) were distinguished. The most important residues on both receptor and SST sides were identified. An energetic comparison of SST binding to SSTR4 and 2 offered a residue-level explanation of receptor subtype selectivity. The calculated structures show good agreement with available experimental results and indicate that somatostatin binding is realized via prerequisite binding modes and an induced fit mechanism. The identified binding modes and the corresponding key residues provide useful information for future drug design targeting SSTR4.
