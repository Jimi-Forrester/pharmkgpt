25079806|t|Source analysis of spontaneous magnetoencephalograpic activity in healthy aging and mild cognitive impairment: influence of apolipoprotein E polymorphism.
25079806|a|The apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele is a genetic risk factor for the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), which affects cholinergic system functioning. The association between reduced cholinergic levels and increase of magnetoencephalographic (MEG) low-frequency has been used to explain spectral changes found in AD patients. However, the investigation in predementia stages is scarce. We obtained MEG recordings from 25 aged controls and 36 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients during a resting-state condition. According to their APOE genotype, MCIs and controls were subdivided in carriers and non-carriers of the epsilon4 allele. Sources of spectral variations in these groups were calculated through beamforming. MCI patients exhibited a significant increase of relative power within the low-frequency domain, accompanied by a power decrease within the high-frequency range. APOEepsilon4 carriers showed an increased relative power in the 4.5-6.5 Hz frequency range over frontal lobes. The power increase observed in controls carrying epsilon4 was significantly higher as compared with MCI non-carriers, while MCI carriers exhibited the highest relative power within the 4.5-6.5 Hz range. Higher power values within the low-frequency ranges correlated with a poorer cognitive performance in MCIs and controls. Our investigation demonstrates that APOEepsilon4 affects resting-state activity to an extent that makes it more proximate to the pattern observed in early stages of AD. Therefore, a combination of genetic and neurophysiological information might help to detect MCI patients at higher risk of conversion to AD, and asymptomatic subjects at higher risk of developing a manifest cognitive deterioration.
