34796967|a|Understanding the molecular signaling mechanisms underlying cognition and neuronal plasticity would provide insights into the pathogenesis of neuronal disorders characterized by cognitive syndromes such as Alzheimer disease (AD). Phosphorylation of the mRNA translational factor eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) by its specific kinase eEF2K is critically involved in protein synthesis regulation. In this review, we discussed recent studies on the roles of eEF2K/eEF2 signaling in the context of regulation/dysregulation of cognitive function and synaptic plasticity. We specifically focus on the discussion of recent evidence indicating suppression of eEF2K signaling as a potential novel therapeutic avenue for AD and related dementias (ADRDs).
