39307805|a|The main chemical components of Yangxue Qingnao Wan(YXQNW) were analyzed and identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry(UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS). According to the mass spectrometry information, Mass Hunter 10.0 analysis software was used to compare the collected quasi-molecular ion peaks and secondary fragment ions with literature and reference substances. A total of 131 compounds were identified from YXQNW, including 11 phenylpropanoids, 11 flavonoids, 42 nitrogen-containing compounds, 12 terpenoids, 17 phthalides, 23 quinones, and 15 other compounds. The anti-aging activity of YXQNW and six compounds from YXQNW, including rosmarinic acid, gallic acid, rutin, umbelliferone, hyperoside, and vanillic acid, were evaluated by D-galactose(D-gal)-induced HT22 cell senescence model. The effects of the compounds on HT22 cell damage and individual cell proliferation ability were observed from overall and individual perspectives by the Beyo Click~(TM) EdU-555 cell proliferation kit, and apoptosis was detected by the Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining apoptosis detection kit. Finally, the anti-aging effect of the compounds was tested by a cell senescence beta-galactosidase staining kit. This study provides a more comprehensive analysis of the chemical components of YXQNW and evaluates its anti-aging effect, which will provide a scientific basis for basic research on the efficacy of YXQNW for the treatment of various neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease(AD), headache, and memory loss.
