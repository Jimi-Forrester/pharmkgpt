36299451|t|ECE2 is a prognostic biomarker associated with m6A modification and involved in immune infiltration of lung adenocarcinoma.
36299451|a|Background: The targeted therapy for lung cancer relies on prognostic genes and requires further research. No research has been conducted to determine the effect of endothelin-converting enzyme 2 (ECE2) in lung cancer. Methods: We analyzed the expression of ECE2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and normal adjacent tissues and its relationship with clinicopathological characteristics from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO). Immunohistochemical staining was used to further validate the findings. GO/KEGG enrichment analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of ECE2 co-expression were performed using R software. Data from TIMER, the GEPIA database, and TCGA were analyzed to determine the relationship between ECE2 expression and LUAD immune infiltration. To investigate the relationship between ECE2 expression levels and LUAD m6A modification, TCGA data and GEO data were analyzed. Results: ECE2 is highly expressed in various cancers including LUAD. ECE2 showed high accuracy in distinguishing tumor and normal sample results. The expression level of ECE2 in LUAD was significantly correlated with tumor stage and prognosis. GO/KEGG enrichment analysis showed that ECE2 was closely related to mitochondrial gene expression, ATPase activity and cell cycle. GSEA analysis showed that ECE2-related differential gene enrichment pathways were related to mitotic cell cycle, MYC pathway, PLK1 pathway, DNA methylation pathway, HIF1A pathway and Oxidative stress-induced cellular senescence. Analysis of the TIMER, GEPIA database, and TCGA datasets showed that ECE2 expression levels were significantly negatively correlated with B cells, CD4+ cells, M2 macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. TCGA and GEO datasets showed that ECE2 was significantly associated with m6A modification-related genes HNRNPC, IGF2BP1, IGF2BP3 and RBM1. Conclusion: ECE2 is associated with m6A modification and immune infiltration and is a prognostic biomarker in LUAD.
