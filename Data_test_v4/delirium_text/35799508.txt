35799508|t|Neurotrophic fragments as therapeutic alternatives to ameliorate brain aging.
35799508|a|Aging is a global phenomenon and a complex biological process of all living beings that introduces various changes. During this physiological process, the brain is the most affected organ due to changes in its structural and chemical functions, such as changes in plasticity and decrease in the number, diameter, length, and branching of dendrites and dendritic spines. Likewise, it presents a great reduction in volume resulting from the contraction of the gray matter. Consequently, aging can affect not only cognitive functions, including learning and memory, but also the quality of life of older people. As a result of the phenomena, various molecules with notable neuroprotective capacity have been proposed, which provide a therapeutic alternative for people under conditions of aging or some neurodegenerative diseases. It is important to indicate that in recent years the use of molecules with neurotrophic activity has shown interesting results when evaluated in in vivo models. This review aims to describe the neurotrophic potential of molecules such as resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene), neurotrophins (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), and neurotrophic-type compounds such as the terminal carboxyl domain of the heavy chain of tetanus toxin, cerebrolysin, neuropeptide-12, and rapamycin. Most of these molecules have been evaluated by our research group. Studies suggest that these molecules exert an important therapeutic potential, restoring brain function in aging conditions or models of neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, our interest is in describing the current scientific evidence that supports the therapeutic potential of these molecules with active neurotrophic.
