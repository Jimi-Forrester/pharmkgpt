28498336|t|11C-Labeling of Aryl Ketones as Candidate Histamine Subtype-3 Receptor PET Radioligands through Pd(0)-Mediated 11C-Carbonylative Coupling.
28498336|a|Pd(0)-mediated coupling between iodoarenes, [11C]carbon monoxide and aryltributylstannanes has been used to prepare simple model [11C]aryl ketones. Here, we aimed to label four 2-aminoethylbenzofuran chemotype based molecules ([11C]1-4) in the carbonyl position, as prospective positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands for the histamine subtype 3 receptor (H3R) by adapting this methodology with use of aryltrimethylstannanes. Radiosynthesis was successfully performed on a platform equipped with a mini-autoclave and a liquid handling robotic arm, within a lead-shielded hot-cell. Candidate radioligands were readily formulated in saline containing ethanol (10%, v/v) and ascorbic acid (0.5 mg/10 mL). Yields for preclinical use were in the range of 5-9%, decay-corrected from cyclotron-produced [11C]CO2 and molar activities were >115 GBq/micromol at end of synthesis. Radiochemical purities exceeded >97%.
