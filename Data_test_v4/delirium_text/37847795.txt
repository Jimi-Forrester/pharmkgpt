37847795|t|New horizons in the diagnosis and management of dehydration.
37847795|a|Hydration is a fundamental aspect of clinical practice and yet it is an under-researched topic, particularly in older people, leading to many areas of uncertainty. There are two types of dehydration; hypertonic, which is a water deficit, and isotonic, which is a deficit of both water and salt. Individual clinical signs and bedside tests are poor diagnostic tools, making dehydration difficult to identify. However, the diagnostic value of a holistic clinical approach is not known. The gold-standard clinical test for dehydration is serum osmolality, but this cannot diagnose isotonic dehydration and may delay diagnosis in acute situations. Salivary osmolality point-of-care testing is a promising and rapid new diagnostic test capable of detecting both hypertonic and isotonic dehydration in older people, but further evidence to support its clinical utility is needed. Daily fluid requirements may be less than previously thought in adults, but the evidence specific to older people remains limited. Hydration via the subcutaneous route is safer and easier to initiate than the intravenous route but is limited by infusion speed and volume. Prompting older adults more frequently to drink, offering a wider selection of drinks and using drinking vessels with particular features can result in small increases in oral intake in the short-term. The ongoing clinically-assisted hydration at end of life (CHELsea II) trial will hopefully provide more evidence for the emotive issue of hydration at the end of life.
