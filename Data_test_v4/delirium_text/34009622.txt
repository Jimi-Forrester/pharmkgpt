34009622|a|Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T)-cell therapy is a promising treatment for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). In our previous report, CD19- and BCMA-targeted CAR-T co-administration was associated with a high response rate. Although cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity are frequent complications following CAR-T treatment, cerebral infarction is rarely reported as a CAR-T-related complication. We reported a 73-year-old female MM patient who received CD19- and BCMA-targeted CAR-T for refractory disease. Her disease responded to CAR-T therapy, but she developed neurological symptoms following CRS. Cranial CT and MRI demonstrated multiple cerebral infarctions and bilateral anterior cerebral artery (ACA) occlusion. We suggest that cerebral infarction other than CAR-T-related neurotoxicity is the underlying cause of abnormal neuropsychological symptoms, and diagnostic imaging tests should be actively performed to exclude ischemic cerebrovascular events.
