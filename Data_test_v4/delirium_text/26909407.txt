26909407|a|Delirium is a common complication after cardiac surgery, being associated with significant mortality and morbidity. The pathogenesis of postoperative delirium (POD) is complex and multifactorial, involving an interaction of multiple predisposing and precipitating factors. There are several hypothesis regarding the underlying mechanisms of POD, and the most recent emerging one involves neuroinflammation, which is exacerbated by the cardiopulmonary bypass-induced systemic inflammatory response. Experimental and clinical studies have recently documented improved perioperative central neural protection exerted by statins because of their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antithrombotic properties. The present review will focused on the possible protective effect exerted by preoperative statin administration on delirium following cardiac surgery.
