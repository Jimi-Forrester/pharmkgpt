34147015|a|STUDY OBJECTIVE: Low bispectral index (BIS) values have been associated with adverse postoperative outcomes. However, trials of optimizing BIS by titrating anesthetic administration have reported conflicting results. One potential explanation is that cerebral perfusion may also affect BIS, but the extent of this relationship is not clear. Therefore, we examined whether BIS would be associated with cerebral perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass, when anesthetic concentration was constant. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Cardiac operating room. PATIENTS: Seventy-nine patients with cardiopulmonary bypass surgery were included. MEASUREMENTS: Continuous BIS, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) were monitored, with analysis during a period of constant anesthetic. Mean flow index (Mx) was calculated as Pearson correlation between MAP and CBFV. The lower limit of autoregulation (LLA) was identified as the MAP value at which Mx increased >0.4 with decreasing blood pressure. Postoperative delirium was assessed using the 3D-Confusion Assessment Method. RESULTS: Mean BIS was lower during periods of MAP < LLA compared with BIS when MAP>LLA (mean 49.35 +- 10.40 vs. 50.72 +- 10.04, p = 0.002, mean difference = 1.38 [standard error: 0.42]). There was a dose response effect, with the BIS proportionately decreasing as MAP decreased below LLA (beta = 0.15, 95% CI for the average slope across all patients 0.07 to 0.23, p < 0.001). In contrast, BIS was relatively unchanged when MAP was above LLA (beta = 0.03, 95% CI for the average slope across all patients -0.02 to 0.09, p = 0.22). Additionally, increasing CBFV and rSO2 were associated with increasing BIS. Patients with postoperative delirium had lower mean BIS and higher percentage of time duration with BIS <45 compared to patients without delirium. CONCLUSIONS: There was an association of BIS and metrics of cerebral perfusion during a period of constant anesthetic administration, but the absolute magnitude of change in BIS as MAP decreased below the LLA was small.
