32419856|t|Age, Comorbidities and Fear of Fall: mortality predictors associated with fall-related fractures.
32419856|a|Objectives: To determine mortality predictors following fall related fractures in older patients. Materials and methods: Patients aged >= 70 years hospitalized for fall related fractures were prospectively evaluated. Mortality was the main outcome. Age, functional-cognitive function, medications, comorbidities, fall history, fear of falls were also assessed. Outcomes: A total of 100 patients were enrolled. Ninety-one out of 100 (91%) suffered a hip fracture; 92 (92%) had surgery. The one-year post-discharge mortality was 20%. Univariate analysis revealed that older age, increased Charlson comorbidity index, low abbreviated mental test on admission, low modified Barthel index (MBI), fear of falls and delirium were significantly correlated with one-year post discharge mortality (p=.03, p=.003, p=.04, p=.005, p=.004, p=.015, respectively). Conclusion: Age, fear of falls and Charlson comorbidity index are predictors of one-year mortality after hospitalization for fracture. It is of utmost importance to identify older patients suffering from fracture at risk of dying that may benefit from patient-centered care.
