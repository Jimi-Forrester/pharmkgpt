31275145|t|MicroRNAs in Alzheimer's Disease: Diagnostic Markers or Therapeutic Agents?
31275145|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding nucleic acids able to post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by binding to complementary sequences of target messenger RNA (mRNA). It has been estimated that at least 1% of the human genome encodes miRNA and every miRNA can regulate up to 200 mRNAs. These findings suggest that dysregulation of miRNA expression could be associated with several human pathological conditions including central neurological disorders. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. The characteristic symptoms are a progressive loss of memory and other cognitive functions due to the impairment of particular types of neurons and synapses, leading to neuronal death. At present, the available symptomatic treatments can only slow down disease progression without stopping it. miRNAs are widely found within the nervous system where they are key regulators of functions such as neurite outgrowth, dendritic spine morphology, neuronal differentiation, and synaptic plasticity. This has been the clue for considering miRNAs crucial molecules to be studied in AD, and nowadays, dysfunction of miRNAs in AD is increasingly recognized. In this review, we summarized existing evidence about miRNAs as biomarkers or therapeutic agents. The field of miRNAs as biomarkers is more advanced in terms of human data, and it is likely that miRNAs will be used successfully in the near future. Given the huge number of miRNAs potentially involved in diagnostics, miRNA panels will be used for specific tasks such as the stage of the disease, the risk prediction, and disease progression. The field of miRNAs as therapeutics is rapidly developing, and it offers a huge variety of solutions. These include positive effects related to beta-amyloid or tau reduction, increased number of neurons, inhibition of apoptosis, protection of synapses, transformation of other cellular elements into missing/deficient neurons in AD, and so on. It is predictable that both areas of research will be carried forward. However, given the absence of an AD therapy able to stop or reverse the disease, it is desirable to accelerate research on miRNAs as therapeutic agents.
