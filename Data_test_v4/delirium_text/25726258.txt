25726258|t|A Common Source Outbreak of Severe Delirium Associated with Exposure to the Novel Synthetic Cannabinoid ADB-PINACA.
25726258|a|BACKGROUND: Since 2009, synthetic cannabinoid (SC) use has emerged as a growing public health threat in the United States (US). Several outbreaks of unexpected, severe toxicity linked to SC use have been reported since 2012. Reports of varied and significant morbidity after SC use are expected to increase because newer compounds enter the marketplace more frequently as manufacturers attempt to circumvent regulatory efforts. CASE REPORT: We report a cluster of 7 patients who experienced a spectrum of anxiety, delirium, psychosis, and aggressive behaviors after smoking the same SC-containing product at a party. An 8th patient with the same exposure source presented with delayed onset seizures. Biologic samples were analyzed for novel, newly identified SCs belonging to the FUBINACA family of compounds. A previously unknown SC, N-(1-amino-3,3-dimethyl-1-oxobutan-2-yl)-1-pentyl-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide (ADB-PINACA) was identified in biologic samples from 7 of the individuals. ADB-PINACA was identified in the SC-containing product ("Crazy Clown") seized by law enforcement and identified as the product smoked by the 8 patients in the reported cluster. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: The information compiled using this cluster of cases, and a similar reported outbreak of altered mental status in Colorado, implicating the same SC (ADB-PINACA) and brands of SC-containing products, aided the US Drug Enforcement Administration in its temporary scheduling of ADB-PINACA and three other SCs. In this outbreak, close cooperation between public health and law enforcement allowed for a rapid intervention, which halted the outbreak by interrupting the common source and accelerated regulatory efforts to prevent further morbidity and mortality.
