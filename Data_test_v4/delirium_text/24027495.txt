24027495|a|Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is recognized as an AD-vulnerable region responsible for defects in cognitive functioning. Pyramidal cell (PC) connections are typically facilitating (F) or depressing (D) in PFC. Excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) were recorded using patch-clamp from single connections in PFC slices of rats and ferrets in the presence of beta-amyloid (Abeta). Synaptic transmission was significantly enhanced or reduced depending on their intrinsic type (facilitating or depressing), Abeta species (Abeta 40 or Abeta 42) and concentration (1-200 nM vs. 0.3-1 mu M). Nanomolar Abeta 40 and Abeta 42 had opposite effects on F-connections, resulting in fewer or increased EPSP failure rates, strengthening or weakening EPSPs and enhancing or inhibiting short-term potentiation [STP: synaptic augmentation (SA) and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP)], respectively. High Abeta 40 concentrations induced inhibition regardless of synaptic type. D-connections were inhibited regardless of Abeta species or concentration. The inhibition induced with bath application was hard to recover by washout, but a complete recovery was obtained with brief local application and prompt washout. Our data suggests that Abeta 40 acts on the prefrontal neuronal network by modulating facilitating and depressing synapses. At higher levels, both Abeta 40 and Abeta 42 inhibit synaptic activity and cause irreversible toxicity once diffusely accumulated in the synaptic environment.
