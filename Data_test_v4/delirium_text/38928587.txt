38928587|t|Long COVID in Brain Health Research: A Call to Action.
38928587|a|The COVID-19 pandemic has brought attention to the long-term consequences of the virus, particularly the persistent symptoms that characterize long COVID. This syndrome, which can last for months after the initial infection, includes a range of neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations that have significant implications for brain health and dementia research. This review explores the current understanding of long COVID's cognitive, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms and their potential impact on brain stimulation and neuroimaging studies. It argues that researchers must adapt their study designs and screening processes to account for the confounding effects of long COVID and ensure the accuracy and reliability of their findings. To advance the understanding of this condition and its long-term effects on brain health, the review proposes a series of strategies, including the development of standardized screening tools, the investigation of underlying mechanisms, and the identification of risk factors and protective factors. It also emphasizes the importance of collaborative research efforts and international data sharing platforms in accelerating the pace of discovery and developing targeted interventions for individuals with long COVID. As the prevalence of this condition continues to grow, it is imperative that the neuroscience community comes together to address this challenge and support those affected by long COVID.
