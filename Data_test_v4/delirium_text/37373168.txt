37373168|t|ACSL4-Mediated Ferroptosis and Its Potential Role in Central Nervous System Diseases and Injuries.
37373168|a|As an iron-dependent regulated form of cell death, ferroptosis is characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and has been implicated in the occurrence and development of various diseases, including nervous system diseases and injuries. Ferroptosis has become a potential target for intervention in these diseases or injuries in relevant preclinical models. As a member of the Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family (ACSLs) that can convert saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain familymember4 (ACSL4) is involved in the regulation of arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, thus leading to ferroptosis. The underlying molecular mechanisms of ACSL4-mediated ferroptosis will promote additional treatment strategies for these diseases or injury conditions. Our review article provides a current view of ACSL4-mediated ferroptosis, mainly including the structure and function of ACSL4, as well as the role of ACSL4 in ferroptosis. We also summarize the latest research progress of ACSL4-mediated ferroptosis in central nervous system injuries and diseases, further proving that ACSL4-medicated ferroptosis is an important target for intervention in these diseases or injuries.
