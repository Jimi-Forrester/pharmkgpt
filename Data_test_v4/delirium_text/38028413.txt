38028413|a|Introduction: The relationship between rosacea and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is still not known. Almost all reports questioning the relation between BCC and rosacea are focused on rhinophyma. Aim: To examine the possible connection of BCC and rosacea. Material and methods: 110 patients with BCC located on the face treated surgically in the Dermatosurgery Unit in 2020-2021 were included in the study. A trained dermatologist assessed the presence or absence of concomitant rosacea and assessed its severity according to the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA). Results: Fifty-one (46.4%) subjects with BCC and concomitant clinically diagnosed rosacea were found. In our group 35.5% of women had BCC located on the cheeks, while in men most cancers were located on the nose (55%, n = 11), however this difference has not reached statistical significance. Conclusions: The incidence of rosacea in our population was undoubtedly higher, comparing to the normative population. Both rosacea and BCC share the same risk factors - UV exposure, the potential association should not be neglected.
