35877563|t|Congenital Heart Disease: The State-of-the-Art on Its Pharmacological Therapeutics.
35877563|a|Congenital heart disease is one of the most common causes of death derived from malformations. Historically, its treatment has depended on timely diagnosis and early pharmacological and surgical interventions. Survival rates for patients with this disease have increased, primarily due to advancements in therapeutic choices, but mortality remains high. Since this disease is a time-sensitive pathology, pharmacological interventions are needed to improve clinical outcomes. Therefore, we analyzed the applications, dosage, and side effects of drugs currently used for treating congenital heart disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and potassium-sparing diuretics have shown a mortality benefit in most patients. Other therapies, such as endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, prostaglandins, and soluble guanylyl cyclase stimulators, have benefited patients with pulmonary artery hypertension. Likewise, the adjunctive symptomatic treatment of these patients has further improved the outcomes, since antiarrhythmics, digoxin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have shown their benefits in these cases. Conclusively, these drugs also carry the risk of troublesome adverse effects, such as electrolyte imbalances and hemodynamic compromise. However, their benefits for survival, symptom improvement, and stabilization outweigh the possible complications from their use. Thus, cases must be assessed individually to accurately identify interventions that would be most beneficial for patients.
