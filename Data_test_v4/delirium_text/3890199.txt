3890199|t|Disguises of delirium.
3890199|a|In four patients, each of whom displayed overt signs and symptoms of a delirious state, the delirium was overlooked. We describe in detail the features of delirium because this syndrome is protean in its etiology and clinical presentations. It can be life-threatening, and it may not be recognized because the behavioral correlates are often attributed to a functional disorder.
