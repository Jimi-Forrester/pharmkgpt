17640492|a|Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) accounts for approximately 20 % of all autopsy-confirmed dementias in the elderly. Presumably, DLB is underdiagnosed in patients without or with only mild Parkinsonian symptoms in the daily routine of memory clinics. This motivated the Austrian Alzheimer Society and the Austrian Parkinson Society to inform about core features, suggestive features and supportive clinical findings of DLB and to provide information on diagnostic possibilities leading to better differential diagnosis. We also guide in the management of DLB as pharmacological treatment can pose difficult dilemmas for the treating clinician.
