34064552|a|(1) Purpose: Comprehensive geriatric care (CGC) is a multidisciplinary treatment approach for elderly patients. We aimed to investigate outcomes in fracture patients who had been treated using this approach in a large geriatric unit. (2) Methods: This observational cohort study assessed the gait function (using the Tinetti Balance and Gait Test (TBGT)) and basic activities of daily living (ADL) (using the Barthel index (BI)) before and after CGC and compared the results. Baseline data, walking ability assessments (Timed Up and Go, TUG), and cognitive status (mini mental status examination, MMSE) were also analyzed in the subgroup of patients with versus without fractures. (3) Results: Out of 1263 hospitalized patients, 1099 received CGC (median age: 83.1 years (IQR: 79.0-87.8 years); 64.1% were female). TBGT improvement was observed in 90.7% and BI increased in 82.7% of fracture patients. A TBGT improvement of >5 was noted in 47.3% and was associated with female sex, a lower BI at admission (median: 40 versus 45; p = 0.010), and poorer mobility on admission (TUG: median 5 versus 4; p = 0.001). An improvement in BI of >=15 was observed in 63.0% of the cases, and was associated with a better cognitive status (MMSE: median 25 versus 18; p = 0.001) and inversely associated with diabetes mellitus and a previous stroke. (4) Conclusion: CGC in specialized geriatric units improves the balance and gait and the basic ADL in geriatric patients. After fracture, female patients are more likely to experience improvements in gait and balance, while patients with better cognitive condition are more likely to experience improvements in ADL.
