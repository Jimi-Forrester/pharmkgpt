37851091|a|BACKGROUND: Older and very old persons have an increased risk of traumatic injuries as well as comorbidities and multimorbidities. The standardized workflow in hospitals can increase the occurrence of typical geriatric complications, such as challenging behavior and delirium, which can result in highly complex care situations. The application of advanced practice nurses (APN) is an international response to such challenges. In Germany, the scientifically based development of APN has so far lagged behind the international standard. METHOD: For this scoping review, a systematic search in the databases PubMed and CINAHL and a supplementary hand search was conducted for the period 2010-2022. RESULTS: Tasks and role profiles for the scope of practice of APN in geriatrics and traumatology already exist in the literature. There is a lack of scientifically proven tasks and role profiles for APN in geriatric traumatology in the literature. DISCUSSION: Based on the current state of research it is not yet possible to derive specific tasks and role profiles for APN in geriatric traumatology. The transferability of tasks and profiles from geriatrics and traumatology seem to be possible. The development of tasks and role profiles for geriatric traumatology APN requires further research, especially to identify the specific needs of geriatric traumatology patients.
