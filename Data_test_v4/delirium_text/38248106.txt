38248106|t|Radiofrequency Ablation versus Surgical Resection in Elderly Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
38248106|a|Although the disease burden of elderly cancer patients is rapidly increasing, reliable scientific information, value and preference information of domestic patients, and standardized guidelines for determining the treatment of elderly cancer patients are lacking. The aim of this study is to compare the therapeutic effects of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and surgery in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients aged 65 years or older. For the meta-analysis, the databases including PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, OVID Medline, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched. After the abstract-based review by two investigators, selected manuscripts were read in detail. The surgery group showed higher overall survival (OS) (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.22-1.70) and disease-free survival (DFS) (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.00-1.97) than the RFA group. This was also shown in small HCC of less than 3 cm (OS, HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.00-2.03; DFS, HR 1.32, 95% CI 0.91-1.91). This might be related to the high local recurrence in the RFA group (OR 4.90, 95% 2.16-11.08). On the other hand, adverse events were significantly lower in the RFA group (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.14-0.36), which led to a decrease in the duration of hospital stay (mean difference -14.88 days, 95% CI -22.44--7.32). In elderly HCC patients, survival in the surgery group was significantly higher than in the RFA group, but various complications tended to increase; so, appropriate patient selection is required.
