25177901|a|Delirium and dementia as organically caused mental disorders exhibit similarities in the clinical and neurological sense and often occur together. The existence of one appears to increase the risk for the development of the other. Although delirium is a very common disorder especially among the elderly, it is often not recognized. For the diagnosis of delirium, an exact family and case history including medication, clinical examination and determination of routine laboratory values are not infrequently necessary. Causal treatment of delirium is possible and not necessarily complicated. Both non-medicative and medicative measures are available for the symptomatic treatment. The non-medicative measures are to a large extent applied by nursing staff and comprise, among others, orientation guidance and attaining a balance between perceptual overload and deprivation. A good knowledge of symptomatology is decisive, also from the prevention point of view (nurses specialized in delirium). For symptomatic medicative treatment neuroleptic agents appear to be favorable. With regard to extrapyramidal side effects atypical neuroleptics are better than the typical ones. The use of cholinesterase inhibitors is not robustly supported by the literature. The use of benzodiazepines is rather discouraged except for the treatment of withdrawal delirium. Preparations with short half-lives and absence of active metabolites can be used as accompanying measures for a short time. Prevention appears to be extremely important for which the treating personnel require a good knowledge of risk factors and their management. The occurrence of delirium among cases of alpha-synucleinopathies represents a special case. Both international and German guidelines on the management of delirium are available.
