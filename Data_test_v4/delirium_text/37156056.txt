37156056|t|Interaction studies of oxindole-derivatives with beta-amyloid peptides inhibiting its aggregation induced by metal ions.
37156056|a|Some hydrazones and Schiff bases derived from isatin, an endogenous oxindole formed in the metabolism of tryptophan, were obtained to investigate their effects on in vitro aggregation of beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta), macromolecules implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Some hydrazone ligands, prepared by condensation reactions of isatin with hydrazine derivatives, showed a large affinity binding to the synthetic peptides Abeta, particularly to Abeta1-16. Measurements by NMR spectroscopy indicated that those interactions occur mainly at the metal binding site of the peptide, involving His6, His13, and His14 residues, and that hydrazone E-diastereoisomer interacts preferentially with the amyloid peptides. Experimental results were consistent with simulations using a docking approach, where it is demonstrated that the amino acid residues Glu3, His6, His13, and His14 are those that mostly interact with the ligands. Further, these oxindole-derived ligands can efficiently chelate copper(II) and zinc(II) ions, forming moderate stable [ML] 1:1 species. The corresponding formation constants were determined by UV/Vis spectroscopy, by titrations of the ligands with increasing amounts of metal salts, and the obtained log K values were in the range 2.74 to 5.11. Both properties, good affinity for amyloid peptides, and reasonably good capacity of chelating biometal ions, like copper and zinc, can explain the efficient inhibition of Abeta fragments aggregation, as shown by experiments carried out with the oxindole derivatives in the presence of metal ions.
