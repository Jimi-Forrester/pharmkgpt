34863781|t|The neuropsychological profile of delirium vulnerability: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
34863781|a|Delirium is a common neurocognitive disorder in hospitalised older adults with substantial negative consequences. Impaired global cognition is a well-established delirium risk factor. However, poor performance on attention tests and higher intra-subject variability may be more sensitive delirium risk factors, given the disorder is characterised by a fluctuating course and attentional deficits. We systematically searched databases (Embase, PsycINFO, MEDLINE) and 44 studies satisfied inclusion criteria. Random-effects meta-analysis models showed poor performance in all cognitive domains except perception was significantly associated with incident delirium. Largest effects were for orientation (g=-1.20) and construction and motor performance (g=-0.60). These effects were no longer significant in the subgroup without pre-existing cognitive impairment, where executive functions and verbal functions and language skills were associated with incident delirium. A small, non-significant association between intra-subject variability and incident delirium was found (g=0.42). Cognitive domain specific tests may be quicker and more sensitive predictors of incident delirium. This pattern of neuropsychological findings supports the proposition that vulnerability for delirium manifests as a dysfunction of whole-brain information integration.
