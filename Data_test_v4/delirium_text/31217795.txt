31217795|t|Cardiovascular risk prediction in the elderly.
31217795|a|Heart failure (HF) in the elderly, besides being a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, is rapidly increasing in prevalence with patients aged 65 and older accounting for more than 75% of heart failure hospitalizations. Elderly patients have historically been unrepresented in clinical HF trials and often present with multiple comorbidities, including frailty, depression, nutritional, functional and cognitive impairments. Additionally, pharmacologic challenges such as adherence to therapy, polypharmacy, altered drug pharmacokinetics and/or renal derangements make them less likely to receive guideline-directed medical therapies for HF. Recognition of these various interrelated domains is key and should prompt a multidisciplinary, holistic management approach so as to optimize prognosis in this vulnerable subset of the population.
