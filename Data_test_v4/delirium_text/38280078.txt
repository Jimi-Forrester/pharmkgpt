38280078|t|Recombinant Antibody Fragments for Immunotherapy of Parkinson's Disease.
38280078|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder. Multiple genetic and environmental factors leading to progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) and consequent depletion of dopamine were described. Current clinical approaches, such as dopamine replacement or deep brain stimulation using surgically implanted probes, provide symptomatic relief but cannot modify disease progression. Therefore, disease-modifying therapeutic tools are urgently needed. Immunotherapy approaches, including passive transfer of protective antibodies and their fragments, have shown therapeutic efficacy in several animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD. Recombinant antibody fragments are promising alternatives to conventional full-length antibodies. Modern computational approaches and molecular biology tools, directed evolution methodology, and the design of tissue-penetrating fusion peptides allowed for the development of recombinant antibody fragments with superior specificity and affinity, reduced immunogenicity, the capacity to target hidden epitopes and cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), higher solubility and stability, the ability to refold after heat denaturation, and inexpensive large-scale production. In addition, antibody fragments do not induce microglia Fcgamma receptor (FcgammaR)-mediated proinflammatory response and tissue damage in the central nervous system (CNS), because they lack the Fc portion of the immunoglobulin molecule. In the present review, we summarized data on recombinant antibody fragments evaluated as immunotherapeutics in preclinical models of PD and discussed their potential for developing therapeutic and preventive protocols for patients with PD.
