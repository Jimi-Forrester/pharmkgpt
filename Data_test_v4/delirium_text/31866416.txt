31866416|a|HHV-6A and HHV-6B are neurotropic viruses able to dysregulate autophagy and activate ER stress/UPR in several cell types. The appropriate functioning of these processes is required for cell homeostasis, particularly in post-mitotic cells such as neuronal cells. Interestingly, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are often accompanied by autophagy dysregulation and abnormal UPR activation. This study demonstrated for the first time that HHV-6A infection of astrocytoma cells and primary neurons reduces autophagy, increases Abeta production and activates ER stress/UPR promoting tau protein hyper-phosphorylation. Our results support previous studies suggesting that HHV-6A infection may play a role in AD and unveil the possible underlying molecular mechanisms involved.
