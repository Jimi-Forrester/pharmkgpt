38299364|t|Immune receptors and aging brain.
38299364|a|Aging brings about a myriad of degenerative processes throughout the body. A decrease in cognitive abilities is one of the hallmark phenotypes of aging, underpinned by neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration occurring in the brain. This review focuses on the role of different immune receptors expressed in cells of the central and peripheral nervous systems. We will discuss how immune receptors in the brain act as sentinels and effectors of the age-dependent shift in ligand composition. Within this 'old-age-ligand soup,' some immune receptors contribute directly to excessive synaptic weakening from within the neuronal compartment, while others amplify the damaging inflammatory environment in the brain. Ultimately, chronic inflammation sets up a positive feedback loop that increases the impact of immune ligand-receptor interactions in the brain, leading to permanent synaptic and neuronal loss.
