37513366|t|Apple Pomace Compositional Data Highlighting the Proportional Contribution of Polymeric Procyanidins.
37513366|a|Recent years have seen an increase in research focusing on the amelioration of apple pomace waste for use in the food and nutraceutical industries. Much of this work has concentrated on the characterisation of the polyphenol composition of apple pomace materials to determine their role in conferring nutritional and health benefits. Although apples contain substantial quantities of polymeric procyanidins (condensed tannins), this class of compounds has received limited attention in apple research. This study quantified the polymeric procyanidins in apple pomace extracts using a rapid, methyl-cellulose precipitation (MCP) approach for the first time. In addition, a non-targeted metabolomics approach was applied to determine the most abundant phenolic classes present. Polymeric procyanidins were found to be the most abundant type of polyphenol in apple pomace extracts and were generally oligomeric in nature. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed that the ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) was most strongly correlated with the polymeric procyanidin concentration. Noting that polymeric procyanidins may not cross the cell layer to exert antioxidant activity in vivo, their presence in apple pomace extracts may therefore overestimate the FRAP. This work highlights the importance of polymeric procyanidins in the phenolic diversity of apple pomaces, and it is proposed that in future studies, rapid MCP assays may be used for their quantification.
