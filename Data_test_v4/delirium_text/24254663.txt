24254663|a|Elevated concentrations of aluminum are found in regions of neurofibrillary change in brains with senile or presenile dementia of Alzheimer's type. The concentrations of aluminum found in the human disease are comparable to those found in experimental animals with aluminum-induced neurofibrillary degeneration (NFD). Although there are a number of reports confirming these observations, two laboratories have been unable to detect elevated levels in Alzheimer's disease. We conducted an interlaboratory study to resolve this discrepancy and traced the discrepancy to difficulties in analytical procedures. We concluded that failure to detect elevated aluminum levels associated with NFD is the result of (a) lack of strict adherence to the criteria for sample selection; (b) selection of too large a sample for analysis; and (c) use of analytical methodology that has potential matrix interference for the measured signal.
