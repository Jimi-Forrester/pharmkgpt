36623274|a|BACKGROUND: Little is known about the recovery experiences of older trauma intensive care unit (TICU) survivors and the relationship between geriatric trauma care and long-term functional ability and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 218 patients (age, >=65 years) admitted to a Level 1 regional trauma center TICU before versus after implementation of a geriatric care bundle with protocolized geriatrics consultations (Geri-T). Survivors or their proxies were interviewed approximately 1 year after hospitalization. Outcomes included the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs), and EQ-5D-5L HRQOL survey. Two investigator-developed questions regarding recovery experiences were included. Differences in outcomes among survivors admitted before versus after Geri-T were analyzed using multivariable linear regression. Responses to questions about recovery experiences were qualitatively assessed using content analysis. RESULTS: We reached 67% (146/218) of hospital survivors or their proxies across both groups; 126 patients were still alive and completed the survey. Mean age was 76 (SD, 8), 36% were female, and 90% were independent with ADLs preinjury. At follow-up, independence with ADLs was 76% and IADLs was 63%. The mean EQ-5D-5L index score was 0.78 (SD, 0.18). Most patients (65%) reported having not returned to preinjury functional status. Neither functional ability or HRQOL differed significantly among patients admitted before versus after Geri-T. Content analysis of open-ended questions revealed themes of activity limitations, persistent pain, and cognitive dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Nearly one-fifth of TICU survivors experienced loss of ADL function 1 year after injury, and most reported having not returned to preinjury functional status. Nonetheless, patient-reported HRQOL was comparable to age-adjusted norms. Geri-T was not associated with differences in HRQOL or functional ability. Survivors reported persistent difficulty with activities beyond those of daily living, pain, and cognition. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic and Epidemiologic, Level III.
