35848373|t|Automatic auditory processing features in distinct subtypes of patients at clinical high risk for psychosis: Forecasting remission with mismatch negativity.
35848373|a|Individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis exhibit a compromised mismatch negativity (MMN) response, which indicates dysfunction of pre-attentive deviance processing. Event-related potential and time-frequency (TF) information, in combination with clinical and cognitive profiles, may provide insight into the pathophysiology and psychopathology of the CHR stage and predict the prognosis of CHR individuals. A total of 92 individuals with CHR were recruited and followed up regularly for up to 3 years. Individuals with CHR were classified into three clinical subtypes demonstrated previously, specifically 28 from Cluster 1 (characterized by extensive negative symptoms and cognitive deficits), 31 from Cluster 2 (characterized by thought and behavioral disorganization, with moderate cognitive impairment), and 33 from Cluster 3 (characterized by the mildest symptoms and cognitive deficits). Auditory MMN to frequency and duration deviants was assessed. The event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and inter-trial coherence (ITC) were acquired using TF analysis. Predictive indices for remission were identified using logistic regression analyses. As expected, reduced frequency MMN (fMMN) and duration MMN (dMMN) responses were noted in Cluster 1 relative to the other two clusters. In the TF analysis, Cluster 1 showed decreased theta and alpha ITC in response to deviant stimuli. The regression analyses revealed that dMMN latency and alpha ERSP to duration deviants, theta ITC to frequency deviants and alpha ERSP to frequency deviants, and fMMN latency were significant MMN predictors of remission for the three clusters. MMN variables outperformed behavioral variables in predicting remission of Clusters 1 and 2. Our findings indicate relatively disrupted automatic auditory processing in a certain CHR subtype and a close affinity between these electrophysiological indexes and clinical profiles within different clusters. Furthermore, MMN indexes may serve as predictors of subsequent remission from the CHR state. These findings suggest that the auditory MMN response is a potential neurophysiological marker for distinct clinical subtypes of CHR.
