36100824|t|Potential Role of Polyphenolic Flavonoids as Senotherapeutic Agents in Degenerative Diseases and Geroprotection.
36100824|a|Cellular senescence, a hallmark of ageing, contributes to tissue or organ dysfunction and the pathophysiology of diverse age-related diseases (ARD) by various mechanisms. Targeting it by selective elimination of senescent cells (SCs) or blocking senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP) with natural or synthetic compounds has been suggested to improve lifespan. Dietary phytochemicals possess a broad spectrum of biochemical and pharmacological effects that are beneficial to human health. Flavonoids, which are widely consumed in fruits and vegetables worldwide, are emerging as potential therapeutic agents to mitigate senescence. Naringenin, hesperetin, hesperidin, quercetin, fisetin, kaempferol, rutin, apigenin, luteolin, nobiletin, tangeretin, genistein, wogonin, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), theaflavin-3-gallate (TF2A), and procyanidin C1 possess potent antisenescence effects. A single biochemical process may not explain their pleiotropic pharmacological impact. Flavonoids directly modulate underlying cellular senescence processes or interact with molecular targets that regulate ageing-related pathways. This review discusses the potential use of flavonoids to mitigate senescence and consequently delay the onset of ageing-related diseases. We also highlight the underlying mechanisms of action of flavonoids as potential senotherapeutics and reflect on future perspectives and possible strategies to optimize and increase the translatability from bench to bedside in senotherapy.
