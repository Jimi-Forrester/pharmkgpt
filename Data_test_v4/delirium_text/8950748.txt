8950748|a|The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that differences in density of senile plaques (SP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the cuneal and lingual gyri of area V1 of the visual cortex could explain the predominantly inferior visual field defects seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The density of SP and NFT was measured in the cuneal and lingual gyri of 18 AD patients. In 7/18 (39%) patients, the density of SP and/or NFT was significantly greater in the cuneal compared with the lingual gyri. In 3/18 (17%) patients, densities were greater in the lingual than the cuneal gyri and in 8/18 (44%) patients there were no significant differences among gyri. The data suggest that pathological differences between cuneal and lingual gyri could contribute to the reported visual field defects in some AD patients.
