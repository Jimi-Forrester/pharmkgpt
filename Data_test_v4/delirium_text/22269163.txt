22269163|t|Alzheimer's disease and diabetes: an integrative view of the role of mitochondria, oxidative stress, and insulin.
22269163|a|An increasing number of studies have demonstrated a connection between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes (T2D). The risk for developing T2D and AD increases exponentially with age and having T2D increases the risk of developing AD. This has propelled researchers to investigate the mechanism(s) underlying this connection. This review critically discusses the involvement of mitochondrial abnormalities and oxidative stress in AD and diabetes highlighting the similarities between both pathologies. The impact of insulin resistance/insulin signaling impairment in AD pathogenesis will be also debated. A better understanding of the key mechanisms underlying the interaction between AD and diabetes is needed for the design of effective preventive and therapeutic strategies.
