36117973|a|Background: Sleep disturbances are prevalent in patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU) and are associated with worse outcomes. Sedative-dose dexmedetomidine may improve sleep quality in this patient population but is associated with adverse events. Herein, we tested the effect of low-dose dexmedetomidine infusion on nighttime sleep quality in postoperative ICU patients with invasive ventilation. Methods: In this pilot randomized trial, 80 adult patients who were admitted to the ICU after non-cardiac surgery and required invasive mechanical ventilation were randomized to receive either low-dose dexmedetomidine (0.1 to 0.2 mug/kg/h, n = 40) or placebo (n = 40) for up to 72 h. The primary endpoint was overall subjective sleep quality measured using the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (score ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating better quality) in the night of surgery. Secondary outcomes included sleep structure parameters monitored with polysomnography from 9:00 PM on the day of surgery to the next 6:00 AM. Results: All 80 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The overall subjective sleep quality was median 52 (interquartile 20, 66) with placebo vs. 61 (27, 79) with dexmedetomidine, and the difference was not statistically significant (median difference 8; 95% CI: -2, 22; P = 0.120). Among 68 patients included in sleep structure analysis, those in the dexmedetomidine group tended to have longer total sleep time [median difference 54 min (95% CI: -4, 120); P = 0.061], higher sleep efficiency [median difference 10.0% (95% CI: -0.8%, 22.3%); P = 0.060], lower percentage of stage N1 sleep [median difference -3.9% (95% CI: -11.8%, 0.5%); P = 0.090], higher percentage of stage N3 sleep [median difference 0.0% (95% CI: 0.0%, 0.4%); P = 0.057], and lower arousal index [median difference -0.9 (95% CI -2.2, 0.1); P = 0.091] but not statistically significant. There were no differences between the two groups regarding the incidence of adverse events. Conclusion: Among patients admitted to the ICU after surgery with intubation and mechanical ventilation, low-dose dexmedetomidine infusion did not significantly improve the sleep quality pattern, although there were trends of improvement. Our findings support the conduct of a large randomized trial to investigate the effect of low-dose dexmedetomidine in this patient population.
