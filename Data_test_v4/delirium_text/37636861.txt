37636861|a|White matter damage (WMD) is a primary cause of cerebral palsy and cognitive impairment in preterm infants, and no effective treatments are available. Microglia are a major component of the innate immune system. When activated, they form typical pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes and regulate myelin development and synapse formation. Therefore, they may play a pivotal role in hypoxic-ischemic (HI) WMD. Herein, we investigated neural inflammation and long-term microglia phenotypic polarization in a neonatal rat model of hypoxia-ischemia-induced WMD and elucidated the underlying pathophysiological processes. We exposed 3-day-old (P3) Sprague-Dawley rats to hypoxia (8% oxygen) for 2.5 hr after unilateral common carotid artery ligation. The activation of NLRP3 inflammatory bodies, microglia M1/M2 polarization, myelination, and synaptic development in our model were monitored 7, 14, and 21 days after birth. In addition, the Morris water maze test was performed on postnatal Day 28. We confirmed myelination disturbance in the periventricular white matter, abnormal synaptic development, and behavioral changes in the periventricular area during the development of HI WMD. In addition, we found an association between the occurrence and development of HI WMD and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, microglial M1/M2 polarization, and the release of inflammatory factors. NLRP3 inhibition can play an anti-inflammatory role by inhibiting the differentiation of microglia into the M1 phenotype, thereby improving myelination and synapse formation. In conclusion, microglia are key mediators of the inflammatory response and exhibit continuous phenotypic polarization 7-21 days after HI-induced WMD. This finding can potentially lead to a new treatment regimen targeting the phenotypic polarization of microglia early after HI-induced brain injury.
