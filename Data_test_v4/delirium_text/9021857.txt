9021857|t|Incidence of HIV infection among patients with new-onset psychosis.
9021857|a|To assess the frequency of HIV testing and the incidence of HIV infection among patients with new-onset psychosis, the records of 811 patients referred to a military hospital for acute psychosis during a two-year period were reviewed. Records of 518 patients were excluded because they had known chronic psychotic illnesses, repeat admissions for recurrent affective disorders with psychotic features, delirium, dementia, or pre-existing HIV infection. Of the 293 patients with new-onset psychotic illness, 84 percent (N = 246) were tested for HIV antibodies. None were seropositive for HIV. Although patients with new-onset psychosis were commonly assessed for HIV infection to clarify their diagnosis, HIV infection was not associated with new-onset psychosis.
