1723258|a|The role of chronic exogenous intracerebroventricular administration of nerve growth factor (NGF) on the morphology of layer V pyramidal cell dendrites in aging rats was quantified using Golgi impregnations. Both dendritic branching and dendritic spines from the basilar tree of randomly selected pyramidal neurons of the frontal cortex were evaluated in young control (4-month-old) Fischer 344 rats, in old controls (24-month-old), and in 24-month-old rats administered NGF for 4 weeks. Sholl analysis of basilar dendritic trees showed that neuronal branching in older rats was significantly greater than that in young rats (probably due to compensatory dendritic hypertrophy). The extent of dendritic material in aged rats receiving NGF, however, was identical to that in young rats, that is, the dendritic tree had regressed in size. Dendritic spine response to NGF treatment depended on the region of the dendritic tree sampled. Normal aging resulted in spine loss. However, NGF treatment restored dendritic spine densities to those seen in young controls on terminal tip segments ("plastic" regions). Internal branch segments ("nonplastic" regions) showed no response to NGF. As dendritic spines are thought to represent the neuroanatomic basis of learning and memory, results suggest that NGF can influence the morphology of cortical neurons (probably indirectly via the basal forebrain projections) and therefore may play an efficacious role in the treatment of geriatric cognitive dysfunction and even perhaps in Alzheimer's disease.
