Structural neuro-imaging and neuro-ophthalmology tests were normal. Positron emission tomography scanning showed decreased metabolism in the parieto-occipital cortex bilaterally. Several months later the patient developed Alzheimer's disease. DISCUSSION: Visual symptoms may be the first manifestation of Alzheimer's disease.
