35741658|a|Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are being used in patients with various advanced malignancies, and patient outcomes have improved considerably. Although ICIs can effectively treat tumors, 30-60% of patients experience immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is a rare irAE that has become a novel topic in neuroimmunology and has received increasing attention in recent years. Herein, we report a rare case of GAD65-antibody-associated AE after metastatic small cell lung cancer treatment with pembrolizumab. The patient received IVIg therapy for AE and continuous pembrolizumab therapy without suspension of tumor treatment. At 1 year follow-up, both the patient's AE symptoms and tumors were stable. We consider that the treatment of ICI-associated AE should be more individualized with prudent decision-making and should balance the tumor progression and AE treatment. In addition, we have also comprehensively reviewed the literature of ICI-associated AE, and summarized the clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of AE caused by ICI, thus broadening our understanding of the neurological complications caused by ICI.
