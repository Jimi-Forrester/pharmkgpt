32719966|t|The Mechanistic Role of Bridging Integrator 1 (BIN1) in Alzheimer's Disease.
32719966|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia. The majority of AD cases are late-onset, multifactorial cases. Genome-wide association studies have identified more than 30 loci associated with sporadic AD (SAD), one of which is Bridging integrator 1 (BIN1). For the past few years, there has been a consensus that BIN1 is second only to APOE as the strongest genetic risk factor for SAD. Therefore, many researchers have put great effort into studying the mechanism by which BIN1 might be involved in the pathogenetic process of AD. To date, plenty of evidence has shown that BIN1 may participate in several pathways in AD, including tau and amyloid pathology. In addition, BIN1 has been indicated to take part in other relevant pathways such as inflammation, apoptosis, and calcium homeostasis. In this review, we systemically summarize the research progress on how BIN1 participates in the development of AD, with the expectation of providing promising perspectives for future research.
