38863812|a|The detection of rosmarinic acid (Ros A) in food samples holds major significance. Simple and convenient electrochemical detection of Ros A with high performance remains a challenge. In this work, a nanochannel array-modified carbon electrode was constructed using a simple and convenient approach to achieve highly sensitive electrochemical detection of Ros A in food samples. Through simple electrochemical pre-activation of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE), oxygen-containing functional groups were introduced on the electrode surface (p-GCE). Vertically-ordered mesoporous silica film (VMSF) was stably grown on p-GCE through electrochemical-assisted self-assembly (EASA) without the introduction of another adhesive layer (VMSF/p-GCE). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization demonstrated the highly ordered structure of VMSF with a nanochannel diameter around 2.7 nm. Both p-GCE and the nanochannels significantly enhanced the electrochemical signals of Ros A on the electrode, exhibiting dual signal amplification. VMSF/p-GCE demonstrated sensitive detection of Ros A with a linear range of 500 nM to 1 muM and 1 muM to 35 muM. The detection limit (DL) was 26 nM. Combining the good anti-fouling and anti-interference properties of the nanochannels, VMSF/p-GCE can achieve direct electrochemical detection of Ros A in food samples. The sensor can be easily regenerated for repeated use. The simple fabrication, high detection sensitivity and selectivity of the sensor make it a new strategy for rapid preparation of high-performance electrochemical sensors.
