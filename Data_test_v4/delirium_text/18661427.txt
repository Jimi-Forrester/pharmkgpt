18661427|a|In the past decade, RNA oxidation has caught the attention of many researchers, working to uncover its role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. It has been well documented that RNA oxidation is involved in a wide variety of neurological diseases and is an early event in the process of neurodegeneration. The analysis of oxidized RNA species revealed that at least messenger RNA (mRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) are damaged in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The magnitude of the RNA oxidation, at least in mRNA, is significantly high at the early stage of the disease. Oxidative damage to mRNA is not random but selective and many oxidized mRNAs are related to the pathogenesis of the disease. Several studies have suggested that oxidative modification of RNA affects the translational process and consequently produces less protein and/or defective protein. Furthermore, several proteins have been identified to be involved in handling of damaged RNA. Although a growing body of studies suggests that oxidative damage to RNA may be associated with neuron deterioration, further investigation and solid evidence are needed. In addition, further uncovering of the consequences and cellular handling of the oxidatively damaged RNA should be important focuses in this area and may provide significant insights into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.
