38680351|t|Structure-Guided Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Peripheral Anionic Site Selective and Brain Permeable Novel Oxadiazole-Piperazine Conjugates against Alzheimer's Disease with Antioxidant Potential.
38680351|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial and emerging neurological disorder, which has invoked researchers to develop multitargeted ligands. Herein, hybrid conjugates of 5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole and piperazines were rationally designed, synthesized, and pharmacologically evaluated against hAChE, hBChE, and hBACE-1 enzymes for the management of AD. Among the series, compound 5AD comprising pyridyl substitution at terminal nitrogen of piperazine contemplated as a paramount lead compound (hAChE, IC50 = 0.103 +- 0.0172 muM, hBChE, IC50 >= 10 muM, and hBACE-1, IC50 = 1.342 +- 0.078 muM). Compound 5AD showed mixed-type enzyme inhibition in enzyme kinetic studies against the hAChE enzyme. In addition, compound 5AD revealed a significant displacement of propidium iodide from the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of hAChE and excellent blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability in a parallel artificial membrane permeation assay (PAMPA). Besides, 5AD also exhibited anti-Abeta aggregation activity in self- and AChE-induced thioflavin T assay. Further, compound 5AD has shown significant improvement in learning and memory (p < 0.001) against the in vivo scopolamine-induced cognitive dysfunction mice model. The ex vivo study implied that after treatment with compound 5AD, there was a decrease in AChE and malonaldehyde (MDA) levels with an increase in catalase (CAT, oxidative biomarkers) in the hippocampal brain homogenate. Hence, compound 5AD could be regarded as a lead compound and further be explored in the treatment of AD.
