35458770|t|Silibinin and Naringenin against Bisphenol A-Induced Neurotoxicity in Zebrafish Model-Potential Flavonoid Molecules for New Drug Design, Development, and Therapy for Neurological Disorders.
35458770|a|Bisphenol A (BPA), a well-known xenoestrogen, is commonly utilised in the production of polycarbonate plastics. Based on the existing evidence, BPA is known to induce neurotoxicity and behavioural issues. Flavonoids such as silibinin and naringenin have been shown to have biological activity against a variety of illnesses. The current research evaluates the neuropharmacological effects of silibinin and naringenin in a zebrafish model against neurotoxicity and oxidative stress caused by Bisphenol A. In this study, a novel tank diving test (NTDT) and light-dark preference test (LDPT) were used in neurobehavioural investigations. The experimental protocol was planned to last 21 days. The neuroprotective effects of silibinin (10 muM) and naringenin (10 muM) in zebrafish (Danio rerio) induced by BPA (17.52 muM) were investigated. In the brine shrimp lethality assay, the 50% fatal concentrations (LC50) were 34.10 mug/mL (silibinin) and 91.33 mug/mL (naringenin) compared to the standard potassium dichromate (13.15 mug/mL). The acute toxicity investigation found no mortality or visible abnormalities in the silibinin- and naringenin-treated groups (LC50 > 100 mg/L). The altered scototaxis behaviour in LDPT caused by BPA was reversed by co-supplementation with silibinin and naringenin, as shown by decreases in the number of transitions to the light zone and the duration spent in the light zone. Our findings point to BPA's neurotoxic potential in causing altered scototaxis and bottom-dwelling behaviour in zebrafish, as well as the usage of silibinin and naringenin as potential neuroprotectants.
