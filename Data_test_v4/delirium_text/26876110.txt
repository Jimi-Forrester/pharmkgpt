26876110|a|Experts use the term corticobasal syndrome (CBS) for patients with a clinical diagnosis of corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and reserve CBD for those whose conditions have been diagnosed on the basis of neuropathological analyses. Several studies demonstrated that patients with CBD may also present with progressive supranuclear syndrome (PSPS), aphasia, Alzheimer disease-like dementia or behavioral change, suggesting that CBS is merely one of the presenting phenotypes of CBD. Although previous CBD diagnostic criteria reflected only CBS, the international consortium proposed new diagnostic criteria for CBD in 2013 (Armstrong's criteria). The new criteria include 4 CBD subtypes; CBS, frontal behavioral-spatial syndrome (FBS), nonfluent/agrammatic variant of primary progressive aphasia (naPPA),and PSPS. These subtypes were combined to create 2 sets of criteria: more specific clinical research criteria for probable CBD (cr-CBD) and broader criteria for possible CBD that are more inclusive but have a higher chance to detect other tau-based pathologies (p-CBD). Two studies have already revealed that the sensitivity and specificity of the criteria were not high. Because therapeutic interventions that target abnormally-phosphorylated tau have started, further refinement of the criteria is needed via biomarker researches with prospective study designs.
