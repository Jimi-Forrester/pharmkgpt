39564461|a|Objective: Observational studies have frequently shown a co-occurrence of psychiatric disorders and Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), with major depressive disorder (MDD) being a prevalent psychiatric disorder. This study aims to investigate the genetic overlap between MDD and OSA to explore their underlying pathological mechanisms. Methods: Leveraging the extensive and recent GWAS for OSA and MDD, we conducted genetic correlation analyses utilizing Linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC), re-evaluated their pleiotropic Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with Cross-Phenotype Association (CPASSOC) and Colocalization (COLOC), investigated the overlap at the gene level using physical annotations and Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation (MAGMA), and finally employed Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess potential causal relationships between the two disorders. Results: Upon our investigation, we established that MDD and OSA exhibit high heritability (h2MDD=0.02, h2OSA=0.04) alongside a significant genetic correlation (rg=0.31, P= 1.42E-23). Utilizing CPASSOC, we identified 397 pleiotropic SNPs, associable with 45 loci, two of which share common genetic fragments with a pleiotropic role. Furthermore, the MAGMA study uncovered a total of 154 pleiotropic genes capable of influencing multiple brain regions. Lastly, leveraging MR analysis, we concluded that MDD heightens the risk of developing OSA (P=3. 10E-04, OR (95%CI):1.28(1.12~ 1.47)). Conclusion: In summary, our study identified PCLO as a common gene between OSA and MDD and provided evidence that MDD causally contributes to the development of OSA. These insights enhance our understanding of the shared mechanisms underlying the comorbidity of these conditions.
