30202713|t|Trends in Lumbar Fusion Surgery Among Octogenarians: A Nationwide Inpatient Sample Study From 2004 to 2013.
30202713|a|STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. OBJECTIVES: Given the aging US population and natural degenerative process of the spine, more elderly patients with lumbar spinal disease are surgical candidates. Prior studies have assessed safety and efficacy of lumbar fusion (LF) surgeries in the elderly, but none have reviewed fusion procedures from an epidemiological standpoint. Here, we report 2004-2013 national trends in demographics, discharge time, and economic impact of LF procedures for octogenarians. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was queried from 2004 to 2013 for LF procedures in patients aged 80 to 89 years. Patients were grouped by fusion level, demographics, comorbidity score, insurance, and hospital characteristics. Postoperative variables include length of stay and total in-hospital charges. Data was evaluated using chi-squared tests and t tests. RESULTS: The national sample included 17 471 LF procedures (mean age = 82.65 years). From 2004 to 2013, the annual number of LF procedures increased from 1144 to 2061 patients. Percentage of multilevel LF was relatively maintained (mean = 18%). The majority of patients were female (mean = 62%). The proportion of males increased during the study period (31.8% to 42.5%; P < .0001). The proportion of patients with a comorbidity score of 2 or 3 increased during the study period (P < .0001). Over time, average length of stay decreased (from 6 to 4.5 days; P < .0001), and total in-hospital charges increased (from $58 471 to $111 235; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that more lumbar fusion procedures are being performed on octogenarians in recent years. While these patients are discharged from hospitals more quickly after surgery, there is also greater financial burden placed on patients, hospitals, and society.
