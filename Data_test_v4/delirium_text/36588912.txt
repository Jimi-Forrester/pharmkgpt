36588912|a|Stroke is a serious global public health issue, associated with severe disability and high mortality rates. Its early detection is challenging, and no effective biomarkers are available. To obtain a better understanding of stroke prevention, management, and recovery, we conducted lipidomic analyses to characterize plasma metabolic features. Lipid species were measured using an untargeted lipidomic analysis with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Sixty participants were recruited in this cohort study, including 20 healthy individuals and 40 patients with stroke. To investigate the association between lipids related to long-term functional recovery in stroke patients. The primary independent variable was activities of daily living (ADL) dependency upon admission to the stroke unit and at the 3-month follow-up appointment. ADL dependency was assessed using the Barthel Index. Eleven significantly altered lipid species between the stroke and healthy groups were detected and displayed in a hierarchically clustered heatmap. Acyl carnitine, triacylglycerol, and ceramides were detected as potential lipid markers. Regarding the association between lipid profiles and functional status of patients with stroke the results indicated, lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC) and phosphatidylcholines were closely associated with stroke recovery. LPC may contribute positively role in patient's rehabilitation process via an anti-inflammatory mechanism. Appropriate management or intervention for lipid levels is expected to lead to better clinical outcomes.
