30310551|t|Comparison of 4 mg dexamethasone versus 8 mg dexamethasone as an adjuvant to levobupivacaine in fascia iliaca block-a prospective study.
30310551|a|BACKGROUND: To compare the effects of adding two different doses of dexamethasone on the duration and quality of the fascia iliaca block in patients undergoing proximal femoral fracture surgery. METHODS: A total of 60 patients (age 18-70 years) undergoing proximal femoral nailing surgery under spinal anesthesia were given fascia iliaca block after random assignment to one of the two groups: Group H received an injection of levobupivacaine (0.5%) 28 ml with 2 ml (8 mg) dexamethasone, and Group L received an injection of levobupivacaine (0.5%) 28 ml with dexamethasone 1 ml (4 mg) with 1 ml normal saline. Assessment of the duration of analgesia and the total tramadol requirement over 48 hours were noted after a successful block. RESULTS: The duration of analgesia was found to be significantly longer in Group H (17.02 +- 0.45 h) than in the Group L patients (14.29 +- 0.45 h) with a p-value of 0.000. Postoperative analgesic requirement (amount of tramadol in mg) was significantly higher in Group L (Q2: 200.0; IQR: 100.0, 200.0) as compared to Group H (Q2: 100.0; IQR: 100.0, 200.0) with a p-value of 0.034. No patient showed any sign of neurotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Dexamethasone, in a dose of 8 mg, is superior to 4 mg when used as an adjuvant with levobupivacaine in the FIB. Though both prolonged analgesia and were effective in reducing oral/intravenous analgesics, 8 mg dexamethasone can be recommended as a more efficacious adjuvant to local anesthetics in the FIB.
