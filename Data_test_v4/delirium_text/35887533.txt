35887533|a|Many epidemiologic and clinical studies have shown significant links between the degree of sleep disturbance and severity of impairment of selective cognitive functions, including the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the sleep parameters that affect cognitive function in old age are unclear. Therefore, we investigated the association between sleep parameters and cognitive function in older patients. Patients aged above 65 years who complained of sleep-disordered breathing were enrolled consecutively. The Mini-Mental-State Examination tool was used to evaluate cognitive function. Eighty patients (normal cognitive function, n = 32 and cognitive impairment, n = 42) were included in this study. Multiple linear regression and binary logistic regression analyses were performed to explain the relationship between sleep parameters and cognitive function. We found that the body mass index (BMI) was significantly lower in the cognitive impairment group than in the normal cognitive function group. Additionally, the cognitive impairment group showed significantly decreased sleep efficiency and an increased apnea index compared with normal subjects. Moreover, lower BMI, reduced sleep efficiency, and high frequency of apnea events during sleep were associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment.
