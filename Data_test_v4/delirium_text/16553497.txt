DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Twenty-seven long-term care facilities in Indiana. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Residents of long-term care facilities with a diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer's disease, complicated by agitation and/or psychosis, and receiving atypical antipsychotics for a minimum of four weeks. INTERVENTION: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Changes in weight after initiation of atypical antipsychotic therapy. RESULTS: Ninety residents were evaluated. Mean age was 83.4 years; 71% were female. Forty-nine percent of the residents gained weight. The residents who received risperidone, olanzapine, or quetiapine gained an average of 5.6 pounds, 8.2 pounds, and 6.1 pounds, respectively. Seven residents had a significant weight gain, and seven residents had a significant weight loss. CONCLUSION: In our population we did not observe any significant weight change in individuals receiving risperidone, olanzapine, or quetiapine. Further prospective studies are needed to determine if there is a difference in potential weight gain among the various atypical antipsychotics in residents with dementia or Alzheimer's disease.
