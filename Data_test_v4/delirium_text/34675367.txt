34675367|t|Design, synthesis, biological evaluation, and molecular modeling studies of pyrazole-benzofuran hybrids as new alpha-glucosidase inhibitor.
34675367|a|In this work, new derivatives of biphenyl pyrazole-benzofuran hybrids were designed, synthesized and evaluated in vitro through enzymatic assay for inhibitory effect against alpha-glucosidase activity. Newly identified inhibitors were found to be four to eighteen folds more active with IC50 values in the range of 40.6 +- 0.2-164.3 +- 1.8 microM, as compared to the standard drug acarbose (IC50 = 750.0 +- 10.0 muM). Limited Structure-activity relationship was established. A kinetic binding study indicated that most active compound 8e acted as the competitive inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase with Ki = 38 muM. Molecular docking has also been performed to find the interaction modes responsible for the desired inhibitory activity. As expected, all pharmacophoric features, used in the design of the hybrid, are involved in the interaction with the active site of the enzyme. In addition, molecular dynamic simulations showed compound 8e oriented vertically into the active site from mouth to the bottom and stabilized the enzyme domains by interacting with the interface of domain A and domain B and the back side of the active site while acarbose formed non-binding interaction with the residue belong to the domain A of the enzyme.
