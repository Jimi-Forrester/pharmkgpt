10939570|t|Progressive loss of cortical acetylcholinesterase activity in association with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease: a positron emission tomography study.
10939570|a|We measured brain acetylcholinesterase activity in 30 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 14 age-matched controls by positron emission tomography (PET) and using a carbon 11-labeled acetylcholine analogue. Seven AD patients had repeat PET scans. The k3 values were calculated as an index of acetylcholinesterase activity in a three-compartment analysis using the metabolite corrected arterial input function. Twenty-eight of the 30 AD patients (14 each in the early and late onset subgroups) were retained in the study so as to equalize the range and average severity of cognitive impairment within the early and late onset subgroups. The k3 values were significantly reduced in the neocortex, hippocampus, and amygdala in the early onset AD patients, although the k3 values were significantly reduced only in the temporoparietal cortex and amygdala in the late onset AD patients. In the longitudinal study, all 7 repeat AD patients showed further reduction of cortical k3 values in the second PET scans, with a mean interval of 2 years, suggesting a progressive loss of the ascending cholinergic system from the nucleus basalis of Meynert in AD. In 37 AD patients, there was a highly significant correlation between the cortical k3 values and Mini-Mental State Examination scores, supporting the cholinergic hypothesis in AD.
