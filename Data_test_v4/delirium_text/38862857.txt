38862857|t|Clinical features of audible upper airway secretions ("death rattle") in patients with cancer in the last days of life.
38862857|a|PURPOSE: Audible upper airway secretions ("death rattle") is a common problem in cancer patients at the end-of-life. However, there is little information about its clinical features. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a cluster randomised trial of clinically-assisted hydration in cancer patients in the last days of life. Patients were assessed 4 hourly for end-of-life problems (including audible secretions), which were recorded as present or absent, excepting restlessness/agitation, which was scored using the modified Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale. Patients were followed up until death. RESULTS: 200 patients were recruited, and 186 patients died during the study period. Overall, 54.5% patients developed audible secretions at some point during the study, but only 34.5% patients had audible secretions at the time of death. The prevalence of audible secretions increased the closer to death, with a marked increase in the last 12-16 h of life (i.e. the prevalence of audible secretions was highest at the time of death). Of those with audible secretions at the time of death, 24 had had a previous episode that had resolved. Development of audible secretions was not associated with use of clinically-assisted hydration, but there was an association between audible secretions and restlessness/agitation, and audible secretions and pain. However, most patients with audible secretions were not restless/agitated, or in pain, when assessed. CONCLUSION: Audible secretions ("death rattle") are common in cancer patients at the end-of-life, but their natural history is extremely variable, with some patients experiencing multiple episodes during the terminal phase (although not necessarily experiencing an episode at the time of death).
