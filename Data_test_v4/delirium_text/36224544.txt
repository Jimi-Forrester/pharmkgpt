36224544|a|BACKGROUND: To investigate the characteristics of sleep cycle in children with severe acute bronchopneumonia treated with invasive mechanical ventilation at different sedation depths. METHODS: We included 35 pediatric patients with severe acute bronchopneumonia treated using mechanical ventilation in Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University. They were divided into deep sedation group (n = 21; ramsay score 5-6) and light sedation group (n = 14; ramsay score3-4) based on sedation depth achieved during mechanical ventilation. Long-term video electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring was performed within the first 24 h after starting mechanical ventilation and after weaning from mechanical ventilation and discontinuing sedatives and analgesics. The results were analyzed and compared with those of normal children to analyze changes in sleep cycle characteristics at different sedation depths and mechanical ventilation stages. RESULTS: There were 29 cases altered sleep architecture. The deep sedation group had a significantly higher incidence of sleep architecture altered, total sleep duration, and non-rapid eye movement sleep-1 (NREM-1) loss incidence than the light sedation group. Moreover, the deep sedation group had a significantly lower awakening number and rapid eye movement sleep (REM) percentage than the light sedation group. The sleep cycle returned to normal in 27 (77%) patients without NREM-1 or REM sleep loss. CONCLUSIONS: Deep sedation during mechanical ventilation allows longer total sleep duration, fewer awakenings, and an increased deep sleep proportion, but sleep architecture is severely altered. After weaning from mechanical ventilation and sedative discontinuation, lightly sedated children exhibit better sleep recovery.
