8721199|a|A particular importance can assume, especially during the onset of Alzheimer's disease, the psychiatric symptomatology characterized by depressive mood, auto and hetero-aggressive behaviour, psychomotor agitation, anxiety disorders, sleep disorders, delusions and hallucinations, these pictures showing a prevalence of 30%. 13 patients affected by Alzheimer's disease at the onset, of both sexes, age ranging from 45 to 80 years, were included in the study. The clinical picture was assessed by BDS, GDS, ICS, IADL, BIMC, MMSE, ADAS, a neuropsychological test battery such as Token Test, verbal fluency test for semantic categories, prose memory test, scribble discrimination test, numeric matrix test, Raven test, judgement of line orientation. A computerized test battery by NYU Computerized Test Battery have been also administered. The psychiatric clinical picture has been evaluated by HRS-D and the non cognitive session of ADAS. There was a positive significant (r = 0.85, p = 0.0004) correlation between depressive symptomatology evaluated at HRS-D and deterioration of daily living activities evaluated at the Blessed Dementia Scale (BDS). On the other hand the deterioration of cognitive capacities was not significantly correlated with a worsening of behavioural aspects. In conclusion seems to have a particular importance, at the onset of Alzheimer's disease, the psychopathological component that often seems to be the principal component in the determination of the early deterioration of daily living and behaviour or patients.
