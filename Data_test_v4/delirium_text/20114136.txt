20114136|a|OBJECTIVE: To highlight the association between the use of lithium and the development of delirium following discontinuation of lithium therapy, a condition that substantially increases the risk of psychogenic events and other medical complications. METHOD: Physical examination, laboratory studies including measurement of serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels, measurement of urine osmolalities before and after desmopressin administration and a brain magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: A 49-year-old woman with a background history of bipolar disorder taking lithium presented with severe mania complicated with delirium following discontinuation of lithium therapy. CONCLUSION: Mania in the context of lithium therapy may be complicated with delirium. Therefore, mental status should be closely monitored in patients receiving lithium in order to facilitate early detection and intervention of delirium to prevent further health complications.
