18298843|a|BACKGROUND: Alterations in multiple cellular pathways contribute to the development of chronic neurodegeneration such as a sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). These, in turn, involve changes in gene expression, amongst which are genes regulating protein processing and turnover such as the components of the ubiquitin-proteosome system. Recently, we have identified a cDNA whose expression was altered in AD brains. It contained an open reading frame of 247 amino acids and represented a novel RING finger protein, RNF182. Here we examined its biochemical properties and putative role in brain cells. RESULTS: RNF182 is a low abundance cytoplasmic protein expressed preferentially in the brain. Its expression was elevated in post-mortem AD brain tissue and the gene could be up regulated in vitro in cultured neurons subjected to cell death-inducing injuries. Subsequently, we have established that RNF182 protein possessed an E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and stimulated the E2-dependent polyubiquitination in vitro. Yeast two-hybrid screening, overexpression and co-precipitation approaches revealed, both in vitro and in vivo, an interaction between RNF182 and ATP6V0C, known for its role in the formation of gap junction complexes and neurotransmitter release channels. The data indicated that RNF182 targeted ATP6V0C for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway. Overexpression of RNF182 reduced cell viability and it would appear that by itself the gene can disrupt cellular homeostasis. CONCLUSION: Taken together, we have identified a novel brain-enriched RING finger E3 ligase, which was up regulated in AD brains and neuronal cells exposed to injurious insults. It interacted with ATP6V0C protein suggesting that it may play a very specific role in controlling the turnover of an essential component of neurotransmitter release machinery.
