37953283|t|Efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of MR13A11A, a generic of remifentanil, for pain management of Japanese patients in the intensive care unit: a double-blinded, fentanyl-controlled, randomized, non-inferiority phase 3 study.
37953283|a|BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of continuous intravenous administration of remifentanil in mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, fentanyl-controlled, non-inferiority phase 3 study. Patients aged >= 20 years requiring 6 h to 10 days mechanical ventilation in an ICU and requiring pain relief were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either remifentanil (n = 98) or fentanyl (n = 98). Dose was titrated from an infusion rate of 1 mL/h (remifentanil: 0.025 microg/kg/min, fentanyl: 0.1 microg/kg/h) until the target level of analgesia (behavioral pain scale [BPS] <= 5 or numerical rating score [NRS] <= 3) was achieved by escalating the dose in 1 mL/h increasing. Administration was then adjusted to maintain the target level of analgesia until weaning from the ventilator. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who did not require rescue fentanyl. Safety was assessed according to standard procedures. PK of remifentanil in the arterial blood was assessed in 24 patients. RESULTS: The proportion of patients achieving the primary endpoint in the remifentanil and fentanyl groups was 100% (92/92) and 97.8% (88/90), respectively. The difference between the groups was 2.2% (95% confidence interval, - 0.8-5.3) and non-inferiority of remifentanil to fentanyl was verified (p < 0.0001). The incidences of any adverse events in the remifentanil and fentanyl groups was 34 of 92 patients (37.0%) and 34 of 90 patients (37.8%), respectively. Adverse drug reactions was 12 in 92 patients (13.0%) and 15 in 90 patients (16.7%), respectively. In the PK analysis, blood remifentanil concentration decreased within 10 min to almost 50% of the end of administration, suggesting rapid offset of action following discontinuation of remifentanil. CONCLUSIONS: Remifentanil can be used safely for pain management in mechanically ventilated Japanese patients in the ICU. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Japan Registry of Clinical Trials, jRCT2080224954.
