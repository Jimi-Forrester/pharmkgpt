37507059|t|Preference Matrix Guided Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis for Mining Brain Imaging Genetic Associations in Alzheimer's Disease.
37507059|a|Investigating the relationship between genetic variation and phenotypic traits is a key issue in quantitative genetics. Specifically for Alzheimer's disease, the association between genetic markers and quantitative traits remains vague while, once identified, will provide valuable guidance for the study and development of genetics-based treatment approaches. Currently, to analyze the association of two modalities, sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) is commonly used to compute one sparse linear combination of the variable features for each modality, giving a pair of linear combination vectors in total that maximizes the cross-correlation between the analyzed modalities. One drawback of the plain SCCA model is that the existing findings and knowledge cannot be integrated into the model as priors to help extract interesting correlations as well as identify biologically meaningful genetic and phenotypic markers. To bridge this gap, we introduce preference matrix guided SCCA (PM-SCCA) that not only takes priors encoded as a preference matrix but also maintains computational simplicity. A simulation study and a real-data experiment are conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the model. Both experiments demonstrate that the proposed PM-SCCA model can capture not only genotype-phenotype correlation but also relevant features effectively.
