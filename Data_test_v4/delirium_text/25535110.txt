25535110|t|[Awareness and understanding of consent in Alzheimer's disease].
25535110|a|Before a patient can take part in a clinical research, French legislation requires his/her free, express and informed consent. In the same way, the information must be given in a clear, fair and appropriate manner. However, in the context of Alzheimer's disease, one might wonder about the patient's capacity to consent. The goal of our research was to study the capacity to provide informed consent in a group of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and in a control group, using two specialized clinical vignettes inspired by Marson's studies. The aim of the study was to assess discernment in capacity to consent to a treatment and to determinate the possible links between impaired capacities to consent and cognitive and behavioral impairments involved in Alzheimer's disease. The data collected confirm that the capacity to make and maintain a choice is preserved while the capacities to appreciate the consequences of choosing a treatment, to reason and to understand the treatment situation are already impaired in mild Alzheimer's disease. The impairment of these capacities can be linked to dysexecutive syndrome, apathy and impaired self-awareness. Caregivers and family should take into account the risk of weakened capacities of discernment as soon as possible.
