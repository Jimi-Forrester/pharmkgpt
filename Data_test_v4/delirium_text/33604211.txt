33604211|t|Fentanyl Infusion Is Effective in the Treatment of Dyspnea in End-Stage Heart Failure With Renal Failure: A Case Report.
33604211|a|Patients with end-stage heart failure may require hospitalization for the treatment of respiratory distress. Morphine may be used to relieve symptoms. However, use of morphine is problematic because heart failure is often associated with renal dysfunction. In this case report, intravenous fentanyl infusion reduced dyspnea in a patient with end-stage heart failure who was on dialysis induction to treat renal failure. The patient was able to eat and sleep after administration of an intravenous fentanyl solution and experienced no apparent respiratory depression as a side effect of fentanyl. There have been few reports of dyspnea relief with fentanyl infusion. Because of its adjustable duration of effect, intravenous fentanyl may be a more effective and useful option than rapid or extended-release agents in cases such as this one.
