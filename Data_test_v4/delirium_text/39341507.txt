39341507|t|Advances in Understanding Biomarkers and Treating Neurological Diseases -Role of the Cerebellar Dysfunction and Emerging Therapies.
39341507|a|Cerebellar dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in various neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Research has revealed distinct cerebellar atrophy patterns in conditions such as AD and multiple system atrophy, and studies in mice have highlighted its impact on motor control and cognitive functions. Emerging research into autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has identified key targets, such as elevated levels of chemokine receptors and ZIC family genes. Biomarkers, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic markers, and advances in AI and bioinformatics, are enhancing early diagnosis and personalized treatment across neurodegenerative disorders. Notable advancements include improved diagnostic tools, gene therapy, and novel clinical trials. Despite progress, challenges such as the bloodbrain barrier and neuroinflammation persist. Current therapies for AD, PD, HD, and ALS, including antisense oligonucleotides and stem cell treatments, show promise but require further investigation. A comprehensive approach that integrates diagnostic methods and innovative therapies is essential for effective management and improved patient outcomes.
