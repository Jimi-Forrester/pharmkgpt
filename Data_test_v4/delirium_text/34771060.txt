34771060|t|Biomedical Applications of Translational Optical Imaging: From Molecules to Humans.
34771060|a|Light is a powerful investigational tool in biomedicine, at all levels of structural organization. Its multitude of features (intensity, wavelength, polarization, interference, coherence, timing, non-linear absorption, and even interactions with itself) able to create contrast, and thus images that detail the makeup and functioning of the living state can and should be combined for maximum effect, especially if one seeks simultaneously high spatiotemporal resolution and discrimination ability within a living organism. The resulting high relevance should be directed towards a better understanding, detection of abnormalities, and ultimately cogent, precise, and effective intervention. The new optical methods and their combinations needed to address modern surgery in the operating room of the future, and major diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration are reviewed here, with emphasis on our own work and highlighting selected applications focusing on quantitation, early detection, treatment assessment, and clinical relevance, and more generally matching the quality of the optical detection approach to the complexity of the disease. This should provide guidance for future advanced theranostics, emphasizing a tighter coupling-spatially and temporally-between detection, diagnosis, and treatment, in the hope that technologic sophistication such as that of a Mars rover can be translationally deployed in the clinic, for saving and improving lives.
