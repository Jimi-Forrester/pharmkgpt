37321820|t|The Use of Tau PET to Stage Alzheimer Disease According to the Braak Staging Framework.
37321820|a|Amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are the 2 histopathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD). On the basis of the pattern of NFT distribution in the brain, Braak and Braak proposed a histopathologic staging system for AD. Braak staging provides a compelling framework for staging and monitoring of NFT progression in vivo using PET imaging. Because AD staging remains based on clinical features, there is an unmet need to translate neuropathologic staging to a biologic clinical staging system. Such a biomarker staging system might play a role in staging preclinical AD or in improving recruitment strategies for clinical trials. Here, we review the literature regarding AD staging with the Braak framework using tau PET imaging, here called PET-based Braak staging. Our aim is to summarize the efforts of implementing Braak staging using PET and assess correspondence with the Braak histopathologic descriptions and with AD biomarkers. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search in May 2022 on PubMed and Scopus combining the terms "Alzheimer" AND "Braak" AND ("positron emission tomography" OR "PET"). Results: The database search returned 262 results, and after assessment for eligibility, 21 studies were selected. Overall, most studies indicate that PET-based Braak staging may be an efficient method to stage AD since it presents an adequate ability to discriminate between phases of the AD continuum and correlates with clinical, fluid, and imaging biomarkers of AD. However, the translation of the original Braak descriptions to tau PET was done taking into account the limitations of this imaging technique. This led to important interstudy variability in the anatomic definitions of Braak stage regions of interest. Conclusion: Refinements in this staging system are necessary to incorporate atypical variants and Braak-nonconformant cases. Further studies are needed to understand the possible applications of PET-based Braak staging to clinical practice and research. Furthermore, there is a need for standardization in the topographic definitions of Braak stage regions of interest to guarantee reproducibility and methodologic homogeneity across studies.
