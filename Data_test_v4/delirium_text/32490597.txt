32490597|t|DNA Methylation Associated with Mitochondrial Dysfunction in a South African Autism Spectrum Disorder Cohort.
32490597|a|Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by phenotypic heterogeneity and a complex genetic architecture which includes distinctive epigenetic patterns. We report differential DNA methylation patterns associated with ASD in South African children. An exploratory whole-epigenome methylation screen using the Illumina 450 K MethylationArray identified differentially methylated CpG sites between ASD and controls that mapped to 898 genes (P <= 0.05) which were enriched for nine canonical pathways converging on mitochondrial metabolism and protein ubiquitination. Targeted Next Generation Bisulfite Sequencing of 27 genes confirmed differential methylation between ASD and control in our cohort. DNA pyrosequencing of two of these genes, the mitochondrial enzyme Propionyl-CoA Carboxylase subunit Beta (PCCB) and Protocadherin Alpha 12 (PCDHA12), revealed a wide range of methylation levels (9-49% and 0-54%, respectively) in both ASD and controls. Three CpG loci were differentially methylated in PCCB (P <= 0.05), while PCDHA12, previously linked to ASD, had two significantly different CpG sites (P <= 0.001) between ASD and control. Differentially methylated CpGs were hypomethylated in ASD. Metabolomic analysis of urinary organic acids revealed that three metabolites, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid (P = 0.008), 3-methyglutaconic acid (P = 0.018), and ethylmalonic acid (P = 0.043) were significantly elevated in individuals with ASD. These metabolites are directly linked to mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders, with a putative link to PCCB, consistent with impaired mitochondrial function. Our data support an association between DNA methylation and mitochondrial dysfunction in the etiology of ASD. Autism Res 2020, 13: 1079-1093.   2020 The Authors.

LAY SUMMARY: Epigenetic changes are chemical modifications of DNA which can change gene function. DNA methylation, a type of epigenetic modification, is linked to autism. We examined DNA methylation in South African children with autism and identified mitochondrial genes associated with autism. Mitochondria are power-suppliers in cells and mitochondrial genes are essential to metabolism and energy production, which are important for brain cells during development. Our findings suggest that some individuals with ASD also have mitochondrial dysfunction.
