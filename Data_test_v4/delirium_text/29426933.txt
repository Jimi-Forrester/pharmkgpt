29426933|t|A conserved R type Methionine Sulfoxide Reductase reverses oxidized GrpEL1/Mge1 to regulate Hsp70 chaperone cycle.
29426933|a|Cells across evolution employ reversible oxidative modification of methionine and cysteine amino acids within proteins to regulate responses to redox stress. Previously we have shown that mitochondrial localized methionine sulfoxide reductase (Mxr2) reversibly regulates oxidized yeast Mge1 (yMge1), a co-chaperone of Hsp70/Ssc1 to maintain protein homeostasis during oxidative stress. However, the specificity and the conservation of the reversible methionine oxidation mechanism in higher eukaryotes is debatable as human GrpEL1 (hGrpEL1) unlike its homolog yMge1 harbors two methionine residues and multiple cysteines besides the mammalian mitochondria hosting R and S types of Mxrs/Msrs. In this study, using yeast as a surrogate system, we show that hGRPEL1 and R type MSRs but not the S type MSRs complement the deletion of yeast MGE1 or MXR2 respectively. Our investigations show that R type Msrs interact selectively with oxidized hGrpEL1/yMge1 in an oxidative stress dependent manner, reduce the conserved hGrpEL1-Met146-SO and rescue the Hsp70 ATPase activity. In addition, a single point mutation in hGrpEL1-M146L rescues the slow growth phenotype of yeast MXR2 deletion under oxidative duress. Our study illustrates the evolutionarily conserved formation of specific Met-R-SO in hGrpEL1/yMge1 and the essential and canonical role of R type Msrs/Mxrs in mitochondrial redox mechanism.
