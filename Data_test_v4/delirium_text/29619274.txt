29619274|t|Evaluating Postoperative Complications and Outcomes of Orthopedic Fracture Repair in Nonagenarian Patients.
29619274|a|INTRODUCTION: The United States and the world are currently experiencing a tremendous growth in the elderly population. Moreover, individuals surpassing the ages of 80 and 90 are also continuing to increase. As this unique division of society expands, it is critical that the medical community best understands how to assess, diagnose, and treat this population. The purpose of this study was to analyze morbidity, mortality, and overall outcome of patients aged 90 years and older after orthopedic surgical fracture repair. Such knowledge will guide patients and their families in making decisions when surgery is required among nonagenarians. METHODS: The trauma registry of our level I academic medical center was queried to identify potential study participants over the past decade. Two hundred and thirty-three surgical procedures among 227 patients were included and retrospectively assessed. Parameters of specific interest were injury type, mechanism of injury (including high energy vs low energy and height of falls), injury severity score, preoperative comorbidities, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, discharge destination, and postoperative mortality rate. RESULTS: Overall, 4.3% of the cohort died in the hospital following surgery. Of the patients who survived, 89.7% were discharged to a professionally supervised setting. The nonagenarian population displayed a considerable follow-up rate, as 82.8% of individuals returned for their first postoperative office visit. DISCUSSION: Historically, surgical morbidity and mortality are highly associated with this age group. However, the number of nonagenarians in the United States is increasing, as are these surgical procedures. The epidemiologic and clinical findings of our study support this trend and add further insight into the matter. CONCLUSION: This investigation demonstrates that orthopedic surgery is an appropriate treatment in this population with an acceptable complication rate. Furthermore, nonagenarians have the potential to demonstrate a substantial follow-up rate, but postoperative discharge to a professionally supervised setting may be necessary.
