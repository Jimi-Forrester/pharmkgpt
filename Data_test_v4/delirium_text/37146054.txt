We aimed to investigate the effect of art therapy on emotional (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 [MMPI-2]) and physical (natural killer [NK] cell count, expression of stress-associated proteins [SAP], and electroencephalography) changes in patients with AUD. METHODS: Participants were randomly divided into two groups (n = 35), with the experimental group undergoing art therapy involving weekly 60-min group therapy sessions for 10 weeks. Statistical analysis was performed using Ranked ANCOVA and Wilcoxon's signed rank test. Western blotting was performed to analyze serum SAP levels. RESULTS: We observed an association between psychological mechanisms and stress proteins. There was an increased number of NK cells in the experimental group after the program. Moreover, compared with the control group, the experimental group showed significant changes in SAP expression. Further, the experimental group showed a positive change in the MMPI-2 profile, as well as a decrease in depression, anxiety, impulsivity, and alcohol dependence. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous psychological support could be applied as a stress-control program for preventing stress recurrence and post-discharge relapse. Our findings strengthen the link between biomedical science and mental health in rehabilitation treatment for AUD.
