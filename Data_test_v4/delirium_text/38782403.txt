38782403|t|Comparative Metabolomics and Microbiome Analysis of Ethanol versus OMNImet/gene GUT Fecal Stabilization.
38782403|a|Metabolites from feces provide important insights into the functionality of the gut microbiome. As immediate freezing is not always feasible in gut microbiome studies, there is a need for sampling protocols that provide the stability of the fecal metabolome and microbiome at room temperature (RT). Here, we investigated the stability of various metabolites and the microbiome (16S rRNA) in feces collected in 95% ethanol (EtOH) and commercially available sample collection kits with specific preservatives OMNImet GUT/OMNIgene GUT. To simulate field-collection scenarios, the samples were stored at different temperatures at varying durations (24 h + 4  C, 24 h RT, 36 h RT, 48 h RT, and 7 days RT) and compared to aliquots immediately frozen at -80  C. We applied several targeted and untargeted metabolomics platforms to measure lipids, polar metabolites, endocannabinoids, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and bile acids (BAs). We found that SCFAs in the nonstabilized samples increased over time, while a stable profile was recorded in sample aliquots stored in 95% EtOH and OMNImet GUT. When comparing the metabolite levels between aliquots stored at room temperature and at +4  C, we detected several changes in microbial metabolites, including multiple BAs and SCFAs. Taken together, we found that storing samples at RT and stabilizing them in 95% EtOH yielded metabolomic results comparable to those from flash freezing. We also found that the overall composition of the microbiome did not vary significantly between different storage types. However, notable differences were observed in the alpha diversity. Altogether, the stability of the metabolome and microbiome in 95% EtOH provided results similar to those of the validated commercial collection kits OMNImet GUT and OMNIgene GUT, respectively.
