38411915|a|Recently, the integrated different interdisciplinary studies derived the environmental solutions of the climate change impacts (e.g., cultivation, wastewater treatment, and managing groundwater resources) (Mesalhy et al. 2020, and Gobashy et al. 2021). Thus, this paper focused on the application of bioremediation to maximize the use of wastewater for new reclamation areas in the Northwest Egyptian desert (New Egyptian Delta (NED). In the NED project, the drainage water samples collected from Nile Delta drains will provide the main unconventional water resources for irrigation through the new Hammam canal. Therefore, three Pleurotus strains were grown moderately on two natural media, the first containing Salvia L. (sage) extract (MDA) and the second containing Thymus vulgaris L. (origanum thymus Kuntze, Thymus collinus Salisb) (TDA) extract replacing potato infusions in standard PDA. Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacquin; Kummer) strain records the highest growth among the three tested fungi on modified media. PO records 4.49 and 4.41 cm on (MDA) and (TDA), respectively. There is a marked decrease in the majority of heavy metal concentrations on sterile drainage water amended with PD broth and inoculated with three tested Pleurotus strains individually. At the end of the incubation period, Pleurotus ostereatus which expressed in abbreviation (PO) are more efficient in the removal of Al, Co, Cr, and Ni by 53.15, 95.87, 58.47, and 85.07%; respectively. Pleurorotus pulmonarius (Fr.) which symbolized (PP) is more potent in the removal of Cd, Si, Sn, Sr, and V by 70.37, 56.59, 41.19, 52.78, and 96.24%; respectively. Pleurotus floridanus (NZOR) which indicated as (PF) is actively over the former species in the removal of Ba, Fe, and Mo by 87.84, 46.67, and 97.34%; respectively. Cu, Mn, Pb, As, and Se could not be detected as the control sample recorded measurements below 0.009 mg L-1. An unexpected increase in Zn among the different treatments was detected from 05.04 to 07.01%.
