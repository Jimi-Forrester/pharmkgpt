37554511|t|Associations Between Dysphagia and Adverse Health Outcomes in Older Adults with Dementia in Intensive Care Units: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
37554511|a|Background: Dysphagia is common in elderly patients with dementia and is one of the common clinical geriatric syndromes. It imposes a heavy burden on patients and their caregivers and is becoming an important public health problem. This study examined the association between dysphagia in older dementia patients in the ICU and the subsequent adverse health outcomes they experience. Patients and Methods: A retrospective analysis of adults (>=65 years) with dementia in ICUs of a Boston tertiary academic medical center was conducted. Using the International Classification of Diseases' Ninth and Tenth Revisions, dementia patients were identified. The study cohort comprised 1009 patients, median age 84.82 years, 56.6% female, predominantly White (72.9%). Patients were grouped based on swallowing function: dysphagia (n=282) and no-dysphagia (n=727). Dysphagia was identified via positive bedside swallowing screening. Primary outcomes were 90- and 180-day mortality, secondary outcomes included aspiration pneumonia, pressure injury, and delirium. Cohort characteristics were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum and chi-square tests. Dysphagia and outcomes correlations were examined via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox proportional-hazards regression models, logistic regression models, and subgroup analysis. Results: After adjusting for covariates, the results from multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression indicated that dysphagia was significantly associated with increased 90-day (HR=1.36, 95% CI=1.07-1.73, E-value=1.78) and 180-day (HR=1.47, 95% CI=1.18-1.82, E-value=1.94) mortality; the multifactorial logistic regression results indicated that dysphagia was associated with significant increases in pressure injury (OR=1.58, 95% CI=1.11-2.23, E-value=1.83) and aspiration pneumonia occurrence (OR=4.04, 95% CI=2.72-6.01, E-value=7.54), but was not significantly associated with delirium prevalence (OR=1.27, 95% CI=0.93-1.74). Conclusion: Dysphagia is likely to increase the risk of adverse health outcomes in older adults with dementia in ICU, and these adverse outcomes mostly include 90- and 180-day mortality, aspiration pneumonia, and pressure injury.
