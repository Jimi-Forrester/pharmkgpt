38375960|a|INTRODUCTION: We address the extent to which adolescent cognition predicts dementia risk in later life, mediated by educational attainment and occupational complexity. METHODS: Using data from Project Talent Aging Study (PTAS), we fitted two structural equation models to test whether adolescent cognition predicts cognitive impairment (CI) and Ascertain Dementia 8 (AD8) status simultaneously (NCognitive Assessment  = 2477) and AD8 alone (NQuestionnaire  = 6491) 60 years later, mediated by education and occupational complexity. Co-twin control analysis examined 82 discordant pairs for CI/AD8. RESULTS: Education partially mediated the effect of adolescent cognition on CI in the cognitive assessment aample and AD8 in the questionnaire sample (Ps < 0.001). Within twin pairs, differences in adolescent cognition were small, but intrapair differences in education predicted CI status. DISCUSSION: Adolescent cognition predicted dementia risk 60 years later, partially mediated through education. Educational attainment, but not occupational complexity, contributes to CI risk beyond its role as a mediator of adolescent cognition, further supported by the co-twin analyses. HIGHLIGHTS: Project Talent Aging Study follows enrollees from high school for nearly 60 years. General cognitive ability in high school predicts later-life cognitive impairment. Low education is a risk partially due to its association with cognitive ability.
