28731446|t|Effect of APOE Genotype on Synaptic Proteins in Earlier Adult Life.
28731446|a|BACKGROUND: Possession of APOEe4 is a strong risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease and is associated with loss of synaptic proteins in the elderly even in the absence of Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that e4 allele possession in non-demented adults aged under-75 would also be associated with alterations in the levels of synaptic proteins. METHODS: We measured synaptophysin, PSD95, drebrin, SNAP-25, and septin 7 by ELISA in hippocampus and superior temporal gyrus from 103 adults aged <75 without dementia. Corresponding gene expression was measured by RT-PCR. RESULTS: There was no evidence that e4 affected levels of the proteins measured. Instead we found an increase in post-synaptic proteins in the hippocampi of those with an e32 genotype. The evidence was strongest for drebrin (p = 0.011). There was some evidence of increased synaptic protein gene expression in e4 carriers. CONCLUSIONS: People with an APOEe32 genotype have a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease. It may be relevant that they have a higher level of post-synaptic proteins in the hippocampus even in earlier adulthood.
