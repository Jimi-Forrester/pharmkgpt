34966491|t|Outcomes in Nonagenarians with Hip Fractures Treated Conservatively and Surgically.
34966491|a|INTRODUCTION: We aimed to assess the clinical outcomes in nonagenarians following a hip fracture. We also further investigated the factors that influence these outcomes, such as method of treatment (operative versus conservative), co-morbidities, and pre-morbid function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 65 nonagenarians that were identifiable from our hospital hip fracture database. We reviewed various parameters of these patients admitted after sustaining a hip fracture (neck of femur or intertrochanteric) and investigated how these parameters affected patient outcomes. The main outcomes studied were: inpatient morbidity, and mortality at one year. RESULTS: Inpatient morbidity was more likely in patients with an ASA grade of 3 to 5. Urinary tract infection was the most common medical complication. The 1-year mortality was 15.4% and was significantly influenced by advancing age. Surgically managed patients had a 1-year mortality rate (14.3%) slightly less than non-operative patients (17.4%). Post injury mobility was significantly better in those who received operative treatment with 63% of surgical cases regaining ambulatory status versus 7% of conservatively managed patients. CONCLUSIONS: We presented the outcomes of hip fractures in an extreme age group in the population. In nonagenarians with hip fractures surgery was associated with a 1-year mortality rate of 14.3% which is comparable to the general hip fracture population and less than the mortality rate of conservatively managed patients (17.4%). The primary advantage of surgery would be that two-thirds of patients return to ambulatory status. This information is useful to counsel patients and their families especially since the elderly are often more fearful of surgical intervention.
