25587364|t|Anesthesia for ORL surgery in children.
25587364|a|ORL procedures are the most common operations in children - an optimal anesthetic management provides an uncomplicated, safe perioperative process with as little discomfort for the child as possible. Children at risk must already be identified preoperatively: the combination of ORL surgery, airway susceptibility and age below 3 years can increase the risk of perioperative respiratory adverse events. Postoperatively, it is important to prevent complications such as pain and PONV by dedicated prevention and treatment strategies, as well as to recognize and treat respiratory or circulatory complications competently. Interdisciplinary guidelines and agreements as well as the overall competence of the team have the potential to improve patient safety and outcome in children.
