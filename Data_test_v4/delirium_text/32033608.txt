32033608|t|Leptin and psychiatric illnesses: does leptin play a role in antipsychotic-induced weight gain?
32033608|a|Antipsychotic-induced weight gain is the most prevalent somatic adverse event occurring in patients treated by antipsychotics, especially atypical antipsychotics. It is of particular interest because of its repercussion on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality especially now that the use of second-generation antipsychotics has been extended to other mental health illnesses such as bipolar disorders and major depressive disorder. The mechanism underlying antipsychotics-induced weight gain is still poorly understood despite a significant amount of work on the topic. Recently, there has been an on-going debate of tremendous research interest on the relationship between antipsychotic-induced weight gain and body weight regulatory hormones such as leptin. Given that, researchers have brought to light the question of leptin's role in antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Here we summarize and discuss the existing evidence on the link between leptin and weight gain related to antipsychotic drugs, especially atypical antipsychotics.
