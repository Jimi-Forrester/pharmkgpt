35998821|a|The formation of amyloid-ss peptides (Ass), that accumulate in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains, involves proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) firstly by ss-secretase (BACE1). Since BACE1 cleaves a plethora of other substrates, in this work we investigated whether the proteolysis and/or distribution of other BACE1 substrates, such as seizure protein 6 (Sez6) and seizure 6-like protein (Sez6L), is altered in AD. To test this we used 5xFAD mouse model brains that show an early accumulation of Ass plaques already at 2-months of age. Here we show for the first time that accumulation of BACE1 in peri-plaque regions and its enhanced levels in AD brains does not affect proteolysis of BACE1 substrates other than APP, such as Sez6 and Sez6L. We observed altered distribution of Sez6 and Sez6L in the area of Ass plaques in 5xFAD brains which is distinct to that of APP, BACE1 and/or LAMP1, suggesting different localization and/or function of these BACE1 substrates. While it is necessary to further elucidate the potential role that this may play in the course of AD, it is likely that Ass-targeted therapies may have beneficial effects against accumulation and/or altered distribution of BACE1 and its substrates, in addition to APP.
