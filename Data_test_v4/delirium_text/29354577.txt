29354577|a|OBJECTIVE: To identify the prevalence of malnutrition in elderly hip fracture and to investigate the relationship between hip fracture patients and malnutrition on functional recovery and mortality. METHODS: All hip fracture patients age >65 years admitted to a rehabilitation unit were recruited from July 2015 to June 2016. Nutritional status was assessed by Mini-Nutritional Assessment Short-Form (MNA-SF) within 72 hours of admission. Patients were reassessed at 6 months for functional status and place of residence. Length of hospital stay, in-patient mortality rate, and 6-month mortality rate were also recorded. RESULTS: There were 218 patients recruited. The mean age was 83.5+-7.5 years. According the MNA-SF, 46 (21.1%) were well nourished, 115 (52.6%) were at risk of malnutrition, and 57 (26.1%) were malnourished. Malnourished individuals were significantly older, had lower Mini-Mental State Examination score and albumin level, were functionally more dependent and were more likely to reside in elderly care facility. A higher proportion of elderly care residents were at-risk or were malnourished on admission, discharge and at 6 months. Functional recovery was slower in the malnourished group. In-patient mortality was higher in malnourished individuals compared to those at risk of malnourishment and well-nourished individuals. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition is high and is associated with poor functional recovery and elderly care placement. Residents of elderly care facilities are especially at risk due a higher prevalence of malnourishment. Health authorities are encouraged to evaluate the dietetic component in elderly care facilities and initiate nutrition supplementation in their planning of healthcare resources.
