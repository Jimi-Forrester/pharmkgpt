30592628|t|A Case of Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia.
30592628|a|We report the case of a 76 year old lady with metastatic breast cancer, who presented to a hospice in severe distress from uncontrolled pain despite an increase in her opioid dose, alongside generalised hypersensitivity and delirium. The clinical presentation suggested opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). After reduction of the opioid dose, our patient significantly improved to the extent she was discharged home a few weeks later. This report aims to increase awareness of OIH, a clinical phenomenon which remains poorly understood and probably under recognised.
