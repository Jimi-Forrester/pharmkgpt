37687260|t|Exploring the Biomedical Applications of Biosynthesized Silver Nanoparticles Using Perilla frutescens Flavonoid Extract: Antibacterial, Antioxidant, and Cell Toxicity Properties against Colon Cancer Cells.
37687260|a|The present study reports the biomimetic synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using a simple, cost effective and eco-friendly method. In this method, the flavonoid extract of Perilla frutescens (PFFE) was used as a bioreduction agent for the reduction of metallic silver into nanosilver, called P. frutescens flavonoid extract silver nanoparticles (PFFE-AgNPs). The Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectrum showed a characteristic absorption peak at 440 nm that confirmed the synthesis of PFFE-AgNPs. A Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (FTIR) analysis of the PFFE-AgNPs revealed that flavonoids are involved in the bioreduction and capping processes. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns confirmed the face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure of PFFE-AgNPs. A transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis indicated that the synthesized PFFE-AgNPs are 20 to 70 nm in size with spherical morphology and without any aggregation. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies showed that the average hydrodynamic size was 44 nm. A polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.321 denotes the monodispersed nature of PFFE-AgNPs. Further, a highly negative surface charge or zeta potential value (-30 mV) indicates the repulsion, non-aggregation, and stability of PFFE-AgNPs. PFFE-AgNPs showed cytotoxic effects against cancer cell lines, including human colon carcinoma (COLO205) and mouse melanoma (B16F10), with IC50 concentrations of 59.57 and 69.33 mug/mL, respectively. PFFE-AgNPs showed a significant inhibition of both Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogens and Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Salmonella typhi and Acinetobacter baumannii) bacteria pathogens. PFFE-AgNPs exhibited in vitro antioxidant activity by quenching 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) free radicals with IC50 values of 72.81 and 92.48 microg/mL, respectively. In this study, we also explained the plausible mechanisms of the biosynthesis, anticancer, and antibacterial effects of PFFE-AgNPs. Overall, these findings suggest that PFFE-AgNPs have potential as a multi-functional nanomaterial for biomedical applications, particularly in cancer therapy and infection control. However, it is important to note that further research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of these nanoparticles in vivo, as well as to explore their potential in other areas of medicine.
