37901131|t|Persistent Hiccups after Subthalamic Nucleus Deep Brain Stimulator Implantation for Parkinson's Disease: Case Report and Literature Review.
37901131|a|Hiccups are mediated by a reflex arc that consists of afferent, central, and efferent components. The structures involved in the central component have not been fully elucidated, although several brainstem structures have been implicated, including the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Accordingly, Parkinson's disease (PD), a disease defined by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the STN, has an interesting, although unspecified, relationship to hiccups. Hiccups have been described in association with PD and the use of dopaminergic medications. Interestingly, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the STN appears to be implicated in the pathogenesis of hiccups as well. There have been sporadic reports of hiccups occurring in conjunction with STN-DBS. We present a case of hiccups occurring after STN-DBS for PD in a 65-year-old man. STN-DBS significantly improved his PD symptoms; however, he developed persistent and daily hiccups. As of writing, 24 months after surgery, the patient experiences hiccups several times per day with no associated gastrointestinal complaints and with significant improvement in his PD symptoms. This report describes the case details and summarizes the existing literature describing hiccups in patients undergoing surgical treatment for PD.
