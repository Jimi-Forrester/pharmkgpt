15991990|a|Neural cell transplantation is an emerging therapy that may provide an effective treatment for neurodegenerative disorders. The most extensive work with neural transplants has been carried out for Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. However, intensive efforts are also being made for the treatment of other neurological indications, such as spinal cord repair, stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease), to name just a few. The major barrier for the successful application of cells as therapeutics is achieving long-term survival and function. The CNS has proven to be ideal for transplantation, in part because immune rejection is attenuated in the CNS compared to peripheral locations. However, some form of immunosuppression is desirable for optimal allograft survival and required for xenograft survival. This review will focus on the challenges of restoring function to something as intricate as the CNS and on the limitations imposed by this complexity on any cellular therapeutic.
