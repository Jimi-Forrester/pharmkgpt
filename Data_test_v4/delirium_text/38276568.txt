38276568|a|Extensive research has been dedicated to develop compounds that can target multiple aspects of Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment due to a growing understanding of AD's complex multifaceted nature and various interconnected pathological pathways. In the present study, a series of biological assays were performed to evaluate the potential of the tryptamine analogues synthesized earlier in our lab as multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs) for AD. To assess the inhibitory effects of the compounds, various in vitro assays were employed. Three compounds, SR42, SR25, and SR10, displayed significant AChE inhibitory activity, with IC50 values of 0.70 microM, 0.17 microM, and 1.00 microM, respectively. These values superseded the standard drug donepezil (1.96 microM). In the MAO-B inhibition assay, SR42 (IC50 = 43.21 microM) demonstrated superior inhibitory effects as compared to tryptamine and other derivatives. Moreover, SR22 (84.08%), SR24 (79.30%), and SR42 (75.16%) exhibited notable percent inhibition against the COX-2 enzyme at a tested concentration of 100 microM. To gain insights into their binding mode and to validate the biological results, molecular docking studies were conducted. Overall, the results suggest that SR42, a 4,5 nitro-benzoyl derivative of tryptamine, exhibited significant potential as a MTDL and warrants further investigation for the development of anti-Alzheimer agents.
