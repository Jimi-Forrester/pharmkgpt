26466503|a|BACKGROUND: Perioperative delirium increases the morbidity and mortality in elderly patients. The present retrospective study was carried out to evaluate whether desflurane or sevoflurane has influence on the incidence of perioperative delirium. METHODS: In 30 patients above 75 years of age undergoing surgical procedure, anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (group S), and with desflurane (group D). The incidence of perioperative delirium was obtained retrospectively from their medical chart The delirium was diagnosed with the Richmond agitation-sedation scale. RESULTS: The incidence of perioperative delirium on postoperative day (POD) 1-3 was not significantly different between group D and group S. The patients in group D were discharged earlier about 10 days compared with those group S. CONCLUSIONS: Desflurane anesthesia is same as sevoflurane regarding perioperative delirium in elderly patients. Shorter hospitalization in group D was achieved for 10 days compared with those in group S, due to the lower incidence of delirium on POD 3 and 5 in group D.
