38945951|t|NLRP3 inflammasome: a key player in the pathogenesis of life-style disorders.
38945951|a|Proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines play a crucial role in regulating the inflammatory response, which is essential for the proper functioning of our immune system. When infections or threats to the body's defense mechanisms are detected, the innate immune system takes the lead. However, an excessive inflammatory response can lead to the production of high concentrations of cytotoxic molecules, resulting in tissue damage. Inflammasomes are significant contributors to innate immunity, and one of the most extensively studied inflammasome complexes is NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3). NLRP3 has a wide range of recognition mechanisms that streamline immune activation and eliminate pathogens. These cytosolic multiprotein complexes are composed of effector, adaptor, and sensor proteins, which are crucial for identifying intracellular bacterial breakdown products and initiating an innate immune cascade. To understand the diverse behavior of NLRP3 activation and its significance in the development of lifestyle-related diseases, one must delve into the study of the immune response and apoptosis mediated by the release of proinflammatory cytokines. In this review, we briefly explore the immune response in the context of lifestyle associated disorders such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, oral disease, and cardiovascular disease.
