34397597|t|Amyloid and tau positive mild cognitive impairment: clinical and biomarker characteristics of dementia progression.
34397597|a|BACKGROUND: According to the amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration research framework classification, amyloid and tau positive (A+T+) mild cognitive impairment (MCI) individuals are defined as prodromal Alzheimer disease. This study was designed to compare the clinical and biomarker features between A+T+MCI individuals who progressed to progressive MCI (pMCI) and those who remained stable MCI (sMCI), and to identify relevant baseline clinical biomarker and features that could be used to predict progression to dementia within 2 years. METHODS: We stratified 197 A+T+MCI individuals into pMCI (n = 64) and sMCI (n = 133) over 2 years. Demographics and cognitive assessment scores, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and neuroimaging biomarkers (18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography mean standardized uptake value ratios [SUVR] and structural magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) were compared between pMCI and sMCI at baseline, 12- and 24-month follow-up. Logistic regression models then were used to evaluate clinical baseline and biomarker features that predicted dementia progression in A+T+MCI. RESULTS: pMCI individuals had higher mean 18F-florbetapir SUVR, CSF total-tau (t-tau), and p-tau181P than those in sMCI individuals. pMCI individuals performed poorer in cognitive assessments, both global and domain specific (memory, executive, language, attention, and visuospatial skills) than sMCI. At baseline, there were significant differences in regions of interest of structural MRI between the two groups, including bilateral amygdala, hippocampus and entorhinal, bilateral inferior lateral ventricle, left superior and middle temporal, left posterior and caudal anterior cingulate (P < 0.05). Baseline CSF t-tau levels and cognitive scores of Montreal cognitive assessment, functional assessment questionnaire, and everyday cognition by the patient's study partner language domain could predict progression to dementia in A+T+MCI within 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: In future clinical trials, specific CSF and cognitive measures that predict dementia progression in A+T+MCI might be useful risk factors for assessing the risk of dementia progression.
