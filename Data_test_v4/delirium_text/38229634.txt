38229634|a|Objective: To study the prevalence of cognitive impairment in survivors of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Methods: Survivors of spontaneous ICH were followed up in the neurology outpatient department when they reported for follow-up after 6 months. Neuroimaging records at the onset and at follow-up visits are studied for the location of ICH, volume of ICH, intraventricular extension, and hydrocephalus. The volume of ICH is calculated by ABC/2 method on a CT scan. All patients underwent cognitive assessment with Addenbrooke's cognitive examination ACE III and were categorized as patients having cognitive impairment (or) no cognitive impairment. Results: A total of 120 patients were studied, out of which 77 (64%) are males and 43 (36%) are females with age groups ranging from 26 to 75 years. In the study population, the mean age was found to be 62.3 years. Specifically, the mean age for males was 56.9 years, while for females it was 63.4 years. Cognitive impairment was noted in 34 of 120 patients (28%) during 6 to 12 months of examination, of which 11 of 19 were in lobar location, 21 of 94 were in sub-cortical location, and 2 of 7 were in infratentorial location. Conclusion: It was found that 28% of survivors of ICH were cognitively impaired. Hence, it is essential to assess cognition in post-ICH patients during follow-up, so that suitable adjustments can be made in their employment, and also in educating family members in providing a good quality of life.
