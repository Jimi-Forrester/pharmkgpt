38027213|t|Causal effects of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease on cerebral cortical structure: a Mendelian randomization analysis.
38027213|a|Background: Previous studies have highlighted changes in the cerebral cortical structure and cognitive function among nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. However, the impact of NAFLD on cerebral cortical structure and specific affected brain regions remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to explore the potential causal relationship between NAFLD and cerebral cortical structure. Methods: We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study using genetic predictors of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), NAFLD, and percent liver fat (PLF) and combined them with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from the ENIGMA Consortium. Several methods were used to assess the effect of NAFLD on full cortex and specific brain regions, along with sensitivity analyses. Results: At the global level, PLF nominally decreased SA of full cortex; at the functional level, ALT presented a nominal association with reduced SA of parahippocampal gyrus, TH of pars opercularis, TH of pars orbitalis, and TH of pericalcarine cortex. Besides, NAFLD presented a nominal association with reduced SA of parahippocampal gyrus, TH of pars opercularis, TH of pars triangularis and TH of pericalcarine cortex, but increased TH of entorhinal cortex, lateral orbitofrontal cortex and temporal pole. Furthermore, PLF presented a nominal association with reduced SA of parahippocampal gyrus, TH of pars opercularis, TH of cuneus and lingual gyrus, but increased TH of entorhinal cortex. Conclusion: NAFLD is suggestively associated with atrophy in specific functional regions of the human brain.
