28944565|a|New synthesized series of 9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine derivatives with iodobenzoic acid moiety were studied for their inhibitory activity toward cholinesterase and against beta-amyloid aggregation. All novel molecules 3a-3i interacted with both cholinesterases-acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase-delivered nanomolar IC50 values. The structure-activity relationship showed that N-butyl moiety derivatives are stronger inhibitors toward AChE and BuChE than N-ethyl and N-propyl moieties compounds. The most potent compound toward acetylcholinesterase was inhibitor 3f (IC50  = 31.2 nm), and it was more active than reference drug, tacrine (IC50  = 100.2 nm). Compound 3f showed strong inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase (IC50  = 8.0 nm), also higher than tacrine (IC50  = 16.3 nm). In the kinetic studies, compound 3f revealed mixed type of acetylcholinesterase inhibition. The computer modeling was carried out. The most active compound 3f was confirmed as peripheral anionic site inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. Moreover, molecule 3f inhibited beta-amyloid aggregation (at the concentration 10 mum-24.96% of inhibition, 25 mum-72%, 50 mum-78.44%, and 100 mum-84.92%). Therefore, among all examined, compound 3f is the most promising molecule for further, more detailed research of novel multifunctional agents in the therapy of Alzheimer's disease.
