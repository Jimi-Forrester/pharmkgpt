31003408|a|The inhibitory effects of baijiu vinasse extract and its phenolic acid compounds on the Nepsilon-carboxymethyllysine (CML) formation from dairy food were investigated. The inhibitory effect of the baijiu vinasse extract against CML formation was 43.2% in the casein and D-glucose model, which used 6 mL of the 70% acetone extract at 60  C for 40 min. The HPLC-MS/MS profiles of the vinasse extract indicated that vanillic, chlorogenic, p-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic, ferulic, and syringic acids were seven major phenolic acid compounds. Furthermore, the inhibitory mechanism of the phenolic acid compounds in the model of dairy food was discussed by the trapping and scavenging of glyoxal. The results of this study exhibit that seven major antioxidant phenolic acid compounds may play important roles in the antioxidant activity and CML inhibition of the vinasse extract in a model of dairy foods.
