31083168|t|Delirium induced by tigecycline treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii infection: A case report.
31083168|a|RATIONALE: Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent structurally belong to tetracyclines and covers against many multidrug-resistant organisms. Arising clinical cases reporting its adverse drug reactions have emerged alongside with the increasing off label use globally. By literature review, delirium caused by tigecycline has not been reported yet. We present what we believe to be the first case of tigecycline-induced delirium. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 77-year-old male patient with end-stage renal disease was hospitalized due to acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. DIAGNOSIS: The patient developed delirium after infused with a loading dose of tigecycline for pulmonary infection. INTERVENTIONS: All potential causes inducing delirium were evaluated and the symptoms improved soon after discontinuation of tigecycline. He experienced delirium once again after reusing tigecycline for the exacerbation of the pulmonary infection even without a loading dose. Tigecycline was discontinued and the symptoms quickly relieved. OUTCOMES: According to the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, tigecycline was the probable cause of his delirium. LESSONS: Clinicians should be aware of this potential adverse effect of tigecycline. We recommend that clinicians monitor patients for signs and symptoms of delirium during treatment with tigecycline.
