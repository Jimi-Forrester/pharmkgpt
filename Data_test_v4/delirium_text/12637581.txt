12637581|a|Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been known to reduce risk for Alzheimer's disease. In addition to the anti-inflammatory effects of NSAIDs to block cylooxygenase, it has been shown recently that a subset of NSAIDs selectively inhibits the secretion of highly amyloidogenic Abeta42 from cultured cells, although the molecular target(s) of NSAIDs in reducing the activity of gamma-secretase for Abeta42 generation (gamma(42)-secretase) still remain unknown. Here we show that sulindac sulfide (SSide) directly acts on gamma-secretase and preferentially inhibits the gamma(42)-secretase activity derived from the 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate-solubilized membrane fractions of HeLa cells, in an in vitro gamma-secretase assay using recombinant amyloid beta precursor protein C100 as a substrate. SSide also inhibits activities for the generation of Abeta40 as well as for Notch intracellular domain at higher concentrations. Notably, SSide displayed linear noncompetitive inhibition profiles for gamma(42)-secretase in vitro. Our data suggest that SSide is a direct inhibitor of gamma-secretase that preferentially affects the gamma(42)-secretase activity.
