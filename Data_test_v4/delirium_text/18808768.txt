18808768|a|Given the current developments of therapeutic strategies in the field of neurodegenerative disorders, exact diagnosis, especially at an early stage, is becoming increasingly crucial for optimal patient care. Importantly, the new diagnosis criteria of dementia include functional imagery as well as CSF biomarkers. Proteomics investigations of these CSF biomarkers have produced quite promising results. The interest of CSF analysis resides in the anatomical and pathophysiological characteristics of this fluid. In this article, we will review current proteomics investigations of CSF which have led to the discovery and validation of biomarkers, mainly in the field of neurodegenerative disorders in Alzheimer's disease.
