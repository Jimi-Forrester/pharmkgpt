35729595|t|Periodontal ligament stem cells as a promising therapeutic target for neural damage.
35729595|a|BACKGROUND: The damaged neuronal cells of adult mammalian lack the regenerative ability to replace the neuronal connections. Periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) are the promising source for neuroregenerative applications that can improve the injured microenvironment of the damaged neural system. They provide neuronal progenitors and neurotrophic, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory factors. In this study, we aimed to comprehensively explore the various neuronal differentiation potentials of PDLSCs for application in neural regeneration therapy. MAIN TEXT: PDLSCs have superior potential to differentiate into various neural-like cells through a dedifferentiation stage followed by differentiation process without need for cell division. Diverse combination of nutritional factors can be used to induce the PDLSCs toward neural lineage. PDLSCs when coupled with biomaterials could have significant implications for neural tissue repair. PDLSCs can be a new clinical research target for Alzheimer's disease treatment, multiple sclerosis and cerebral ischemia. Moreover, PDLSCs have beneficial effects on retinal ganglion cell regeneration and photoreceptor survival. PDLSCs can be a great source for the repair of injured peripheral nerve through the expression of several neural growth factors and differentiation into Schwann cells. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, these cells are an appealing source for utilizing in clinical treatment of the neuropathological disorders. Although significant in vitro and in vivo investigations were carried out in order for neural differentiation evaluation of these cells into diverse types of neurons, more preclinical and clinical studies are needed to elucidate their therapeutic potential for neural diseases.
