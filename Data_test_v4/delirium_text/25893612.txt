25893612|a|The transmembrane protease complex gamma-secretase is a key enzyme in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis as it liberates the neurotoxic amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta); however, the mechanism of regulation of its activity in various cell types and subcellular compartments is largely unknown. Several gamma-secretase inhibitors have been developed, but none have been released due to side-effects that appear to arise from reduced processing of Notch, one of many gamma-secretase substrates. Hence, it is desirable to specifically inhibit Abeta production. In our previous studies, we have identified several gamma-secretase-associated proteins (GSAPs) from brain, which affect Abeta production without having any major effects on Notch processing. In the present study using detergent-resistant membranes prepared from brain, we have identified four GSAPs that affect Abeta production to a greater extent than Notch processing. We evaluated the interaction between GSAPs and gamma-secretase in various cell types and their mRNA expression in various human organs. Using an in situ proximity ligation assay, we demonstrated that many GSAPs showed considerably greater interaction with gamma-secretase in neurons than in human embryonic kidney cells stably over-expressing APP, and showed that several GSAPs are highly expressed in human brain. This study underscores the importance of studying protein-protein interactions in relevant cell types, and suggests that reducing Abeta production by interfering with brain- or neuron-specific gamma-secretase/GSAP interactions may reduce the risk of unwanted side-effects associated with treatment of Alzheimer disease.
