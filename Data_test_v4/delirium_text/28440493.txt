28440493|t|The extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway in neurological diseases: A potential therapeutic target (Review).
28440493|a|Signaling pathways are critical modulators of a variety of physiological and pathological processes, and the abnormal activation of some signaling pathways can contribute to disease progression in various conditions. As a result, signaling pathways have emerged as an important tool through which the occurrence and development of diseases can be studied, which may then lead to the development of novel drugs. Accumulating evidence supports a key role for extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling in the embryonic development of the central nervous system (CNS) and in the regulation of adult brain function. ERK1/2, one of the most well characterized members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, regulates a range of processes, from metabolism, motility and inflammation, to cell death and survival. In the nervous system, ERK1/2 regulates synaptic plasticity, brain development and repair as well as memory formation. ERK1/2 is also a potent effector of neuronal death and neuroinflammation in many CNS diseases. This review summarizes recent findings in neurobiological ERK1/2 research, with a special emphasis on findings that clarify our understanding of the processes that regulate the plethora of isoform-specific ERK functions under physiological and pathological conditions. Finally, we suggest some potential therapeutic strategies associated with agents acting on the ERK1/2 signaling to prevent or treat neurological diseases.
