38915544|t|Systemic and targeted activation of Nrf2 reverses doxorubicin-induced cognitive impairments and sensorimotor deficits in mice.
38915544|a|While cancer survivorship has increased due to advances in treatments, chemotherapy often carries long-lived neurotoxic side effects which reduce quality of life. Commonly affected domains include memory, executive function, attention, processing speed and sensorimotor function, colloquially known as chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) or "chemobrain". Oxidative stress and neuroimmune signaling in the brain have been mechanistically linked to the deleterious effects of chemotherapy on cognition and sensorimotor function. With this in mind, we tested if activation of the master regulator of antioxidant response nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) alleviates cognitive and sensorimotor impairments induced by doxorubicin. The FDA-approved systemic Nrf2 activator, diroximel fumarate (DRF) was used, along with our recently developed prodrug 1c which has the advantage of specifically releasing monomethyl fumarate at sites of oxidative stress. DRF and 1c both reversed doxorubicin-induced deficits in executive function, spatial and working memory, as well as decrements in fine motor coordination and grip strength, across both male and female mice. Both treatments reversed doxorubicin-induced loss of synaptic proteins and microglia phenotypic transition in the hippocampus. Doxorubicin-induced myelin damage in the corpus callosum was reversed by both Nrf2 activators. These results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of Nrf2 activators to reverse doxorubicin-induced cognitive impairments, motor incoordination, and associated structural and phenotypic changes in the brain. The localized release of monomethyl fumarate by 1c has the potential to diminish unwanted effects of fumarates while retaining efficacy.
