38732354|a|Inferior frontal sulcal hyperintensities (IFSHs) on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences have been proposed to be indicative of glymphatic dysfunction. Replication studies in large and diverse samples are nonetheless needed to confirm them as an imaging biomarker. We investigated whether IFSHs were tied to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and cognitive performance. We used data from 361 participants along the AD continuum, who were enrolled in the multicentre DELCODE study. The IFSHs were rated visually based on FLAIR magnetic resonance imaging. We performed ordinal regression to examine the relationship between the IFSHs and cerebrospinal fluid-derived amyloid positivity and tau positivity (Abeta42/40 ratio <= 0.08; pTau181 >= 73.65 pg/mL) and linear regression to examine the relationship between cognitive performance (i.e., Mini-Mental State Examination and global cognitive and domain-specific performance) and the IFSHs. We controlled the models for age, sex, years of education, and history of hypertension. The IFSH scores were higher in those participants with amyloid positivity (OR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.05-3.59) but not tau positivity (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 0.57-2.18). The IFSH scores were higher in older participants (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00-1.10) and lower in males compared to females (OR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.26-0.76). We did not find sufficient evidence linking the IFSH scores with cognitive performance after correcting for demographics and AD biomarker positivity. IFSHs may reflect the aberrant accumulation of amyloid beta beyond age.
