27120|t|Ketamine sequelae. Evaluation of the ability of various premedicants to attenuate its psychic actions.
27120|a|The ability of a number of drugs to abolish the emergence delirium and unpleasant dreams which follow anaesthesia induced with 2 mg/kg ketamine was studied. These included three benzodiazepines, droperidol and 'neurolept' combinations and four commonly-used premedicants. When given intravenously 10 min before induction of anaesthesia flunitrazepam and lorazepam gave best results. In a subsequent study, these two benzodiazepines and diazepam were given intravenously 30-40 min before induction of anaesthesia. There was no doubt that 4 mg lorazepam gave the greatest protection and is worthy of further study in this respect.
