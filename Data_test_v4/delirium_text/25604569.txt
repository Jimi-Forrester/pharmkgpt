25604569|a|BACKGROUND: Alcohol hallucinosis is a rare complication of chronic alcohol abuse characterized by the acute onset of hallucinations during or after an episode of alcohol use. The hallucinations may persist for a long time, due to which the clinical picture can be mistaken for a disorder on the schizophrenia spectrum. The prognosis tends to be favourable, although untreated cases are associated with a considerable mortality risk (37% in eight years). CASE DESCRIPTION: A 38-year-old male was admitted to a psychiatric hospital with hallucinations of acute onset during alcohol abuse which persisted for two months of abstinence. The patient experienced visual, auditory and tactile hallucinations during which time his consciousness, attention, orientation and higher cognitive functions remained intact. Somatic and neuroimaging investigations showed no abnormalities. The patient partially recovered on treatment with haloperidol. CONCLUSION: If hallucinations are experienced during or after a period of alcohol abuse, the diagnosis of alcohol hallucinosis should be considered. The diagnosis must be distinguished from delirium tremens and schizophrenia spectrum disorder as treatment and prognosis are essentially different.
