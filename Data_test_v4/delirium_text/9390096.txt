9390096|t|Behavioral and pharmacologic treatment of delirium.
9390096|a|Delirium is an acute confusional state with a fluctuating course. Since the syndrome of delirium is associated with derangements of cognition, attention and level of consciousness, it can cause behaviors that are difficult to manage. Hallucinations, agitation, insomnia and anxiety are common in the delirious patient. Behavioral and pharmacologic interventions can be used while the underlying etiology of delirium is sought. Nonpharmacologic measures include frequent reassurance, environmental cues to reorient the patient and the judicious use of physical restraints. Haloperidol, which has negligible anticholinergic effects, is the drug most often used to treat the symptoms of delirium. Short-acting benzodiazepines may be useful in patients with delirium caused by alcohol withdrawal, but these agents may cause increased agitation in elderly patients and patients with hepatic dysfunction.
