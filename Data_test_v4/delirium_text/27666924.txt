27666924|t|Integrated microRNA and protein expression analysis reveals novel microRNA regulation of targets in fetal down syndrome.
27666924|a|Down syndrome (DS) is caused by trisomy of human chromosome 21 and is associated with a number of deleterious phenotypes. To investigate the role of microRNA (miRNA) in the regulation of DS, high-throughput Illumina sequencing technology and isobaric tagging for relative and absolute protein quantification analysis were utilized for simultaneous expression profiling of miRNA and protein in fetuses with DS and normal fetuses. A total of 344 miRNAs were associated with DS. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses were used to investigate the proteins found to be differentially expressed. Functionally important miRNAs were determined by identifying enriched or depleted targets in the transcript and the protein expression levels were consistent with miRNA regulation. The results indicated that GRB2, TMSB10, RUVBL2, the hsa-miR-329 and hsa-miR-27b, hsa-miR-27a targets, and MAPK1, PTPN11, ACTA2 and PTK2 or other differentially expressed proteins were connected with each other directly or indirectly. Integrative analysis of miRNAs and proteins provided an expansive view of the molecular signaling pathways in DS.
