36557841|t|Nanodelivery of Dietary Polyphenols for Therapeutic Applications.
36557841|a|Advancement in nanotechnology has unleashed the therapeutic potentials of dietary polyphenols by enhancing bioavailability, improving biological half-life, and allowing site-specific drug delivery. In this review, through citation of relevant literature reports, we discuss the application of nano-pharmaceutical formulations, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, nano-emulsions, nano-crystals, nano-polymersomes, liposomes, ethosomes, phytosomes, and invasomes for dietary polyphenols. Following this, we highlight important studies concerning different combinations of nano formulations with dietary polyphenols (also known as nanophytopolyphenols). We also provide nano-formulation paradigms for enhancing the physicochemical properties of dietary polyphenols. Finally, we highlight the latest patents that were granted on nano-formulations of dietary polyphenols. Based on our review, we observe that nanosized delivery of herbal constituents, spices, and dietary supplements have the ability to improve biological processes and address issues connected with herbal treatments.
