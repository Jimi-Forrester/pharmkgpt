34198582|a|A large body of clinical and nonclinical evidence supports the role of neurotoxic soluble beta amyloid (amyloid, Abeta) oligomers as upstream pathogenic drivers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent late-stage trials in AD that have evaluated agents targeting distinct species of Abeta provide compelling evidence that inhibition of Abeta oligomer toxicity represents an effective approach to slow or stop disease progression: (1) only agents that target soluble Abeta oligomers show clinical efficacy in AD patients; (2) clearance of amyloid plaque does not correlate with clinical improvements; (3) agents that predominantly target amyloid monomers or plaque failed to show clinical effects; and (4) in positive trials, efficacy is greater in carriers of the epsilon4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE4), who are known to have higher brain concentrations of Abeta oligomers. These trials also show that inhibiting Abeta neurotoxicity leads to a reduction in tau pathology, suggesting a pathogenic sequence of events where amyloid toxicity drives an increase in tau formation and deposition. The late-stage agents with positive clinical or biomarker data include four antibodies that engage Abeta oligomers (aducanumab, lecanemab, gantenerumab, and donanemab) and ALZ-801, an oral agent that fully blocks the formation of Abeta oligomers at the clinical dose.
