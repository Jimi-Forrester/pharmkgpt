33973880|t|An Agitated Patient With COVID-19 Infection and Early-onset Alzheimer Disease.
33973880|a|Encephalopathy, delirium, and agitation are documented symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection, but research into the management of agitation in the setting of COVID-19 and pre-existing neuropsychiatric disease is ongoing. We present a 55-year-old male patient with early-onset Alzheimer disease and deteriorating mental and functional status who presented to our institution with agitation and persistent COVID-19 positivity on polymerase chain reaction testing. His agitation was improved through pharmacologic optimization including the avoidance of benzodiazepines and initiation of clonidine and prazosin, which temporally coincided with the resolution of his nearly 2-month long COVID-19 positivity.
