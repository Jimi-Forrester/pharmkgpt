35915279|t|Mediation Effect of Body Mass Index on the Association of Urinary Nickel Exposure with Serum Lipid Profiles.
35915279|a|The objective of this study was to determine the relationship of urinary nickel (U-Ni) exposure to serum lipid profiles and the mediation effect of body mass index (BMI) in a US general population. We analyzed the cross-sectional data from 3517 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2017-March 2020). Multivariable linear regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression were conducted to explore the association of U-Ni with four serum lipids and four lipids-derived indicators. Mediation analysis was performed to examine the effect of BMI on the relationship between U-Ni levels and serum lipid profiles. Compared with the lowest quartile, the beta with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in the highest quartile were - 12.83 (- 19.42, - 6.25) for total cholesterol (TC) (P for trend < 0.001), - 12.76 (- 19.78, - 5.74) for non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) (P for trend = 0.001) and - 0.29 (- 0.51, - 0.07) for TC/HDL-C (P for trend = 0.007) in the fully adjusted model. RCS plots showed the linear association of log2-transformed U-Ni levels with TC, non-HDL-C and TC/HDL-C (P for nonlinearity = 0.294, 0.152, and 0.087, respectively). Besides, BMI decreased monotonically in correlation with increasing U-Ni levels (P for trend < 0.001). Mediation analysis revealed that BMI significantly mediated the relationship of U-Ni to TC, non-HDL-C and TC/HDL-C with mediated proportions of 11.17%, 22.20% and 36.44%, respectively. In summary, our findings suggest that BMI mediates the negative association of U-Ni with TC, non-HDL-C, and TC/HDL-C in the US general population.
