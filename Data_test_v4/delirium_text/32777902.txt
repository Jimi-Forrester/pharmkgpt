32777902|a|The aim of this review is to summarize current studies on the relationship between melatonin and aging. Nowadays, age-related diseases come into prominence, and identifying age-related changes and developing proper therapeutic approaches are counted as some of the major issues regarding community health.  Melatonin is the main hormone of the pineal gland. Melatonin is known to influence many  biological  processes  in  the  body,  including  circadian  rhythms,  the  immune  system,  and    neuroendocrine  and  cardiovascular  functions.Melatoninrhythms  also  reflect  the  biological  process  of  aging.  Aging  is  an  extremely  complex  and  multifactorial  process.  Melatonin levels decline considerably with aging and its decline is associated with several age-related diseases. Aging is closely associated with  oxidative  damage  and  mitochondrial  dysfunction.  Free  radical  reactions  initiated  by  the  mitochondria  constitute  the  inherent  aging process. Melatonin plays a pivotal role in preventing age-related oxidative stress. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) fatality rates increase with chronic diseases and age, where melatonin levels decrease. For this reason, melatonin supplementation in elderly could be beneficial in COVID-19 treatment. Therefore, studies on the usage of melatonin in COVID-19 treatment are needed.
