37719248|a|OBJECTIVE: The emergency department length of stay (EDLOS) is one of the essential parameters of emergency healthcare management efficacy, and prominent factors that contribute to EDLOS are critical in enhancing emergency department (ED) patient care effectiveness, particularly for older patients, which is rarely investigated. METHODS: This single-center, prospective cohort study was performed in the ED of a tertiary care hospital. The patients were classified into two groups according to EDLOS (>=4 h vs. <4 h). The chief complaints, consultant branches, the patients' comorbidities, polypharmacy status, time of presentation, laboratory, imaging investigations, EDLOS, Clinical Frailty Score (CFS) score, mini mental examination test, National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2), consultations, and outcome of the patients were compared with Spearman and Kendall tau-b correlations. RESULTS: During the 30-day study period, a total of 222 geriatric patients were included in the study. The mean age of study patients was 79.13+-9.43 years, and 47.05% of patients were male. The Median EDLOS was 250 (range, 60-1440) min. The patients who arrived on the night shift (p=0.047), who had chronic heart failure (p=0.025), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p=0.03), severe dementia according to the MMSE (p=0.008), higher CFS frailty scores (p=0.03), and higher clinical acuity according to the NEWS2 score, were found to be positively correlated to an EDLOS of >4 h. (p=0.001) Any specialty consultation and specialty consultation number, along with hospitalization, were also positively correlated to an EDLOS of >4 h. (p=0.001). CONCLUSION: High-acuity patients with frailty and dementia are at increased risk for increased EDLOS via consultations. Emergency and consultation physicians should communicate better about which patients are vulnerable to EDLOS case by case, and the patient outcome must be decided as soon as possible.
