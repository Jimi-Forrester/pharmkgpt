38222520|t|Determination of Polyphenolic Profile of Apple Pomace (Malus domestica Golden Delicious Variety) by HPLC-MS.
38222520|a|Apple (Malus domestica Borkh) is an appreciated source of polyphenols. Phenolic compounds are known as natural antioxidants and have a wide range of applications in different industries. Apple pomace has the potential of being an alternative source of polyphenols. To determine the polyphenolic profile of apple pomace, samples from the skin at two different stages of ripening were extracted with 80-20% EtOH-water/acetic acid 5% (S1) and 20-80% EtOH-water/acetic acid 5% (S2) in order to determine the solvent system. Ripe skins extracted with S1 showed a higher total polyphenol content or TPC (1.21 g of polyphenols per 100 g of fresh weight (FW)) than unripe apple skin, being the most effective system tested and a mean degree of polymerization of 2.47. Commercial apple pomace was extracted with S1, resulting in a TPC of 0.5615 +- 0.007 g of polyphenols per 100 g of FW. Meanwhile, the RP-HPLC-MS analysis led to the tentative identification of several polyphenolic compounds.
