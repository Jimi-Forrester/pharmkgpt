36716975|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest neurodegenerative disease with slow progression. Pieces of evidence suggest that the GABAergic system is impaired in the early stage of AD, leading to hippocampal neuron over-activity and further leading to memory and cognitive impairment in patients with AD. However, the precise impairment mechanism of the GABAergic system on the pathogenesis of AD is still unclear. The impairment of neural networks associated with the GABAergic system is tightly associated with AD. Therefore, we describe the roles played by hippocampus-related GABAergic circuits and their impairments in AD neuropathology. In addition, we give our understand on the process from GABAergic circuit impairment to cognitive and memory impairment, since recent studies on astrocyte in AD plays an important role behind cognition dysfunction caused by GABAergic circuit impairment, which helps better understand the GABAergic system and could open up innovative AD therapy.
