29869871|t|The Fate of Nascent APP in Hippocampal Neurons: A Live Cell Imaging Study.
29869871|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is closely associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) because its proteolytic products form amyloid plaques and its mutations are linked to familial AD patients. As a membrane protein, APP is involved in neuronal development and plasticity. However, it remains unclear how nascent APP is distributed and transported to designated membrane compartments to execute its diverse functions. Here, we employed a dual-tagged APP fusion protein in combination with a synaptic vesicle marker to study the surface trafficking and cleavage of APP in hippocampal neurons immediately after its synthesis. Using long-term time-lapse imaging, we found that a considerable amount of nascent APP was directly transported to the somatodendritic surface, from which it propagates to distal neurites. Some APP in the plasma membrane was endocytosed and some was cleaved by alpha-secretase. Hence, we conclude that surface transportation of APP is a major step preceding its proteolytic processing and neuritic distribution.
