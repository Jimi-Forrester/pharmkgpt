15098004|a|Current evidence supports the notion that beta-amyloid deposits or Abeta intermediates may be responsible for the pathogenesis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. In the present work, we have assessed the neuroprotective effect of the chronic intraperitoneal administration of a five-amino-acid beta-sheet breaker peptide (iAbeta5p) on the rat behavioral deficit induced by the intrahippocampal Abeta-fibrils injection. At 1 month after the injection, animals showed a partial reduction of the amyloid deposits formed and a decreased astrocytic response around the injection site. More importantly, we report that following the iAbeta5p treatment, hippocampal-dependent spatial learning paradigms, including the standard Morris water maze and a working memory analysis, showed a significant prevention from impairments induced by Abeta deposits in the dorsal hippocampus. Thus, it is possible that a noninvasive treatment such as the one presented here with beta-sheet breaker peptides may be used as a potential therapy for AD patients.
