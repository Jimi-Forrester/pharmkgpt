25550228|t|Tau aggregation inhibitor therapy: an exploratory phase 2 study in mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease.
25550228|a|BACKGROUND: As tau aggregation pathology correlates with clinical dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a tau aggregation inhibitor (TAI) could have therapeutic utility. Methylthioninium (MT) acts as a selective TAI in vitro and reduces tau pathology in transgenic mouse models. OBJECTIVE: To determine the minimum safe and effective dose of MT required to prevent disease progression on clinical and functional molecular imaging outcomes. METHODS: An exploratory double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding trial of MT (69, 138, and 228 mg/day) was conducted in 321 mild/moderate AD subjects. The primary outcome was change on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) at 24 weeks relative to baseline severity. Effect of treatment on regional cerebral blood flow decline was determined in a sub-study in 135 subjects. After 24 weeks, subjects were re-consented to enter sequential 6- and 12-month blinded extension phases. Registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00515333). RESULTS: At 24 weeks, there were significant treatment benefits in two independent populations at the 138 mg/day dose: in moderate subjects on the ADAS-cog scale (treatment effect: -5.42 units, corrected p = 0.047) and two other clinical scales; in mild subjects on the more sensitive regional cerebral blood flow measure (treatment effect: 1.97%, corrected p < 0.001). With continued treatment for 50 weeks, benefit was seen on the ADAS-cog scale in both mild and moderate subjects. The delivery of the highest dose was impaired due to dose-dependent dissolution and absorption limitations. CONCLUSION: The minimum safe and effective daily MT dose is 138 mg and suggests that further study of MT is warranted in AD.
