19026688|t|Terminal continuation (TC) RNA amplification without second strand synthesis.
19026688|a|Terminal continuation (TC) RNA amplification was developed originally to reproducibly and inexpensively amplify RNA. The TC RNA amplification method has been improved further by obviating second strand DNA synthesis, a cost-effective protocol that takes less time to perform with fewer manipulations required for RNA amplification. Results demonstrate that TC RNA amplification without second strand synthesis does not differ from the original protocol using RNA harvested from mouse brain and from hippocampal neurons obtained via laser capture microdissection from postmortem human brains. The modified TC RNA amplification method can discriminate single cell gene expression profiles between normal control and Alzheimer's disease hippocampal neurons indistinguishable from the original protocol. Thus, TC RNA amplification without second strand synthesis is a reproducible, time- and cost-effective method for RNA amplification from minute amounts of input RNA, and is compatible with microaspiration strategies and subsequent microarray analysis as well as quantitative real-time PCR.
