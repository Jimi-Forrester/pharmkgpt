29173782|t|New Psychoactive Substances in Pediatric Patients.
29173782|a|New psychoactive substances (NPS), namely cannabinoids, cathinones, and opioids, have surged in popularity among school-age children, resulting in serious morbidity and mortality globally. In the last decade, there has been a rapid evolution of NPS resulting in hundreds of new compounds. Little to no evidence for humans is available on most compounds. The clinical presentations of patients intoxicated with cannabinoids and cathinones are highly variable but most commonly present with a sympathomimetic toxidrome, for example, agitation, delirium, and tachycardia. Those with opioids present with a classic opioid toxidrome: coma, dilated pupils, and respiratory failure.
