21647666|t|[Long-term consequences of postoperative delirium].
21647666|a|A patient reported anxiety and sleeping problems 9 months after reconstruction of the anterior floor of the mouth following tumor surgery. These symptoms had been initiated by a postoperative delirium with hallucinations, which had not been detected during its occurrence. One session of psychotherapy 9 months later reduced the symptoms. Patients in intensive care units should be asked and informed about delirium symptoms. This might prevent long-term psychological distress.
