35434405|a|Objectives: This study aimed to describe the rehabilitation characteristics of patients with acute stage coronavirus disease managed with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the intensive care unit. Methods: This retrospective study enrolled coronavirus disease patients who underwent rehabilitation following ECMO between April 21, 2020, and August 20, 2021. The following patient data were evaluated: age, sex, weaning, peak C-reactive protein, lowest albumin level, white blood cell count, use of steroids and muscle relaxants, duration of respiratory management, ECMO management and rehabilitation, Medical Research Council (MRC) score, and Barthel index after sedation and at discharge. Results: ECMO was performed in 20 patients, and 16 were weaned successfully. The median durations of ECMO and respiratory management in survivors were 14.5 and 38 days, respectively. The median MRC scores after sedation and after rehabilitation therapy were 18 and 45, respectively. The median rehabilitation duration after sedation was 14 days. The MRC score after sedation showed significant correlations with the durations of ECMO and intubation. The median Barthel index values after sedation and at discharge were 0 and 30, respectively. Conclusions: Rehabilitation was important for patients with severe coronavirus disease because muscle weakness advanced in proportion with the durations of ECMO and ventilation management in the intensive care unit.
