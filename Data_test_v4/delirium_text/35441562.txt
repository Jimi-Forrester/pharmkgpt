35441562|a|AIM: To analyse the available evidence regarding refractory symptoms to treatment in patients receiving palliative/terminal healthcare. DESIGN: A systematic review of various databases between September and December 2020; Pubmed; Cochrane; Scopus and ScienceDirect. Study eligibility criteria: Studies published between 1st January 2015 and 31st of March 2020, in Spanish, English or Catalan conducted in elderly people or terminal patients. The study included systematic reviews, clinical trials and interventions. RESULTS: The search returned 782 articles, of which 22 articles were finally reviewed. Of the selected articles, 16 were systematic reviews and three were clinical trials. Three refractory symptoms are notable; breathlessness, delirium and existential suffering. There are various therapeutic approaches for the first two symptoms, but palliative sedation seems to be most effective for existential suffering. CONCLUSIONS: Although palliative care enables controlling these symptoms effectively, and following a multidisciplinary approach, there remains a group of patients for whom euthanasia could save foreseeable suffering that is difficult to manage.
