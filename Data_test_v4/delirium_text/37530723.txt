37530723|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pharmacological mechanism of action of SAL on intestinal IR injury using a network pharmacology approach combined with experimental validation. &#160;Methods: We used the TCMSP database and analysis platform and CTD to predict possible target genes of SAL, collected relevant target genes of intestinal IR injury from GeneCards and DisGenet websites, and collected summary data to screen common target genes. Then, the PPI target network was constructed and analyzed by STRING database and Cytoscape 3.8.2 with the above intersecting genes. Then, GO and KEGG pathway analyses were performed and the component-target-pathway network was constructed, followed by the use of molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation to verify the possible binding conformation between SAL and candidate targets to further explore the potential targets of SAL in the treatment of intestinal IR injury. Finally, an in vivo model of mouse superior mesenteric artery ligation was established to assess the anti-intestinal IR injury effect of SAL.</p> &#160;Results: A total of 166 SAL target genes and 1740 disease-related targets were retrieved, and 88 overlapping proteins were obtained as potential therapeutic targets. The pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the pharmacological effects of SAL on intestinal IR injury were anti-hypoxic, anti-inflammatory and metabolic pathway related, and the molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation results showed that the core bioactive components had good binding affinity for TXNIP and AMPK, and the vivo results indicated it.</p>.
