30922360|t|The secreted APP ectodomain sAPPalpha, but not sAPPbeta, protects neurons against Abeta oligomer-induced dendritic spine loss and increased tau phosphorylation.
30922360|a|AIM: The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is endoproteolytically processed to generate either the neurotoxic beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) or the secreted ectodomain APP alpha (sAPPalpha). While neurotrophic properties of sAPPalpha were suggested in several studies, it is still unclear if and how sAPPalpha counteracts pathogenic effects of Abeta. Direct comparisons with sAPPbeta, produced in the Abeta-generating pathway, are missing in order to determine the role of sAPPalpha's carbonyl-terminal end in its possible neuroprotective activity. METHODS: Mouse neuronal primary cultures and hippocampal slices were treated with oligomeric Abeta42. The effects on tau phosphorylation and dendritic spine densities were assessed by western blot and confocal imaging, respectively. Co-administration of either sAPPalpha or sAPPbeta was used to determine activity on Abeta-induced toxicity. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: We found that oligomeric Abeta strongly increased AT8 and AT180 phosphorylation of tau and caused a loss of dendritic spines. SAPPalpha completely abolished Abeta effects whereas sAPPbeta had no such rescue activity. Interestingly, sAPPalpha or sAPPbeta alone neither affected tau phosphorylation nor dendritic spine numbers. Together, our data suggest that sAPPalpha specifically protects neurons against Abeta-dependent toxicity supporting the strategy of activating alpha-secretase-dependent endoproteolytic APP processing to increase sAPPalpha shedding from the neuronal plasma membrane as a therapeutic intervention for the protection of dendritic spines and phospho-tau-dependent toxicity in Alzheimer's disease.
