30510402|a|BACKGROUND: Gene therapy can be an intriguing therapeutic option in wide-ranging neurological disorders. Though nonviral gene carriers represent a safer delivery system to their viral counterparts, a thorough design of such vehicles is crucial to enhance their transfection properties. PURPOSE: This study evaluated the effects of combined use of two nonionic surfactants, poloxamer 188 (P) and polysorbate 80 (P80) into nanovesicles - based on 2,3-di(tetradecyloxy)propan-1-amine cationic lipid (D) - destined for gene delivery to central nervous system cells. METHODS: Niosome formulations without and with poloxamer 188 (DP80 and DPP80, respectively) were prepared by the reverse-phase evaporation technique and characterized in terms of size, surface charge, and morphology. After the addition of pCMS-EGFP plasmid, the binding efficiency to the niosomes was evaluated in agarose gel electrophoresis assays. Additionally, transfection efficiency of complexes was also evaluated in in vitro and in vivo conditions. RESULTS: In vitro experiments on NT2 cells revealed that the complexes based on a surfactant combination (DPP80) enhanced cellular uptake and viability when compared with the DP80 counterparts. Interestingly, DPP80 complexes showed protein expression in glial cells after administration into the cerebral cortices of rats. CONCLUSION: These data provide new insights for glia-centered approach for gene therapy of nervous system disorders using cationic nanovesicles, where nonionic surfactants play a pivotal role.
