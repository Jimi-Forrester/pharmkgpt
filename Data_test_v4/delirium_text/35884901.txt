35884901|t|The Extracellular MicroRNAs on Inflammation: A Literature Review of Rodent Studies.
35884901|a|Inflammation is an indispensable biological process stimulated by infection and injuries. Inflammatory mechanisms related to extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are small membrane structures carrying various molecules, were summarized in this review. Emerging evidence from animal studies has highlighted the role of EVs in modulating inflammatory responses, by transporting various molecules involved in host defense. In this review, we have discussed the role of EV miRNAs in inflammation. Rodent studies associated with extracellular miRNAs in inflammatory diseases, published from 2012 to 2022, were explored from PUBMED, EMBASE, and MEDLINE. A total of 95 studies were reviewed. In summary, EV-associated miRNAs play a key role in various diseases, including organ injury, immune dysfunction, neurological disease, metabolic syndrome, vesicular disease, arthritis, cancer, and other inflammatory diseases. Diverse EV-associated miRNAs regulate inflammasome activation and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels by targeting genes.
