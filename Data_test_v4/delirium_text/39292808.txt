39292808|a|BACKGROUND: Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) is a long-lasting local anesthetic agent that was developed for use in the surgical setting to help manage postoperative pain. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of LB on postoperative pain, function, and overall hospital course in patients with intracapsular hip fractures who were treated with hip hemiarthroplasty. METHODS: This was a single-center, randomized prospective double-blinded study of 50 patients with an isolated intracapsular femoral neck fracture who were treated with hip hemiarthroplasty from 2018 to 2022. The study group consisted of 25 patients who were treated with intraoperative LB and bupivacaine hydrochloride injections, while the control group consisted of 25 patients who were treated with intraoperative bupivacaine hydrochloride injections only. Primary outcomes were a visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain, total morphine milligram equivalents (MME), delirium, and time to ambulation with physical therapy. RESULTS: No significant differences between the study and control groups were found in any of the outcomes measured. Most notably, there were no differences in the average postoperative pain score (VAS, 2.26 versus 2.7; p = 0.34), total MME used postoperatively (11.73 versus 9.98 MME; p = 0.71), and postoperative day of discharge (4.00 versus 3.88 days; p = 0.82). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that use of LB is not associated with substantially improved postoperative pain or function or with a shorter hospital course following hip hemiarthroplasty for a femoral neck fracture. Given the higher cost of LB compared with standard postoperative pain modalities, it is worth questioning its use in the setting of geriatric hip fractures. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level I.
