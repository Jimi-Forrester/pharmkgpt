38026090|t|A Pilot Study to Explore the Improvements in Pulmonary and Cognitive Functions With a Kazoo Intervention Among Middle-Aged and Older Adults in a Rural Community.
38026090|a|Dementia is a leading cause of disability and dependence in older adults worldwide. The aim of this pilot study was to explore the effect of using a kazoo instrument to improve pulmonary function and cognitive reserve in middle-aged and older adults in rural areas. This quasi-experimental study was conducted at two community care stations selected using cluster sampling from a rural district in southern Taiwan. We enrolled 85 middle-aged and older adults who were randomly assigned into self-learner and in-class groups. Both groups received a 6-month kazoo program. Cognitive and pulmonary function were compared before and after the intervention between the two groups. Significantly improved pulmonary function with regards to forced vital capacity (p < .05) was found in the self-learner group, and significantly improved maximum expiratory flow 75% (p < .001) was found in both groups. Mini-Mental State Examination scores significantly improved in the self-learner group (p < .01), but there was no significant change in the in-class group. Our results suggest that community care stations could consider implementing wind instrument programs such as a kazoo to enhance pulmonary function and cognitive reserve in middle-aged and older adults residing in rural areas.
