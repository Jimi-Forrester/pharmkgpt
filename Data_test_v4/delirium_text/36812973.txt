36812973|t|Cellulose/pectin-based materials incorporating Laponite-indole derivative hybrid for oral administration and controlled delivery of the neuroprotective drug.
36812973|a|Bionanocomposite materials based on clays have been designed for oral administration and controlled release of a neuroprotective drug derivative of 5-methylindole, which had featured an innovative pharmacological mechanism for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. This drug was adsorbed in the commercially available Laponite  XLG (Lap). X-ray diffractograms confirmed its intercalation in the interlayer region of the clay. The loaded drug was 62.3 meq/100 g Lap, close to the cation exchange capacity of Lap. Per se toxicity studies and neuroprotective experiments versus the neurotoxin okadaic acid, a potent and selective inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), confirmed that the clay-intercalated drug did not exert toxicity in cell cultures and provided neuroprotection. Release tests of the hybrid material performed in media mimicking the gastrointestinal tract indicated a drug release in acid medium close to 25 %. The hybrid was encapsulated in a micro/nanocellulose matrix and processed as microbeads, with pectin coating for additional protection, to minimize release under acidic conditions. Alternatively, low density materials based on a microcellulose/pectin matrix were evaluated as orodispersible foams showing fast disintegration times, sufficient mechanical resistance for handling, and release profiles in simulated media that confirmed a controlled release of the encapsulated neuroprotective drug.
