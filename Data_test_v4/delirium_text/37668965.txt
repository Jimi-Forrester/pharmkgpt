37668965|a|Accumulating evidence has suggested that the gut microbiome plays an important role in depression. Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK), a next-generation probiotic, shows a beneficial effect on immune and metabolic homeostasis. The relative abundance of AKK was found negatively correlated with depressive symptoms in both clinical and pre-clinical studies. To evaluate the potential antidepressant effect of AKK and explore the possible mechanism, we used chronic alcohol exposure and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) to induce depressive-like behaviors in mice. We found that oral AKK administration significantly reduced the immobility time in the force swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) in the mice with chronic alcohol exposure and the CUMS mice. The sucrose preference in the mice receiving AKK was significantly increased in the sucrose preference test (SPT). More importantly, AKK implantation significantly increased the level of 5-HT in the gut and PFC of both the alcohol exposure mice and the CUMS mice. Furthermore, AKK had inhibited the expression of SERT in the gut but not in the brain for both NIAAA and the CUMS model mice. Interestingly, the expression of cFos in enteric nerves in the gut significantly decreased after AKK administration. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the antidepressant effect of AKK in mice exposed to alcohol exposure and CUMS, with the potential mechanism that AKK implantation might lead to an increased level of 5-HT and inhibited SERT expression in the gut, and might alter the gut-to-brain signal through suppression of enteric nerves activation.
