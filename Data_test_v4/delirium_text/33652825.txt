33652825|t|One Year Trajectory of Caregiver Burden in Parkinson's Disease and Analysis of Gender-Specific Aspects.
33652825|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder that leads to impairments in activities of daily living. In addition to reducing patients' quality of life, this disease also affects caregivers' well-being. Until recently, caregiver burden was mainly assessed by generic questionnaires, which do not take the characteristics of the chronic disease into consideration. In the case of PD, this issue has been addressed by the introduction of the "Parkinson's disease caregiver burden" questionnaire (PDCB). Data on longitudinal trajectories of caregiver burden are still missing in the literature. In this study, we assessed the one-year trajectory of caregiver burden by the PDCB as a disease-specific questionnaire. Further, gender-specific aspects of caregiver burden were analyzed by applying a caregiver task questionnaire. PDCB total score (n = 84 patients and caregivers) did not significantly change from baseline (30.4) to one year at follow-up (31.5). No significant difference was detected between female and male caregivers in global burden and-specific caregiver tasks. Our data showed only a mild increase of caregiver burden in the timeframe of one year. Gender-specific differences do not seem to impact-specific caregiver tasks in the presented study population.
