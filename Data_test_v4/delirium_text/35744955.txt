35744955|a|Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that lacks a cure. The use of plant-derived antioxidant molecules such as those contained in turmeric powder and resveratrol may produce short-term anticonvulsant effects. A total of 42 three-month-old male Wistar rats were divided into six groups (n = 7 in each group): Vehicle (purified water), turmeric (150 and 300 mg/kg, respectively), and resveratrol (30 and 60 mg/kg, respectively), administered per os (p.o.) every 24 h for 35 days. Carbamazepine (300 mg/kg/5 days) was used as a pharmacological control for anticonvulsant activity. At the end of the treatment, status epilepticus was induced using the lithium-pilocarpine model [3 mEq/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.) and 30 mg/kg subcutaneously (s.c.), respectively]. Seizures were evaluated using the Racine scale. The 300 mg/kg of turmeric and 60 mg/kg of resveratrol groups had an increased latency to the first generalized seizure. The groups treated with 150 and 300 mg/kg of turmeric and 60 mg/kg of resveratrol also had an increased latency to status epilepticus and a decreased number of generalized seizures compared to the vehicle group. The chronic administration of turmeric and resveratrol exerts anticonvulsant effects without producing kidney or liver damage. This suggests that both of these natural products of plant origin could work as adjuvants in the treatment of epilepsy.
