26395307|a|COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) may result in cognitive disorders (mainly executive) even without hypoxemia. The aim of this descriptive study was to highlight a deficit in task-switching in non-hypoxemic patient with COPD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer disease (AD). The main judgment criterion was patients' performances on the TMTA and B. COPD patients were recruited via the database (CogDisCo) of the geriatric medicine department at Pitie Salpetriere hospital in Paris. 7 patients had Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 11 mild cognitive impairment (MCI): they were matched for age, sex, MMSE, education level with controls subjects without COPD. There was no significant difference between the two groups. However, patients with COPD and MCI required, on average, an extra 13 seconds compared with patient without COPD for the TMTA and 18 seconds for the TMTB. Patients with COPD and AD needed, on average, an extra 63 seconds for TMTA and 97 seconds for TMTB. The number of errors for the TMTB was the same in the both groups. This preliminary study does not show statistically significant results but the time for achieving TMT was longer in the population with COPD whether AD or MCI. These results encourage us to continue with prospective studies on larger samples.
