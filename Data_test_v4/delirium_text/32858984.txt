32858984|t|Development of Newly Synthesized Chromone Derivatives with High Tumor Specificity against Human Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
32858984|a|Since many anticancer drugs show severe adverse effects such as mucositis, peripheral neurotoxicity, and extravasation, it was crucial to explore new compounds with much reduced adverse effects. Comprehensive investigation with human malignant and nonmalignant cells demonstrated that derivatives of chromone, back-bone structure of flavonoid, showed much higher tumor specificity as compared with three major polyphenols in the natural kingdom, such as lignin-carbohydrate complex, tannin, and flavonoid. A total 291 newly synthesized compounds of 17 groups (consisting of 12 chromones, 2 esters, and 3 amides) gave a wide range of the intensity of tumor specificity, possibly reflecting the fitness for the optimal 3D structure and electric state. Among them, 7-methoxy-3-[(1E)-2-phenylethenyl]-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (compound 22), which belongs to 3-styrylchromones, showed the highest tumor specificity. 22 induced subG1 and G2 + M cell population in human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line, with much less keratinocyte toxicity as compared with doxorubicin and 5-FU. However, 12 active compounds selected did not necessarily induce apoptosis and mitotic arrest. This compound can be used as a lead compound to manufacture more active compound.
