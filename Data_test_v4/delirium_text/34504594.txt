34504594|a|Computer-aided diagnosis systems aim to assist clinicians in the early identification of abnormal signs in order to optimize the interpretation of medical images and increase diagnostic precision. Multiple sclerosis (MS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) are chronic inflammatory, demyelinating diseases affecting the central nervous system. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) techniques have led to novel computational paradigms in MS and CIS imaging designed for automatic segmentation and detection of areas of interest and automatic classification of anatomic structures, as well as optimization of neuroimaging protocols. To this end, there are several publications presenting artificial intelligence-based predictive models aiming to increase diagnostic accuracy and to facilitate optimal clinical management in patients diagnosed with MS and/or CIS. The current study presents a thorough review covering DL techniques that have been applied in MS and CIS during recent years, shedding light on their current advances and limitations.
