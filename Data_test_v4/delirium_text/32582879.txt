32582879|a|OBJECTIVES: The prevalence and burden of SLE in Africa are poorly understood. This health-facility-based retrospective study aimed to describe the frequency and the clinical and immunological characteristics of SLE in Uganda. METHODS: We reviewed clinical notes of patients presenting with rheumatological complaints in two large rheumatology outpatient clinics in Uganda between January 2014 and December 2019. RESULTS: Of the 1019 charts reviewed, 5.5% (56) of the patients had confirmed SLE, with a median age of 29 (range: 14-65) years. The male-to-female ratio was ~1:10, and 19.6% (11/56) of the patients had SLE and RA overlap syndrome. Patients presented with joint pains or swellings (n = 39, 69.6%), typical photosensitive malar rash (n = 34, 60.7%), oral ulceration (n = 23, 41.1%), anaemia (n = 14, 25.0%), hair loss and polyserositis (n = 12, 21.4% each), constitutional symptoms (n = 10, 17.9%), RP (n = 4, 7.1%) or LN (n = 3, 5.4%). ANA and anti-dsDNA autoantibodies were both positive in 25 (75.8%) of the 33 patients with available results. ANA titres were >=1:160, with a median titre of 1:160 (range: 1:160 to 1:3200). Six patients had titres >=1:320. The median dsDNA level was 80 (range: 40-283) IU. Ten patients had results of C3 and C4 complement protein levels and, of these, 4 patients had low C3 levels and 3 had low C4 levels. CONCLUSION: SLE is uncommon among patients presenting with rheumatological complains in Uganda. SLE overlaps with RA in our setting, and a majority of patients present to care with complications.
