28855814|a|Colon cancer is the most common type of cancer and major cause of death worldwide. The detection of colon cancer is difficult in early stages. However, the secretory proteins have been used as ideal biomarker for the detection of colon cancer progress in cancer patients. Serum/tissue protein expression could help general practitioners to identify colon cancer at earlier stages. By this way, we use the biomarkers to evaluate the anticancer drugs and their response to therapy in cancer models. Recently, the biomarker discovery is important in cancer biology and disease management. Also, many measurable specific molecular components have been studied in colon cancer therapeutics. The biomolecules are mainly DNA, RNA, metabolites, enzymes, mRNA, aptamers and proteins. Thus, in this review we demonstrate the important protein biomarker in colon cancer development and molecular identification of protein biomarker discovery.
