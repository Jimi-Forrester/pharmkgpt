35889524|a|Microtubule affinity regulating kinase 4 (MARK4) regulates the mechanism of microtubules by its ability to phosphorylate the microtubule-associated proteins (MAP's). MARK4 is known for its major role in tau phosphorylation via phosphorylating Ser262 residue in the KXGS motif, which results in the detachment of tau from microtubule. In lieu of this vital role in tau pathology, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), MARK4 is a druggable target to treat AD and other neurodegenerative disorders (NDs). There is growing evidence that NDs and diabetes are connected with many pieces of literature demonstrating a high risk of developing AD in diabetic patients. Metformin (Mtf) has been a drug in use against type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for a long time; however, recent studies have established its therapeutic effect in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), namely AD, Parkinson's disease (PD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment. In this study, we have explored the MARK4 inhibitory potential of Mtf, employing in silico and in vitro approaches. Molecular docking demonstrated that Mtf binds to MARK4 with a significant affinity of -6.9 kcal/mol forming interactions with binding pocket's critical residues. Additionally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provided an atomistic insight into the binding of Mtf with MARK4. ATPase assay of MARK4 in the presence of Mtf shows that it inhibits MARK4 with an IC50 = 7.05 microM. The results of the fluorescence binding assay demonstrated significant binding of MARK4 with a binding constant of 0.6 x 106 M-1. The present study provides an additional axis towards the utilization of Mtf as MARK4 inhibitor targeting diabetes with NDs.
