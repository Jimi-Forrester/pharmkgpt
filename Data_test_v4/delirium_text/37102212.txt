37102212|a|INTRODUCTION: Low hemoglobin and anemia are associated with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the associations of other blood cell indices with incident dementia risk and the underlined mechanisms are unknown. METHODS: Three hundred thirteen thousand four hundred forty-eight participants from the UK Biobank were included. Cox and restricted cubic spline models were used to investigate linear and non-linear longitudinal associations. Mendelian randomization analysis was used to identify causal associations. Linear regression models were used to explore potential mechanisms driven by brain structures. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 9.03 years, 6833 participants developed dementia. Eighteen indices were associated with dementia risk regarding erythrocytes, immature erythrocytes, and leukocytes. Anemia was associated with a 56% higher risk of developing dementia. Hemoglobin and red blood cell distribution width were causally associated with AD. Extensive associations exist between most blood cell indices and brain structures. DISCUSSION: These findings consolidated associations between blood cells and dementia. HIGHLIGHT: Anemia was associated with 56% higher risk for all-cause dementia. Hematocrit percentage, mean corpuscular volume, platelet crit, and mean platelet volume had U-shaped associations with incident dementia risk. Hemoglobin (HGB) and red blood cell distribution width had causal effects on Alzheimer's risk. HGB and anemia were associated with brain structure alterations.
