36466745|t|Delirium Screening of Patients on a Neuroscience Step-Down Unit.
36466745|a|This project aimed to identify patients who had experienced a stroke and were at risk for delirium earlier, and implement evidence-based protocols to reduce overall length of stay and mortality. Nurses were motivated to perform screening and implement strategies that benefit patients who had experienced acute stroke. Results suggest early identification and treatment of delirium, use of prevention strategies, and treatment of the underlying etiology can improve patient outcomes and reduce cost of care.
