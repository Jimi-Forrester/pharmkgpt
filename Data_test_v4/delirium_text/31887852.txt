31887852|t|25-Hydroxy vitamin D level is associated with sleep disturbances in patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis: a cross-sectional study
31887852|a|Background/aim: Deficient levels of vitamin D are an important factor in the pathogenesis of some neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and depression status and sleep disorders of patients on dialysis. Materials and methods: In this cross-sectional study, 121 hemodialysis patients were enrolled. All patients had been on hemodialysis for at least six months at the time of the study. Sleep quality and depression status were measured by using specific inventories. All the patients filled out Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and gave blood samples. Vitamin D levels were measured for 121 patients, and statistical analysis was done by using SPSS. Results: Regression analyses demonstrated that low levels of 25(OH)D and high BDI score were independent risk factors for poor sleep quality [ORs were 0.668 (0.566-0.789), 1.080 (1.001-1.164), and 1.080 (1.001-1.164), respectively]. Conclusion: Our  results  suggest  that  deficiency  of  25(OH)D  is  an  important  independent  risk  factor  for  poor  sleep  quality  in  hemodialysis patients.
