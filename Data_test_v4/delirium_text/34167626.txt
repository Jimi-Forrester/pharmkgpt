34167626|t|Silibinin-Albumin Nanoparticles: Characterization and Biological Evaluation Against Oxidative Stress-Stimulated Neurotoxicity Associated with Alzheimer's Disease.
34167626|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is strongly associated with oxidative stress which can damage neural cells. Silibinin has shown potential antioxidative effects. However, due to its low solubility in water, silibinin provides low biological activity and bioavailability. Therefore, to increase its pharmacological effects, silibilin was encapsulated into human serum albumin (HSA) nanoparticles and well-characterized by DLS and TEM techniques. The antioxidant activity of silibinin-HSA nanoparticles was evaluated on LPS-induced oxidative stress in neuron-like cells (SH-SY5Y) through MTT, antioxidant activity and apoptotic assay. It was shown that the mean diameter of HSA and silibinin-HSA nanoparticles were 88 and 105 nm, respectively with a drug loading of 24.08%, drug encapsulation rate of 94.72%, and the yield of silibinin-HSA nanoparticles of around 83.41% and the HSA nano-formulation released silibinin for 15 h. The results displayed that cell viability was reduced by LPS (10 mug/mL), who's also determined to stimulate oxidative stress and apoptosis. However, co-incubation of cells with silibinin (50 mug/mL) or silibinin-HSA nanoparticles led to the recovery of cell viability, activation of SOD and CAT, increase of GSH content, and reduction of ROS level, Caspase-3 activity and fragmentation of DNA. It was also indicated that the neuroprotective and antioxidant activities of silibinin-HAS nanoparticles was greater than free silibinin, indicating that using albumin can be a potential formulation approach for improving the antioxidant efficacy of silibinin.
