36943473|t|Novel oral medications for retinal disease: an update on clinical development.
36943473|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Intravitreal and periocular injections for retinal disease provide a targeted delivery of medication to the eye. However, given risks of injections, including endophthalmitis, pain and treatment burden for both patients and retina specialists, there has been significant interest and effort in developing oral medications for the management of retinal disease. This article provides clinical and preclinical details of new oral medications in the pipeline for management of retinal disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Several new oral medications show clinical and preclinical promise for the management of retinal disease, including macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and Stargardt disease. SUMMARY: Oral medications provide promise for treating retinal disease, possibly increasing compliance, and reducing side effects of intravitreal or periocular injections. However, difficulties in this approach include systemic side effects and efficacy targeting the eye. There are multiple medications that are currently under investigation with the potential to act as stand-alone treatment or as an adjunct treatment for management of retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration and Stargardt disease.
