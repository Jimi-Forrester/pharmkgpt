33525656|a|Dementia is one of the most common health problems affecting older adults, and the population with dementia is growing. Dementia refers to a comprehensive syndrome rather than a specific disease and is characterized by the loss of cognitive abilities. Many factors are related to dementia, such as aging, genetic profile, systemic vascular disease, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity. As the causes and types of dementia are diverse, personalized healthcare is required. In this review, we first summarize various diagnostic approaches associated with dementia. Particularly, clinical diagnosis methods, biomarkers, neuroimaging, and digital biomarkers based on advances in data science and wearable devices are comprehensively reviewed. We then discuss three effective approaches to treating dementia, including engineering design, exercise, and diet. In the engineering design section, recent advances in monitoring and drug delivery systems for dementia are introduced. Additionally, we describe the effects of exercise on the treatment of dementia, especially focusing on the effects of aerobic and resistance training on cognitive function, and the effects of diets such as the Mediterranean diet and ketogenic diet on dementia.
