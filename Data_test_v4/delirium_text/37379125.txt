37379125|t|A network pharmacology-based treatment analysis of luteolin for regulating pyroptosis in acute lung injury.
37379125|a|BACKGROUND: Acute lung injury (ALI) and its severe manifestation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, are complicated pulmonary inflammatory conditions for which standard therapeutics are still not well established. Although increasing research has indicated the anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antioxidant effects of luteolin, especially in lung diseases, the molecular mechanisms underlying luteolin treatment remain largely unclear. METHODS: The potential targets of luteolin in ALI were explored using a network pharmacology-based strategy and further validated in a clinical database. The relevant targets of luteolin and ALI were first obtained, and the key target genes were analyzed using a protein-protein interaction network, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses. The targets of luteolin and ALI were then combined to ascertain the relevant pyroptosis targets, followed by Gene Ontology analysis of core genes and molecular docking of key active compounds to the anti-pyroptosis targets of luteolin in resolving ALI. The expression of the obtained genes was verified using the Gene Expression Omnibus database. In vivo and in vitro experiments were performed to explore the potential therapeutic effects and mechanisms of action of luteolin against ALI. RESULTS: Fifty key genes and 109 luteolin pathways for ALI treatment were identified through network pharmacology. Key target genes of luteolin for treating ALI via pyroptosis were identified. The most significant target genes of luteolin in ALI resolution included AKT1, NOS2, and CTSG. Compared with controls, patients with ALI had lower AKT1 expression and higher CTSG expression. Luteolin simply reduced systemic inflammation and lung tissue damage in septic mice. Furthermore, we blocked AKT1 expression and found luteolin reduced the degree of lung injury and affected NOS2 levels. CONCLUSION: As demonstrated by a network pharmacology approach, luteolin may exert an anti-pyroptosis effect on ALI via AKT1, NOS2, and CTSG.
