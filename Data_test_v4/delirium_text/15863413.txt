15863413|t|The Caregivers for Alzheimer's disease Problems Scale (CAPS): development of a new scale within the LASER-AD study.
15863413|a|BACKGROUND: we developed the Caregivers for Alzheimer's disease Problems Scale (CAPS) comprising common risk factors for anxiety and depression for family carers of people with dementia. OBJECTIVE: to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the CAPS in order to measure its usefulness in identifying dementia caregivers at risk of anxiety and depression and therefore whether it identifies clinically relevant areas for intervention or highlights the need for support if the problem could not be changed. METHOD: 153 family caregivers were interviewed as part of a larger epidemiologically representative study of people with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers. Caregiver anxiety and depression were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS: the CAPS had high sensitivity and specificity in detecting caregivers with screen positive anxiety and depression. Five areas were indicated: neuropsychiatric symptoms and depression in the care-recipient, co-residence and relationships with the care-recipient, and physical health of the caregiver. CONCLUSIONS: awareness of these problems can help clinicians identify those carers most likely to be anxious or depressed and indicate appropriate intervention and support. We recommend that this instrument be used as part of routine assessments of people with dementia and their families.
