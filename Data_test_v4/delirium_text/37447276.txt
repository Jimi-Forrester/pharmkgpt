37447276|t|Correlates of Undernutrition in Older People in Guadeloupe (French West Indies): Results from the KASADS Study.
37447276|a|Objectives: This study aimed to determine the risk factors for undernutrition in community-dwelling older adults in Guadeloupe (Caribbean islands). Methods: We used data from the KArukera Study of Aging-Drugs Storage (KASADS), an observational cross-sectional study of community-dwelling older people living in Guadeloupe. The Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) was used to assess the risk of undernutrition. An MNA-short form (SF) score <=11 defined the risk of undernutrition. Depression was assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, cognitive function was assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), frailty was assessed using the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures index (SOF), and dependency was assessed using Lawton's instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scale. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the correlates of undernutrition. Results: The study sample comprised 115 patients aged 65 years or older; 67.8% were women, and the mean age was 76 +- 7.8 years. The prevalence of undernutrition was 21.7% (95% CI = 15.2-30.1%). In our bivariate analysis, the risk of undernutrition was associated with MMSE score, IADL score, frailty, and CES-D score. We found no significant relation between nutrition risk and other variables, such as marital status, pain, or polypharmacy. In the multivariate analysis, the factors associated with the risk of undernutrition were MMSE score (Odd-Ratio (OR): 0.74 (0.58-0.97)) and CES-D score (OR: 1.13 (1.02-1.27)). Conclusions: Cognitive decline and the risk of depression were independently associated with the risk of undernutrition in community-dwelling older people in Guadeloupe. Although we cannot imply causality in this relation, the detection of these three key geriatric syndromes in community-dwelling elders is essential to prevent adverse health outcomes. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings.
