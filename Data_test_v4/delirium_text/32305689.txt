32305689|a|Investigations of Alzheimer's disease (AD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and related brain disorders have provided extensive evidence for involvement of cathepsin B, a lysosomal cysteine protease, in mediating the behavioral deficits and neuropathology of these neurodegenerative diseases. This review integrates findings of cathepsin B regulation in clinical biomarker studies, animal model genetic and inhibitor evaluations, structural studies, and lysosomal cell biological mechanisms in AD, TBI, and related brain disorders. The results together indicate the role of cathepsin B in the behavioral deficits and neuropathology of these disorders. Lysosomal leakage occurs in AD and TBI, and related neurodegeneration, which leads to the hypothesis that cathepsin B is redistributed from the lysosome to the cytosol where it initiates cell death and inflammation processes associated with neurodegeneration. These results together implicate cathepsin B as a major contributor to these neuropathological changes and behavioral deficits. These findings support the investigation of cathepsin B as a potential drug target for therapeutic discovery and treatment of AD, TBI, and TBI-related brain disorders.
