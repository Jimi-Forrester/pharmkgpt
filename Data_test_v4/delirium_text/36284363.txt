36284363|a|BACKGROUND: The epsilon4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE epsilon4) is the strongest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), associated with amyloid pathogenesis. However, it is not clear how APOE epsilon4 accelerates amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition during the seeding stage of amyloid development in AD patient neurons. METHODS: AD patient induced neurons (iNs) with an APOE epsilon4 inducible system were prepared from skin fibroblasts of AD patients. Transcriptome analysis was performed using RNA isolated from the AD patient iNs expressing APOE epsilon4 at amyloid-seeding and amyloid-aggregation stages. Knockdown of IGFBP3 was applied in the iNs to investigate the role of IGFBP3 in the APOE epsilon4-mediated amyloidosis. RESULTS: We optimized amyloid seeding stage in the iNs of AD patients that transiently expressed APOE epsilon4. Remarkably, we demonstrated that Abeta  pathology was aggravated by the induction of APOE epsilon4 gene expression at the amyloid early-seeding stage in the iNs of AD patients. Moreover, transcriptome analysis in the early-seeding stage revealed that IGFBP3 was functionally important in the molecular pathology of APOE epsilon4-associated AD. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the presence of APOE epsilon4 at the early Abeta-seeding stage in patient iNs is critical for aggravation of sporadic AD pathology. These results provide insights into the importance of APOE epsilon4 expression for the progression and pathogenesis of sporadic AD.
