39348718|t|Extraction of In-Cell beta-Amyloid Fibrillar Aggregates for Studying Molecular-Level Structural Propagations Using Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy.
39348718|a|Molecular-level structural polymorphisms of beta-amyloid (Abeta) fibrils have recently been recognized as pathologically significant. High-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy has been utilized to study these structural polymorphisms, particularly in ex-vivo fibrils seeded from amyloid extracts of post-mortem brain tissues of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. One unaddressed question in current ex-vivo seeding protocol is whether fibrillation from exogenous monomeric Abeta peptides, added to the extracted seeds, can be quantitatively suppressed. Addressing this issue is critical because uncontrolled fibrillation could introduce biased molecular structural polymorphisms in the resulting fibrils. Here, we present a workflow to optimize the key parameters of ex-vivo seeding protocols, focusing on the quantification of amyloid extraction and the selection of exogenous monomeric Abeta concentrations to minimize nonseeded fibrillation. We validate this workflow using three structurally different 40-residue Abeta (Abeta40) fibrillar seeds, demonstrating their ability to propagate their structural features to exogenous wild-type Abeta40.
