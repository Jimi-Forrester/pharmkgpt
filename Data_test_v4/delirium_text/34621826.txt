34621826|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative ileus is a frequent postoperative complication, especially after abdominal surgery. Sympathetic excitation is the primary factor for postoperative ileus. Sympathetic activation becomes increased by surgical stress, postoperative pain, and inflammation. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) can inhibit sympathetic nerve activity, inflammation, and pain. AIM: To observe whether DEX promotes bowel movements in patients after laparoscopic nephrectomy. METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients undergoing laparoscopic nephrectomy were assigned to three groups: C (normal saline infusion), D1 (DEX 0.02 microg/kg/h), and D2 (DEX 0.04 microg/kg/h). The primary outcomes were the recorded times to first flatus, defecation, and eating after surgery. The secondary outcomes were postoperative pain, assessed using the numerical rating scale (NRS), adverse effects, and the duration of the postoperative hospital stay. RESULTS: The times to first flatus, defecation, and eating in groups D1 and D2 were significantly shorter than those in group C (P < 0.01). The NRS scores at 8 h and 24 h after surgery were significantly lower in groups D1 and D2 than in group C (P < 0.05). No adverse effects were observed (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Postoperative infusion of DEX at 0.04 microg/kg/h facilitates bowel movements in patients undergoing laparoscopic nephrectomy.
