26304279|t|Sleep Loss and Circadian Rhythm Disruption in the Intensive Care Unit.
26304279|a|Critical illness is associated with profound sleep disruption. Causality is diverse and includes physiologic, psychological, and environmental factors. There are limited pharmacologic interventions available to treat sleep disturbances in critical illness; however, multidisciplinary strategies that alter the intensive care unit (ICU) environment and cluster care delivery have shown promise in sleep and circadian promotion and delirium reduction. With the appropriate administrative support and involvement of diverse ICU stakeholders, effective strategies could be created, implemented, and maintained to improve sleep disruption in critically ill patients.
