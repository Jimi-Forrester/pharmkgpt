34257592|a|Mounting evidence suggests a causal relationship between specific bacterial infections and the development of certain malignancies. In this study, we examined the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) in oral-digestive tract tumors by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and PCR and analyzed the correlation between P. gingivalis detection and clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of oral and esophageal carcinoma. The IHC results showed that the positive rates of P. gingivalis were 60.00, 46.00, 20.00, 6.67, and 2.86% in oral, esophagus, cardiac, stomach, and colorectal cancer tissues, respectively. Likewise, PCR results showed rates of 56.00, 42.00, 16.67, 3.33, and 2.86%, respectively. The two methods were consistent, and the kappa value was 0.806, P < 0.001. In addition, P. gingivalis expression was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis and the clinical stages of oral and esophageal cancer (P < 0.05). The overall survival rate of the P. gingivalis undetected group (86, 50%) was significantly higher than that of the P. gingivalis detected group (57, 14%) for oral and esophageal cancer, respectively. In conclusion, the detection rate of P. gingivalis showed a decreasing trend in oral-digestive tract tumors. Detection with P. gingivalis was associated with poor prognosis for oral and esophageal cancer.
