21800525|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium can have serious consequences, including increased hospitalisation and risk of death, and worsening dementia. AIM: To explore the feasibility of preventing delirium in care homes for older people. METHOD: An enhanced educational package targeting care home staff was developed. RESULTS: Staff were not confident in recognising, preventing or managing delirium before the intervention. After it, however, they showed a greater awareness: the total number of episodes of delirium in residents' records increased; the number of prescriptions fell; and the proportion of residents who had had a cognitive test in the previous six months rose. CONCLUSION: Further research is needed to establish the project's efficacy and cost effectiveness.
