39600389|a|Background: The rehabilitation process for cognitive disorders is long and complex, which can lead to reduced rehabilitation outcomes and reduced quality improvement. Thus, there is a need to use new methods to boost conventional rehabilitation (e.g., drug therapy, herbal therapy, paper, and pencil tasks). Innovations such as RehaCom can be helpful to remove the obstacles to treatment, but evidence for their effectiveness is limited. Objectives: To compare the effectiveness of RehaCom with other cognitive therapies (computer-based, non- computer) in patients with cognitive impairment (CI). Methods: Eight bibliographic databases (PubMed, Cochran Library, Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, Embase, ProQuest, and google scholar) were used in this research. The initial search resulted in the extraction of 2466 articles; after the review of the title, abstract, and full text, 19 articles were selected. Quality assessment was performed using the CONSORT checklist. Then, data extraction was done using the form set by the researcher in Word 2016 software. Results: Overall, RehaCom achieved more positive clinical effects compared to other cognitive therapies (e.g., improvement in memory, attention, and motor function) on multiple sclerosis (n = 7), schizophrenia (n = 6), stroke (n = 3), Parkinson (n = 1), mild CI (n = 1), and acquired brain damage (n = 1). In six studies, a follow-up period of some weeks to 6 months has been used. Additionally, six studies used conventional therapy plus RehaCom for intervention. Except one study, all studies used RehaCom individual training. Conclusions: This review provides evidence for the potential effectiveness of RehaCom for the improvement of clinical outcomes in patients with CI. However, more robust Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) are needed to confirm the observed positive effects.
