29399547|a|Purpose: Some reports have shown neuroprotective effects of caffeine in several neurodegenerative disorders. However, its mechanism of action is not completely clear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the interference of ryanodine, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and adenosine modulators with the neuroprotective effects of caffeine against beta-amyloid (Abeta) neurotoxicity in the SHSY5Y cells. Methods: The SHSY5Y cells were treated with Abeta23-35 (20microM) and/or caffeine (0.6 and 1mM), or both for 24 hours. Adenosine (20, 40, 60, 80, 100microM), NMDA (20, 50, 70, 90microM), dantrolene (2, 4, 6, 8, 10microM) were also added to the medium and incubated for 24 hours. The cell viability was measured via the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) method. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test. Results: Caffeine at all the used concentrations (0.6, 0.8, 0.9, 1, and 3mM) significantly protected neuronal cells against Abeta neurotoxicity. Adenosine at the concentrations of 20, 40, 80 and 100muM diminished the neuroprotective effects of caffeine (0.6 and 1mM) against Abeta neurotoxicity. NMDA at the concentrations of 20, 50, 70 and 90muM blocked caffeine (0.6 and 1mM) neuroprotective effects. Dantrolene at the concentration of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10muM diminished the neuroprotective effects of caffeine (0.6mM) and at the concentrations of 2 and 10muM impede caffeine (1mM) neuroprotection against Abeta neurotoxicity. Conclusion: Caffeine produced neuroprotective effect against Abeta neurotoxicity. Blockade of adenosine and NMDA receptors, as well as the activation of ryanodine receptors, may contribute to the neuroprotective effects of caffeine.
