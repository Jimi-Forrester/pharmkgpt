38492878|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibits a higher incidence rate among older women, and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis during aging is associated with cognitive impairments and the development of dementia. luteinizing hormone (LH) has an important role in CNS function, such as mediating neuronal pregnenolone production, and modulating neuronal plasticity and cognition. The sex differences in LH and its impact on Abeta deposition in AD individuals remain unclear, with no reported specific mechanisms. Here, we show through data mining that LH-related pathways are significantly enriched in female AD patients. Additionally, LH levels are elevated in female AD patients and exhibit a negative correlation with cognitive levels but a positive correlation with AD pathology levels, and females exhibit a greater extent of AD pathology, such as Abeta deposition. In vivo, we observed that the exogenous injection of LH exacerbated behavioral impairments induced by Abeta1-42 in mice. LH injection resulted in worsened neuronal damage and increased Abeta deposition. In SH-SY5Y cells, co-administration of LH with Abeta further exacerbated Abeta-induced neuronal damage. Furthermore, LH can dose-dependently decrease the levels of NEP and LHR proteins while increasing the expression of GFAP and IBA1 in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, these results indicate that LH can exacerbate cognitive impairment and neuronal damage in mice by increasing Abeta deposition. The potential mechanism may involve the reduction of NEP and LHR expression, along with the exacerbation of Abeta-induced inflammation.
