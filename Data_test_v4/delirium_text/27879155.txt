27879155|t|Managing cognition in progressive supranuclear palsy.
27879155|a|Cognitive impairment is integral to the syndrome of progressive supranuclear palsy. It is most commonly described as a frontal dysexecutive syndrome but other impairments include apathy, impulsivity, visuospatial and memory functions. Cognitive dysfunction may be exacerbated by mood disturbance, medication and communication problems. In this review we advocate an individualized approach to managing cognitive impairment in progressive supranuclear palsy with the education of caregivers as a central component. Specific cognitive and behavioral treatments are complemented by treatment of mood disturbances, rationalizing medications and a patient-centered approach to communication. This aims to improve patients' quality of life, reduce carer burden and assist people with progressive supranuclear palsy in decisions about their life and health, including discussions of feeding and end-of-life issues.
