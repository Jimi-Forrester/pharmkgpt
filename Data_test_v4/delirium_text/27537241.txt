27537241|t|Validity and Reliability of the 6-Item Cognitive Impairment Test for Screening Cognitive Impairment: A Review.
27537241|a|BACKGROUND: A large proportion of older adults with dementia remain undiagnosed, presenting to hospital with occult dementia, and are at risk for adverse outcomes, especially delirium. Routine screening for cognitive impairment among older adult patients presenting to acute hospitals could help alleviate this problem; however, this is hampered by time constraints, poor knowledge of screening instruments and lack of consensus as to which screening tool is best. Cognitive tests with attention items may be particularly useful in acute settings, given the importance of delirium detection. However, it is crucial that cognitive screening instruments are fast and reliable. SUMMARY: The Six-Item Cognitive Impairment Test (6-CIT) is a feasible instrument for cognitive screening among older adults attending a general practitioner or hospital. Although researchers have investigated its accuracy in diagnosing cognitive impairment in primary and secondary care settings, its validity in primary care use has been questioned and there are limited validation studies on its use in secondary care. KEY MESSAGES: This paper presents a review of validation studies conducted on the 6-CIT. We recommend that larger studies, which test the psychometric properties of the 6-CIT in primary and acute care settings, are conducted to establish recommendations for routine screening use.
