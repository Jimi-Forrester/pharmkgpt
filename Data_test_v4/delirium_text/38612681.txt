38612681|t|Integrated Transcriptomic and Proteomic Study of the Mechanism of Action of the Novel Small-Molecule Positive Allosteric Modulator 1 in Targeting PAC1-R for the Treatment of D-Gal-Induced Aging Mice.
38612681|a|Small-molecule positive allosteric modulator 1 (SPAM1), which targets pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide receptor 1 (PAC1-R), has been found to have a neuroprotective effect, and the underlying mechanism was explored in this study. First, using a D-galactose (D-gal)-induced aging mouse model, we confirmed that SPAM1 improves the structure of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and restores the number of neurons. Compared with D-gal model mice, SPAM1-treated mice showed up-regulated expression of Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) and Lamin B1 and down-regulated expression of YinYang 1 (YY1) and p16. A similar tendency was observed in senescent RGC-5 cells induced by long-term culture, indicating that SPAM1 exhibits significant in vitro and in vivo anti-senescence activity in neurons. Then, using whole-transcriptome sequencing and proteomic analysis, we further explored the mechanism behind SPAM1's neuroprotective effects and found that SPAM is involved in the longevity-regulating pathway. Finally, the up-regulation of neurofilament light and medium polypeptides indicated by the proteomics results was further confirmed by Western blotting. These results help to lay a pharmacological network foundation for the use of SPAM1 as a potent anti-aging therapeutic drug to combat neurodegeneration with anti-senescence, neuroprotective, and nerve regeneration activity.
