37439280|t|Analysis of Japanese nationwide health datasets: association between lifestyle habits and prevalence of neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia with reference to dementia-related diseases and Parkinson's disease.
37439280|a|OBJECTIVES: Chronic pain is defined as pain that persists or recurs for more than 3 months. This study focuses on neuropathic pain (NP) and fibromyalgia (FM) which are chronic pain states, and aims to identify lifestyle habits associated with their prevalence. Other neurological disorders are also analyzed as references. METHODS: Association between the variable referring to disease prevalence (number of claims for reimbursement of marker drugs) and the variable for lifestyle habits/health examination results (collected from insured individuals aged 40-74 years) was determined by analyzing Japanese nationwide datasets, which were collected in 2018 and aggregated by prefecture. Pregabalin, donepezil, and levodopa were used as marker drugs for the chronic pain states, dementia-related diseases (Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia) and Parkinson's disease (PD), respectively. Pearson's correlation analysis and multiple linear regression analysis were conducted. RESULTS: Variables showing correlation coefficient ( r )>0.5 were put into the multiple linear regression. Exercise habits ( =-0.3182), smoking habits (0.3218), daily drinking (0.2683), and alanine aminotransferase>51 U/L (0.2309) were finally incorporated in the equation for pregabalin (R 2=0.7268). Walking speed (-0.4543) and daily drinking (0.5077) were incorporated in the equation for donepezil (R 2=0.5718). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of chronic pain states is associated with lifestyle habits, just like the dementia-related diseases. Exercise in daily life is negatively associated with the prevalence of the chronic pain states, although excessive alcohol drinking, smoking, and high serum ALT are positively associated with it. The prevalence of PD seems less associated with lifestyle habits.
