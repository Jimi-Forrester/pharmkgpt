38599511|t|Targeting VDAC: A potential therapeutic approach for mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.
38599511|a|Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), a protein located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, plays a critical role in regulating mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism. Recent studies have identified VDAC as a potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease. This article aims to provide an overview of the role of VDAC in mitochondrial dysfunction, its association with Alzheimer's disease, and the potential of targeting VDAC for developing novel therapeutic interventions. Understanding the involvement of VDAC in Alzheimer's disease may pave the way for the development of effective treatments that can restore mitochondrial function and halt disease progression.
