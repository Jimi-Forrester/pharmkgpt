37506854|t|Dual role of autophagy for advancements from conventional to new delivery systems in cancer.
37506854|a|Autophagy, a programmed cell-lysis mechanism, holds significant promise in the prevention and treatment of a wide range of conditions, including cancer, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. The successful utilization of autophagy modulation for therapeutic purposes hinges upon accurately determining the role of autophagy in disease progression, whether it acts as a cytotoxic or cytoprotective factor. This critical knowledge empowers scientists to effectively manipulate tumor sensitivity to anti-cancer therapies through autophagy modulation, while also circumventing drug resistance. However, conventional therapies face limitations such as low bioavailability, poor solubility, and a lack of controlled release mechanisms, hindering their clinical applicability. In this regard, innovative nanoplatforms including organic and inorganic systems have emerged as promising solutions to offer stimuli-responsive, theranostic-controlled drug delivery systems with active targeting and improved solubility. The review article explores a variety of organic nanoplatforms, such as lipid-based, polymer-based, and DNA-based systems, which incorporate autophagy-inhibiting drugs like hydroxychloroquine. By inhibiting the glycolytic pathway and depriving cells of essential nutrients, these platforms exhibit tumor-suppressive effects in advanced forms of cancer such as leukemia, colon cancer, and glioblastoma. Furthermore, metal-based, metal-oxide-based, silica-based, and quantum dot-based nanoplatforms selectively induce autophagy in tumors, leading to extensive cancer cell destruction. Additionally, this article discusses the current clinical status of autophagy-modulating drugs for cancer therapy with valuable insights of progress and potential of such approaches.
