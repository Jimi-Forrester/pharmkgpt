37233712|t|Changes in the Carbohydrate Profile in Common Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) Seedlings Induced by Cold Stress and Dehydration.
37233712|a|Plant species are sensitive to stresses, especially at the seedling stage, and they respond to these conditions by making metabolic changes to counteract the negative effects of this. The objectives of this study were to determine carbohydrate profile in particular organs (roots, hypocotyl, and cotyledons) of common buckwheat seedlings and to verify whether carbohydrate accumulation is similar or not in the organs in response to cold stress and dehydration. Roots, hypocotyl, and cotyledons of common buckwheat seedlings have various saccharide compositions. The highest concentrations of cyclitols, raffinose, and stachyose were found in the hypocotyl, indicating that they may be transported from cotyledons, although this needs further studies. Accumulation of raffinose and stachyose is a strong indicator of the response of all buckwheat organs to introduced cold stress. Besides, cold conditions reduced d-chiro-inositol content, but did not affect d-pinitol level. Enhanced accumulation of raffinose and stachyose were also a distinct response of all organs against dehydration at ambient temperature. The process causes also a large decrease in the content of d-pinitol in buckwheat hypocotyl, which may indicate its transformation to d-chiro-inositol whose content increased at that time. In general, the sucrose and its galactosides in hypocotyl tissues were subject to the highest changes to the applied cold and dehydration conditions compared to the cotyledons and roots. This may indicate tissue differences in the functioning of the protective system(s) against such threats.
