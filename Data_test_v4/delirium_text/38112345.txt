38112345|t|Nanomaterials as Microglia Modulators in the Treatment of Central Nervous System Disorders.
38112345|a|Microglia play a pivotal role in the central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis, acting as housekeepers and defenders of the surrounding environment. These cells can elicit their functions by shifting into two main phenotypes: pro-inflammatory classical phenotype, M1, and anti-inflammatory alternative phenotype, M2. Despite their pivotal role in CNS homeostasis, microglia phenotypes can influence the development and progression of several CNS disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injuries, and even brain cancer. It is thus clear that the possibility of modulating microglia activation has gained attention as a therapeutic tool against many CNS pathologies. Nanomaterials are an unprecedented tool for manipulating microglia responses, in particular, to specifically target microglia and elicit an in situ immunomodulation activity. This review focuses the discussion on two main aspects: analyzing the possibility of using nanomaterials to stimulate a pro-inflammatory response of microglia against brain cancer and introducing nanostructures able to foster an anti-inflammatory response for treating neurodegenerative disorders. The final aim is to stimulate the analysis of the development of new microglia nano-immunomodulators, paving the way for innovative and effective therapeutic approaches for the treatment of CNS disorders.
