31630771|t|Neurological disorders and mitochondria.
31630771|a|The brain is highly dependent on mitochondrial energy metabolism. As a result, mitochondrial dysfunction is a central aspect of many adult-onset neurological diseases, including stroke, ALS, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases. We review here how different mitochondrial functions, including oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial dynamics, oxidant generation, cell death regulation, Ca2+ homeostasis, and proteostasis are involved in these disorders.
