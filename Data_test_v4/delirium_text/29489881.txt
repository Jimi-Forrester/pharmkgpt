29489881|t|Impairment of vascular strain in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.
29489881|a|BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases. Aim of this present study was to evaluate and extend recent research on the influence of obstructive sleep apnea on vascular strain. METHODS: A total number of 98 patients were integrated in the study. Patients were grouped according to the Apnea-Hypopnea-Index (AHI) in patients with mild-to-moderate OSA (5/h <= AHI < 30/h), severe OSA (AHI >= 30/h) and controls (AHI < 5/h). Groups were matched in age, body-mass-index and cardiovascular risks. Vascular strain of common carotid arteries was assessed by ultrasound speckle-tracking. A minor group of 30 patients and controls further underwent assessment of vascular strain of brachial and femoral arteries. Additionally, all patients underwent blood testing to reveal potential influences of inflammatory markers on arterial stiffness. In additional analysis we examined the effect of statin therapy on vascular strain. RESULTS: Patients with OSA showed significantly reduced values of vascular strain of common carotid arteries. Radial and circumferential strains were significantly lower in both patients with mild-to-moderate (p = .05) and patients with severe OSA (p = .001) compared to control. Vascular strain parameters of brachial and femoral arteries showed no consistent results. There were no significant correlations of inflammatory markers with vascular strain parameters. No significant differences in vascular strain were detected between statin and non-statin groups. CONCLUSION: Patients with OSA show significantly reduced vascular strain assessed by ultrasound-based speckle-tracking. Vascular stiffness increases with the severity of the disease. Target vessels to assess vascular strain in patients with OSA are common carotid arteries, whereas other sites of the arterial tree are not reliable. No significant impact of current statin therapy on vascular strain was found. Further studies are needed to evaluate potential benefit of statins in secondary prevention of atherosclerosis in OSA.
