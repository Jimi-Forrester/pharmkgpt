20641292|a|Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, are potent psychoactive drugs used for their sedative and anxiolytic properties (1, 2). There are two types of benzodiazepine receptors, which have been designated as the central and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. The central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) is found exclusively in the central nervous system on the membranes of neurons and is coupled to the g-aminobutyric acid receptor/chloride channel (3). In contrast, the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is a mitochondrial protein found in brain and peripheral tissues (adrenal gland, heart, lung, kidney, and testis) (4). The brain has lower levels of PBRs than do the peripheral tissues. Both glial cells and macrophages contain high levels of PBRs (5-7). Increased PBR expression after brain injury or neuroinflammation is associated with microglial activation, such as occurs with the neuronal damage accompanying several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer s disease, Wernicke s encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. PBRs have been studied <i>in vivo</i> by positron emission tomography (PET) using [<sup>11</sup>C]PK11195, an isoquinoline carboxamide with specific PBR-antagonistic activity. [<sup>11</sup>C]PK11195 is being developed as a PET agent for non-invasive studies of microglia and macrophage activation in the brain, lung, and heart. However, accumulation of this tracer in the brain is limited. <i>N</i>-(2,5-Dimethoxybenzyl)-<i>N</i>-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide (DAA1106) was found to be a selective agonist for studying PBRs in the central nervous system (8, 9). DAA1106 was reported to have a higher affinity for PBRs in mitochondrial fractions of rat and monkey brains than did PK11195 (8, 9). Therefore, both tracers are able to cross the normal cell membrane to reach the mitochondrial receptor sites. [<sup>11</sup>C]DAA1106 has been studied as a PET agent for the non-invasive study of microglia and macrophage activation in the brain. [<sup>11</sup>C]DAA1106 binding was 3-fold higher than [<sup>11</sup>C]PK11195 binding in the monkey occipital cortex (9). <i>N</i>-(5-Fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-<i>N</i>-(2-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoroethyl-5-methoxybenzyl)acetamide ([<sup>18</sup>F]FEDAA1106), a fluoroethyl analog of DA1106, is being developed as a potential PET ligand with highly selective and specific binding to PBR.
