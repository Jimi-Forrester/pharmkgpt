39623969|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative dementia, with diagnosis traditionally reliant on clinical criteria. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers like pTau181 and Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio significantly improve diagnostic accuracy but are invasive. Plasma biomarkers measured by automated assays offer a non-invasive alternative. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of plasma pTau181, Abeta42/Abeta40, and pTau181/Abeta42 ratios in predicting CSF amyloid status in a real-life clinical setting. METHODS: Data from consecutive patients whose plasma and CSF samples sent to our laboratory between March and October 2022, were retrospectively analyzed. Plasma and CSF pTau181, Abeta42, and Abeta40 levels were measured using the Lumipulse G600II platform. CSF amyloid status was classified as amyloid-positive (A+) or amyloid-negative (A-) based on the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio. Statistical analyses included Spearman correlation, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and multivariate logistic regression to evaluate biomarker performance. RESULTS: Among 165 individuals (83 females), 29.1% were classified as A+. Significant correlations were found between plasma and CSF biomarkers, with the highest for the pTau181/Abeta42 ratio (rho=0.620, p < 0.0001). ROC analysis showed the pTau181/Abeta42 ratio had the highest diagnostic performance (AUC 0.818), followed by pTau181 (AUC 0.794) and Abeta42/Abeta40 (AUC 0.775). Combining plasma biomarkers in age-adjusted models improved diagnostic accuracy (AUC up to 0.846). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma biomarkers measured by the Lumipulse G600II platform show strong potential in predicting CSF amyloid status and possibly reduces the need for lumbar punctures. These findings support the potential use of plasma assays in the early diagnosis of AD. Anyway, further validations in larger multicenter cohorts are mandatory.
