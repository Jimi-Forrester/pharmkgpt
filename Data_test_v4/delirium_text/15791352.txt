15791352|t|One-year longitudinal evaluation of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease. The REAL.FR Study.
15791352|a|Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms are major and frequent manifestations of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The aim of the present study was to evaluate neuropsychiatric symptoms in the PHRC REAL.FR cohort (for Reseau sur la maladie d'Alzheimer Francais) after one year of evolution. Four hundred and eighty two patients with mild and moderate AD were assessed. A majority of them had significant symptoms at inclusion (85.3 % of subjects with mild AD, 89.7% of patients with a moderate AD). Patients with mild AD had a significant increase of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) frequency x severity scores for apathy and aberrant motor behavior. Patients with moderate AD had a significant increase of NPI disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior and sleep disorders scores. The variation of NPI total score at one year correlated positively with change in Zarit's caregiver burden score, independently of global cognitive evolution. After one year, a group of 54 patients were institutionalized in nursing home or long term care unit. When compared to non institutionalized patients, the institutionalized group was characterized at base line by a lower MMSE score, a higher Zarit caregiver burden score, and a higher NPI agitation and disinhibition scores.
