34169437|a|Human SARS Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 170 million people worldwide and resulted in more than 3.5 million deaths so far. The infection causes Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in people of all age groups, notably diabetic and old age people, at a higher risk of infectivity and fatality. Around 35% of the patients who have died of the disease were diabetic. The infection is associated with weakening immune response, chronic inflammation, and potential direct pancreatic impairment. There seems to be a three-way association of the SARS-CoV-2 infection with diabetes and aging. The COVID-19 infection causes metabolism complications, which may induce diabetes and accelerate aging in healthy individuals. How does diabetes elevate the likelihood of the infection is not clearly understood. we summarize mechanisms of accelerated aging in COVID-19 and diabetes, and the possible correlation of these three diseases. Various drug candidates under different stages of pre-clinical or clinical developments give us hope for the development of COVID-19 therapeutics, but there is no approved drug so far to treat this disease. Here, we explored the potential of anti-diabetic and anti-aging natural compounds for the COVID-19 treatment. We have also reviewed different therapeutic strategies with plant-based natural products that may be used to cure patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and post-infection syndrome.
