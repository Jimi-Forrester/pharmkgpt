38058549|a|Background: To investigate the effect of frailty on the long-term prognosis of elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods: The data of 238 AMI patients (aged >=75 years) were retrospectively reviewed. They were divided into two groups according to the Modified Frailty Index (mFI): frailty group (mFI>=0.27, n=143) and non-frailty group (mFI<0.27, n=95). The major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACEs) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves of the two groups were compared. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors for MACEs. Results: The frailty group showed a significantly older age as well as a higher N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide level, Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events score, and CRUSADE bleeding score compared with the non-frailty group (P<0.05). A significantly greater proportion of patients with combined heart failure, atrial fibrillation, comorbidity, and activities of daily living score of <60 was also observed in the frailty group compared with the non-frailty group (P<0.05). At 36 months after AMI, the frailty group vs the non-frailty group showed a significantly poorer survival (log-rank P=0.005), higher incidence of MACEs (50.35 vs 29.47, P=0.001), higher overall mortality rate (20.98% vs 7.37%, P=0.006), higher 30-day mortality rate (13.99% vs 5.26%, P=0.033), higher major bleeding rate (14.69% vs 5.26, P=0.018), and lower repeat revascularization rate (2.10% vs 8.42%, P=0.03). Frailty, type 2 diabetes, and N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide >=1800 pg/mL were independent risk factors for MACEs. Conclusion: Frailty is an independent risk factor affecting the long-term prognosis of elderly patients with AMI.
