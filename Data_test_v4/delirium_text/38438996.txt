38438996|a|BACKGROUND: Polypharmacy and the use of potentially inappropriate medications are common among nursing home residents and are associated with negative outcomes. Although deprescribing has been proposed as a way to curtail these problems, the best way to implement multidisciplinary comprehensive medication review and deprescribing and its real impact in specific high-risk populations, such as nursing home residents, is still unclear. This multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial aims to assess the effects of a multidisciplinary mediation management program on medication use and health problems. METHODS: A total of 1,672 residents aged >= 65 years from 22 nursing homes in South Korea who meet the targeted criteria, such as the use of >= 10 medications, are eligible to participate. The experimental group will receive a comprehensive medication review, deprescription, and multidisciplinary case conference with the help of platform. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, at the end of the intervention, as well as at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the end of the intervention. The primary endpoints will be the rate of adverse drug events, number of potentially inappropriate medications/potentially inappropriate medication users/two or more central nervous system drug/ central nervous system drug users, delirium, emergency department visits, hospitalization, and falls. The secondary endpoint will be the number of medications taken and polypharmacy users. DISCUSSION: Our trial design is unique in that it aims to introduce a structured operationalized clinical program focused on reducing polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate medications in a nursing home setting with large samples. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Ethical approval was granted by the public institutional review board of the Ministry of Health and Welfare (2022-1092-009). The study is also registered with the Clinical Research Information Service (Identifier: KCT0008157, Development and evaluation of a multidisciplinary medication management program in long-term care facility residents Status: Approved First Submitted Date: 2023/01/18 Registered Date: 2023/02/03 Last Updated Date: 2023/01/18 (nih.go.kr) https://cris.nih.go.kr/ ), which includes all items from the World Health Organization Trial Registration Dataset.
