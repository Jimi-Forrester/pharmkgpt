35971082|a|BACKGROUND: It is unknown, how many older hospitalized patients experience cognitive changes independently from delirium. METHODS: In this retrospective study, cognitive function was assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment on admission and discharge in 103 acute care geriatric hospital patients. RESULTS: Mean age was 80.8 +- 7.3 years. The total MoCA score on admission was 17.8 (+-4.5) and at discharge 17.7 (+-4.4). The mean difference of the total MoCA score was - 0.1 (+-3.5). 12 (11.7%) patients suffered from delirium. 46 (44.7%) patients experienced significant changes of cognitive function <- 2 or > 2 MoCA points without delirium. There was no significant association between delirium during hospital stay and the prevalence and magnitude of changes in total MoCA score. CONCLUSION: Cognitive changes frequently occur during acute disease of geriatric patients independently from delirium. We propose the term "acute disease induced cognitive dysfunction" (ADICD) for this entity. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical trial register (DRKS-ID: DRKS00025157 on 28.04.2021).
