30796710|t|Convergence of longevity and immunity: lessons from animal models.
30796710|a|An increasing amount of data implicate immunity-mostly innate immunity-in the ageing process; both during healthy ageing as well as in neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the aetiology however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we review what we know from model organisms (worms, flies and mice) on the possible mechanistic details that connect immunity and ageing. These links provide evidence that inter-tissue communication (especially the interaction between gut and brain), hormonal control mechanisms and intestinal microbiota determine immune system activity and thus influence lifespan.
