7361578|t|Histocompatibility antigens and antibodies to viral and other antigens in Alzheimer pre-senile dementia.
7361578|a|Alzheimer's disease may arise from an interaction between a conventional infective agent and a particular disease susceptibility (related to the HLA-A or B locus). HLA antigens and antibodies to conventional infective agents were examined in 14 patients with pre-senile dementia. Most of the sample probably suffered Alzheimer's disease, though one subject may have had Pick's disease. No particular HLA type or antibody was associated with the sample.
