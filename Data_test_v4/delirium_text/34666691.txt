34666691|t|Management of preoperative pain in elderly patients with moderate to severe cognitive deficits and hip fracture: a retrospective, monocentric study in an orthogeriatric unit.
34666691|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with cognitive deficits are 3 times more likely to suffer a hip fracture than geriatric patients of the same age group without cognitive deficits. The persistence of perioperative pain following hip fracture is a risk factor for the occurrence of delirium, poor functional prognosis, and the development of secondary chronic pain. Patients with cognitive deficits receive 20 to 60% less analgesics than those without cognitive deficits. Our retrospective descriptive monocentric study was performed in an orthogeriatric unit on a cohort of elderly patients hospitalized for hip fracture. The aim of the study was to compare the quantity of strong opioids delivered in a morphine sulfate equivalent daily during the preoperative period after a hip fracture between cognitively intact patients and those with cognitive deficits. RESULTS: Our total population of 69 patients had a median age of 90 years old, and 46% of these patients had moderate or severe cognitive deficits. During the preoperative period, the same quantity of strong opioids was administered to both groups of patients (13.1 mg/d versus 10.8 mg/d (p = 0.38)). Patients with moderate to severe cognitive deficits more often experienced delirium during their hospitalization (p < 0.01) and received more psychotropic drugs in the first 3 postoperative days (p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: We reported that with standardized pain management in an orthogeriatric unit, patients aged 75 years and older received the same daily average quantity of strong opioids during the preoperative period regardless of the presence of cognitive deficits.
