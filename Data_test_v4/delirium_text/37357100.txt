37357100|t|Apolipoprotein E in lipid metabolism and neurodegenerative disease.
37357100|a|Dysregulation of lipid metabolism has emerged as a central component of many neurodegenerative diseases. Variants of the lipid transport protein, apolipoprotein E (APOE), modulate risk and resilience in several neurodegenerative diseases including late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Allelic variants of the gene, APOE, alter the lipid metabolism of cells and tissues and have been broadly associated with several other cellular and systemic phenotypes. Targeting APOE-associated metabolic pathways may offer opportunities to alter disease-related phenotypes and consequently, attenuate disease risk and impart resilience to multiple neurodegenerative diseases. We review the molecular, cellular, and tissue-level alterations to lipid metabolism that arise from different APOE isoforms. These changes in lipid metabolism could help to elucidate disease mechanisms and tune neurodegenerative disease risk and resilience.
