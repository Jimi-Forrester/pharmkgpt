31820699|t|Role of Cdk5 in Amyloid-beta Pathology of Alzheimer's Disease.
31820699|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with irreversible cognitive impairment. So far, successful treatment and prevention for this disease are deficient in spite of delaying the progression of cognitive impairment and dementia. Cyclin dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a unique member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family, is involved in AD pathogenesis and may be a pathophysiological mediator that links the major pathological features of AD. Cdk5 dysregulation interferes with the proteolytic processing of Amyloid-beta Protein Precursor (APP) and modulates amyloidbeta (Abeta) by affecting three enzymes called alpha-, beta- and gamma-secretase, which are critical for the hydrolysis of APP. Given that the accumulation and deposition of Abeta derived from APP are a common hinge point in the numerous pathogenic hypotheses of AD, figuring out that influence of specific mechanisms of Cdk5 on Abeta pathology will deepen our understanding of AD.
