39422944|t|Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer's Disease Drug Trials: A Mini-Review.
39422944|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative pathology that leads to cognitive decline and dementia, particularly in older adults. It disrupts brain structure and function, with neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques being a primary pathological hallmark. Pharmacotherapeutic trials targeting Abeta and other AD pathological features aim to slow disease progression. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive tool that visualizes brain functional activity, aiding in evaluating the efficacy of AD drugs in clinical trials. Objective: This mini-review explores the role of fMRI in evaluating the impact of AD pharmacotherapeutic clinical trials conducted in the past seven years. Methods: Literature was systematically searched using two databases. The risk of bias was assessed with the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB-2) for randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Results: Four studies using fMRI to investigate AD drug efficacy were included. Cholinesterase, glutamatergic, and serotonergic drugs showed significant positive effects on brain functional activity, especially within the default mode network. Functional connectivity (FC) changes due to drug intake were linked to cerebellar and cholinergic decline in AD, correlating with improved global cognition and fMRI task performance. Conclusions: Recent RCTs demonstrate fMRI's ability to reveal longitudinal FC pattern changes in response to AD drug treatments across disease stages. Positive FC changes in distinct brain regions suggest potential compensatory mechanisms from drug intake. However, these drugs have limited efficacy, necessitating further research to enhance specific pharmacological interventions for clinical application.
