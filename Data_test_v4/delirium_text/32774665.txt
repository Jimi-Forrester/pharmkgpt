32774665|t|The Role of Oxidative Stress in Physiopathology and Pharmacological Treatment with Pro- and Antioxidant Properties in Chronic Diseases.
32774665|a|Oxidative stress (OS) has the ability to damage different molecules and cellular structures, altering the correct function of organs and systems. OS accumulates in the body by endogenous and exogenous mechanisms. Increasing evidence points to the involvement of OS in the physiopathology of various chronic diseases that require prolonged periods of pharmacological treatment. Long-term treatments may contribute to changes in systemic OS. In this review, we discuss the involvement of OS in the pathological mechanisms of some chronic diseases, the pro- or antioxidant effects of their pharmacological treatments, and possible adjuvant antioxidant alternatives. Diseases such as high blood pressure, arteriosclerosis, and diabetes mellitus contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and hypoglycemic treatments help reduce the risk with an additional antioxidant benefit. Treatment with methotrexate in autoimmune systemic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, has a dual role in stimulating the production of OS and producing mitochondrial dysfunction. However, it can also help indirectly decrease the systemic OS induced by inflammation. Medicaments used to treat neurodegenerative diseases tend to decrease the mechanisms related to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and balance OS. On the other hand, immunosuppressive treatments used in cancer or human immunodeficiency virus infection increase the production of ROS, causing significant oxidative damage in different organs and systems without widely documented exogenous antioxidant administration alternatives.
