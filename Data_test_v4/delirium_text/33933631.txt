33933631|a|In the preclinical stage of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum, subjects report subjective memory complaints (SMCs), although with the absence of any objective decline, and have a higher risk of progressing to dementia than the general population. Early identification of this stage therefore constitutes a major focus of current AD research, to enable early intervention. In this study, healthy adult participants with high and low SMCs (HSMCs and LSMCs) performed a Go/NoGo task during electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. Relative to LSMC participants, HSMC participants performed the task slower (longer reaction times) and showed changes in the event-related potential (ERP) components associated with response preparation (lower readiness potential -RP- amplitude in the Go condition), and also related to response inhibition processes (lower N2-P3 amplitude in the NoGo condition). In addition, HSMC participants showed lower Go-N2 and NoGo-N2 peak-to-baseline amplitudes, however these results seem to be influenced by a negative tendency overlapping stimulus-related waveforms. The declines observed in this study are mostly consistent with those observed in aMCI participants, supporting the notion of the AD continuum regarding SMC state.
