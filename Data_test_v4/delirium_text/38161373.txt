38161373|t|Atg4B and Cathepsin B-Triggered in Situ Luciferin Formation for Precise Cancer Autophagy Bioluminescence Imaging.
38161373|a|Autophagy plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and progression, but current approaches to visualize it in vivo show limited precision due to their single-analyte-responsive mode. Hence, by simultaneously employing dual autophagy enzymes Atg4B and cathepsin B to trigger the in situ formation of luciferin, we herein propose a strategy for precise autophagy bioluminescence imaging. An Atg4B-responsive peptide Ac-Thr-Phe-Gly-d-Cys (TFGC) and a cathepsin B-activatable compound Ac-Lys-Gly-Arg-Arg-CBT (KGRR-CBT) were rationally designed. During tumor autophagy, these two compounds were uptaken by cancer cells and cleaved by their corresponding enzymes to yield d-cysteine and 2-cyano-6-aminobenzothiazole, respectively, which underwent a CBT-Cys click reaction to yield d-aminoluciferin, turning the bioluminescence "on". The responsiveness of these two compounds toward the two enzymes was tested in vitro, and the ability to turn bioluminescence "on" was validated in living cancer cells and in vivo. We anticipate that our precise autophagy imaging strategy could be further applied for the diagnosis of autophagy-related diseases in the near future.
