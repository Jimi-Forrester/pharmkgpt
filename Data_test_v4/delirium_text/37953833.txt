37953833|t|Quality Standards and Pharmacological Interventions of Natural Oils: Current Scenario and Future Perspectives.
37953833|a|Medicinal plants are rich sources of natural oils such as essential and fixed oils used traditionally for nutritive as well as medicinal purposes. Most of the traditional formulations or phytopharmaceutical formulations contain oil as the main ingredient due to their own therapeutic applications and thus mitigating several pathogeneses such as fungal/bacterial/viral infection, gout, psoriasis, analgesic, antioxidant, skin infection, etc. Due to the lack of quality standards and progressive adulteration in the natural oils, their therapeutic efficacy is continuously deteriorated. To develop quality standards and validate scientific aspects on essential oils, several chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques such as HPTLC, HPLC, NMR, LC-MS, and GC-MS have been termed as the choices of techniques for better exploration of metabolites, hence sustaining the authenticity of the essential oils. In this review, chemical profiling and quality control aspects of essential or fixed oils have been explored from previously reported literature in reputed journals. Methods of chemical profiling, possible identified metabolites in essential oils, and their therapeutic applications have been described. The outcome of the review reveals that GC-MS/MS, LC-MS/MS, and NMR-based chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques are the most liable, economic, precise, and accurate techniques for determining the spuriousness or adulteration of oils based on their qualitative and quantitative chemical profiling studies. This review occupies the extensive information about the quality standards of several oils obtained from natural sources for their regulatory aspects via providing the detailed methods used in chemoprofiling techniques. Hence, this review helps researchers in further therapeutic exploration as well as quality-based standardization for their regulatory purpose.
