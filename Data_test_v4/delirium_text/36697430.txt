36697430|t|Chronic low-dose Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) treatment stabilizes dendritic spines in 18-month-old mice.
36697430|a|Cognitive functions decline during aging. This decline could be caused by changes in dendritic spine stability and altered spine dynamics. Previously, we have shown that a low dose chronic THC treatment improves learning abilities in old whereas impairs learning abilities in young mice. The mechanism underlying this age-dependent effect is not known. Dendritic spine stability is a key for memory formation, therefore we hypothesized that THC affects spine dynamics in an age-dependent manner. We applied longitudinal 2-photon in vivo imaging to 3- and 18-month-old mice treated with 3 mg/kg/day of THC for 28 days via an osmotic pump. We imaged the same dendritic segments before, during and after the treatment and assessed changes in spine density and stability. We now show that in old mice THC improved spine stability resulting in a long-lasting increase in spine density. In contrast, in young mice THC transiently increased spine turnover and destabilized the spines.
