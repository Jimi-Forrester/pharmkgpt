36557851|t|Acylhydrazones and Their Biological Activity: A Review.
36557851|a|Due to the structure of acylhydrazones both by the pharmacophore -CO-NH-N= group and by the different substituents present in the molecules of compounds of this class, various pharmacological activities were reported, including antitumor, antimicrobial, antiviral, antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antiedematous, antiglaucomatous, antidiabetic, antioxidant, and actions on the central nervous system and on the cardiovascular system. This fragment is found in the structure of several drugs used in the therapy of some diseases that are at the top of public health problems, like microbial infections and cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, the acylhydrazone moiety is present in the structure of some compounds with possible applications in the treatment of other different pathologies, such as schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. Considering these aspects, we consider that a study of the literature data regarding the structural and biological properties of these compounds is useful.
