3327367|a|On the basis of the pathology described by Lasegue & Falret, this papers intends to further a psychoanalytic distinction between both types of psychosis which exemplify 'folie a deux'. Hypothesis are proposed which refer to the difference in the psychic structure, in view of the 'body into pieces' experience in Type I delirium cases and a mainly neurotic organization in Type II delirium cases. A case in brought up where part of the interview reveals the rigid as well as sealed bond organization between significant and meaning. Reference is also made to the qualities of symbiotic attachment between both partners in the delirious intercourse, and to the importance the consideration of this diagnostic difference has with regards to the therapeutic strategy.
