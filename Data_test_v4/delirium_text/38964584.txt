38964584|a|BACKGROUND: Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution has been linked with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Suggestive associations between ambient air pollutants and neurodegeneration have also been reported, but due to the small effect and relatively rare outcomes evidence is yet inconclusive. Our aim was to investigate the associations between long-term air pollution exposure and mortality from neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: A Dutch national cohort of 10.8 million adults aged >=30 years was followed from 2013 until 2019. Annual average concentrations of air pollutants (ultra-fine particles (UFP), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particles (PM2.5 and PM10) and elemental carbon (EC)) were estimated at the home address at baseline, using land-use regression models. The outcome variables were mortality due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, non-vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS). Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using Cox models, adjusting for individual and area-level socio-economic status covariates. RESULTS: We had a follow-up of 71 million person-years. The adjusted HRs for non-vascular dementia were significantly increased for NO2 (1.03; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.05) and PM2.5 (1.02; 95%CI 1.01-1.03) per interquartile range (IQR; 6.52 and 1.47 mug/m3, respectively). The association with PM2.5 was also positive for ALS (1.02; 95%CI 0.97-1.07). These associations remained positive in sensitivity analyses and two-pollutant models. UFP was not associated with any outcome. No association with air pollution was found for Parkinson's disease and MS. Inverse associations were found for Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSION: Our findings, using a cohort of more than 10 million people, provide further support for associations between long-term exposure to air pollutants (PM2.5 and particularly NO2) and mortality of non-vascular dementia. No associations were found for Parkinson and MS and an inverse association was observed for Alzheimer's disease.
