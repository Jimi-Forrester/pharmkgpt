29213291|a|BACKGROUND: The rupture of a brain aneurysm causes bleeding in the subarachnoid space. This is known as aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). We evaluated the association of apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphism and the risk of aSAH in a South Indian population. METHODS: The study was performed on 200 subjects with aSAH and 253 healthy control subjects. Blood samples (5 ml) were used to isolate DNA and genotyping was performed for rs7412 and rs429358 using a Taqman allelic discrimination assay. Statistical software R.3.0.11 was used to statistically analyze the data and a p value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: We found a significant association with the risk of aSAH in epsilon3/ epsilon4 genetic model (OR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.16-3.14, p = 0.01). However, in the other genetic models and allele frequency, there was no significant association with the risk of aSAH. In subtyping, we found a significant association of epsilon2 allele frequency with posterior communicating artery (PCOM) aneurysm (OR = 3.59, 95% CI = 1.11-11.64, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that APOE polymorphism has an influence on the risk of aSAH in this South Indian population, specifically in the PCOM subtype.
