38790960|t|Seroprevalence and Associated Risk Factors of Toxoplasma gondii in Patients Diagnosed with Schizophrenia: A Case-Control Cross Sectional Study.
38790960|a|The protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, has been linked to several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of T. gondii IgG antibodies and risk factors associated with seroprevalence in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. This seroepidemiological study assessed 196 participants, divided into two groups. The study group consisted of 98 schizophrenic patients and was matched with 98 healthy blood donors. A questionnaire was used to gather information regarding potential risk factors associated with T. gondii seroprevalence. Results revealed a higher seroprevalence of T. gondii IgG antibodies in schizophrenic patients (69.39%, 68/98) when compared to healthy controls (51.02%, 50/98) (OR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.21-3.9; p = 0.01). Patients with schizophrenia who consumed raw or undercooked meat (80.65%, 25/31) (OR: 3.75; 95% CI: 1.25-11.21, p = 0.02) and those with a lower educational level (77.59%, 45/58) (OR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.59-7.54, p = 0.002) presented increased T. gondii seropositivity rates versus their control counterparts. Our findings indicate a high T. gondii IgG seroprevalence in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia compared to healthy blood donors. Factors associated with T. gondii seroprevalence were consumption of raw or uncooked meat and a lower educational attainment. This study provided the first data regarding the potential risk factors for toxoplasmosis in Romanian patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and may serve as a foundation for future research and the development of preventive strategies.
