The aim of this paper was to identify risk factors that influenced functionality (Barthel) and quality of life (EQ-5D) of the elderly with osteoporotic HF. METHODS: A prospective observational study was made in people over 65 years of age with HF between October 2017 and November 2018. Clinical information was collected from the digital medical record and the scales were measured by telephone at four times: baseline, one month, six months and twelve months. Statistical analysis was made thanks to SPSS vs 25.0. Multivariate analysis was performed using a generalized linear model for repeated measures to determine the relationship of risk factors with functionality and quality of life. RESULTS: Functionality showed significant differences (p<0.001) between baseline measurement and one month (90 points vs 50); baseline and at twelve months (90 vs 60 points); and that of the month and at twelve months (50 points vs 60). Quality of life also presented significant differences (p<0.001) between baseline and one month (0.587 vs 0.113); and baseline and twelve months (0.220). The functionality should be in transfused and with high surgical risk (p<0.05) and the quality of life will arrive in high surgical risk (p=0.017). Those older than 85 years were the ones who recovered the least after one year, as well as patients with delirium on admission and those who received transfusions. Patients with iron therapy recovered better at six months compared to those who did not and maintained this improvement at twelve months. CONCLUSIONS: Among the main risk factors are advanced age, male sex, transfused, high surgical risk, delirium on admission and malnutrition.
