31004109|t|Serum GM3(d18:1-16:0) and GM3(d18:1-24:1) levels may be associated with lymphoma: An exploratory study with haematological diseases.
31004109|a|GM3 (monosialodihexosylganglioside) is a type of ganglioside, which is a molecule composed of ceramide and oligosaccharide containing one or more sialic acids. Since GM3 is abundantly expressed in blood cells, we investigated the association between GM3 molecular species and haematological diseases. We measured the serum levels of seven GM3 molecular species in subjects with various haematological diseases (n = 52) and healthy subjects (n = 24) using a liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry technique as an exploratory study. In all the subjects with haematological diseases, GM3(d18:1-16:0) were inversely correlated with the erythrocytes counts. Regarding the difference in serum GM3 molecular species levels among each haematological diseases and healthy subjects, the levels of GM3(d18:1-16:0) and GM3(d18:1-24:1) were higher in the lymphoid neoplasm group than healthy subjects. Principal component analyses also revealed that the GM3(d18:1-16:0) and GM3(d18:1-24:1) levels were significant contributing factors for discriminating the lymphoid neoplasm group. Moreover, in the lymphoid neoplasm group, the GM3(d18:1-16:0) levels were significantly and positively correlated with the levels of C-reactive protein, soluble interleukin-2 receptor, and lactate dehydrogenase. In conclusion, in our exploratory study with haematological diseases, GM3 molecular species showed different distribution among disease groups, and serum GM3(d18:1-16:0) and GM3(d18:1-24:1) might be associated with lymphoma.
