34499343|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is associated with a variety of adverse healthcare outcomes but is highly predictable, preventable and treatable. For this reason, numerous guidelines have been developed for delirium recognition, prevention and management across different countries and disciplines. Although research is adduced as evidence for these guidelines, a constant finding is the lack of implementation if they exist at all. Implementation is a human behaviour that can be influenced by various factors including culture at a micro- and macro-level. Hofstede's model proposes that national cultures vary along six consistent dimensions. AIM: Using this model, we examined the nature of delirium guidelines across countries in relation to Hofstede's six cultural dimensions. METHODS: Data collected for each country on: the six dimensions of Hofstede's model, number of delirium guidelines approved by a National professional body of each country (through searching databases), the annual old-age dependency ratio for each country. RESULTS: Sixty-four countries had the completed six dimensions of Hofstede's model. Twenty of them (31%) had one or more delirium guidelines. The total number of different delirium guidelines was 45. Countries with formal delirium guidelines have significantly lower power distance among their members, are more individualistic societies, have lower levels of uncertainty avoidance and higher old-age dependency ratio compared to those without delirium guidelines. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The development and implementation of delirium guidelines vary across countries. Specific combinations of cultural dimensions influence the production of delirium guidelines. Understanding these important cultural differences can facilitate more widespread acceptance and implementation of guidelines.
