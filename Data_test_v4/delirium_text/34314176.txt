34314176|t|Multiplex Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Amyloid Proteins in Human Plasma for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis.
34314176|a|Direct analysis of amyloid proteins in human plasma will promote rapid screening of brain amyloidosis, the earliest pathological signature of Alzheimer's disease. We developed a microflow liquid chromatography-targeted mass spectrometry assay for quantitation of four intact beta-amyloid proteins starting from 1 mL of human plasma samples. This method showed 90% accuracy for predicting brain amyloid using plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 values from 36 cognitively normal individuals in a prospective clinical study (raw data deposited in MassIVE, Data set ID MSV000087451). Our method may contribute to early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
