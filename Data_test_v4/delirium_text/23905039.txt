23905039|t|The clinical significance of delirium in the intensive care unit.
23905039|a|Delirium is prevalent among intensive care unit patients. It prolongs length of stay, increases costs, and is independently associated with higher mortality rates. While its specific biological pathways are largely unknown, environmental and iatrogenic determinants have been repeatedly recognized. Removal of the known triggers and pharmacologic intervention constitute available therapies. This review focuses on the clinical significance of delirium in critically ill patients, from its prevalence to its long-term impact, the ways that we have to diagnose it, and the available therapeutic options.
