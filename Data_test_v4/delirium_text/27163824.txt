27163824|t|Analysis of Cerebrospinal Fluid and [11C]PIB PET Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease with Updated Protocols.
27163824|a|BACKGROUND: Recently, a Korean research group suggested a consensus protocol, based on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study protocol but with modifications for minimizing the confounding factors, for the evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. OBJECTIVE: Here, we analyzed fluid and imaging biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Korean population. We used the updated protocol to propose a more accurate CSF biomarker value for the diagnosis of AD. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with AD and 30 cognitively normal controls (NC) were enrolled. CSF was collected from 55 subjects (patients with AD = 26, NC = 29) following the Korea consensus protocol. CSF biomarkers were measured using the INNO-BIA AlzBio3 immunoassay, and Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography (PET) scans were also performed. RESULTS: The cutoff values of CSF amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta42), total tau (t-Tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-Tau) proteins were 357.1 pg/ml, 83.35 pg/ml, and 38.00 pg/ml, respectively. The cutoff values of CSF t-Tau/Abeta42 and p-Tau/Abeta42 ratio- were 0.210 (sensitivity 100%, specificity 86.21%) and 0.1350 (sensitivity 88.46%, specificity of 92.86%). The concordance rate with PIB-PET was higher using the CSF t-Tau/Abeta42 ratio (kappa= 0.849, CI 0.71-0.99) than CSF Abeta42 alone (kappa= 0.703, CI 0.51-0.89). CONCLUSIONS: Here, we improved controversial factors associated with the previous CSF study protocol and suggested a new cutoff value for the diagnosis of AD. Our results showed good diagnostic performance for differentiation of AD. Thus, we expect our findings could be a cornerstone in the establishment and clinical application of biomarkers for AD diagnosis.
