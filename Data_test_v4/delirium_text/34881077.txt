34881077|t|Depression and Dementia in Older Adults: A Neuropsychological Review.
34881077|a|Depression and dementia are the most common neuropsychiatric disorders in the older adult population. There are a certain number of depressed patients who visit outpatient clinics because they suspect dementia due to similarities in the clinical symptoms in both disorders. Depressive symptoms associated with dementia may be diagnosed with depression, and treatment with antidepressants is continued for a long time. Depression and dementia differ in their treatment approaches and subsequent courses, and it is necessary to carefully differentiate between the two in the clinical practice of dementia treatment. In this review, I describe the similarities between depression and dementia and how to differentiate depression in dementia treatment based on the differences and emphasize that there is a significant potential to cure depression, in contrast to dementia, for which there is currently no fundamental therapy. Therefore, it is important to recognize that depression and dementia may present with common symptoms and to appropriately differentiate depressed patients who are suspected of having dementia. Dementia is a disorder in which cognitive dysfunction is caused by a variety of causative diseases and conditions, resulting in impairment of activities of daily living. However, current medical science has had difficulty finding a cure for the causative disease. Based on clinical findings, it has also been shown that the degree of symptoms for preexisting psychiatric disorders is alleviated as the brain ages. In the presence of dementia, the speed of the alleviation will increase. The importance of focusing on the positive aspects of aging is also discussed.
