39511487|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common human neurodegenerative disorder worldwide. Owing to its chronic nature, our limited understanding of its pathophysiological mechanisms, and because of the lack of effective anti-AD drugs, AD represents a significant socio-economic challenge for all industrialized countries. Neuronal cell death is a key factor in AD pathogenesis and recent studies have suggested that neuronal ferroptosis may play a major patho-physiological role. Since ferroptosis involves free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation, we hypothesized that enteral administration of the radical scavenger butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) might slow down or even prevent the development of AD-related symptoms in an in vivo animal AD model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we employed the rat model of streptozotocin-induced AD and administered butylated hydroxytoluene orally at a dose of 120 mg/kg body weight. Following BHT treatment, neuronal cell death was induced by bilateral stereotactic intraventricular injection of streptozotocin at a dose of 3.0 mg/kg body weight. Three weeks after surgery, we assessed the learning capabilities and the short-term memory of three experimental groups using the conventional y-maze test: (i) streptozotocin-treated rats (BHT pre-treatment), (ii) streptozotocin-treated rats (no BHT pre-treatment), (iii) sham-operated rats (BHT pre-treatment but no streptozotocin administration). After the y-maze test, the animals were sacrificed, hippocampal tissue was prepared and several biochemical (malonyl dialdehyde formation, glutathione homeostasis, gene expression patterns) and histochemical (Congo-red staining, Nissl staining, Perls staining) readout parameters were quantified. RESULTS: Intraventricular streptozotocin injection induced the development of AD-related symptoms, elevated the degree of lipid peroxidation and upregulated the expression of ferroptosis-related genes. Histochemical analysis indicated neuronal cell death and neuroinflammation, which were paralleled by aberrant intraneuronal iron deposition. The streptozotocin-induced alterations were significantly reduced and sometimes even abolished by oral BHT treatment. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that oral BHT treatment attenuated the development of AD-related symptoms in an in vivo rat model, most probably via inhibiting neuronal ferroptosis. These findings suggest that BHT might constitute a promising candidate as anti-AD drug. However, more work is needed to explore the potential applicability of BHT in other models of neurodegeneration and in additional ferroptosis-related disorders.
