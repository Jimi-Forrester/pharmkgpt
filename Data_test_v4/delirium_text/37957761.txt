37957761|a|BACKGROUND: Elevated cardiac biomarkers, such as high-sensitivity cardiac Troponin T and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide improve the prediction of major adverse cardiac events. However, very few trials have investigated the association between perioperative cardiac injury and non-cardiac complications. The primary aim of this study was to determine the association between peri-operative myocardial injury and non-cardiac complications in patients undergoing vascular surgery. Additionally, the association between elevated pre-operative high-sensitivity cardiac Troponin T or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and non-cardiac complications was explored. METHODS: This study is a post hoc analysis of a multicentre randomised controlled trial. Patients were recruited from three centres in Sweden between 2016 and 2019. Cardiac troponin level was measured pre-operatively and at 4, 24, and 48 h after the start of surgery in patients undergoing vascular surgery. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide was measured pre-operatively. The primary outcome was a composite of major postoperative non-cardiac complications assessed at 30 days. RESULTS: A total of 184 patients undergoing peripheral or aortic vascular surgery were included in this study. The primary endpoint occurred in 67 (36%) patients. Perioperative myocardial injury was significantly associated with non-cardiac complications, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 2.71 (95% confidence interval 1.33-5.55, P = 0.01). Sensitivity and specificity were 0.40 and 0.81, respectively. No association was found between pre-operative hs-cTnT or NT-proBNP and non-cardiac complications. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, we found that new peri-operative myocardial injury is associated with an increased risk of non-cardiac complications within 30 days after index surgery in patients undergoing vascular surgery. Pre-operative high-sensitivity cardiac Troponin T or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide did not appear to predict non-cardiac complications. Larger studies are needed to confirm our findings.
