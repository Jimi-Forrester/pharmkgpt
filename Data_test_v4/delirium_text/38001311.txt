38001311|a|PURPOSE: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) suffers from brain functional reorganization and developmental delays during childhood, but the underlying neurodevelopmental mechanism is unclear. This paper aims to investigate the intra- and internetwork functional connectivity (FC) changes, and their relationships with developmental delays in PWS children. METHODS: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets of PWS children and healthy controls (HCs) were acquired. Independent component analysis was used to acquire core resting-state networks (RSNs). The intra- and internetwork FC patterns were then investigated. RESULTS: In terms of intranetwork FC, children with PWS had lower FC in the dorsal attention network, the auditory network, the medial visual network (VN) and the sensorimotor network (SMN) than HCs (FWE-corrected, p < 0.05). In terms of internetwork FC, PWS children had decreased FC between the following pairs of regions: posterior default mode network (DMN) and anterior DMN; posterior DMN and SMN; SMN and posterior VN and salience network and medial VN (FDR-corrected, p < 0.05). Partial correlation analyses revealed that the intranetwork FC patterns were positively correlated with developmental quotients in PWS children, while the internetwork FC patterns were completely opposite (p < 0.05). Intranetwork FC patterns showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.947, with a sensitivity of 96.15% and a specificity of 81.25% for differentiating between PWS and HCs. CONCLUSION: Impaired intra- and internetwork FC patterns in PWS children are associated with developmental delays, which may result from neural pathway dysfunctions. Intranetwork FC reorganization patterns can discriminate PWS children from HCs. REGISTRATION NUMBER ON THE CHINESE CLINICAL TRAIL REGISTRY: ChiCTR2100046551.
