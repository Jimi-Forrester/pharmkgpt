33081371|a|BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data report that male hypogonadism may play a role in cognitive impairment in elderly. However, the effect of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) on cognitive abilities in this cluster of patients has not been well established. Methods. PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched by using free text words and medical subject headings terms related with "male hypogonadism", "late-onset hypogonadism", elderly, cognition, "mild cognitive impairment", memory, "testosterone replacement therapy" used in various combinations according to the specific clinical questions. Original articles, reviews, and randomized controlled trials written in English were selected. Results. A long-term TRT could improve specific cognitive functions, such as verbal and spatial memory, cognitive flexibility, and physical vitality. However, randomized controlled trials do not provide positive results, and in most of the cases TRT might not induce beneficial effects on cognitive function in elderly men. Discussion and conclusions. Since the lengthening of life expectancy, the prevalence rate of cognitive decline in elderly men is expected to increase remarkably over the next decade with considerable healthcare and economical concerns. Therefore, this remains a relevant clinical topic and further investigations are needed for clarifying the role of TRT especially in elderly men with hypogonadism.
