36936879|a|Oxidation products gradually accumulate during senescence, enhancing the risk of onset of many severe diseases. One such disease is dementia, and the number of cases of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, has been increasing world-wide. These diseases can be prevented via attenuation of age-related physiological dysfunction; one preventive approach is the ingestion of antioxidants such as vitamin C and vitamin E. Many antioxidants are readily available commercially. Ingestion of mixed antioxidants is expected to provide further beneficial effects for human health. In this study, we used vitamin E-deficient mice as an animal model of increased oxidative stress and assessed the effects of dosing with mixed antioxidants. Administration of a commercial mixed antioxidant formula, Twendee X significantly improved cognitive function and coordination compared to untreated vitamin E-deficient animals. Furthermore, the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor were significantly increased in the cerebral cortex of Twendee X-dosed vitamin E-deficient mice compared to untreated animals. These results indicate that intake of a mixed antioxidant supplement may be beneficial to human health, even after oxidative stress has begun. In the next stage, it will be necessary to compare with other antioxidants and consider whether it is effective in the aged model.
