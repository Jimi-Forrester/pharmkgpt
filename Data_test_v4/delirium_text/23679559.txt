23679559|t|Tranilast binds to abeta monomers and promotes abeta fibrillation.
23679559|a|The antiallergy and potential anticancer drug tranilast has been patented for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD), in which amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) plays a key pathogenic role. We used solution NMR to determine that tranilast binds to Abeta40 monomers with ~300 muM affinity. Remarkably, tranilast increases Abeta40 fibrillation more than 20-fold in the thioflavin T assay at a 1:1 molar ratio, as well as significantly reducing the lag time. Tranilast likely promotes fibrillation by shifting Abeta monomer conformations to those capable of seed formation and fibril elongation. Molecular docking results qualitatively agree with NMR chemical shift perturbation, which together indicate that hydrophobic interactions are the major driving force of the Abeta-tranilast interaction. These data suggest that AD may be a potential complication for tranilast usage in elderly patients.
