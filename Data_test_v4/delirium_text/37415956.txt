37415956|a|Accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) is linked with development or aggravation of many degenerative processes or disorders. Fruit vinegars are rich in polyphenols that can be a good dietary source of AGEs inhibitors. In this study, eight kinds of vinegars were prepared. Among them, the highest polyphenol and flavonoid content were orange vinegar and kiwi fruit vinegar, respectively. Ferulic acid, vanillic acid, chlorogenic acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, catechin, and epicatechin were main polyphenols in eight fruit vinegars. Then, we measured the inhibitory effect of eight fruit vinegars on fluorescent AGEs, and found that orange vinegar had the highest inhibitory rate. Data here suggested that orange vinegar and its main components catechin, epicatechin, and p-coumaric acid could effectively reduce the level of ROS, RAGE, NADPH and inflammatory factors in Caco-2 cells. Our research provided theoretical basis for the application of orange vinegar as AGEs inhibitor.
