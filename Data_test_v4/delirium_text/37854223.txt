37854223|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the risk factors for the occurrence of postoperative hyperactive delirium after laparoscopic radical gastrectomy under general anesthesia in patients with gastric cancer. METHODS: The clinical data of 280 gastric cancer patients who underwent laparoscopic radical gastrectomy under general anesthesia in First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University from January 2020 to June 2023 were retrospectively analyzed, and the types and incidence of postoperative delirium were recorded. The factors influencing the occurrence of postoperative hyperactive delirium were analyzed. RESULTS: Multi-factor logistic regression analysis showed that older age, high dosage of anesthetic drug consumption, high American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification (or ASA grade 3-4), long Post-anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) stay, and long extubation time were independent risk factors for the occurrence of hyperactive delirium after laparoscopic radical gastrectomy (OR > 1, P < 0.05). The area under the curve of the nomogram was used to predict the occurrence of hyperactive delirium after laparoscopic radical gastrectomy under general anesthesia was 0.903 (95% CI: 0.846-0.978). CONCLUSION: Older age, high dosage of anesthetic drug consumption, high ASA classification (or ASA grade 3-4), long PACU stay, and long extubation time were independent risk factors affecting the occurrence of hyperactive delirium after laparoscopic radical gastrectomy under general anesthesia.
