38368377|a|BACKGROUND/AIM: To investigate the independent relationships of visual impairment (VI) and Subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) with physical function impairment (PFI) and the interaction effect between VI and SCC on PFI in American older adults. METHODS: The data of this cross-sectional study was obtained from the 2005-2008 National Health and Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted in the United States. The VI criterion included both subjective self-reported eyesight conditions and objective visual acuity test results. The self-reported questionnaires were utilized to determine PFI and SCC. According to the survey design of NHANS, original data were weighted to produce nationally representative estimates. Both the unweighted original data and weighted estimates underwent analysis. Crude and adjusted logistic models were employed to assess the pairwise associations among VI, SCC, and PFI. To assess the interactive effect, measures such as the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), attributable proportion due to interaction (AP), and synergy index (S) were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 2,710 subjects (weighted n = 38,966,687) aged 60 years or older were included. Compared with subjects without subjective visual impairment (SVI), those with SVI had a significant positive association with PFI [weighted OR (95%CI): 3.11 (2.25, 4.31)]. After multi-variable adjusting, the relationship remained significant [weighted OR (95%CI): 1.90 (1.32, 2.72)]. Similarly, those with objective visual impairment (OVI) were positively associated with the risk of PFI in the crude model [weighted OR (95%CI): 2.35 (1.53, 3.61)] and adjusted model [weighted OR (95%CI): 1.84 (1.07, 3.17)]. Moreover, we found the association of SCC with an increased risk of FPI [crude weighted OR (95%CI): 5.02 (3.40, 7.40); adjusted weighted OR (95%CI): 3.29 (2.01, 5.38)]. Ultimately, the additive interaction showed there was a significant positive interaction term between SVI and SCC on PFI, while OVI and SCC did not. CONCLUSION: Both VI and SCC were significantly associated with PFI in elder adults. Besides, there was a significant synergistic interaction between SVI and SCC on PFI, which indicated the improvement of SVI and SCC may be beneficial for the prevention of PFI. For the elderly, especially those with multiple disabilities, comprehensive and targeted approaches are imperative to foster their overall well-being and health.
