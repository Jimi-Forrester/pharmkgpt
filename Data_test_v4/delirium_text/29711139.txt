29711139|a|The cooperative action of three proteases is required to process the APP protein (695-770 amino acids) into small beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta, 40-42 amino acids). Abeta aggregates are found in the senile plaques of patients with Alzheimer's disease and play a major role in the onset of this disorder. The functional analysis of several factors that contribute to the production and aggregation of Abeta has enhanced our knowledge of the mechanism of amyloid formation and increased the potential for effective therapeutic treatment.
