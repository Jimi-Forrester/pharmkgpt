39445560|a|Pediatric intensive care medicine is a rapidly evolving field of medicine, with recent publication of landmark papers specific for the pediatric population. Progress has been made in modes of mechanical ventilation, including noninvasive ventilation in pediatric ARDS and after extubation failure, with updated guidelines on ventilator liberation. Improved technology and advancements in hemodynamic support allow for better care of our patients with heart disease. Sepsis burden in children remains high and continued efforts are made to improve survival. A nutritional plan with a tailored approach, focusing on individualized needs, could offer benefits for our patients. Sedation practices and guidelines have been updated, focusing on minimizing delirium and facilitating early mobility. This manuscript highlights some of the most recent advances and updates.
