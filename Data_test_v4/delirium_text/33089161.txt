33089161|t|Sleep in Hospitalized Patients.
33089161|a|Hospitalized patients frequently have disordered and poor-quality sleep due to a variety of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. These include frequent nighttime intrusions, insomnia related to pain and unfamiliar environments, dark conditions during the day with loss of natural light, and disruption of the natural sleep cycle due to illness. Sleep wake disturbances can result in a deleterious consequence on physical, emotional, and cognitive status, which may impact patient satisfaction, clinical recovery, and hospital length of stay. Despite this, clinicians frequently fail to document sleep disturbances and are generally unaware of the best practices to improve sleep quality in the hospital. A PubMed search was conducted using the terms: ("sleep and hospitalized patients") and ("sleep and hospitalization") to review the published data on the topic of sleep in hospitalized medical patients. The search was limited to English-language articles published between 2000 and 2018. Subsequent PubMed searches were performed to clarify the data described in the initial search, including the terms "hospital sleep protocols," "hospitalized patients sleep documentation," and "hospitalized patients sleep quality". The purpose of this review is to discuss sleep disturbances in hospitalized patients with a focus on causes of sleep disturbance, the effect of poor-quality sleep, high risk populations, considerations for surveillance and prevention, and pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic options for treatment.
