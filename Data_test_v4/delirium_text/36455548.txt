36455548|a|BACKGROUND: The Institute for Healthcare Improvement's 4-Ms framework of care for older adults recommends a multidisciplinary assessment of a patient's Medications, Mentation, Mobility, and What Matters Most. Electronic health record (EHR) systems were developed prior to this emphasis on the 4-Ms. We sought to understand how healthcare providers across the healthcare system perceive their EHRs and to identify any current best practices and ideas for improvement regarding integration of the 4-Ms. METHODS: Anonymous survey of healthcare providers who care for older adults. The survey aimed to evaluate efficiency, error tolerance, and satisfaction (usefulness and likeability). The survey was distributed through organizational list serves that focus on the care of older adults and through social media. RESULTS: Sixty-six respondents from all geographic segments of the U.S. (n = 62) and non-U.S. practices (n = 4) responded. Most (82%) were physicians. Respondents used a range of EHRs and 82% had >5 years of experience with their current EHR. Over half of respondents agreed that their EHR had easy to find contact information (56%) and advance directives. Finding a patient's prior cognitive status (26% agreement), goals of care (24%), functional status (14%), and multidisciplinary geriatric assessments (27%) was more difficult. Only 3% were satisfied with how their EHR handles geriatric syndromes. In free text responses, respondents (79%) described three areas that the EHR assists in the care of older adults: screening tied to actions or orders; advance care planning, and medication alerts or review. Common suggestions on how to improve the EHR included incorporating geriatric assessments in notes, establishing a unified place to review the 4-Ms, and creating age-specific best practice alerts. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of healthcare providers were not satisfied with how their EHR handles multidisciplinary geriatric assessment and geriatric care. EHR modifications would aide in reporting, communicating, and tracking the 4-Ms in EHRs.
