38312598|a|Aging is a complex and inevitable biological process affected by a combination of external environmental and genetic factors. Humans are currently living longer than ever before, accompanied with aging-related alterations such as diminished autophagy, decreased immunological function, mitochondrial malfunction, stem cell failure, accumulation of somatic and mitochondrial DNA mutations, loss of telomere, and altered nutrient metabolism. Aging leads to a decline in body functions and age-related diseases, for example, Alzheimer's disease, which adversely affects human health and longevity. The quality of life of the elderly is greatly diminished by the increase in their life expectancy rather than healthy life expectancy. With the rise in the age of the global population, aging and related diseases have become the focus of attention worldwide. In this review, we discuss several major mechanisms of aging, including DNA damage and repair, free radical oxidation, telomeres and telomerase, mitochondrial damage, inflammation, and their role in neurodegenerative diseases to provide a reference for the prevention of aging and its related diseases.
