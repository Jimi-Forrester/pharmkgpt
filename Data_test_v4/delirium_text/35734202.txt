35734202|t|Evaluation of Pediatric Delirium Awareness and Management in Pediatric Intensive Care Units in Turkey.
35734202|a|Delirium has been associated with prolonged pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) stay and mechanical ventilation times as well as high hospital costs and mortality rates. This work aimed to examine pediatric delirium awareness and delirium management in Turkey. A total of 19 physicians responsible for their respective PICUs completed the survey. Most of the units (57.9%) did not use any assessment tool. Varying measures were applied in different units to reduce the prevalence of delirium. The number of units that continuously measured noise was very low (15.8%). Eye mask and earpiece usage rates were also very low. In pharmacological treatment, haloperidol, dexmedetomidine, benzodiazepines, and atypical antipsychotics were the most preferred options. Some units have reached a sufficient level of pediatric delirium awareness and management. However, insufficiencies in delirium awareness and management remain in general.
