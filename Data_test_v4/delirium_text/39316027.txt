39316027|a|Diabetes is associated with cognitive impairment, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Methylglyoxal (MGO), a precursor to advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), is elevated in diabetes and linked to microvascular dysfunction. In this study, overexpression of the MGO-detoxifying enzyme glyoxalase 1 (Glo1) was used in a mouse model of diabetes to explore whether MGO accumulation in diabetes causes cognitive impairment. Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin. Fasting blood glucose, cognitive function, cerebral blood flow, neurovascular coupling (NVC), Glo1 activity, MGO and AGEs were assessed. In diabetes, MGO-derived hydroimidazolone-1 increased in the cortex, and was decreased in Glo1-overexpressing mice compared to controls. Visuospatial memory was decreased in diabetes, but not in Glo1/diabetes. NVC response time was slightly increased in diabetes, and normalised in the Glo1-overexpressing group. No impact of diabetes or Glo1 overexpression on blood-brain barrier integrity or vascular density was observed. Diabetes induced a mild visuospatial memory impairment and slightly reduced NVC response speed and these effects were mitigated by Glo1. This study shows a link between MGO-related AGE accumulation and cerebrovascular/cognitive functions in diabetes. Modulation of the MGO-Glo1 pathway may be a novel intervention strategy in patients with diabetes who have cerebrovascular complications. KEY POINTS: Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of stroke, cognitive decline, depression and Alzheimer's disease, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Methylglyoxal (MGO), a highly reactive by-product of glycolysis, plays an important role in the development of diabetes-associated microvascular dysfunction in the periphery and is detoxified by the enzyme glyoxalase 1. Diabetes reduced visuospatial memory in mice and slowed the neurovascular coupling response speed, which was improved by overexpression of glyoxalase 1. MGO formation and MGO-derived advanced glycation endproduct (AGE) accumulation in the brain of diabetic mice are associated with a slight reduction in neurovascular coupling and mild cognitive impairment. The endogenous formation of MGO, and the accumulation of MGO-derived AGEs, might be a potential target in reducing the risk of vascular cognitive impairment in people with diabetes.
