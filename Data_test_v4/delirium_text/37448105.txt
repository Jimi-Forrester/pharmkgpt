37448105|a|BACKGROUND: One-fourth of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients suffer from cognitive impairment. However, few neuroimaging markers have been identified regarding cognitive impairment in PD. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the association between third ventricular width by transcranial sonography (TCS) and cognitive decline in PD. METHOD: Participants with PD were recruited from one medical center in China. Third ventricular width was assessed by TCS, and cognitive function was analyzed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and Cox model analysis were utilized to determine the diagnostic and predictive accuracy of third ventricular width by TCS for cognitive decline in PD patients. RESULT: A total of 174 PD patients were recruited. Third ventricular width was negatively correlated with MMSE scores. ROC analysis suggested that the optimal cutoff point for third ventricular width in screening for cognitive impairment in PD was 4.75 mm (sensitivity 62.7%; specificity 75.6%). After 21.5 (18.0, 26.0) months of follow-up in PD patients without cognitive impairment, it was found that those with a third ventricular width greater than 4.75 mm exhibited a 7.975 times higher risk of developing cognitive impairment [hazard ratio = 7.975, 95% CI 1.609, 39.532, p = 0.011] compared with patients with a third ventricular width less than 4.75 mm. CONCLUSION: Third ventricular width based on TCS emerged as an independent predictor of developing cognitive impairment in PD patients.
