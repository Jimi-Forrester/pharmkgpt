28492059|t|Severity of memory impairment in the elderly: Association with health care resource use and functional limitations in the United States.
28492059|a|INTRODUCTION: Dementia is a prevalent condition in older adults associated with decline in cognitive and functional abilities and substantial burden. This study assessed the prevalence and impact of subjective memory impairment in the United States. METHODS: The 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a population-based, nationally representative survey, was analyzed. Data included medical examinations, self-reported cognitive and functional limitations, and health care utilization over 1 year. Participants were aged >=65 years and completed both interview and medical examination components. Descriptive analyses of patient characteristics were performed, and complex survey regression models were used to test associations. RESULTS: Of 2431 survey participants included, 53.1% had no memory impairment, 40.1% had early-stage memory impairment, and 6.6% had late-stage memory impairment. In adjusted analyses, late-stage versus no impairment was associated with more functional limitations (odds ratio [OR] = 7.26, P < .001), greater health care utilization (OR = 2.46, P < .001), and higher likelihood of seeing a mental health specialist (OR = 3.06, P = .001). DISCUSSION: Consistent with previous research, individuals with late-stage memory impairment had significantly greater functional limitations and higher health care utilization versus individuals with early-stage or no memory impairment.
