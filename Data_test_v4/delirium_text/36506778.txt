36506778|t|An X-linked PLXNB3 mutation identified in patients with congenital heart disease with neurodevelopmental disabilities.
36506778|a|Background: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect and is often accompanied by neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD) which increase the associated mortality. Plexin families are known to play a key role in the development of heart and the occurrence of neurodevelopmental anomalies. However, there has been no report of PLXNB3 mutation in isolated CHD or CHD with concomitant NDD. Methods: We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on a proband with CHD with neurodevelopmental anomalies and his family members. Targeted sequencing, conservation analysis, AlphaFold, and PyRosetta were performed to identify more pathogenic mutations of PLXNB3. Scratch wound assay, Ki-67 assessment by flow cytometry, and gene expression analysis of heart development related pathway by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were conducted after 24 h transfection in AC16 and HEK293T to investigate the effect of the target mutation. Results: We identified a pathogenic mutation in the X-linked PLXNB3 gene (c.A4319T p.E1440V). In addition, we found 4 other pathogenic mutations in a cohort of 75 patients with sporadic CHD with NDD. AlphaFold and PyRosetta predicted that these 4 mutations could cause dramatic changes of the PLXNB3 protein structure (root-mean-square deviation score >10 A). Further functional analysis revealed that this p.E1440V variant inhibits cell migration and proliferation, and affects the activity of key factors in the Notch signaling pathway, myocardial contraction pathway, and neurodevelopmental pathways. Conclusions: These findings suggest that PLXNB3 and the p.E1440V variant may be related to the pathogenesis of CHD associated with NDD.
