37903878|t|Personalized relapse prediction in patients with major depressive disorder using digital biomarkers.
37903878|a|Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic illness wherein relapses contribute to significant patient morbidity and mortality. Near-term prediction of relapses in MDD patients has the potential to improve outcomes by helping implement a 'predict and preempt' paradigm in clinical care. In this study, we developed a novel personalized (N-of-1) encoder-decoder anomaly detection-based framework of combining anomalies in multivariate actigraphy features (passive) as triggers to utilize an active concurrent self-reported symptomatology questionnaire (core symptoms of depression and anxiety) to predict near-term relapse in MDD. The framework was evaluated on two independent longitudinal observational trials, characterized by regular bimonthly (every other month) in-person clinical assessments, weekly self-reported symptom assessments, and continuous activity monitoring data with two different wearable sensors for >= 1 year or until the first relapse episode. This combined passive-active relapse prediction framework achieved a balanced accuracy of >= 71%, false alarm rate of <= 2.3 alarm/patient/year with a median relapse detection time of 2-3 weeks in advance of clinical onset in both studies. The study results suggest that the proposed personalized N-of-1 prediction framework is generalizable and can help predict a majority of MDD relapses in an actionable time frame with relatively low patient and provider burden.
