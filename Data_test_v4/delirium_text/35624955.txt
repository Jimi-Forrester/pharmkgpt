35624955|t|Music Interventions and Delirium in Adults: A Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis.
35624955|a|Delirium is a neuropsychiatric syndrome represented by an acute disturbance in attention, awareness and cognition, highly prevalent in older, and critically ill patients, and associated with poor outcomes. This review synthesized existing evidence on the effectiveness of music interventions on delirium in adults, and music interventions (MIs), psychometric assessments and outcome measures used. We searched MEDLINE, PsychINFO, SCOPUS, Clinical Trials and CENTRAL for quantitative designs comparing any MIs to standard care or another intervention. From 1150 studies 12 met the inclusion criteria, and 6 were included in the meta-analysis. Narrative synthesis showed that most studies focused on prevention, few assessed delirium severity, with the majority of studies reporting beneficial effects. The summary relative risk for incident delirium comparing music vs. no music in postsurgical and critically ill older patients was 0.52 (95% confidential interval (CI): 0.20-1.35, I2 = 79.1%, heterogeneity <0.0001) for the random effects model and 0.47 (95% CI: 0.34-0.66) using the fixed effects model. Music listening interventions were more commonly applied than music therapy delivered by credentialed music therapists, and delirium assessments methods were heterogeneous, including both standardized tools and systematic observations. Better designed studies are needed addressing effectiveness of MIs in specific patient subgroups, exploring the correlations between intervention-types/dosages and delirium symptoms.
