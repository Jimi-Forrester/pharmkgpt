36160850|a|One of the most prevalent posttranscriptional modifications of eukaryotic mRNA is the RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) regulator, which plays a significant role in various illnesses. The involvement of m6A regulators in osteoarthritis (OA) is not fully known. By comparing nonosteoarthritic and osteoarthritic patients, 26 important m6A regulators were identified from the gene expression omnibus GSE48556 dataset. Seven candidate m6A regulators (IGFBP3, WTAP, IGFBP1, HNRNPC, RBM15B, YTHDC1, and METTL3) were screened using a random forest model to assess the likelihood of OA. A column line graph model founded on seven m6A modulator candidates was created. According to decision curve analysis, patients might profit from the column line graph model. Based on chosen relevant m6A modifiers, a consensus clustering approach was utilized to categorize OA into two m6A categories (group A and group B). To measure the m6A pattern, a principal component analysis technique was created to generate the m6A score for every sample. Cluster A patients exhibited more excellent m6A scores than cluster B patients. Furthermore, we discovered that patients with lower and higher m6A scores had varied immunological responses using the m6A type. At last, m6A regulators contribute significantly to the progression of OA. Our research on m6A patterns might help to guide further OA immunotherapeutic techniques.
