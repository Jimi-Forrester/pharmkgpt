17272893|t|Tau and tauopathies.
17272893|a|Tau protein is a neuronal microtubule-associated protein (MAP), which localizes primarily in the axon. It is one of the major and most widely distributed MAPs in the central nervous system. Its biochemistry and molecular pathology is being increasingly studied. Tau is a key component of neurofbrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Disorders with neuronal, oligodendroglial or astrocytic filamentous tau inclusions are now grouped under the common rubric of tauopathies. The discovery of mutations in the tau gene, located on Chromosome 17 and its relationship to frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism (FTDP-17) has enhanced the importance of tau protein in cognitive neurology. Aberrant aggregates of tau have been documented in most of the neurodegenerative diseases with filamentous inclusions. The role of cerebrospinal fluid tau in the diagnosis of dementias is being investigated quite extensively. Recently, it has been shown that Abeta immunotherapy leads to the clearance of early tau pathology. It is becoming clearer that understanding tau better will lead to better understanding of many neurodegenerative diseases that may help develop interventional strategies.
