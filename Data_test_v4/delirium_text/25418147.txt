25418147|a|INTRODUCTION: The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetics are an established therapeutic option for patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the properties of the GLP-1 mimetics go beyond the strict metabolic control of the patients with diabetes. The neuroprotective effects of GLP-1 have been shown in recent studies opening new areas of research in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), among others. AIM. Systematic review including experimental studies and human clinical trials demonstrating the neuroprotective properties of GLP-1 mimetics in AD. DEVELOPMENT: The experimental studies that have been conducted in rodent models of AD have demonstrated the neuroprotective properties of GLP-1 in the central nervous system reducing beta-amyloid plaques, the oxidative stress and the inflammatory brain response. Clinical trials in patients with cognitive impairment and AD testing the effects of GLP-1 analogs have recently started. CONCLUSION: The GLP-1 analogs have neuroprotective properties. Considering that type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia, the benefits of GLP-1 mimetics on cognition must be considered. Likewise, the GLP-1 mimetics represent a promising treatment for neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.
