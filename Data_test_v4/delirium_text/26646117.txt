26646117|t|Rapidly Versus Slowly Progressing Patients With Alzheimer's Disease: Differences in Baseline Cognition.
26646117|a|Rate of progression of cognitive deficits is variable among patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of the current study was to compare demographic characteristics and performance on neuropsychological measures at baseline evaluation between rapidly and slowly progressing patients. Participants were divided into 2 groups based on change in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale score from baseline to 2-year follow-up, and baseline performance was compared between the groups. Participants were 55 rapidly progressing and 55 slowly progressing patients with probable AD who had a follow-up evaluation 21 to 27 months after the baseline evaluation. The groups differed in age and initial Clinical Dementia Rating. Performance differed significantly between the groups on Verbal Series Attention Test time, Logical Memory I, Visual Reproduction I, Block Design, and Controlled Oral Word Association Test. Differences were found between rapidly and slowly progressing patients on baseline neuropsychological testing.
