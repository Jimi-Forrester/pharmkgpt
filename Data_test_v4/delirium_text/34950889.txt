34950889|t|Minimally invasive protocols and quantification for microglia-mediated perineuronal net disassembly in mouse brain.
34950889|a|Enzymatic digestion of the extracellular matrix with chondroitinase-ABC reinstates juvenile-like plasticity in the adult cortex as it also disassembles the perineuronal nets (PNNs). The disadvantage of the enzyme is that it must be applied intracerebrally and it degrades the ECM for several weeks. Here, we provide two minimally invasive and transient protocols for microglia-enabled PNN disassembly in mouse cortex: repeated treatment with ketamine-xylazine-acepromazine (KXA) anesthesia and 60-Hz light entrainment. We also discuss how to analyze PNNs within microglial endosomes-lysosomes. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Venturino et al. (2021).
