34075546|a|PURPOSE: COVID-19 disease is a declared pandemic, affecting all aspects of healthcare, including orthopedics. The aim of this study is to describe the COVID-19 orthopedic trauma patients characteristics and management in a dedicated Orthopedic and Traumatology Hospital in Italy during the first pandemic period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cohort of 25 consecutive patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection were retrospectively analyzed. Health system rearrangement, patients' clinical presentation, diagnostic tools role, laboratory finding, treatment and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Health system rearrangement was fast. There was no clear prevalence of comorbidity or surgery type between confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases. Nine positive swabs tests and 14 cases with only suspected CT scan findings were recorded. Several laboratory changes have been reported since the onset of symptoms: anemia, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, coagulation abnormalities, alkaline phosphatase, liver enzymes and C-reactive protein alterations. Nineteen patients were treated by oxygen supplement, three patients were administered antivirals, eight antibiotic therapy, and nine hydroxychloroquine. The number of discharges reported in this study was greater than 52% and the number of deaths reached 20%. CONCLUSION: To our experience, the development of patient management algorithms allows the differentiation of the clinical pathways of negative and suspected/positive patients, reducing exposure, and virus spreading. The execution of swabs on all patients allows an early diagnosis and a more adequate management. Considering the different therapy patterns used, there were no significant differences, but anti-thromboembolic prophylaxis administered to all the orthopedic patients may have contributed to complications and mortality rates reduction.
