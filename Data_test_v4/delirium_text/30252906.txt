30252906|a|BACKGROUND: There is strong association of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology with gait disorder and falls in older adults without dementia. The goal of the study was to examine the prevalence and severity of AD pathology in older adults without dementia who fall and sustain hip fracture. METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained from 168 hip fracture patients. CSF Abeta42/40 ratio, p-tau, and t-tau measures were dichotomized into normal vs. abnormal, and categorized according to the A/T/N classification. RESULTS: Among the hip fracture patients, 88.6% of the cognitively normal (Clinical Dementia Rating-CDR 0; n = 70) and 98.8% with mild cognitive impairment (CDR 0.5; n = 81) fell in the abnormal biomarker categories by the A/T/N classification. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of older hip fracture patients have CSF evidence of AD pathology. Preoperative determination of AD biomarkers may play a crucial role in identifying persons without dementia who have underlying AD pathology in perioperative settings.
