30112462|t|An Analysis of Whether Health Literacy and Numeracy Are Associated with Diabetes Medication Adherence.
30112462|a|Many people with type 2 diabetes do not take medications as prescribed, resulting in suboptimal glycemic control and a greater risk of diabetes complications. Taking medications regularly requires adequate health literacy and numeracy skills, but associations between health literacy and numeracy skills and medication taking are mixed. We used validated, reliable, and widely accepted measures to examine the relationship between health literacy, numeracy, and medication adherence among a sample of patients with T2D. We analyzed cross-sectional data using non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-tests and unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models. For every one point increase on the Brief Health Literacy Screen and Subjective Numeracy Scale, participants were 1.8 and 2.7 times more likely to optimally take medications (p < 0.05). Health literacy and numeracy skills should be considered in the design of education materials for medication management and adherence among people with T2D.
