36255152|t|Tactile stimulation improves cognition, motor, and anxiety-like behaviors and attenuates the Alzheimer's disease pathology in adult APPNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice.
36255152|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the largest health crises in the world. There are limited pharmaceutical interventions to treat AD, however, and most of the treatment options are not for cure or prevention, but rather to slow down the progression of the disease. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of tactile stimulation (TS) on AD-like symptoms and pathology in APPNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice, a mouse model of AD. The results show that TS reduces the AD-like symptoms on tests of cognition, motor, and anxiety-like behaviors and these improvements in behavior are associated with reduced AD pathology in APP mice. Thus, TS appears to be a promising noninvasive strategy for slowing the onset of dementia in aging animals.
