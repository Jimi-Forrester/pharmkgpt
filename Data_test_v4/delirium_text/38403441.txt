38403441|a|The dipeptide gamma-glutamylcysteine (gamma-GC), the first intermediate of glutathione (GSH) synthesis, is considered as a promising drug to reduce or prevent plethora of age-related disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. The unusual gamma-linkage between the two constitutive amino acids, namely cysteine and glutamate, renders its chemical synthesis particularly challenging. Herein, we report on the metabolic engineering of the non-conventional yeast Yarrowia lipolytica for efficient gamma-GC synthesis. The yeast was first converted into a gamma-GC producer by disruption of gene GSH2 encoding GSH synthase and by constitutive expression of GSH1 encoding glutamylcysteine ligase. Subsequently genes involved in cysteine and glutamate anabolism, namely MET4, CYSE, CYSF, and GDH1 were overexpressed with the aim to increase their intracellular availability. With such a strategy, a gamma-GC titer of 464 nmol mg-1 protein (93 mg gDCW-1 ) was obtained within 24 h of cell growth.
