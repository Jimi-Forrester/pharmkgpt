25195912|t|Expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of acylpeptide hydrolase from Deinococcus radiodurans.
25195912|a|Acylpeptide hydrolase (APH; EC 3.4.19.1), which belongs to the S9 family of serine peptidases (MEROPS), catalyzes the removal of an N-acylated amino acid from a blocked peptide. The role of this enzyme in mammalian cells has been suggested to be in the clearance of oxidatively damaged proteins as well as in the degradation of the beta-amyloid peptides implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Detailed structural information for the enzyme has been reported from two thermophilic archaea; both of the archaeal APHs share a similar monomeric structure. However, the mechanisms of substrate selectivity and active-site accessibility are totally different and are determined by inter-domain flexibility or the oligomeric structure. An APH homologue from a bacterium, Deinococcus radiodurans (APHdr), has been crystallized using microbatch-under-oil employing the random microseed matrix screening method. The protein crystallized in space group P21, with unit-cell parameters a = 77.6, b = 189.6, c = 120.4 A, beta = 108.4 . A Matthews coefficient of 2.89 A(3) Da(-1) corresponds to four monomers, each with a molecular mass of ~73 kDa, in the asymmetric unit. The APHdr structure will reveal the mechanisms of substrate selectivity and active-site accessibility in the bacterial enzyme. It will also be helpful in elucidating the functional role of this enzyme in D. radiodurans.
