39468666|a|BACKGROUND: The prevalence of age-related disorders, particularly in neurological and cardiovascular systems, is an increasing global health concern. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy, particularly using human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (HUCMSCs), has shown promise in mitigating these disorders. This study investigates the effects of HUCMSCs on aging-related conditions in a senescence-accelerated mouse model (SAMP8), with a focus on DNA damage, gut microbiota alterations, and metabolic changes. METHODS: SAMP8 mice were treated with clinical-grade HUCMSCs via intraperitoneal injections. Behavioral and physical assessments were conducted to evaluate cognitive and motor functions. The Single-Strand Break Mapping at Nucleotide Genome Level (SSiNGLe) method was employed to assess DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) across the genome, with particular attention to exonic regions and transcription start sites. Gut microbiota composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing, and carboxyl metabolomic profiling was performed to identify changes in circulating metabolites. RESULTS: HUCMSC treatment significantly improved motor coordination and reduced anxiety in SAMP8 mice. SSiNGLe analysis revealed a notable reduction in DNA SSBs in MSC-treated mice, especially in critical genomic regions, suggesting that HUCMSCs may mitigate age-related DNA damage. The functional annotation of the DNA breaktome indicated a potential link between reduced DNA damage and altered metabolic pathways. Additionally, beneficial alterations in gut microbiota were observed, including an increase in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, which correlated with improved metabolic profiles. CONCLUSION: The administration of HUCMSCs in SAMP8 mice not only reduces DNA damage but also induces favorable changes in gut microbiota and metabolism. The observed alterations in DNA break patterns, along with specific changes in microbiota and metabolic profiles, suggest that these could serve as potential biomarkers for evaluating the efficacy of HUCMSCs in treating age-related disorders. This highlights a promising avenue for the development of new therapeutic strategies that leverage these biomarkers, to enhance the effectiveness of HUCMSC-based treatments for aging-associated diseases.
