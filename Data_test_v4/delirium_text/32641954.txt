32641954|t|An In-Vivo Study on Anticonvulsant, Anxiolytic, and Sedative-Hypnotic Effects of the Polyphenol-Rich Thymus Kotschyanus Extract; Evidence for the Involvement of GABAA Receptors.
32641954|a|Antidepressant-like activity of T. kotschyanus has been recently reported by scientists but insufficient attention has been so far devoted to T. kotschyanus, and there is a lack of information on the other neurobehavioral effects and side effects of this species. In the current study, the anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and sedative-hypnotic, effects of Thymus kotschyanus extract on male NMRI mice were evaluated using pentylenetetrazole, maximal electroshock, elevated plus maze, and pentobarbital-induced sleeping tests. Since phenolic compounds and flavonoids have main roles in pharmacological effects of most plant extracts, the phenolic and flavonoid contents of the extract were measured with Folin-Ciocalteu and AlCl3 reagents. Acute toxicity, passive avoidance, and open field tests were carried out to assess the toxicity of the extract. To find out the possible mechanism of action, flumazenil as the specific GABAA receptor antagonist was used. Anticonvulsant and hypnotic effects of the extract were observed at 400 and 600 mg/kg. The extract at the dose of 200 mg/kg revealed significant anxiolytic effects, but it did not show any adverse effects on learning and memory at all the tested doses. Results of this study indicate that Thymus kotschyanus extract has anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and hypnotic effects, which are likely related to the ability of some phenolic compounds to activate alpha1-containing GABAA receptors but more experiments still need to be carried out in order to find the exact mechanism, active component, and the toxicity of the Thymus kotschyanus extract.
