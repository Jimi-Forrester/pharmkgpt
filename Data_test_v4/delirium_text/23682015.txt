23682015|a|Microglia are the brain-resident macrophages tasked with the defense and maintenance of the central nervous system (CNS). The hematopoietic origin of microglia has warranted a therapeutic potential for the hematopoietic system in treating diseases of the CNS. However, migration of bone marrow-derived cells (BMDC) into the CNS is a marginal event under normal, healthy conditions. A busulfan-based chemotherapy regimen was used for bone marrow transplantation in wild-type mice before subjecting them to a hypoxic-ischemic brain injury or in APP/PS1 mice prior to the formation of amyloid plaques. The cells were tracked and analyzed throughout the development of the pathology. The efficacy of a preventive macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) treatment was also studied to highlight the effects of circulating monocytes in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Such an injury induces a strong migration of BMDC into the CNS, without the need for irradiation. These migrating cells do not replace the entire microglial pool but rather are confined to the sites of injury for several weeks, suggesting that they could perform specific functions. M-CSF showed neuroprotective effects as a preventive treatment. In APP/PS1 mice, the formation of amyloid plaques was sufficient to induce the entry of cells into the parenchyma, though in low numbers. This study confirms that BMDC infiltrate the CNS in animal models for stroke and Alzheimer's disease and that peripheral cells can be targeted to treat affected regions of the CNS.
