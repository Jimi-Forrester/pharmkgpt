10850726|a|The role of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase pathway in the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein was investigated in cultured cells. Human kidney 293T-cells were cotransfected with tau and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) genes or tau and protein kinase B genes. The phosphorylation of tau protein was increased by cotransfection with GSK-3; however, it was decreased by cotransfection with protein kinase B. Human neuroblastoma SY5Y cells were treated with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and only transient (after 1 hour) activation of GSK-3 and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein were observed. However, continuous inactivation of protein kinase B was observed, suggesting the involvement of protein kinases other than protein kinase B in the phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK-3 after 3 hours. In cells treated with wortmannin, protein kinase C delta fragments were observed, and the protein kinase C activity increased after 3 hours, whereas treatment of cells with z-DEVD-fmk, an inhibitor of caspase-3, inhibited fragmentation of protein kinase C delta and induced continuous activation of GSK-3. It is suggested that fragmentation of protein kinase C delta during the process of apoptosis results in the phosphorylation and the inactivation of GSK-3. Those data suggest that, in Alzheimer disease, more complicated mechanisms are involved in the process of phosphorylation of tau protein predominantly regulated by P13K pathway.
