19365372|t|[Express-method of assessment of cognitive functions in normal aging].
19365372|a|The authors suggest a new express-method for assessment of memory and intellect in the late age. This method allows to assess not only disturbed functions but also the intact patterns of mental processes and to conduct a quantitative assessment as well as a qualitative (syndrome) analysis of mental activity changes using a Luria's structural-functional model of the brain. The method was administered to 157 subjects of young (20-30 years), old and very old age (50-90 years). The express method may be used for the detection of age impairment and differential diagnostics of memory and intellect states in different variants of normal aging, assessment of neurocognitive deficit in patients with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive syndrome.
