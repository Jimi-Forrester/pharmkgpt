30327818|a|Demographic changes in Germany means that nursing and medical care is becoming increasingly complex. This is especially true for intensive care. Despite the closure of hospitals in Germany, the number of beds in intensive care units rose between 2002 from 23,113 to 26,162 in 2010. At the same time the number of patients treated in intensive care units increased by 148,989 to 2,049,888. The increasing complexity requires specific education for nurses in intensive care based on a model of advanced nursing practice (ANP). Nursing experts who fulfill an advanced practise nursing are competent to make decisions autonomously and accountably within complex care situations. This includes decisions such as artificial ventilation, weaning, nutrition management and the management of delirium, wounds and pain. Nursing experts are responsible for specific clearly defined areas of care and initiate nurse-led services and practice. Scientific and research based evidence are transferred directly into health care practice and can be implemented directly. The DGF demands a scientific and with it academic development of critical care as advanced nursing practice based on a master level qualification. This also includes the request for expansion of competencies and roles and the assignment of decision making authority within complex health care situations and an orientation on the Competencies for European Critical Care Nurses of the European Federation of Critical Care Nursing Associations (EfCCNa).
