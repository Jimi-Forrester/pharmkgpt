34498978|t|Breaker peptides against amyloid-beta aggregation: a potential therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease.
34498978|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, for which blocking the early steps of extracellular misfolded amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation is a promising therapeutic approach. However, the pathological features of AD progression include the accumulation of intracellular tau protein, membrane-catalyzed cell death and the abnormal deposition of Abeta. Here, we focus on anti-amyloid breaker peptides derived from the Abeta sequence and non-Abeta-based peptides containing both natural and modified amino acids. Critical aspects of the breaker peptides include N-methylation, conformational restriction through cyclization, incorporation of unnatural amino acid, fluorinated molecules, polymeric nanoparticles and PEGylation. This review confers a general idea of such breaker peptides with in vitro and in vivo studies, which may advance our understanding of AD pathology and develop an effective treatment strategy against AD.
