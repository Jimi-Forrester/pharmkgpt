37765006|t|Synthesis, DFT Study, and In Vitro Evaluation of Antioxidant Properties and Cytotoxic and Cytoprotective Effects of New Hydrazones on SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma Cell Lines.
37765006|a|A series of ten new hydrazide-hydrazone derivatives bearing a pyrrole ring were synthesized and structurally elucidated through appropriate spectral characteristics. The target hydrazones were assessed for radical scavenging activity through 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) tests, with ethyl 5-(4-bromophenyl)-1-(2-(2-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzylidene)hydrazine-yl)-2-oxoethyl)-2-methyl-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylate (7d) and ethyl 5-(4-bromophenyl)-1-(3-(2-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzylidene) hydra zine-yl)-3-oxopropyl)-2-methyl-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylate (8d) highlighted as the best radical scavengers from the series. Additional density functional theory (DFT) studies have indicated that the best radical scavenging ligands in the newly synthesized molecules are stable, do not decompose into elements, are less polarizable, and with a hard nature. The energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) revealed that both compounds possess good electron donation capacities. Overall, 7d and 8d can readily scavenge free radicals in biological systems via the donation of hydrogen atoms and single electron transfer. The performed in vitro assessment of the compound's protective activity on the H2O2-induced oxidative stress model on human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y determined 7d as the most perspective representative with the lowest cellular toxicity and the highest protection.
