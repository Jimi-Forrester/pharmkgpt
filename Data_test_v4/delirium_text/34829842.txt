34829842|t|An Epigenetic Insight into NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation in Inflammation-Related Processes.
34829842|a|Aberrant NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3) inflammasome activation in innate immune cells, triggered by diverse cellular danger signals, leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta and IL-18) and cell death by pyroptosis. These processes are involved in the pathogenesis of a wide range of diseases such as autoimmune, neurodegenerative, renal, metabolic, vascular diseases and cancer, and during physiological processes such as aging. Epigenetic dynamics mediated by changes in DNA methylation patterns, chromatin assembly and non-coding RNA expression are key regulators of the expression of inflammasome components and its further activation. Here, we review the role of the epigenome in the expression, assembly, and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, providing a critical overview of its involvement in the disease and discussing how targeting these mechanisms by epigenetic treatments could be a useful strategy for controlling NLRP3-related inflammatory diseases.
