3838246|t|Neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity in neuritic plaques of Alzheimer's disease.
3838246|a|Alzheimer's disease, a form of senile dementia, is characterized by the presence of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles throughout the cortex and hippocampus. This study demonstrates the presence of neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity within 10-20% of neuritic plaques. Neuropeptide Y is a 36 amino acid peptide which is distributed unevenly throughout the brain and has an interneuronal location.
