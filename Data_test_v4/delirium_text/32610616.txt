32610616|t|NHANES 2011-2014 Reveals Cognition of US Older Adults may Benefit from Better Adaptation to the Mediterranean Diet.
32610616|a|Although the Mediterranean diet (MedD) has gained interest for potential Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention, it is unknown how well US older adults follow a MedD. We used two National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles (2011-2014) to conduct our primary aim of reporting population estimates of MedD adherence among older adults (60+ years) in the US (n = 3068). The mean MedD adherence score for US older adults was 5.3 +- 2.1 (maximum possible = 18), indicating that older adults in the US do not adhere to a MedD. There were various differences in MedD scores across demographic characteristics. We also assessed the cross-sectional relationship between MedD adherence and cognitive performance using survey-weighted ordinary least squares regression and binary logistic regression models adjusted for 11 covariates. Compared to the lowest MedD adherence tertile, the highest tertile had a lower odds ratio of low cognitive performance on three of five cognitive measures (p < 0.05 for each). Sensitivity analyses within participants without subjective memory complaints over the past year revealed similar results on the same three cognitive measures. We conclude that MedD interventions are a departure from usual dietary intake of older adults in the US and are a reasonable approach for AD prevention trials.
