Sensitive assays applicable in the routine setting are needed to validate the existing GFAP tests. This study aimed to develop a highly sensitive and clinically applicable microfluidic immunoassay for the measurement of GFAP in blood. Methods: A microfluidic GFAP assay was developed and validated regarding its performance. Subsequently, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and control patients were analyzed with the established assay, and levels were compared to the commercial GFAP Simoa discovery kit. Results: The developed GFAP assay showed a good performance with a recovery of 85% of spiked GFAP in serum and assay variations below 15%. The established assay was highly sensitive with a calculated lower limit of quantification and detection of 7.21 pg/mL and 2.37 pg/mL, respectively. GFAP levels were significantly increased in AD compared to control patients with advanced age (p = 0.002). However, GFAP levels revealed no significant increase in MS compared to control patients in the same age range (p = 0.140). Furthermore, serum GFAP levels evaluated with the novel microfluidic assay strongly correlated with Simoa concentrations (r = 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81-0.93), p < 0.0001). Conclusion: We successfully developed a sensitive and easy-to-use microfluidic assay to measure GFAP in blood. Furthermore, we could confirm previous findings of elevated GFAP levels in AD by applying the assay in a cohort of clinically characterized patients.
