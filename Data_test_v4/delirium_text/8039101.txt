8039101|a|The behavioral symptoms associated with AD are a critical aspect of the disease. They provide an additional avenue not only for understanding AD but for implementing interventions. The nature of behavioral disorders in AD is complicated by a number of factors that interact and contribute to the development of problematic behavior. It is difficult to determine whether the behavior is the result of neurodegeneration, cognitive dysfunction, previous experiences, current stressors, independently coexisting psychopathology, or a combination of these factors. In any case, behavioral disturbances need to be more clearly defined and objectively measured. To understand and treat behavioral disturbances in AD, all biopsy-chosocial factors must be examined simultaneously. Currently, there is little that can be done to treat the cognitive components of AD. Consequently, our most successful and beneficial interventions may focus on the remediable behavioral manifestations of the disease. The most valuable treatment approach for patients with AD and their caregivers interweaves medications, psychosocial services, environmental strategies, and caregiver education.
