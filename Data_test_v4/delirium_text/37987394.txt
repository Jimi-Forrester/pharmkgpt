37987394|t|The Antihypertensive Guanabenz Exacerbates Integrated Stress Response and Disrupts the Brain Circadian Clock.
37987394|a|The circadian clock regulates a variety of biological processes that are normally synchronized with the solar day. Disruption of circadian rhythms is associated with health problems. Understanding the signaling mechanisms that couple cell physiology and metabolism to circadian timekeeping will help to develop novel therapeutic strategies. The integrated stress response (ISR) is activated by the cellular stressors to maintain physiological homeostasis by orchestrating mRNA translation. Aberrant ISR has been found in a number of neurological diseases that exhibit disrupted circadian rhythms and sleep. Recent work has started to uncover a critical role for the ISR in regulating the physiology of the circadian clock. Guanabenz (2,6-dichlorobenzylidene aminoguanidine acetate) is an orally bioavailable alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist that has been used as an antihypertensive for decades. Recent studies demonstrated that guanabenz can regulate the ISR. Here, we assessed the effects of guanabenz on cellular and behavioral circadian rhythms using a multidisciplinary approach. We found that guanabenz can induce the ISR by increasing eIF2alpha phosphorylation in cultured fibroblasts as well as in the mouse brain. The hyperphosphorylation of eIF2alpha by guanabenz is associated with the shortened circadian period in cells and animals and the disruption of behavioral circadian rhythms in mice. Guanabenz administration disrupted circadian oscillations of the clock protein Per1 and Per2 in the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus, the master pacemaker. These results uncover a significant yet previously unidentified role of guanabenz in regulating circadian rhythms and indicate that exacerbated ISR activation can impair the functions of the brain's circadian clock by disrupting clock gene expression.
