33266236|t|Relationship of Prevalent Fragility Fracture in Dementia Patients: Three Years Follow up Study.
33266236|a|Introduction: dementia increases the risk of falls by 2-3 times and cognitively impaired patients are three times more likely to have hip fracture following a fall when compared to cognitively intact individuals. However, there is not enough evidence that explores the relationship between dementia and fragility fractures. The aim of this study is to explore the relationships of prevalent fragility fracture in patients with dementia admitted with an acute illness to the hospital. Methods: the existing Health Board records were reviewed retrospectively for all patients admitted diagnosed with dementia in the year 2016. All patients were followed up for a maximum of three years. All of the the dementia patients were divided into three groups: group 1-"no fractures"; group 2-"all fractures"; group 3-"fragility fractures". Clinical outcomes were analysed for hospital stay, discharge destination (new care home), post-discharge hip fracture data, and mortality. Results: dementia patients with a prevalent fracture were significantly older, 62% were women. A significantly higher proportion of dementia patients with prevalent fractures were care home residents and taking a significantly higher number of medications. The mean Charlson comorbidity index was similar in patients with or without fracture. Dementia patients with a prevalent fracture required a new care home and this is significantly higher when compared to those with no fracture. Mortality at one year and three year was not statistically different in patients with or without prevalent fractures. A significantly higher number (21.5%) of dementia patients with prevalent fragility fracture sustained a new hip fracture when compared to those with no prevalent osteoporotic fracture (2.9%) over the three years follow up (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: dementia patients with a prevalent fragility fracture is associated with a statistically significant higher risk of a new care home placement following acute hospital admission. This sub-group is also at risk of a new hip fracture in the next three years. Whilst clinical judgement remains crucial in the care of frail older people, it is prudent to consider medical management of osteoporosis in dementia if deemed to be beneficial following the comprehensive geriatric assessment.
