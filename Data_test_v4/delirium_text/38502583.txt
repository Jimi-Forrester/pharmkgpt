38502583|t|Cerebellum and Aging: Update and Challenges.
38502583|a|The cerebellum plays a vital role in the aging process. With the aging of the cerebellum, there is a decline in balance and motor function, particularly fine motor skills, and an increased risk of falling. However, in recent years, numerous studies have revealed that the cerebellum has several roles beyond balance and fine motor skills, such as cognitive function and memory. It also plays a role in many neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, the cerebellum ages more rapidly than other brain regions, including the hippocampus. With increasing studies reporting that the cerebellum has a more prominent and interconnected role in the brain, it is essential to understand why aging affects it more, leading to solutions to help curb the accelerated decline. Here, we summarize the cerebellum's function and look at how it ages at the cellular, molecular, and functional levels. Additionally, we explore the the effects of alcoholism on the aging cerebellum as well as the role of the cerebellum in diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Multiple Sclerosis.
