37909364|a|Brain disorders comprise several psychiatric and neurological disorders which can be characterized by impaired cognition, mood alteration, psychosis, depressive episodes, and neurodegeneration. Clinical diagnoses primarily rely on a combination of life history information and questionnaires, with a distinct lack of discriminative biomarkers in use for psychiatric disorders. Symptoms across brain conditions are associated with functional alterations of cognitive and emotional processes, which can correlate with anatomical variation; structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of the brain are therefore an important focus of research, particularly for predictive modelling. With the advent of large MRI data consortia (such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) facilitating a greater number of MRI-based classification studies, convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-deep learning models well suited to image processing tasks-have become increasingly popular for research into brain conditions. This has resulted in a myriad of studies reporting impressive predictive performances, demonstrating the potential clinical value of deep learning systems. However, methodologies can vary widely across studies, making them difficult to compare and/or reproduce, potentially limiting their clinical application. Here, we conduct a qualitative systematic literature review of 55 studies carrying out CNN-based predictive modelling of brain disorders using MRI data and evaluate them based on three principles-modelling practices, transparency, and interpretability. We propose several recommendations to enhance the potential for the integration of CNNs into clinical care.
