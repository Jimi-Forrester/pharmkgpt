We hypothesized that a therapeutic agent that improves glycemic control and steatosis may attenuate obesity-associated progression of dementia. We previously identified that adenoviral protein E4orf1 improves glycemic control and reduces hepatic steatosis despite obesity in mice. Here, we determined if this metabolic improvement by E4orf1 will ameliorate cognitive decline in a transgenic mouse model of AD. METHODS: Fourteen- to twenty-month-old APP/PS1/E4orf1 and APP/PS1 (control) mice were fed a high-fat diet. Cognition was determined by Morris Water Maze (MWM). Systemic glycemic control and metabolic signaling changes in adipose tissue, liver, and brain were determined. RESULTS: Compared to control, E4orf1 expression significantly improved glucose clearance, reduced endogenous insulin requirement and lowered body-fat, enhanced glucose and lipid metabolism in adipose tissue, and reduced de novo lipogenesis in the liver. In the brain, E4orf1 mice displayed significantly greater expression of genes involved in neurogenesis and amyloid-beta degradation and performed better in MWM testing. CONCLUSION: This study opens-up the possibility of addressing glycemic control and steatosis for attenuating obesity-related cognitive decline. It also underscores the potential of E4orf1 for the purpose, which needs further investigations.
