28571786|a|The oxidation of cholesterol results in the formation of oxysterols such as 7-ketocholesterol (7KC), which are implicated in a number of age-related disorders such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimers' disease and macular degeneration. Current modalities use antioxidants and other natural or synthetic molecules to reduce 7KC-induced cytotoxity. The alternative application of enzymes from microbial sources to degrade oxysterols in vitro and in vivo is an innovative approach. The present study aims to assess the potential of the bacteria Rhodococcus erythropolis MTCC 3951 in degrading 7KC and mining relevant enzymes involved. This strain has been previously reported to be a degrader of xenobiotics such as polyphenols, toluene and catechol. Under optimized conditions, Rhodococcus erythropolis MTCC 3951 is found to degrade 93% of 1g/l concentration of 7KC within 15days of incubation. The extra- and intra-cellular extracts were also able to hydrolyse the compound indicating the involvement of enzymatic systems in the process. The strain produced cholesterol oxidase, lipase, dehydrogenase and reductase in the presence of 7KC. We have also identified a few intermediate products to predict the degradation pathway.
