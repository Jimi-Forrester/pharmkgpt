39266605|t|Neural basis of false recognition in Alzheimer's disease and dementia with lewy bodies.
39266605|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD), reports on the association between false recognition and brain structure have been inconsistent. In dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), no such association has been reported. This study aimed to identify brain regions associated with false recognition in AD and DLB by analyzing regional gray matter volume (rGMV). We included 184 patients with AD and 60 patients with DLB. The number of false recognitions was assessed using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale' word recognition task. Brain regions associated with the number of false recognitions were examined by voxel-based morphometry analysis. The number of false recognitions significantly negatively correlated with rGMV in the bilateral hippocampus, left parahippocampal gyrus, bilateral amygdala, and bilateral entorhinal cortex in patients with AD (p < 0.05, family-wise error [FEW] corrected) and in the bilateral hippocampus, left parahippocampal gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, right basal forebrain, right insula, left medial and lateral orbital gyri, and left fusiform in those with DLB (p < 0.05, FWE corrected). Bilateral hippocampus and left parahippocampal gyrus were associated with false recognition in both diseases. However, we found there were regions where the association between false recognition and rGMV differed from disease to disease.
