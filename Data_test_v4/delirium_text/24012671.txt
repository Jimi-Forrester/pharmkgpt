24012671|t|Fibrillar seeds alleviate amyloid-beta cytotoxicity by omitting formation of higher-molecular-weight oligomers.
24012671|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides can exist in distinct forms including monomers, oligomers and fibrils, consisting of increased numbers of monomeric units. Among these, Abeta oligomers are implicated as the primary toxic species as pointed by multiple lines of evidence. It has been suggested that toxicity could be rendered by the soluble higher-molecular-weight (high-n) Abeta oligomers. Yet, the most culpable form in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains elusive. Moreover, the potential interaction among the insoluble fibrils that have been excluded from the responsible aggregates in AD development, Abeta monomers and high-n oligomers is undetermined. Here, we report that insoluble Abeta fibrillar seeds can interact with Abeta monomers at the stoichiometry of 1:2 (namely, each Abeta molecule of seed can bind to two Abeta monomers at a time) facilitating the fibrillization by omitting the otherwise mandatory formation of the toxic high-n oligomers during the fibril maturation. As a result, the addition of exogenous Abeta fibrillar seeds is seen to rescue neuronal cells from Abeta cytotoxicity presumably exerted by high-n oligomers, suggesting an unexpected protective role of Abeta fibrillar seeds.
