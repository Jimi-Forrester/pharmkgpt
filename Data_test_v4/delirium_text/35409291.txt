35409291|t|The Role of Axonal Transport in Glaucoma.
35409291|a|Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and leads to progressive vision loss. The first pathological signs can be seen at the optic nerve head (ONH), the structure where RGC axons leave the retina to compose the optic nerve. Besides damage of the axonal cytoskeleton, axonal transport deficits at the ONH have been described as an important feature of glaucoma. Axonal transport is essential for proper neuronal function, including transport of organelles, synaptic components, vesicles, and neurotrophic factors. Impairment of axonal transport has been related to several neurodegenerative conditions. Studies on axonal transport in glaucoma include analysis in different animal models and in humans, and indicate that its failure happens mainly in the ONH and early in disease progression, preceding axonal and somal degeneration. Thus, a better understanding of the role of axonal transport in glaucoma is not only pivotal to decipher disease mechanisms but could also enable early therapies that might prevent irreversible neuronal damage at an early time point. In this review we present the current evidence of axonal transport impairment in glaucomatous neurodegeneration and summarize the methods employed to evaluate transport in this disease.
