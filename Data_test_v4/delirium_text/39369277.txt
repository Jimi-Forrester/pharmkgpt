39369277|a|The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has fostered collaboration among researchers around the world, catalyzing innovation and accelerating progress in the field. In Latin America, this initiative advanced the validation and development of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers for the first time in our region. In 2011, as part of the international ADNI, Argentina-ADNI (Arg-ADNI) was founded. The following years were characterized by strong support from entities such as the Alzheimer's Association, transforming into the emergence of several multinational studies focusing on prevention and diagnosis, and treatment of dementias. These studies are heirs to the tradition of Arg-ADNI: the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network, Latin American Initiative for Lifestyle Intervention to Prevent Cognitive Decline, Longitudinal Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Study, and Initiative for the Study of Down Syndrome and Alzheimer's Disease. These initiatives have contributed significantly to the development of regional research and serve as essential tools for health policy planning in Latin America. HIGHLIGHTS: In Latin America, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) advanced the validation and development of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers for the first time in our region. ADNI has been the basis that boosted several multinational studies focusing on both prevention and diagnosis, and treatment of dementias (Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network, LatAm-FINGER, LEADS). These initiatives with the support from the Alzheimer's Association have contributed significantly to the development of regional research This is an example of collaboration between high-income countries with low- and middle-income countries aimed at global scientific development and inclusion.
