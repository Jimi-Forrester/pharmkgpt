36948358|a|BACKGROUND: Primary neuronal cultures enable cell-biological studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD), albeit typically non-neuron-specific. The first cortical neurons affected in AD reside in layer II of the lateralmost part of the entorhinal cortex, and they undergo early accumulation of intracellular amyloid-beta, form subsequent tau pathology, and start degenerating pre-symptomatically. These vulnerable entorhinal neurons uniquely express the glycoprotein reelin and provide selective inputs to the hippocampal memory system. Gaining a more direct access to study these neurons is therefore highly relevant. NEW METHOD: We demonstrate a methodological approach for dissection and long-term culturing of adult lateral entorhinal layer II-neurons from AD-model mice. RESULTS: We maintain adult dissected lateralmost entorhinal layer II-neurons beyond two months in culture. We show that they express neuronal markers, and that they are electrophysiologically active by 15 days in vitro and continuing beyond 2 months. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Primary neurons are typically harvested from embryonic or early postnatal brains because such neurons are easier to culture compared to adult neurons. Methods to culture adult primary neurons have been reported, however, to our knowledge, culturing of adult entorhinal neuron-type specific primary neurons from AD-model animals have not been reported. CONCLUSIONS: Our methodological approach offers a window to study initial pathological changes in the AD disease-cascade. This includes the study of proteinopathy, single-neuron changes, and network-level dysfunction.
