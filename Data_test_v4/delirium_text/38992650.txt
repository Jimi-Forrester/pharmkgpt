38992650|t|Midlife stress-related exhaustion and dementia incidence: a longitudinal study over 50 years in women.
38992650|a|BACKGROUNDS: Cognitive problems are common symptoms among individuals with stress-related exhaustion. It is still unknown whether these individuals are at a higher risk of developing dementia later. This study aims to examine the relationship between midlife stress-related exhaustion and dementia incidence. METHODS: A population sample of 777 women (aged 38, 46, 50 and 54 years) without dementia at baseline was followed over 50 years, from 1968 to 2019. Stress-related exhaustion was based on information from the psychiatric examination in 1968/69. Information on dementia incidence between 1968 and 2019 was obtained from neuropsychiatric examinations, key-informant interviews, and hospital registry. Dementia was diagnosed according to the DSM-III-R criteria. A subgroup of non-demented women (n = 284) was examined for cognitive functions by the Gottfries-Brane-Steen scale 24 years after baseline. RESULTS: Stress-related exhaustion in midlife was associated with higher risk for development of dementia before age 75 (Hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval: 2.95 and 1.35-6.44). The association remained after adjustment for age, major depression, and anxiety disorder. Mean age of dementia onset was younger for women with stress-related exhaustion than women without stress (mean +- SD, 76 +- 9 vs. 82 +- 8 . p = 0.009). Women with stress-related exhaustion in midlife still showed more cognitive impairments 24 years later compared with women without stress (Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval: 2.64 and 1.15-6.06). CONCLUSIONS: We found that women with stress-related exhaustion in midlife were at a higher risk to develop dementia at relatively younger age. These women showed persistently lower cognitive functions over years even without dementia. Present study results need to be interpreted with caution due to small sample size and should be confirmed in future studies with larger sample size. Our study findings may imply the importance of long-term follow-up regarding cognitive function among individuals with stress-related exhaustion.
