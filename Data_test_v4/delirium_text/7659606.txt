7659606|t|Convulsive therapy in delusional disorders.
7659606|a|Delusions are psychopathologic expressions associated with schizophrenia, affective disorders, and systemic and toxic illnesses. In each condition, the efficacy of ECT is well defined. For some illnesses, such as major depression with psychosis, manic delirium, and catatonia, ECT is effective in relieving the delusional states. This activity of ECT as an antidelusional agent compels us to consider the mode of action of ECT as broader than as an antidepressant treatment alone. The experience also compels greater consideration of the unitary classification of severe mental disorders.
