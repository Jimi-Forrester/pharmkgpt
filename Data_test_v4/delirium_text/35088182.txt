35088182|t|Organoids for modeling prion diseases.
35088182|a|Human cerebral organoids are an exciting and novel model system emerging in the field of neurobiology. Cerebral organoids are spheres of self-organizing, neuronal lineage tissue that can be differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells and that present the possibility of on-demand human neuronal cultures that can be used for non-invasively investigating diseases affecting the brain. Compared with existing humanized cell models, they provide a more comprehensive replication of the human cerebral environment. The potential of the human cerebral organoid model is only just beginning to be elucidated, but initial studies have indicated that they could prove to be a valuable model for neurodegenerative diseases such as prion disease. The application of the cerebral organoid model to prion disease, what has been learned so far and the future potential of this model are discussed in this review.
