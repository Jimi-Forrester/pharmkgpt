38760516|t|MST1 selective inhibitor Xmu-mp-1 ameliorates neuropathological changes in a rat model of sporadic Alzheimer's Disease by modulating Hippo-Wnt signaling crosstalk.
38760516|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment accompanied by aberrant neuronal apoptosis. Reports suggest that the pro-apoptotic mammalian set20-like kinase 1/2 (MST1/2) instigates neuronal apoptosis via activating the Hippo signaling pathway under various stress conditions, including AD. However, whether inhibiting MST1/2 has any therapeutic benefits in AD remains unknown. Thus, we tested the therapeutic effects of intervening MST1/2 activation via the pharmacological inhibitor Xmu-mp-1 in a sporadic AD rat model. Sporadic AD was established in adult rats by intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) injection (3 mg/kg body weight). Xmu-mp-1 (0.5 mg/kg/body weight) was administered once every 48 h for two weeks, and Donepezil (5 mg/kg body weight) was used as a reference standard drug. The therapeutic effects of Xmu-mp-1 on ICV-STZ rats were determined through various behavioral, biochemical, histopathological, and molecular tests. At the behavioral level, Xmu-mp-1 improved cognitive deficits in sporadic AD rats. Further, Xmu-mp-1 treatment reduced STZ-associated tau phosphorylation, amyloid-beta deposition, oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, neuronal apoptosis, and neurodegeneration. Mechanistically, Xmu-mp-1 exerted these neuroprotective actions by inactivating the Hippo signaling while potentiating the Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling in the AD rats. Together, the results of the present study provide compelling support that Xmu-mp-1 negated the neuronal dysregulation in the rat model of sporadic AD. Therefore, inhibiting MST/Hippo signaling and modulating its crosstalk with the Wnt/beta-Catenin pathway can be a promising alternative treatment strategy against AD pathology. This is the first study providing novel mechanistic insights into the therapeutic use of Xmu-mp-1 in sporadic AD.
