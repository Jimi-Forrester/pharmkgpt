37502456|t|Risk Factors for Puncture Site Complications Using the Angio-Seal Closure Device in Endovascular Therapy: A Single-center Analysis.
37502456|a|Objective: To retrospectively analyze the complication rates and risk factors associated with the use of the Angio-Seal vascular closure device during neuroendovascular therapy. Methods: In this study, we enrolled 283 patients who underwent Angio-Seal hemostasis between December 2005 and June 2019 at our institute. We retrospectively analyzed the major and minor complication rates and risk factors between the complication and no-complication groups using the medical charts of patients for whom the device was used. Results: Of the 283 patients, 5 had major complications (1.8%) and 18 had minor complications (6.3%). There were no significant differences between the complication (n = 23) and no-complication (n = 260) groups regarding the baseline characteristics or operation procedures. Among the major complications, superficial femoral artery puncture, 8Fr device, Angio-Seal Evolution, post-carotid artery stenting, dual antiplatelet therapy, and delirium were considered risk factors. Conclusion: The Angio-Seal is a safe and useful hemostatic device. However, puncture site complications need to be considered when the device is used for contraindicated patients or for those with delirium who cannot rest following the procedure.
