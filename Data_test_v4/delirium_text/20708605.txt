20708605|a|Multiple lines of evidence have implicated that nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) may be an important therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although there are reports suggesting a link between alpha7 nAChR subtype and AD, there has been little report on the mechanism. The present study investigates whether and how alpha7 nAChR activation affects APP695 processing in SH-EP1 cell model. Cell line co-expressing alpha7 nAChR gene and human amyloid precursor protein 695 (hAPP695) gene were constructed by stable transfection. Expression of beta-amyloid, alpha-form of secreted APP (alphaAPPs) and APP1695 was measured by ELISA, western blotting and real-time PCR respectively. Additionally, alpha, beta, and gamma-secretase activities were also analyzed in constructed SH-EP1-alpha7 nAChR-hAPP695 cell line. The results showed that SH-EP1-alpha7 nAChR-hAPP695 cell line, expressing both hAPP695 gene and alpha7 nAChR subtype gene, was constructed successfully. The secreted Abeta was decreased and alphaAPPs was significantly increased by non-selective nAChR agonist nicotine (10 muM) and specific alpha7 nAChR agonist GTS-21 (1 muM), and APP expression was not affected. Furthermore, specific alpha7 nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA) reversed the alterations induced by activation of alpha7 nAChR. CTF-alpha was increased and CTF-gamma was decreased when treated with nicotine (10 muM). In addition, the results of enymatic activity analysis showed that nicotine (1muM) and GTS-21 (0.1, 1 muM) decreased gamma-secretase activity, but has no effects on alpha-secretase activity and beta-secretase activity. Our findings demonstrate that, through regulating gamma-secretase activity, alpha7 nAChR activation reduces APP processing in amyloidogenic pathway, and at the same time enhances APP processing in non-amyloidogenic pathway. The constructed SH-EP1-alpha7 nAChR-hAPP695 cell line might be useful for screening specific nAChR agonists against AD.
