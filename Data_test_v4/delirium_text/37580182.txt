37580182|a|BACKGROUND: Catatonia, a form of acute brain dysfunction typically linked with severe affective and psychotic disorders, occurs in critical illness with delirium and coma. Delirium and coma are associated with mortality, though catatonia's relationship with mortality is unclear. We aim to describe whether catatonia, delirium, and coma are associated with mortality. METHODS: We enrolled a convenience cohort of critically ill adults (N = 378) at an academic medical center. We assessed catatonia, delirium, and coma using the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale, the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit and the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale, respectively. We tested the associations between previous day brain dysfunction state occurrence with in-hospital and one-year mortality using multivariable time-dependent risk models. Additionally, we tested the association between brain dysfunction duration and one-year mortality. RESULTS: Catatonia was not associated with death on the day after diagnosis during hospitalization, and neither previous catatonia occurrence nor duration was associated with one-year mortality. Delirium was not associated with death on any day following diagnosis during hospitalization, and neither previous delirium occurrence nor duration was associated with one-year mortality. The occurrence of coma was associated with death on any day after diagnosis during hospitalization (HR 2.30,CI 1.19-4.44,p = 0.014), as well as through one year following hospital discharge (HR 1.68,CI 1.09-2.59,p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Coma, but neither catatonia nor delirium, was associated with future day in-hospital and one-year mortality. More research is needed to understand catatonia's clinical impact. Delirium results differ from existing literature likely due to cohort demographics and size. Coma results highlight the prognostic significance of suppressed arousal while critically ill.
