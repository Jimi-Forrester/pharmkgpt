36415420|t|Chloroquine-Induced Psychosis: A Case Report.
36415420|a|The use of antimalarial drugs for prophylaxis is a widespread practice while traveling to underdeveloped nations, particularly those with a high malaria prevalence. Chloroquine is still one of the most commonly recommended antimalarials, either alone or in combination with others, for prophylaxis. However, its increased use over the past few decades has been associated with many adverse effects, including headaches, dizziness, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as neuropsychiatric symptoms such as psychosis. Here, we discuss the case of a 30-year-old Asian man who, after starting a 500-milligram (mg) prophylactic dosage of chloroquine per week, developed psychotic symptoms. This case highlights the need to use chloroquine and other antimalarials with care, especially when beginning as a prophylactic measure with the lowest suggested dosage.
