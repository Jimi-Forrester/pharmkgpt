36049740|a|Perioperative complications are more frequent in younger children, especially under the age of 3 years and in infants. The anatomy and physiology of children cause more respiratory adverse events compared to adult patients. Respiratory adverse events account for 60% of all anesthetic complications. Main risk factors for respiratory adverse events are upper respiratory tract infections. Keeping the airway management as noninvasive as possible helps prevent major complications.Perioperative hypotension can compromise cerebral oxygenation, especially when hypocapnia and anemia are present. Congenital heart disease leads to a higher cardiovascular adverse event rate and should be diagnosed preoperatively whenever possible.Venous and arterial cannulation is more challenging in children and complications are more frequent even for experienced practitioners. Ultrasound is an essential tool for peripheral venous access as well as for central venous catheterization.Medication errors are more common in pediatric than in adult patients. Charts and electronic calculation of dosing can increase safety of prescriptions. Standardized storage of medications at all workplaces, avoiding look-alike medications in the same compartment and storing high-risk medications separately help prevent substitution errors.Emergence delirium and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are the most frequent postoperative adverse events. For diagnosing emergence delirium, the PAED scale is a helpful tool. Prevention of emergence delirium by pharmacological and general measures plays a key role for patient outcome. Routine prophylaxis of PONV above the age of 3 years is recommended.Frequency and severity of perioperative adverse events in pediatric anesthesia can be reduced by using algorithms and defined processes to allow for structured actions. Efficient communication and organization are mainstays for utilizing all medical options to reduce the risk of complications.
