20306369|t|Cognitive rehabilitation in posterior cortical atrophy.
20306369|a|Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is a rare early-onset dementing syndrome presenting with visuo-perceptual deficits. Clinicopathologically, it is most commonly considered a form of Alzheimer's disease. We present the case of a 64-year-old male patient with posterior cortical atrophy who took part in a cognitive rehabilitation programme that included psychoeducation, compensatory strategies, and cognitive exercises. After the cognitive rehabilitation programme, subtle differences were found in visuoperceptual tasks and in the patient's subjective perception of difficulties. Cognitive rehabilitation may temporarily improve functioning in patients with posterior cortical atrophy.
