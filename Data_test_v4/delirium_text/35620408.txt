35620408|t|The Comparative Efficacy of Multiple Acupuncture for Alzheimer's Disease: A Bayesian Network Meta-Analysis.
35620408|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Numerous cases have illustrated that the acupuncture method could improve AD patients' cognitive function and daily living ability. However, the optimal acupuncture treatments remain controversial. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a systematic review to compare the efficacy of multiple acupuncture therapies for AD and identify the optimal acupuncture intervention for delaying AD progression. Methods: To select potentially concerned randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we searched four English databases, four Chinese databases, and additional sources from 1 May 2021. Two independent reviewers conducted study screening, data extraction, and methodological quality assessment. The primary outcome was global cognitive function improvement. Pairwise and Bayesian network meta-analyses were performed using STATA v15.0 and ADDIS v1.16.8. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool was used to assess the quality of evidence. Results: This study included 34 RCTs with 2,071 participants. Regarding global cognitive function improvement, the pairwise meta-analysis confirmed that electronic acupuncture (EA) plus conventional medicine (CM) and manual acupuncture (MA) plus CM were statistically significantly different from CM, and EA plus CM was ranked as the best combination in the network meta-analysis. In terms of response rate, MA outperformed CM statistically significantly; warm acupuncture (WA) was ranked as the best in the network meta-analysis. Regarding activity of daily living improvement, EA plus CM, MA plus CM, and fire acupuncture plus CM, MA, and scalp acupuncture were statistically significantly different from CM, and EA plus CM was ranked as the best combination in the network meta-analysis. However, the evidences were ranked as low to critically low. Conclusions: Acupuncture, as a monotherapy or an adjuvant therapy, may have a beneficial effect on efficacy for AD. EA plus CM may be the optimal acupuncture therapy for AD and should be administered to AD patients. It may aid and support patient, operative, and societal decision-making. Due to the dearth of high-quality evidence, additional high-quality studies should be conducted to ensure these findings in the future. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021252305).
