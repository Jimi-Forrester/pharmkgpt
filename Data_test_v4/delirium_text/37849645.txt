37849645|t|Identification of Plasma Inflammatory Markers of Adolescent Depression Using the Olink Proteomics Platform.
37849645|a|Purpose: The quality of life of worldwide adolescents has been seriously affected by depression. Notably, the inflammatory response is closely associated with the pathophysiology of depression. The present study applied a novel targeted proteomics technology, Olink proximity extension assay (PEA), to profile circulating immune-related proteins in adolescents with depression. Methods: In the present study, the expression levels of 92 inflammation-related proteins were compared between adolescents with depression (ADs) (n=15) and healthy controls (HCs) (n=15), using the OLINK PEA inflammation panel. We further validated 5 top proteins that were identified through KEGG and GO analyses between 40 HCs and 50 ADs, including CCL4, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL11, and IL-18 using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: We identified 13 differentially expressed proteins between the two cohorts, including 5 up-regulated and 8 down-regulated proteins. Among them, the TRAIL protein levels were significantly negatively correlated with the HAMA-14 score (r=-0.538, p= 0.038), and the levels of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) were significantly associated with a change in appetite (r = -0.658, p = 0.008). After validation by ELISA, CCL4, CXCL5, CXCL11, and IL-18 showed significant changes between ADs and HCs (p < 0.05), while CXCL6 showed an up-regulated tendency in ADs (p=0.0673). The pooled diagnostic efficacy (area under the curve [AUC]) of these five inflammation markers in clinical diagnosis for adolescent depression was 0.819 (95% CI: 0.735-0.904). Conclusion: We report a number of inflammation-related plasma biomarkers, which uncover a potential involvement of chemokines, cytokines, and cytokine receptors in adolescent depression. Their roles in the pathophysiology of depression need to be further elucidated.
