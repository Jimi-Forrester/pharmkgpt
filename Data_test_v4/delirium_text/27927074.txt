OBJECTIVE: The protective effect of methanol (Met E) and aqueous (Aq E) extracts of Hertia cheirifolia against DNA, lipid and protein oxidation was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different concentrations (50-1000 mug/mL) of Hertia cheirifolia aerial part extracts were examined against DNA, lipid and protein oxidation induced by H2O2 + UV, FeSO4, and Fe3+/H2O2-ascorbic acid, respectively. The DPPH , metal ion chelating, reducing power and beta-carotene bleaching tests were conducted. RESULTS: Both extracts were rich in polyphenols, flavonoids and tannins, and were able to scavenge DPPH  with IC50 values of 138 and 197 mug/mL, respectively. At 300 mug/mL, Aq E exerted stronger chelating effect (99%) than Met E (69%). However, Met E reducing power (IC50 = 61 mug/mL) was more than that of Aq E (IC50 = 193 mug/mL). Both extracts protected from beta-carotene bleaching by 74% and 94%, respectively, and inhibited linoleic acid peroxidation. The inhibitory activity of Aq E extract (64%) was twice more than that of Met E (32%). Interestingly, both extracts protected DNA against the cleavage by about 96-98%. At 1 mg/mL, Met E and Aq E restored protein band intensity by 94-99%. CONCLUSIONS: Hertia cheirifolia exhibits potent antioxidant activity and protects biomolecules against oxidative damage; hence, it may serve as potential source of natural antioxidant for pharmaceutical applications and food preservation. This is the first report on the protective activity of this plant against biomolecule oxidation.
