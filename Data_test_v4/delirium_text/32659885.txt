32659885|t|Delirium Post-Stroke-Influence on Post-Stroke Dementia (Research Study-Part of the PROPOLIS Study).
32659885|a|BACKGROUND: Previous research confirmed association between delirium and subsequent dementia in different clinical settings, but the impact of post-stroke delirium on cognitive functioning is still under-investigated. Therefore, we aimed to assess the risk of dementia among patients with stroke and in-hospital delirium. METHODS: A total of 750 consecutive patients admitted to the stroke unit with acute stroke or transient ischemic attacks were screened for delirium, during the first seven days after admission. At the three- and twelve-month follow-up, patients underwent cognitive evaluation. The DSM-5 definition for dementia was used. Cases with pre-stroke dementia were excluded from the analysis. RESULTS: Out of 691 included cases, 423 (61.22%) and 451 (65.27%) underwent cognitive evaluation, three and twelve months after stroke; 121 (28.61%) and 151 (33.48%) patients were diagnosed with dementia, respectively. Six (4.96%) patients with dementia, three months post-stroke did not meet the diagnostic criteria for dementia nine months later. After twelve months, 37 (24.50%) patients were diagnosed with dementia, first time after stroke. Delirium in hospital was an independent risk factor for dementia after three months (OR = 7.267, 95%CI 2.182-24.207, p = 0.001) but not twelve months after the stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stroke complicated by in-hospital delirium are at a higher risk for dementia at three but not twelve months post-stroke.
