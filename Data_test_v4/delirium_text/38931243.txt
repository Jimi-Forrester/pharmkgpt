38931243|a|The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a crucial role during neuronal development as well as during differentiation and synaptogenesis. They are important proteins present in the brain that support neuronal health and protect the neurons from detrimental signals. The results from the present study suggest BDNF expression can be increase up to ~8-fold by treating the neuroblastoma cells SHSY-5Y with an herbal extract of Oroxylum indicum (50 mug/mL) and ~5.5-fold under lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced inflammation conditions. The Oroxylum indicum extract (Sabroxy) was standardized to 10% oroxylin A, 6% chrysin, and 15% baicalein. In addition, Sabroxy has shown to possess antioxidant activity that could decrease the damage caused by the exacerbation of radicals during neurodegeneration. A mode of action of over expression of BDNF with and without inflammation is proposed for the Oroxylum indicum extract, where the three major hydroxyflavones exert their effects through additive or synergistic effects via five possible targets including GABA, Adenoside A2A and estrogen receptor bindings, anti-inflammatory effects, and reduced mitochondrial ROS production.
