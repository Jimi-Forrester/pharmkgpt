37006768|t|The Role of Heme and Copper in Alzheimer's Disease and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
37006768|a|Beyond the well-explored proposition of protein aggregation or amyloidosis as the central event in amyloidogenic diseases like Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2Dm); there are alternative hypotheses, now becoming increasingly evident, which suggest that the small biomolecules like redox noninnocent metals (Fe, Cu, Zn, etc.) and cofactors (Heme) have a definite influence in the onset and extent of such degenerative maladies. Dyshomeostasis of these components remains as one of the common features in both AD and T2Dm etiology. Recent advances in this course reveal that the metal/cofactor-peptide interactions and covalent binding can alarmingly enhance and modify the toxic reactivities, oxidize vital biomolecules, significantly contribute to the oxidative stress leading to cell apoptosis, and may precede the amyloid fibrils formation by altering their native folds. This perspective highlights this aspect of amyloidogenic pathology which revolves around the impact of the metals and cofactors in the pathogenic courses of AD and T2Dm including the active site environments, altered reactivities, and the probable mechanisms involving some highly reactive intermediates as well. It also discusses some in vitro metal chelation or heme sequestration strategies which might serve as a possible remedy. These findings might open up a new paradigm in our conventional understanding of amyloidogenic diseases. Moreover, the interaction of the active sites with small molecules elucidates potential biochemical reactivities that can inspire designing of drug candidates for such pathologies.
