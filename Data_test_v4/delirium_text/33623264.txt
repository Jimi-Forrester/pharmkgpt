33623264|t|Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) Study on Serotonin Syndrome Among Neuro Physicians.
33623264|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a highly underdiagnosed drug-induced clinical syndrome. Under diagnosis is partly due to the unawareness of this syndrome by physicians. The aim of this study is to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of SS among neuro physicians in India. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey using a self-administered questionnaire was carried out among neuro physicians in India. Neuro physicians attending the various neurological conferences and meetings were approached to participate in the study. RESULT: A total of 150 neuro physicians responded to the survey. About 31% of participants correctly recognized the criteria for SS. Only 17% of the neuro physicians considered clonus as the most important feature in SS. Very few physicians correctly identified serotonergic agents causing serotonin syndrome. Similarly, a very low percentage of neuro physicians correctly identified the drugs used in the management of SS. Drugs used for the treatment of SS were incorrectly recognized as drugs causing SS. Clonus is the most specific feature for SS. However, examination for clonus is not a routine phenomenon in clinical practice among neuro physicians. CONCLUSION: This study shows great deficiencies in all domains of SS among neuro physicians. There is a need to make every doctor aware of SS by educational programs.
