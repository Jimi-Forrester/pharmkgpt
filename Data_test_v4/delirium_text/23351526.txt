23351526|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine whether prophylactic treatment with antipsychotics can decrease the incidence and severity of postsurgical delirium. METHOD: A meta-analysis of existing trials comparing delirium incidence between patients given prophylactic antipsychotic and placebo was performed. Secondary outcomes were total hospital days, total days of delirium and severity. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Five randomized placebo-controlled trials comprising a total of 1491 patients were included. In the pooled analysis, prophylactic antipsychotic administration showed a reduction in delirium incidence (OR: 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.24, 0.74). Among the studies reporting other outcomes, patients receiving antipsychotics prophylactically showed no differences in total hospital days (0.1; 95% CI: -0.73, 0.94), days of delirium (-1.17; 95% CI: -5.22, 2.88) or delirium severity (-1.02; 95% CI: -6.81, 4.76). CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic antipsychotic treatment in surgical patients modestly decreases the incidence of delirium, but not the length of hospital stay, duration of delirium or its severity. Given the modest protective effect of antipsychotics and their potential adverse reactions, there is insufficient evidence to support its universal use as a preventive agent, though potential benefit may be seen in populations at high risk of developing delirium.
