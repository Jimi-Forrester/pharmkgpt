6410934|t|[Sperm count in male patients after alcoholic delirium].
6410934|a|Ejaculates from 30 patients with alcohol toxic delirium have been tested. We found a decreased number of hypospermia (n = 8) and a reduced sperm density of 18 mill.spermatozoa/ml. Judging sperm density, morphology and motility, 29 sperm-counts are severe pathological. The disturbance of spermiogeneses is most pronounced (2 = 0.01), when increased FSH-values (n = 10) and acute alcohol toxical hepatitis (n = 4) were found, but is less dependent on the drinking habits according to Jellinek or on increased oestradiol values (n = 6) or increased CK-values. The sperm parameters in chronic alcoholics show no better values when fertility has been proved before (n = 10).
