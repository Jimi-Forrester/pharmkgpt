21292200|t|The effect of cerebral monitoring on recovery after sevoflurane anesthesia in ambulatory setting in children: a comparison among bispectral index, A-line autoregressive index, and standard practice.
21292200|a|BACKGROUND: The bispectral index (BIS) and A-line autoregressive index (AAI) are electroencephalogram-derived monitoring indices of anesthesia. This study evaluated the efficacy of BIS- and AAI-guided sevoflurane anesthesia in children receiving ambulatory urologic surgeries. METHODS: One hundred sixty children (aged 3-12 years) undergoing ambulatory urologic surgery were randomized to receive sevoflurane anesthesia controlled either solely by clinical parameters (standard practice group), BIS-guided group within the BIS range of 40-60 (BIS group), or AAI-guided group within the AAI range of 15-30 (AAI group). The primary outcome was the recovery time, and the secondary outcome was the quality of recovery, including the incidence of emergency delirium measured by Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium score, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and parental satisfaction. RESULTS: Compared with the standard practice group, patients with BIS or AAI monitoring had shortened recovery time and consumed less sevoflurane. There were no significant differences in the incidences of emergence delirium, postoperative nausea and vomiting, or parental satisfaction among the three groups. CONCLUSION: BIS- and AAI- guided titration sevoflurane anesthesia could result in shortened recovery and reduced sevoflurane concentration and consumption without affecting the quality of recovery in children receiving ambulatory urologic surgery. The beneficial effects of AAI- and BIS-guided anesthesia in pediatric ambulatory surgeries are similar.
