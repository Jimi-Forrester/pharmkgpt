39235983|t|AMPA receptors in Alzheimer disease: Pathological changes and potential therapeutic targets.
39235983|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that affects synapses and leads to progressive cognitive decline. The role of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors in the pathogenesis of AD is well-established as they contribute to excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration in the pathological process of extrasynaptic glutamate concentration. However, the therapeutic potential of the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine in rescuing synaptic damage is limited. Research indicates that alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors also play a significant role in AD. Abnormal transcription, expression, and localization of AMPA receptors lead to synaptic dysfunction and damage, contributing to early cognitive impairment in AD patients. Understanding the impact of AMPA receptors on AD pathogenesis and exploring the potential for the development of AMPA receptor-targeting drugs are crucial. This review aims to consolidate recent research findings on AMPA receptors in AD, elucidate the current state of AMPA receptor research and lay the foundation for future basic research and drug development.
