37837245|a|OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and adverse events linked to the utilization of fentanyl for perioperative pain management in dentistry. METHODS: This systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) adhered to the PRISMA guidelines and incorporated various databases. RESULTS: Eleven RCTs studying 674 patients were analyzed. Perioperative pain was predominantly evaluated in patients undergoing surgery for impacted molars, although some studies also included patients with other conditions such as oral submucous fibrosis, maxillary cancer, bony temporomandibular joint ankylosis, irreversible pulpitis, among others. Combined with dexmedetomidine, fentanyl produced enhanced analgesic effects. It demonstrated comparable efficacy when compared to nefopam and nalbuphine. Both intranasal and intravenous administration routes proved equally effective. In four RCTs, the transdermal fentanyl patch outperformed the control group, except in the clinical trial where it was compared to ropivacaine. The main adverse events associated with the use of fentanyl included nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, delirium, and respiratory depression; however, they were like those reported in the comparison groups. CONCLUSIONS: While fentanyl demonstrated satisfactory perioperative analgesic efficacy, there were other alternatives that displayed better or comparable outcomes. Due to the risks and potential for misuse of fentanyl, these alternatives must be considered although adverse events were also reported.
