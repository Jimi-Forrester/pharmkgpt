37501887|t|Endovascular Embolization of Femoral Pseudoaneurysm Associated with Therapeutic and Diagnostic Neuroendovascular Procedures.
37501887|a|Objective: We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of endovascular embolization for femoral iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms (PAs) following therapeutic and diagnostic neuroendovascular procedures. Methods: This study included 12 patients with femoral PA due to femoral puncture at our department between May 2014 and April 2021. We performed an analysis of baseline characteristics, treatment, and outcome of these cases. Results: Endovascular embolization was performed in 10 of the 12 PAs using coils and/or N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate. Of these, 10 PAs were treated with endovascular embolization and 9 were successfully occluded, whereas complete occlusion was not achieved in 1 case of PA (success rate: 90%). No new intraoperative or postoperative complications or postoperative recurrences occurred. Conclusion: Endovascular embolization for PA can be immediately performed under local anesthesia without discontinuation of antithrombotic therapy and may be a safe and effective option for access site complication treatment.
