12535702|t|Passage of amyloid beta protein antibody across the blood-brain barrier in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
12535702|a|Vaccinations against amyloid beta protein (A beta P) reduce amyloid deposition and reverse learning and memory deficits in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. This has raised the question of whether circulating antibodies, normally restricted by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), can enter the brain [Nat. Med. 7 (2001) 369-372]. Here, we show that antibody directed against A beta P does cross the BBB at a very low rate. Entry is by way of the extracellular pathways with about 0.11% of an intravenous (i.v.) dose entering the brain by 1h. Clearance of antibody from brain increasingly dominates over time, but antibody is still detectable in brain 72 h after i.v. injection. Uptake and clearance is not altered in mice overexpressing A beta P. This ability to enter and exit the brain even in the presence of increased brain ligand supports the use of antibody in the treatment of Alzheimer's and other diseases of the brain.
