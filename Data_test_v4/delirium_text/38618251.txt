38618251|a|Emerging research suggests a potential association of progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with alterations in synaptic currents and mitochondrial dynamics. However, the specific associations between these pathological changes remain unclear. In this study, we utilized Abeta42-induced AD rats and primary neural cells as in vivo and in vitro models. The investigations included behavioural tests, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis, Nissl staining, thioflavin-S staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Golgi-Cox staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunofluorescence staining, proteomics, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) detection, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assessment, mitochondrial morphology analysis, electrophysiological studies, Western blotting, and molecular docking. The results revealed changes in synaptic currents, mitophagy, and mitochondrial dynamics in the AD models. Remarkably, intervention with Dengzhan Shengmai (DZSM) capsules emerged as a pivotal element in this investigation. Abeta42-induced synaptic dysfunction was significantly mitigated by DZSM intervention, which notably amplified the frequency and amplitude of synaptic transmission. The cognitive impairment observed in AD rats was ameliorated and accompanied by robust protection against structural damage in key brain regions, including the hippocampal CA3, primary cingular cortex, prelimbic system, and dysgranular insular cortex. DZSM intervention led to increased IDE levels, augmented long-term potential (LTP) amplitude, and enhanced dendritic spine density and length. Moreover, DZSM intervention led to favourable changes in mitochondrial parameters, including ROS expression, MMP and ATP contents, and mitochondrial morphology. In conclusion, our findings delved into the realm of altered synaptic currents, mitophagy, and mitochondrial dynamics in AD, concurrently highlighting the therapeutic potential of DZSM intervention.
