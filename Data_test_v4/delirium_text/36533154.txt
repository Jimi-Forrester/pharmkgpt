36533154|a|There is currently no cure for neurodegenerative or vascular dementias, but some pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions may contribute to alleviate symptoms, slow disease progression and improve quality of life. Current treatment approaches are based on etiology, symptom profile and stage of dementia. This manuscript presents recommendations on pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, vascular cognitive impairment, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies.
