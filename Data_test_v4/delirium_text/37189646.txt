37189646|a|BACKGROUND: We have performed a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and safety of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE, a radioligand therapy, in advanced somatostatin receptor-positive pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PPGL), thymic neuroendocrine tumor (NET), bronchial NET, unknown primary NET, or medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). METHODS: Studies identified in PubMed from inception to 13 May 2021 must have assessed [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE as a single agent and reported outcome data for the specific NET types of interest. RESULTS: Two independent reviewers performed the screening and data extraction, resulting in 16 publications: PPGL (n = 7), bronchial NETs (n = 6; one also included NETs of unknown origin), and MTC (n = 3). Overall, [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE offers encouraging antitumor activity (overall tumor response rates and disease control rates) across NET types. Safety was favorable with most adverse events mild to moderate in severity, transient, and consistent with those seen in patients with gastroenteropancreatic (GEP)-NETs. CONCLUSIONS: [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE has been used effectively in clinical practice to treat NETs of non-GEP origin.
