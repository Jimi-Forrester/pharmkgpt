30524653|a|Polygonum multiflorum Thunb. (PM), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, has been widely used in the Orient as a tonic and antiaging agent. 2,3,5,4'-Tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-beta-D-glucoside (TSG, C20H22O9, FW = 406.38928) is one of the active components extracted from PM. TSG is an antioxidant agent, which exhibits remarkable antioxidative activities in vivo and in vitro. The antioxidant effect of TSG is achieved by its radical-scavenging effects. TSG can inhibit apoptosis and protect neuronal cells against injury through multifunctional cytoprotective pathways. TSG performs prophylactic and therapeutic activities against Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. It is also antiatherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory. However, the mechanisms underlying these pharmacological activities are unclear. This study aimed at reviewing experimental studies and describing the effectiveness and possible mechanisms of TSG.
