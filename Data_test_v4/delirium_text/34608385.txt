34608385|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, it is imperative to identify the subjects with mild cognitive impairment before clinical symptoms of AD appear. This work proposes a technique for decision support in identifying subjects who will show transition from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the future. We used robust predictors from multivariate MRI-derived biomarkers and neuropsychological measures and tracked their longitudinal trajectories to predict signs of AD in the MCI population. Assuming piecewise linear progression of the disease, we designed a novel weighted gradient offset-based technique to forecast the future marker value using readings from at least two previous follow-up visits. Later, the complete predictor trajectories are used as features for a standard support vector machine classifier to identify MCI-to-AD progressors amongst the MCI patients enrolled in the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) cohort. We explored the performance of both unimodal and multimodal models in a 5-fold cross-validation setup. The proposed technique resulted in a high classification AUC of 91.2% and 95.7% for 6-month- and 1-year-ahead AD prediction, respectively, using multimodal markers. In the end, we discuss the efficacy of MRI markers as compared to NM for MCI-to-AD conversion prediction.
