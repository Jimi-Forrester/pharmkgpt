36281208|t|A Review of the Biological Mechanisms of Dexmedetomidine for Postoperative Neurocognitive Disorders.
36281208|a|Postoperative neurocognitive disorders are common neurological complications following surgery that are generally characterized by varying degrees of cognitive impairment. Postoperative neurocognitive disorders can exhibit as short-term postoperative delirium and/or long-term postoperative cognitive dysfunction. In addition, postoperative neurocognitive disorders may result in poor outcomes in patients, and are a leading cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality, particularly in elderly patients. Recently, there has been a heightened interest in mechanisms and clinical treatments for postoperative neurocognitive disorders. Though some influencing factors and mechanisms of postoperative neurocognitive disorders have been revealed, they remain troublesome problems in clinical departments. Dexmedetomidine is a commonly used anesthetic adjuvant that may help improve postoperative cognitive impairment, especially the conditions of a postoperative acute event (postoperative delirium, within 1 week after operation) and delayed neurocognitive recovery (postoperative cognitive dysfunction, up to 30 days). In the recent literature, dexmedetomidine has been shown to exert positive effects on cognitive impairment in clinical and animal studies, especially for postoperative neurocognitive disorders. However, not all clinical findings support this efficacy. Though some mechanisms of dexmedetomidine on postoperative neurocognitive disorders have been proposed, such as signaling pathways associated with inflammation and apoptosis, this evidence is fragmentary and disputed in the literature. Therefore, this article aims to review the potential biological mechanisms underlying dexmedetomidine's effects on postoperative neurocognitive disorders, providing a reference for future studies.
