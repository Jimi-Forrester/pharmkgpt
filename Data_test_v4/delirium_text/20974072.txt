20974072|a|This cross-sectional study (N = 155) investigated precipitating factors associated with delirium among long-term-care residents with dementia and assessed their cumulative effect on the likelihood of having delirium. Use of physical restraints (odds ratio [OR] = 4.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.61-8.27) was the factor most associated, and the likelihood of being in delirium increased with the number of associated precipitating factors present (OR = 2.53, 95% CI = 1.42-4.49). Given their frailty, only a few precipitating factors need be present to increase the likelihood of these residents being in delirium, hence the need for increased nurse awareness of the risks posed by use of physical restraints with respect to the cognitive function of elderly residents with dementia.
