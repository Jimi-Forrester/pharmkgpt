33578991|t|Metabolic Alterations Associated with gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid and the Potential of Metabolites as Biomarkers of Its Exposure.
33578991|a|gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is an endogenous short chain fatty acid that acts as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator in the mammalian brain. It has often been illegally abused or misused due to its strong anesthetic effect, particularly in drug-facilitated crimes worldwide. However, proving its ingestion is not straightforward because of the difficulty in distinguishing between endogenous and exogenous GHB, as well as its rapid metabolism. Metabolomics and metabolism studies have recently been used to identify potential biomarkers of GHB exposure. This mini-review provides an overview of GHB-associated metabolic alterations and explores the potential of metabolites for application as biomarkers of GHB exposure. For this, we discuss the biosynthesis and metabolism of GHB, analytical issues of GHB in biological samples, alterations in metabolic pathways, and changes in the levels of GHB conjugates in biological samples from animal and human studies. Metabolic alterations in organic acids, amino acids, and polyamines in urine enable discrimination between GHB-ingested animals or humans and controls. The potential of GHB conjugates has been investigated in a variety of clinical settings. Despite the recent growth in the application of metabolomics and metabolism studies associated with GHB exposure, it remains challenging to distinguish between endogenous and exogenous GHB. This review highlights the significance of further metabolomics and metabolism studies for the discovery of practical peripheral biomarkers of GHB exposure.
