10862247|a|BACKGROUND: The cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease is the basis of a new class of drugs: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. These drugs have few side effects, mainly digestive disorders. CASE REPORTS: Extra-pyramidal side effects with severe gait disorders were observed in 3 patients with Alzheimer's dementia treated with donepezil. This drug was associated with paroxetine or a neuroleptic. In 2 of the 3 cases, the extra-pyramidal effects disappeared when donepezil was discontinued. DISCUSSION: Extra-pyramidal syndromes in elderly subjects with cognitive impairment are difficult to interpret. The possible causes include interactions between acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, neuroleptics and serotonine reuptake inhibitors and Lewy body dementia.
