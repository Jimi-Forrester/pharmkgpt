20336771|a|The ubiquitin-proteasome system fulfills a pivotal role in regulating intracellular protein turnover. Impairment of this system is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by ubiquitin- containing proteinaceous deposits. UBB(+1), a mutant ubiquitin, is one of the proteins accumulating in the neuropathological hallmarks of tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease, and polyglutamine diseases. In vitro, UBB(+1) properties shift from a proteasomal ubiquitin-fusion degradation substrate at low expression levels to a proteasome inhibitor at high expression levels. Here we report on a novel transgenic mouse line (line 6663) expressing low levels of neuronal UBB(+1). In these mice, UBB(+1) protein is scarcely detectable in the neuronal cell population. Accumulation of UBB(+1) commences only after intracranial infusion of the proteasome inhibitors lactacystin or MG262, showing that, at these low expression levels, the UBB(+1) protein is a substrate for proteasomal degradation in vivo. In addition, accumulation of the protein serves as a reporter for proteasome inhibition. These findings strengthen our proposition that, in healthy brain, UBB(+1) is continuously degraded and disease-related UBB(+1) accumulation serves as an endogenous marker for proteasomal dysfunction. This novel transgenic line can give more insight into the intrinsic properties of UBB(+1) and its role in neurodegenerative disease.
