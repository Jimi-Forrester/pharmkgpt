39379090|a|OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of hearing loss in patients with dementia, examine the use of hearing aids in those with hearing loss, and ascertain if the cause of hearing loss is central or peripheral in origin. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study involving 143 patients with dementia which was conducted in Saudi Arabia from 2020 to 2023 in King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to determine hearing loss. The study included patients aged >=60 years who had dementia, hearing loss, and neurological diseases. Those with Parkinson's disease and secondary epilepsy were excluded. Data was analyzed for its demographics, clinical features, predisposing factors, treatment, dementia duration and progression, and hearing loss outcomes. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM's SPSS software, version 29.0.0. Statistical significance was established at a p-value of <=0.05 and a confidence interval of 95%. RESULTS: The findings indicated that 88.8% of the 143 patients exhibited dementia, with Alzheimer's disease being the most prevalent type. Moreover, 18.2% had hearing issues, and 11.2% had other complaints. Audiometry was performed in 15.4% of the cases. Hearing loss was present in 14.7% of the patients, being primarily bilateral, ranging from mild to severe. CONCLUSION: This study has clarified the link between hearing loss and dementia onset and has emphasized the need for early evaluation and intervention for individuals with hearing impairment.
