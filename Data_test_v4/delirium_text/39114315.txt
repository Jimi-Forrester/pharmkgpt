39114315|t|Integrated Approaches of Prevention and Medicine for Dealing with Central Nervous System Brucellosis: A Case from a Non-Epidemic Area - China, 2023.
39114315|a|What is already known about this topic?: Brucellosis of the central nervous system (CNS) is rare and frequently fatal, often being overlooked or misdiagnosed. What is added by this report?: In April 2023, the Jinan CDC identified a case of CNS brucellosis in a 54-year-old woman through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture. Upon confirming the diagnosis of brucellosis, the Jinan CDC immediately informed Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, to which the patient had been transferred, and she was subsequently tracked and successfully treated. What are the implications for public health practice?: The successful outcome can be attributed to the effective integration of a system that facilitated coordinated and collaborative actions between public health services and clinical institutions.
