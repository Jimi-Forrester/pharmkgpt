37207409|a|Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) has been identified as a risk factor for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. The medial temporal structures, which are crucial for memory processing, are the earliest affected regions in the brains of patients with aMCI, and episodic memory performance has been identified as a reliable way to discriminate between patients with aMCI and cognitively normal older adults. However, whether the detail and gist memory of patients with aMCI and cognitively normal older adults decay differently remains unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that detail and gist memory would be retrieved differentially, with a larger group performance gap in detail memory than in gist memory. In addition, we explored whether an increasing group performance gap between detail memory and gist memory groups would be observed over a 14-day period. Furthermore, we hypothesized that unisensory (audio-only) and multisensory (audiovisual) encoding would lead to differences in retrievals, with the multisensory condition reducing between and within-group performance gaps observed under the unisensory condition. The analyses conducted were analyses of covariance controlling for age, sex, and education and correlational analyses to examine behavioral performance and the association between behavioral data and brain variables. Compared with cognitively normal older adults, the patients with aMCI performed poorly on both detail and gist memory tests, and this performance gap persisted over time. Moreover, the memory performance of the patients with aMCI was enhanced by the provision of multisensory information, and bimodal input was significantly associated with medial temporal structure variables. Overall, our findings suggest that detail and gist memory decay differently, with a longer lasting group gap in gist memory than in detail memory. Multisensory encoding effectively reduced or overcame the between- and within-group gaps between time intervals, especially for gist memory, compared with unisensory encoding.
