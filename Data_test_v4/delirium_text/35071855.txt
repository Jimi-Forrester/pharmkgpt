35071855|t|Coffee Phenolics and Their Interaction with Other Food Phenolics: Antagonistic and Synergistic Effects.
35071855|a|Due to its strong aroma and stimulating effect, coffee is the most consumed beverage worldwide, following water. Apart from being a luscious food product, its contents of high phenolic compounds dominated by chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and their derivatives have caused coffee to be consumed by individuals at higher ratios and have also encouraged the number of varying research studies for its health-promoting properties. However, it should be noted that these desirable beneficial actions of coffee phenolics are in dynamic behaviors, highly dependent on the roasting process parameters and presence of different types of phenolic compounds in the media. Interactions between coffee phenolics and other phenols might end up with induced or reduced biological activities, which is called synergism or antagonism, respectively. In this paper, bioactive properties such as antioxidant, enzyme inhibition, and chelating power are reviewed in terms of synergism and antagonism of coffee phenolics and other bioactive compounds that are introduced into the matrix, such as cacao, ginger, cinnamon, willow bark, cardamom, and chili pepper. Furthermore, how these properties are affected after in vitro digestion and potential reasons for the outcomes are also briefly discussed with the aim of providing a better understanding of these interactions for the food industry. Revealing the synergistic and antagonistic interactions of the phenolics between coffee and different ingredients in a food matrix and their effects on bioactivity mechanisms is not only important for scientific studies but also for conscious food consumption of individuals.
