38975231|t|Multifaceted complications and surgical management of bronchobiliary fistula with associated pneumonia and intrahepatic stones: A case report.
38975231|a|Background: Bronchobiliary fistulas (BBFs), primarily stemming from choledocholithiasis, present considerable diagnostic and treatment challenges. Their prolonged nature can lead to life-threatening situations without timely management, often complicated by lung abscesses. Case presentation: A 64-year-old man, presenting with fever, chills, and a cough initially misdiagnosed as a common cold, developed severe respiratory distress and delirium upon admission. Urgent intensive care unit (ICU) admission was prompted by a computed tomography (CT) scan revealing a right lung abscess. Enhanced CT scans and elevated bilirubin levels confirmed the biliary origin of the BBFs. Comprehensive treatment included laparoscopic partial hepatectomy, choledochojejunostomy, stone extraction, choledochoscopy, T-tube drainage, and BBFs closure. The patient was discharged with a T-tube. Follow-up CT after two months showed no recurrence. Conclusions: Managing BBFs, especially with concurrent lung abscesses in choledocholithiasis patients, remains challenging but feasible. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial to improving survival rates and quality of life, highlighting the need for vigilance. This case underscores the importance of early detection and comprehensive treatment for successful outcomes in such complex conditions.
