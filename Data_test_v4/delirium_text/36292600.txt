36292600|a|We investigated the presence of misfolded alpha-Synuclein (alpha-Syn) in minor salivary gland biopsies in relation to substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) damage measured using magnetic resonance imaging in patients with isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) as compared to healthy controls. Sixty-one participants (27 PD, 16 iRBD, and 18 controls) underwent a minor salivary gland biopsy and were scanned using a 3 Tesla MRI. Deposits of alpha-Syn were found in 15 (55.6%) PD, 7 (43.8%) iRBD, and 7 (38.9%) controls using the anti-aggregated alpha-Syn clone 5G4 antibody and in 4 (14.8%) PD, 3 (18.8%) iRBD and no control using the purified mouse anti-alpha-Syn clone 42 antibody. The SNc damages obtained using neuromelanin-sensitive imaging did not differ between the participants with versus without alpha-Syn deposits (irrespective of the antibodies and the disease group). Our study indicated that the alpha-Syn detection in minor salivary gland biopsies lacks sensitivity and specificity and does not correlate with the SNc damage, suggesting that it cannot be used as a predictive or effective biomarker for PD.
