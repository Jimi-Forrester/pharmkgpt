36018262|a|Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy has breakthrough potential for relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, because of the risk for neurotoxicity, trials usually exclude patients with central nervous system leukemia (CNSL) or active neurological comorbidities (NC). Here, we evaluated the efficacy and neurotoxicity of humanized CD19-directed CAR-T therapy for R/R ALL with CNSL or NC. Of 12 enrolled patients, 4 had CNSL with bone marrow (BM) or testicular recurrence, 3 had BM relapses with NC, and 5 had BM relapse without NC. Bridging chemotherapy was performed for high tumor burden before CAR-T therapy. Patients with CNSL or BM relapse with NC or without NC experienced 100% complete remission. Tumor burden reduction did not occur in 1 patient with NC, who developed grade 5 neurotoxicity before BM assessment, and one patient with CNSL developed leukoencephalopathy. Severe cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity developed in 0% with CNSL, 33.3% with BM relapse and NC, and 0% without NC. CAR-T cells expanded in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of all patients with no difference among CNSL, BM with NC, or no NC (respective median percentages among lymphocyte: 33.7%, 48.2% and 34.5%, P =0.899; respective median concentrations: 0.82, 2.21, and 0.46/muL, P =0.719). Median CSF CAR-T cell duration was 5.5 (3-9) months with CNSL and 3 (2-3) months without CNSL ( P =0.031). CAR-T can be given safely and effectively to pediatric patients with R/R ALL with CNSL or NC who have near-normal neurological status. High tumor burden may confer increased risk for severe neurotoxicity.
