30181725|t|Impact of Two Educational Modules on Practitioner Knowledge of Pediatric Delirium.
30181725|a|OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of education modules in preparing staff before the implementation of a pediatric delirium screening protocol. METHODS: After consenting participants began phase 1 of the study, which covered general information on pediatric delirium. It comprised a 21-question assessment administered as a pretest followed by an education module and then the same 21-question assessment administered as a posttest. After completing phase 1, participants proceeded to phase 2, which focused on use of the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD) tool. It comprised an education module and a 14-question postassessment. Participants completed these phases at their convenience via provided instruction documents. Assessments were delivered through the online service SurveyMonkey. Education modules were available online as invisible YouTube videos. RESULTS: A total of 50 nurses and pharmacists gave consent, and 37 of these participants initiated phase 1. All 37 participants completed the phase 1 preassessment, averaging a score of 46% (range, 29%-71%). A total of 27 participants completed the phase 1 postassessment, with an average score of approximately 76% (range, 48%-95%). A total of 20 participants, with no prior training on the CAPD, completed the phase 2 postassessment, averaging a score of 88% (range, 43%-100%). CONCLUSIONS: Both the pediatric delirium general education module and the CAPD use education module resulted in participant learning, as evidenced by the assessment score averages.
