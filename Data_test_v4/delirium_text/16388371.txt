16388371|t|A novel presenilin 1 L166H mutation in a pseudo-sporadic case of early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
16388371|a|We report a 44-year-old woman presenting at 33 years with memory loss, followed by progressive dementia. Her family history was negative for dominant genetic disorders at high penetrance. Analysis of presenilin-1 gene revealed a missense mutation at codon 166, leading to the substitution from leucine to histidine. The mutation occurs in the third transmembrane domain of presenilin-1, at the position of two different mutations previously described, associated with an atypical phenotype. The present case has two implications: (1) mutations of presenilin-1 have to be searched also in apparently sporadic cases of dementia beginning in the third decade of life; (2) as yet unidentified factors, besides the gamma-secretase complex, influence the phenotype of presenilin-1 mutations.
