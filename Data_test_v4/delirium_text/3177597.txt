3177597|t|Immunohistochemical study of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. II. Enhancement of immunostaining using formic acid pretreatment of tissue sections.
3177597|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a biochemically heterogeneous entity most commonly associated with stroke syndromes, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Down's syndrome, and miscellaneous neurologic conditions. The authors have applied and extended (using formic acid pretreatment of histologic sections) an immunocytochemical technique that used antibody to a synthetic 28-amino acid peptide representing a segment of the AD amyloid precursor, to study CAA and related parenchymal amyloid deposits in brain tissues originally derived from: 1) patients with CAA with or without typical clinicopathologic features of AD, cerebral hemorrhage, and infarcts; 2) a young boy with angiocentric brain amyloid; 3) patients with familial (Icelandic, Dutch) forms of cerebral hemorrhage caused by CAA; and 4) Japanese patients with nonfamilial CAA-related brain hemorrhage, sometimes associated with histopathology characteristic of AD. Formic acid pretreatment of sections resulted in markedly enhanced staining of senile plaque core and microvascular, especially capillary, amyloid, and some apparent staining of the neuritic component of senile plaques. Perivascular halos of immunoreactive material were observed frequently. Neurofibrillary tangles were not immunolabeled, nor were blood vessels or any parenchymal components within cerebral white matter. CAA in Japanese patients with nonfamilial encephalic hemorrhages appeared immunocytochemically identical to AD-related CAA. Arterioles in brains that had severe CAA frequently showed significant stenosis of their lumina by nonamyloid hyaline or cellular material.
