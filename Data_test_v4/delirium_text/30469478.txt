30469478|t|Inflammation-Accelerated Senescence and the Cardiovascular System: Mechanisms and Perspectives.
30469478|a|Low-grade chronic inflammation is a common denominator in atherogenesis and related diseases. Solid evidence supports the occurrence of an impairment in the innate and adaptive immune system with senescence, favoring the development of acute and chronic age-related diseases. Cardiovascular (CV) diseases (CVD), in particular, are a leading cause of death even at older ages. Inflammation-associated mechanisms that contribute to CVD development include dysregulated redox and metabolic pathways, genetic modifications, and infections/dysbiosis. In this review, we will recapitulate the determinants and consequences of the immune system dysfunction at older age, with particular focus on the CV system. We will examine the currently available and potential future strategies to counteract accelerated CV aging, i.e., nutraceuticals, probiotics, caloric restriction, physical activity, smoking and alcohol cessation, control of low-grade inflammation sources, senolytic and senescence-modulating drugs, and DNA-targeting drugs.
