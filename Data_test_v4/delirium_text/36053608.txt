36053608|a|INTRODUCTION: Inadequate management of pain and sedation in critically ill children can cause unnecessary suffering and agitation, but also delirium and iatrogenic withdrawal. It is, therefore, important to address these four interrelated conditions together. Some clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are available for the management of pain and sedation, and a few for delirium and iatrogenic withdrawal in the paediatric intensive care unit; none address the four conditions altogether. Critical appraisal of the quality of CPGs is necessary for their recommendations to be adopted into clinical practice. The aim of this systematic review is to identify and appraise the quality of CPGs and recommendations for management of either pain, sedation, delirium and iatrogenic withdrawal. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Researchers will conduct a systematic review in electronic databases (Medline ALL (Ovid), Embase.com, CINAHL with Full Text (EBSCO), JBI EBP Database (Ovid)), guideline repositories and websites of professional societies to identify CPGs published from 2010 to date. They will then combine index and free terms describing CPGs with pain, sedation, delirium and withdrawal. The researchers will include CPGs if they can be applied in the paediatric intensive care population (newborns to 18 years old) and include recommendation(s) for assessment of at least one of the four conditions. Two independent reviewers will screen for eligibility, complete data extraction and quality assessments using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II and the AGREE Recommendation Excellence instruments. Researchers will report characteristics, content and recommendations from CPGs in tabulated forms. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for this systematic review. Results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42021274364.
