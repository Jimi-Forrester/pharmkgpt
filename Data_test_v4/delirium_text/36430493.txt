36430493|a|Neuroinflammation, a key pathological contributor to various neurodegenerative diseases, is mediated by microglial activation and subsequent secretion of inflammatory cytokines via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Moreover, neuroinflammation leads to synaptic loss and memory impairment. This study investigated the inhibitory effects of PNP001, a mixture of Trichosanthis Semen and Zingiberis Rhizoma in a ratio of 3:1, on neuroinflammation and neurological deficits induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). For the in vitro study, PNP001 was administered in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells, and reduced the pro-inflammatory mediators, such as nitric oxide, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2 by downregulating MAPK signaling. For the in vivo study, ICR mice were orally administered PNP001 for 18 consecutive days, and concurrently treated with LPS (1 mg/kg, i.p.) for 10 days, beginning on the 4th day of PNP001 administration. The remarkably decreased number of activated microglial cells and increased expression of pre- and post-synaptic proteins were observed more in the hippocampus of the PNP001 administered groups than in the LPS-treated group. Furthermore, daily PNP001 administration significantly attenuated long-term memory decline compared with the LPS-treated group. Our study demonstrated that PNP001 inhibits LPS-induced neuroinflammation and its associated memory dysfunction by alleviating microglial activation and synaptic loss.
