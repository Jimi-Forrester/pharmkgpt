34216066|t|The relation between psychological distress and medication adherence in lung transplant candidates and recipients: A cross-sectional study.
34216066|a|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the prevalence of psychological distress such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and its associations with medication adherence in lung transplant patients. BACKGROUND: Psychological distress after lung transplantation may impact clinical outcomes by associated behaviours such as non-adherence to medication. Evidence about the relation between psychological distress and medication adherence in lung transplant patients is limited and not well explained. DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a single-centre study with a cross-sectional design in 73 lung transplant candidates and 116 recipients. Questionnaires were the Brief Symptom Inventory, Impact of Event Scale and Basel Assessment of Adherence to Immunosuppressive Medications Scale. The STROBE checklist was monitored. RESULTS: In candidates, 39.7% reported (sub)clinical symptoms of depression, in recipients this was 21.6%. We observed suicidal ideation in recipients (8.6%), and candidates (5.5%). The prevalence of (sub)clinical symptoms of anxiety was 38.3% in candidates and 33.7% in recipients. After lung transplantation, 12% of the recipients reported clinical symptoms of PTSD related to the transplantation. Symptoms of anxiety and medication adherence were significantly and positively related in transplant recipients. We found no association between depressive or post-traumatic stress symptoms, and medication adherence. CONCLUSIONS: In lung transplant patients, we found a high prevalence of symptoms of depression and anxiety. Recipients had high levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms related to the transplantation. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was unexpectedly high in recipients. After lung transplantation, higher levels of anxiety were related to better medication adherence. We propose that LTX recipients are very anxious to develop dyspnoea and therefore take their medication more conscientiously. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The clinical nurse specialist can play a key role in identifying and addressing psychological and behavioural problems. More prospective research on the role of anxiety and dyspnoea in lung transplant recipients is recommended.
