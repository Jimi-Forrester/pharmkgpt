32566091|t|Interplay between Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, and Amyloidosis in the Anterior Segment of the Eye; Its Pathological Implications.
32566091|a|There are different pathologies associated with amyloidogenic processes caused by the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the overactivation of inflammatory responses. These alterations are present in different regions of the anterior segment of the eye, and they have been associated with the development and progression of ocular pathologies, such as glaucoma, dry eye syndrome, keratitis, and cataracts among other pathologies. Aim. To discuss briefly the anatomical characteristics of the anterior segment of the eye and describe the interaction between oxidative stress (OS) and inflammatory responses, emphasizing the misfolding of several proteins leading to amyloidogenic processes occurring in the anterior segment and their implications in the development of ocular diseases. We performed a search on PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase using the MeSH terms "eye," "anterior segment", "inflammation", "oxidative stress", and "amyloidosis". The search encompassed manuscripts published up to April 2019. A hundred forty-four published studies met the inclusion criteria. We present the current knowledge regarding the interaction between OS and the activation of inflammatory processes and how both can cause conformational changes in several peptides and proteins in each compartment of the anterior segment. However, we found that there is no consensus about which factor is the first to cause amyloidosis. Our conclusions suggest that there is an interplay among these factors forming a vicious cycle that leads to the loss of protein structure in ocular pathologies, and multifactorial therapies should be developed to avoid protein misfolding and to stop the progression of ocular pathologies.
