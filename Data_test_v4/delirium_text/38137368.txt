38137368|t|Understanding the Episodic Memory and Executive Functioning Axis Impairment in MCI Patients: A Multicenter Study in Comparison with CSF Biomarkers.
38137368|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the association between a verbal learning task that evaluates the potential mutual dependency between memory and executive functions (i.e., the Test of Memory Strategies, TMS) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's Disease (AD) biomarkers. METHODS: A sample of 47 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants from Poland and Spain were classified according to the Erlangen Score Diagnostic Algorithm (ESA) into CSF- (n = 16) and CSF+ (n = 31) groups. Correlation analyses between TMS word-list conditions and CSF biomarkers were conducted. Additionally, an analysis of covariance was performed to define the effect on ESA classification in the sample, using as a covariable the country of origin of the participants. RESULTS: Significant associations between the TMS-3 condition and Abeta42, t-tau, and p-tau were observed for the whole sample. In addition, the CSF- participants obtained higher cognitive performance in TMS-3 compared to the CSF+ group. This outcome persisted if the groups were based on Abeta42 scores, but not t-tau or p-tau values. CONCLUSIONS: These findings could indicate that poor performance on verbal learning tests may be affected by executive dysfunctions. Therefore, future intervention plans focused on training executive functions would be of interest to improve the ability of MCI patients to encode and organize information.
