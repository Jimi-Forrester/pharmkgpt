34277139|a|Introduction: Movement disorders are increasingly described in hospitalized and milder cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, despite a very low prevalence compared to the total patients. Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature published in English, spanning from the initial descriptions of COVID-19 until January 25, 2021, in the PubMed/MEDLINE database. Results: We identified 93 new-onset movement disorders cases (44 articles) from 200 papers screened in the database or reference lists. Myoclonus was present in 63.4% (n = 59), ataxia in 38.7% (n = 36), action/postural tremor in 10.8% (n = 10), rigid-akinetic syndrome in 5.38% (n = 5), oculomotor abnormalities in 20.4% (n = 19), catatonia in 2.1% (n = 2), dystonia in 1.1% (n = 1), chorea in 1.1% (n = 1), functional (psychogenic) movement disorders in 3.2% (n = 3) of the reported COVID-19 cases with any movement disorder. Encephalopathy was a common association (n = 37, 39.78%). Discussion: Comprehensive neurophysiological, clinical, and neuroimaging descriptions of movement disorders in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection are still lacking, and their pathophysiology may be related to inflammatory, postinfectious, or even indirect mechanisms not specific to SARS-CoV-2, such as ischemic-hypoxic brain insults, drug effects, sepsis, kidney failure. Cortical/subcortical myoclonus, which the cited secondary mechanisms can largely cause, seems to be the most common hyperkinetic abnormal movement, and it might occur in association with encephalopathy and ataxia. Conclusion: This brief review contributes to the clinical description of SARS-CoV-2 potential neurological manifestations, assisting clinical neurologists in identifying features of these uncommon syndromes as a part of COVID-19 symptomatology. Highlights: - Movement disorders are probably uncommon neurological manifestations in SARS-CoV-2 infection;- Myoclonus is the most reported movement disorder associated with COVID-19, its clinical complications or pharmacological management;- The pathophysiology is yet not well-understood but can include systemic inflammation, autoimmune mechanisms, or hypoxia.
