31148327|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition is one of the main hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. The study assessed the associations between cortical and subcortical 11 C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) retention, namely, in the hippocampus, amygdala, putamen, caudate, pallidum, and thalamus, and subcortical morphology in cognitively normal individuals. We recruited 104 cognitive normal individuals who underwent extensive neuropsychological assessment, PiB-positron emission tomography (PET) scan, and 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition of T1-weighted images. Global, cortical, and subcortical regional PiB retention values were derived from each scan and subcortical morphology analyses were performed to investigate vertex-wise local surface and global volumes, including the hippocampal subfields volumes. We found that subcortical regional Abeta was associated with the surface of the hippocampus, thalamus, and pallidum, with changes being due to volume and shape. Hippocampal Abeta was marginally associated with volume of the whole hippocampus as well as with the CA1 subfield, subiculum, and molecular layer. Participants showing higher subcortical Abeta also showed worse cognitive performance and smaller hippocampal volumes. In contrast, global and cortical PiB uptake did not associate with any subcortical metrics. This study shows that subcortical Abeta is associated with subcortical surface morphology in cognitively normal individuals. This study highlights the importance of quantifying subcortical regional PiB retention values in these individuals.
