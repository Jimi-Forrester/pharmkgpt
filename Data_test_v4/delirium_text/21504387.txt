21504387|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative illness affecting over 35 million people worldwide. Solanezumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to beta-amyloid (Abeta), a protein that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AD. The drug is currently being investigated in Phase III trials as a disease-modifying treatment for AD. AREAS COVERED: This paper reviews literature on solanezumab that is available in PubMed from 2008 to 2010, other treatment trials in clinicaltrials.gov and published abstracts from conferences. The article also provides a discussion of the early trials of AN1792 and an overview of the immunotherapies currently in development. The authors provide the reader with a critical appraisal of the to-date clinical trial data on solanezumab and its implications for the broader field of immunotherapies for AD. EXPERT OPINION: Solanezumab can neutralize soluble Abeta peptides, which may represent the more neurotoxic of the Abeta species. Phase II findings support the compound's safety, which has been a concern for some Abeta immunotherapies. Cerebrospinal and plasma biomarker changes with solanezumab treatment are encouraging. Results of the ongoing Phase III trials will be instrumental in determining the drug's clinical significance.
