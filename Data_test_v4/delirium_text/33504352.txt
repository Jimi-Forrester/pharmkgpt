33504352|a|BACKGROUND: Mitral valve prolapse is the most frequent valvular defect associated with a wide range of electro-hemodynamic abnormalities, leading to heart failure, arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Mitral valve prolapse, first described from Barlow in the 1960s, is defined as displacement of mitral leaflet tissue into the left atrium past the mitral annular plane during systole. The correlation between mitral valve prolapse and sudden cardiac death has been investigated and clarified by various studies in recent years. However, identifying patients at risk and applying measures to prevent those from sudden cardiac death is challenging. CASE PRESENTATION: We report on a 61-year-old female patient who had undergone an aborted sudden cardiac death. An arrythmogenic mitral valve prolapse was diagnosed. In addition, electrocardiographically and morphologically risk markers for sudden cardiac death were found in this case. We performed an ICD implantation as secondary prophylaxis and intended to reconstruct the mitral valve. CONCLUSION: This article examines the association of mitral valve prolapse with sudden cardiac death, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and the strategies leading to identify the risk group.
