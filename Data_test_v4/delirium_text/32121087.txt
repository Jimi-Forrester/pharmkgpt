32121087|t|Metabolite Profiling and Distribution of Militarine in Rats Using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS.
32121087|a|Militarine, a natural glucosyloxybenzyl 2-isobutylmalate, isolated from Bletilla striata, was reported with a prominent neuroprotective effect recently. The limited information on the metabolism of militarine impedes comprehension of its biological actions and pharmacology. This study aimed to investigate the metabolite profile and the distribution of militarine in vivo, which help to clarify the action mechanism further. A total of 71 metabolites (57 new metabolites) in rats were identified with a systematic method by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography combined with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS). The proposed metabolic pathways of militarine include hydrolyzation, oxidation, glycosylation, esterification, sulfation, glucuronidation and glycine conjugation. Militarine and its metabolites were distributed extensively in the treated rats. Notably, six metabolites of militarine were identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which were highly consistent with the metabolites after oral administration of gastrodin in rats. Among the metabolites in CSF, five of them were not reported before. It is the first systematic metabolic study of militarine in vivo, which is very helpful for better comprehension of the functions and the central nervous system (CNS) bioactivities of militarine. The findings will also provide an essential reference for the metabolism of other glucosylated benzyl esters of succinic, malic, tartaric and citric acids.
