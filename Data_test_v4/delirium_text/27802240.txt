27802240|t|Bipolar Disorder and Frontotemporal Dementia: An Intriguing Association.
27802240|a|Bipolar disorder (BD) could represent a prodromal state of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Two patients affected by lifelong BD with a progressive decline of cognitive functions, behavioral, and neurological signs, reached the early diagnosis of FTD before the age of 60. They were diagnosed as affected by primary progressive aphasia and FTD with parkinsonism, respectively. A diagnosis of FTD should therefore be taken into account, in case of unexpected cognitive and behavioral decline in patients with a long history of BD. Follow-up studies with genetic, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging markers of these BD/FTD patients could further explore some of the underlying association, opening new viable therapeutic options.
