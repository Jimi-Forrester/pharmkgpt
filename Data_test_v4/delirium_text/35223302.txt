35223302|t|Comorbidity of Epilepsy and Depression: Associated Pathophysiology and Management.
35223302|a|Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. Depression may arise as a result of other mental or physical problems or as a side effect of the drugs used to treat such illnesses, or it could be caused by epilepsy-related structural abnormalities. However, physicians are hesitant to prescribe antidepressants to patients with epilepsy due to concerns about decreasing seizure thresholds and the harmful drug interactions between antidepressants and antiepileptic medicines. As a result, the question about the optimal care of epileptic patients who suffer from depression remains unanswered. Despite the complicated link between epilepsy and depression, the co-administration of antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is safe and beneficial when appropriately managed. A focused evaluation for depression (regardless of social, economic, or personal circumstances) might identify people who benefit from medical care and therapeutic assistance. Vagus nerve stimulation and psychological therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, individual or group psychotherapy, patient support groups, family therapy, and counseling are nonpharmacological therapeutic alternatives. In terms of treatment strategy, it is critical to optimize seizure control and limit antiepileptic medications' adverse effects. Psychotherapy for depression in epilepsy is underused, even though it has been shown to be helpful in well-controlled studies. This review article has discussed some parts of the most common pathophysiologies of depression in patients with epilepsy, highlighted the efficacy of psychotherapy and antidepressant drugs, and explored the optimal care of patients with epilepsy who suffer from depression.
