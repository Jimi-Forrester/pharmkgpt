39852503|t|GC/MS Fatty Acid Profile of Marine-Derived Actinomycetes from Extreme Environments: Chemotaxonomic Insights and Biotechnological Potential.
39852503|a|This study investigated the fatty acids (FA) profile of 54 actinomycete strains isolated from marine sediments collected off the Portugal continental coast, specifically from the Estremadura Spur pockmarks field, by GC/MS. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were prepared from the ethyl acetate lipidic extracts of these strains and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), with FA identification performed using the NIST library. The identified FAs varied from C12:0 to C20:0, where 32 distinct FAs were identified, including 7 branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs), 9 odd-chain fatty acids (OCFAs), 8 monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), 6 saturated fatty acids (SFAs), 1 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), and 1 cyclic chain fatty acid (CCFA). The average expressed content was BCFA (47.54%), MUFA (28.49%), OCFA (26.93%), and SFA (22.16%), of which i-C16:0, C18:1omega9, and C16:0 were predominant, while PUFA (3.58%) and CCFA (0.41%) were identified as minor components. The identified BCFA were i-C16:0, a-C15:0, i-C15:0, i-C15:1omega6, a-C16:0, a-C14:0, and i-C17:0, which include combined branching and unsaturation and branching and odd. SFAs were present in all species, with C16:0 and C18:0 being the most representative. Rare OCFAs C19:1omega9, C17:1omega7, C15:0, and C17:0 were expressed. PUFA C18:1omega9 was detected; within this class, omega families omega9, omega7, omega6, and omega5 were identified, and no omega3 was detected. The only CCFA was benzene-butanoic acid (benzene-C4:0). These findings highlight the metabolic versatility of actinomycetes, providing valuable insights into microbial chemotaxonomy and offering promising biochemical leads for the development of biofuel, nutraceutical, and antifungal agents. Furthermore, these results underline the diversity and biotechnological potential of FAs in actinomycetes, uncovering their potential to be used as microbial cell factories, and paving the way for innovations in biofuels, pharmaceuticals, and eco-friendly industrial products.
