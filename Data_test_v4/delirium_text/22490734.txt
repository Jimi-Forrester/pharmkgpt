22490734|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the neuropsychological features of elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) susceptible to Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: A total of 47 patients with MCI diagnosed from June to October 2008 and 21 controls with normal cognition at the same convalescent camp were selected and followed up for two years. Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), mini mental state examination (MMSE) and clock drawing test (CDT) were performed for all subjects at the onset of study and repeated annually. RESULTS: At Month 12, the visuospatial skill scores of MCI patients decreased significantly versus those of the control (0.6 +- 0.7 vs 0.1 +- 0.6, P = 0.008). No one progressed to AD in neither groups. And at Month 24, both visuospatial skill scores (0.9 +- 0.9 vs 0.4 +- 0.9) and attention scores (1.0 +- 1.0 vs 0.2 +- 0.8) of MCI patients declined significantly versus the control (P = 0.021, 0.001). Among 47 MCI patients, 7 progressed to AD. No obvious difference existed in the score of all items between the AD converters and non-converters at baseline. However, the scores of MMSE (27.6 +- 0.8 vs 28.9 +- 1.0), MoCA (24.3 +- 3.1 vs 27.9 +- 1.6) and such MoCA subitems as visuospatial skill (3.9 +- 0.7 vs 4.5 +- 0.6), language (1.86 +- 0.38 vs 2.65 +- 0.53) and delayed recall (2.1 +- 1.5 vs 3.9 +- 1.0) of the converters were obviously lower than those of the non-converters at Month 12 (P < 0.05). Furthermore, all other scores of the AD converters, except for designation and abstract, were significantly lower than those of the non-converters at Month 24 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The visuospatial skill, executive function, delayed recall and language function of MCI patients progressing to AD tend to have early impairment and significant changes. It may be useful to predict AD among the MCI patients.
