34562992|t|The Mini-Cog, Clock Drawing Test, and Three-Item Recall Test: Rapid Cognitive Screening Tools with Comparable Performance in Detecting Mild NCD in Older Patients.
34562992|a|BACKGROUND: Early mild neurocognitive disorder (mild NCD) detection can allow for appropriate planning and delay disease progression. There have been few studies examining validated mild NCD detection tools. One such tool that may be of use is the Mini-Cog, which consists of the clock drawing test (CDT) and three-item recall. METHODS: This study aimed to compare the diagnostic properties of the Mini-Cog, the CDT alone, and the three-item recall test alone in mild NCD detection according to DSM-5 criteria. The participants were older patients attending the medicine outpatient clinic. Area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) analysis was used to compare the tools' accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients were enrolled, 42 of whom were diagnosed as having mild NCD. The AUCs of ROC curves of the three-item recall, CDT, Mini-Cog1, and Mini-Cog2 were 0.71, 0.67, 0.73, and 0.71, respectively (p = 0.36). The sensitivity of the tools was 85.7%, 66.7%, 57.4%, and 69% respectively. The tests performed similarly in participants with <=6 years of education (p = 0.27) and those with >6 years of education (p = 0.49). CONCLUSIONS: All tools exhibited similar acceptable performance in detecting mild NCD and were not affected by education. These convenient tools might be suitable for use in clinical practice.
