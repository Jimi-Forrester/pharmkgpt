33725267|t|Culture Variabilities of Human iPSC-Derived Cerebral Organoids Are a Major Issue for the Modelling of Phenotypes Observed in Alzheimer's Disease.
33725267|a|Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the most important susceptibility gene for late onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the presence of APOE-epsilon4 associated with increased risk of developing AD. Here, we reprogrammed human fibroblasts from individuals with different APOE-epsilon genotypes into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and generated isogenic lines with different APOE profiles. Following characterisation of the newly established iPSC lines, we used an unguided/unpatterning differentiation method to generate six-month-old cerebral organoids from all iPSC lines to assess the suitability of this in vitro system to measure APOE, beta amyloid, and Tau phosphorylation levels. We identified variabilities in the organoids' cell composition between cell lines, and between batches of differentiation for each cell line. We observed more homogenous cerebral organoids, and similar levels of APOE, beta amyloid, and Tau when using the CRISPR-edited APOE isogenic lines, with the exception of one site of Tau phosphorylation which was higher in the APOE-epsilon4/epsilon4 organoids. These data describe that pathological hallmarks of AD are observed in cerebral organoids, and that their variation is mainly independent of the APOE-epsilon status of the cells, but associated with the high variability of cerebral organoid differentiation. It demonstrates that the cell-line-to-cell-line and batch-to-batch variabilities need to be considered when using cerebral organoids.
