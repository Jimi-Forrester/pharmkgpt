23420486|a|We have previously shown that the antiprogestin and antiglucocorticoid mifepristone inhibits the growth of ovarian cancer cells. In this work, we hypothesized that cellular stress caused by mifepristone is limited to cytostasis and that cell killing is avoided as a consequence of the persistent activity of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway.To investigate the role of this pathway in mifepristone-induced growth inhibition, human ovarian cancer cells of various histological subtypes and genetic backgrounds were exposed to cytostatic doses of mifepristone in the presence or absence of the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. The activation of Akt in ovarian cancer cells, as marked by its phosphorylation on Ser473, was not modified by cytostatic concentrations of mifepristone, but it was blocked upon treatment with LY294002. The combination mifepristone/LY294002, but not the individual drugs, killed ovarian cancer cells via apoptosis, as attested by genomic DNA fragmentation and cleavage of caspase-3, and the concomitant down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and XIAP. From a pharmacological standpoint, when assessing cell growth inhibition using a median-dose analysis algorithm, the interaction between mifepristone and LY294002 was synergistic. The lethality caused by the combination mifepristone/LY294004 in two dimensional cell cultures was recapitulated in organized, tri-dimensional spheroids. This study demonstrates that mifepristone and LY294002, when used individually, cause cell growth arrest, yet when combined, they cause lethality.
