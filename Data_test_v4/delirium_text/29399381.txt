29399381|t|Anticancer Activity of Ganoderic Acid DM: Current Status and Future Perspective.
29399381|a|Ganoderma lucidum is a mushroom that has a long history of medicinal use in the Far East countries as this mushroom is revered for its supposed miracle cures and life improving properties. Recently, this mushroom has come under scientific scrutiny to examine the possibility of finding biologically active compounds that may have an impact on human physiology. The main category of biologically active compounds produced in the G. lucidum, are the triterpenoids, which are known as Ganoderic Acids. In this review, we discuss one Ganoderic Acid in particular known as Ganoderic Acid-DM (GA-DM) that is extracted from the Ganoderma lucidum mushroom. We will discuss GA-DM as a potential therapeutic candidate for treating a number of diseases yet will focus on the potential to be used as an alternative or supplemental therapeutic agent in regards to various cancer types. The urge for this promising therapeutic agent is that GA-DM is capable of inducing cell death in cancer cells while exhibiting minimal toxicity to normal bystander cells. Furthermore, this review will look at GA-DM's ability to stimulate an immune response in the tumor environment to potentially provide long-term protection from the malignant tumors. We will also discuss the known routes of administration of GA-DM and pose the advantages and disadvantages of each route in a comparative manner. Finally, we will cover current status of the roles GA-DM may have as a therapeutic agent in respect to different cancer types as wells as discuss about its future perspective as a therapeutic candidate in other diseases as well.
