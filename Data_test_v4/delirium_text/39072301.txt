39072301|t|Antibiotic-induced neuropsychiatric toxicity: epidemiology, mechanisms and management strategies - a narrative literature review.
39072301|a|Antibiotics are amongst the most prescribed medications globally in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Antibiotic-induced neuropsychiatric toxicity is relatively uncommon; yet, when it occurs, it can lead to severe morbidity ranging from dizziness and confusion to seizure and psychosis. However, the actual incidence rate of these adverse events may be higher due to underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis as they are commonly confused with clinical manifestations of different neuropsychiatric conditions. The incidence and mechanism of antibiotic-induced neuropsychiatric toxicity vary between different antibiotic classes and clinical presentation (i.e. neurotoxicity versus psychiatric toxicity). However, the exact mechanism by which antibiotics can cause neuropsychiatric toxicity remains unclear. This article reviews the epidemiology of antibiotic-induced neuropsychiatric toxicity, explores potential mechanisms of this adverse event, investigates variations in frequency and clinical presentations between different antibiotic classes causing neuropsychiatric toxicity, and discusses management strategies.
