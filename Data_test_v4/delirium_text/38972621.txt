38972621|t|PAHs as environmental pollutants and their neurotoxic effects.
38972621|a|Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are widely present in incompletely combusted air particulate matter <2.5 mum (PM2.5), tobacco and other organic materials, can enter the human body through various routes and are a class of environmental pollutants with neurotoxic effects. PAHs exposure can lead to abnormal development of the nervous system and neurobehavioral abnormalities in animals, including adverse effects on the nervous system of children and adults, such as a reduced learning ability, intellectual decline, and neural tube defects. After PAHs enter cells of the nervous system, they eventually lead to nervous system damage through mechanisms such as oxidative stress, DNA methylation and demethylation, and mitochondrial autophagy, potentially leading to a series of nervous system diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, preventing and treating neurological diseases caused by PAHs exposure are particularly important. From the perspective of the in vitro and in vivo effects of PAHs exposure, as well as its effects on human neurodevelopment, this paper reviews the toxic mechanisms of action of PAHs and the corresponding prevention and treatment methods to provide a relevant theoretical basis for preventing the neurotoxicity caused by PAHs, thereby reducing the incidence of diseases related to the nervous system and protecting human health.
