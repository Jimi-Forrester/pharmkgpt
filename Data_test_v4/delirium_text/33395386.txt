33395386|t|Characteristics of Residential Care Communities by Percentage of Resident Population Diagnosed With Dementia: United States, 2016.
33395386|a|Introduction-Increasingly, residential care communities (RCCs) are becoming a source of care for older adults with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Nationally in 2016, 41.9% of RCC residents were diagnosed with dementia. This report examines selected characteristics of RCCs and characteristics of their residents by the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Methods-Data in this report are from the RCC survey component of the 2016 wave of the biennial National Study of Long-Term Care Providers (NSLTCP), conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics. RCCs were grouped into three categories indicating prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in their communities: RCCs with less than 25% of their residents diagnosed with dementia, RCCs with 25%-75% of their residents diagnosed with dementia, and RCCs with more than 75% of their residents diagnosed with dementia. RCC characteristics included bed size, metropolitan statistical area location, provision of mental health services, and staff hours per resident day. Resident characteristics included selected conditions and need for assistance with activities of daily living. Results-Approximately one-quarter of RCCs (25.3%) had more than 75% of their residents diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. More RCCs with over 75% of their residents diagnosed with dementia were in metropolitan statistical areas (90.5%) compared with RCCs with 25%-75% (81.4%) and less than 25% of their residents diagnosed with dementia (76.4%). Aide and activities staff hours per resident day were higher in RCCs with more than 75% of their residents diagnosed with dementia compared with the other dementia prevalence categories. The prevalence of depression and the need for assistance with activities of daily living were higher in RCCs with more than 75% of the residents diagnosed with dementia compared with the other dementia prevalence categories.
