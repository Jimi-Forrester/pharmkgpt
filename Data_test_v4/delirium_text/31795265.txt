31795265|t|A Review of Bark-Extract-Mediated Green Synthesis of Metallic Nanoparticles and Their Applications.
31795265|a|Nanoparticles are intensely studied because of their importance in diverse fields of biotechnology, especially in medicine. This paper highlights that waste bark can be a cheap source of biocompounds, with high recovery and functionalization potential in nanoparticle synthesis. Due to their biocompatibility and activity as antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticancer agents, the green synthesis of metallic nanoparticles is of great importance. This review aims to bring together the diversity of synthesized metallic nanoparticles mediated by bark extracts obtained from different woody vascular plants, the phytoconstituents responsible for the reduction of metal salts, and the activity of metallic nanoparticles as diverse agents in combating the microbial, oxidant, and cancer activity. The literature data highlight the fact that metallic nanoparticles obtained from natural compounds are proven reducing agents with multiple activities. Thus, the activity of natural components in environmental protection and human health is confirmed.
