39868121|a|Human exposure to arsenicals is associated with devastating diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration. At the same time, arsenic-based drugs are used as therapeutic agents. The ability of arsenic to directly bind to proteins is correlated with its toxic and therapeutic effects highlighting the importance of elucidating arsenic-protein interactions. In this study, we took a proteomic approach and identified 174 proteins that bind to arsenic in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Proteins involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport were markedly enriched among the arsenic-binding proteins, and we demonstrate that arsenic-binding to nuclear import factors results in their relocation from the nuclear envelope and subsequent aggregation in the cytosol. Similarly, nuclear pore proteins that make up the nuclear pore complex mislocalized and aggregated in arsenic-exposed cells. Consequently, arsenic was shown to inhibit nuclear protein import and export. We propose a model in which arsenic-binding to nuclear transport factors leads to their mislocalization and aggregation, which disrupts nucleocytoplasmic transport and causes arsenic sensitivity.
