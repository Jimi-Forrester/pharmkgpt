30061798|a|INTRODUCTION: Falls and fear of falling are considered as the major factors affecting the elderly's disabilities, so that most of these individuals often find their homes as a safe environment. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between home safety and prevalence of falls and fear of falling among older adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 450 elderly people who lived in Bojnrud, Northeast of Iran, from December 2016 to July 2017 using cluster sampling method. A demographic characteristics questionnaire, Fall Efficiency Scale-International (FES-I)questionnaire, and Home Safety Checklist were employed as research instruments. RESULTS: Out of the study population, 157 individuals (35.7%) had a history of falls in the past one year. The mean score for fear of falling in the elderly people examined was 29.14+-11.07 and the same value for home safety status was equal to 11.31+-4.17. The mean score for fear of falling was significantly correlated with history of falls in older adults (p<0.0001). There was also a statistically significant relationship between home safety status and prevalence of falls and fear of falling in the elderly (p<0.0001). Besides, the results of logistic regression analysis showed that fear of falling could be estimated by 29-51%, taking the history of falls in the last 12 months and home safety mean score into account (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Home safety status and demographic variables could have effects on falls and fear of falling in elderly individuals. Therefore, putting these factors together, older adults at the risk of further falls can be identified and provided with trainings through planning and appropriate interventions to prevent the incidence of falls and their negative consequences among them.
