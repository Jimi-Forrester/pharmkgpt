26064053|t|A 6-year open-label study of the efficacy and safety of olanzapine long-acting injection in patients with schizophrenia: a post hoc analysis based on the European label recommendation.
26064053|a|PURPOSE: To assess the long-term efficacy and safety of olanzapine long-acting injection (LAI) in the treatment of schizophrenia, focusing on clinical trial data consistent with the approved indication and dosing recommendations in the European label and which forms the basis for treatment decisions made by clinicians in daily clinical practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of a 6-year open-label study of olanzapine LAI in patients (male or female, 18-75 years old) with schizophrenia entering this study following feeder studies of olanzapine LAI. Patients were flexibly dosed (45-405 mg, 2- to 4-week intervals), but those receiving oral olanzapine supplementation whose total olanzapine dose was >20 mg/day equivalent were excluded from this post hoc analysis. RESULTS: Data from 669 patients were analyzed (44.5% completed). Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total scores did not change significantly from baseline to endpoint; Clinical Global Impression-Severity scores improved significantly. Mean weight change was +2.19 kg (P<0.001), with 40.8% of patients experiencing >=7% weight gain. There were 24 occurrences of post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome (PDSS). CONCLUSION: Olanzapine LAI appeared to be effective in the long-term maintenance of schizophrenia, and the safety profile was consistent with that of oral olanzapine, except for injection-related events and PDSS events.
