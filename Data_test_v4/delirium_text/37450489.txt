37450489|a|INTRODUCTION: The development of biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has allowed researchers to increase sample homogeneity and test candidate treatments earlier in the disease. The integration of biomarker "screening" criteria should be met with a parallel implementation of standardized methods to disclose biomarker testing results to research participants; however, the extent to which protocolized disclosure occurs in trials is unknown. METHODS: We reviewed the literature to identify prodromal AD trials published in the past 10 years. From these, we quantified the frequency of biomarker disclosure reporting and the depth of descriptions provided. RESULTS: Of 30 published trials using positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid-based amyloid positivity as an eligibility criterion, only one mentioned disclosure, with no details on methods. DISCUSSION: Possible reasons for and implications of this information gap are discussed. Recommendations are provided for trialists considering biomarker screening as part of intervention trials focused on prodromal AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Few prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) trial papers discuss biomarker disclosure. Disclosure has implications for participants, family members, and trial success. Disclosure must be consistently integrated and reported in prodromal AD trials. Best practice guidelines and training resources for disclosure are needed.
