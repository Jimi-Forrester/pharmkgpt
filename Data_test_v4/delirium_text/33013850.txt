33013850|t|Pharmacological Inhibition of Amyloidogenic APP Processing and Knock-Down of APP in Primary Human Macrophages Impairs the Secretion of Cytokines.
33013850|a|It has been previously shown that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) support the innate immune defense as an immune receptor. Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides seem to have properties of an antimicrobial peptide and can act as opsonines. In APP-deficient mouse models, a reduced secretion of cytokines has been observed. Still, it is unclear whether this can be attributed to the lack of APP or to the missing secretion of Abeta peptides. We inhibited the secretion of Abeta peptides in primary human monocyte derived macrophages with the gamma-secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine-t-butyl-ester (DAPT) or the beta-secretase inhibitor GL-189. Alternatively, we knocked down APP by transfection with siRNA. We measured tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin (IL-10) by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and evaluated the phagocytotic activity by flow cytometry. We observed reduced concentrations of TNFalpha and IL-6 in the media of APPk/d macrophages and after inhibition of the beta-, or gamma-secretase, especially after additional immunological activation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Secretion of IL-10 was increased after pharmacological inhibition of APP processing when the macrophages were not immunologically activated but was decreased during LPS-induced inflammation in APPk/d macrophages. No changes of the phagocytotic activity were observed. We conclude that macrophage APP and Abeta peptides support the initiation of an immune response and are involved in the regulation of TNFalpha, IL-6, and IL-10 secretion by human monocyte-derived macrophages.
