34877521|t|Smartphone-integrated colorimetric sensor array-based reader system and fluorometric detection of dopamine in male and female geriatric plasma by bluish-green fluorescent carbon quantum dots.
34877521|a|A simple, cost-effective system was developed for dopamine (DA) detection using green synthesized 1-6 nm honey-based carbon quantum dots (H-CQDs) exhibiting bluish green fluorescence. The H-CQDs exhibited emission at 445 nm, with a quantum yield of ~44%. The H-CQDs were used as a probe for electron transfer based DA detection and changes in H-CQD color in the presence of DA. The H-CQDs were formed with polar functional groups and were highly soluble in aqueous media. In the fluorometric mode, the proposed system demonstrated high specificity toward DA and effective limit of detection (LOD) values of 6, 8.5, and 8 nM in deionized (DI) water, male geriatric plasma, and female geriatric plasma, respectively, in the linear range 100 nM-1000 muM. In the colorimetric mode, the color changed within 5 min, and the LOD was 163 muM. A colorimetric sensor array system was used to precisely detect DA with a smartphone-integrated platform using an in house built imaging application and an analyzer app. Additionally, no additives were required, and the H-CQDs were not functionalized. More importantly, the H-CQDs were morphologically and analytically characterized before and after DA detection. Because the sensor array-based system allows high specificity DA detection in both DI water and geriatric plasma, it will play an important role in biomedical applications.
