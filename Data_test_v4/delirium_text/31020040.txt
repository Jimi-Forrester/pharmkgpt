31020040|a|Although a few studies have investigated the intestinal microbiota of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the functional and metabolic mechanisms of the microbes associated with PCOS, as well as potential microbial biomarkers, have not yet been identified. To address this gap, we designed a two-phase experiment in which we performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing and monitored the metabolic parameters, gut-brain mediators, and sex hormones of PCOS patients. In the first stage, we identified an imbalance in the intestinal microbiota of the PCOS patients, observing that Faecalibacterium, Bifidobacterium, and Blautia were significantly more abundant in the control group, whereas Parabacteroides and Clostridium were enriched in the PCOS group. In the second stage, we monitored the impact of the probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis V9 on the intestinal microbiome, gut-brain mediators, and sex hormones of 14 PCOS patients. Notably, we observed that the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and LH/follicle-stimulating hormone (LH/FSH) decreased significantly in 9 volunteers, whereas the levels of sex hormones and intestinal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) increased markedly. In contrast, the changes in the indices mentioned above were indistinct in the remaining 5 volunteers. The results of an analysis of the number of viable Bifidobacterium lactis V9 cells in the two groups were highly consistent with the clinical and SCFA results. Therefore, effective host gut colonization of the probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis V9 was crucial for its ability to function as a probiotic. Finally, we propose a potential mechanism describing how probiotics regulate the levels of sex hormones by manipulating the intestinal microbiome in PCOS patients. IMPORTANCE Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common metabolic disorder among women of reproductive age worldwide. Through a two-phase clinical experiment, we first revealed an imbalance in the intestinal microbiome of PCOS patients. By binning and annotating shotgun metagenomic sequences into metagenomic species (MGS), 61 MGSs were identified as potential PCOS-related microbial biomarkers. In the second stage, we monitored the impact of the probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis V9 on the intestinal microbiota, metabolic parameters, gut-brain mediators, and sex hormones of PCOS patients. Notably, we observed that the PCOS-related clinical indices and the intestinal microbiotas of the participating patients exhibited an inconsistent response to the intake of the B. lactis V9 probiotic. Therefore, effective host gut colonization of the probiotic was crucial for its ability to function as a probiotic. Finally, we propose a potential mechanism by which B. lactis V9 regulates the levels of sex hormones by manipulating the intestinal microbiome in PCOS patients.
