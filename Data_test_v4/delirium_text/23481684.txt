23481684|a|N-terminally truncated pyroglutamate amyloid-beta (Abeta) starting at position 3 (AbetapE3) represents a major fraction of Abeta peptides in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, we have identified low molecular weight AbetapE3 oligomers, which can be detected by 9D5, a novel mouse monoclonal antibody. In the present study, we analyzed the immunohistochemical staining profile in the brain of patients with AD and in the APP/PS1KI mouse model, as well as in aged rhesus monkeys. 9D5-positive microglia and blood vessels were found in many AD cases, in the transgenic mouse model, and in an aged macaque. The presence of 9D5-immunoreactivity in microglia indicates that low molecular weight AbetapE3 oligomers may be phagocytosed, since in the APP/PS1KI model, Abeta is exclusively produced in neurons due to neuronal expression of transgenic AbetaPP.
