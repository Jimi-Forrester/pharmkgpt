35358285|a|BACKGROUND: Early rehabilitation allows patients to better perform the activities of daily living after hospital discharge. A specialized physical therapist has been assigned as part of the early rehabilitation, but the effectiveness of the program remains unclear. We investigated how early rehabilitation provided by a specialized physical therapist affects ADL in patients with sepsis. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. This study's subjects were sepsis patients who entered the advanced emergency critical care center of Shinshu University Hospital between April 2014 and March 2020. Electronic medical records were reviewed to obtain information on demographic characteristics, severity score, primary source of infection, therapeutic medication, the number of days after hospital admittance until rehabilitation begins, length of hospital stay, discharge to home, and an assessment of daily living activities for each patient. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether they were treated before or after a specialized physical therapist had been hired by the advanced emergency critical care center. RESULTS: Assigning a physical therapist to a patient significantly shortened the number of days until rehabilitation began. In a multivariable model, the strongest predictors of return to independent living after hospital discharge were (1) assigning a specialized physical therapist (odds ratio = 2.40; 95% confidence interval = 1.09-5.79; P = 0.050) and (2) the number of days until rehabilitation started (odds ratio = 0.24; 95% confidence interval = 0.08-0.76; P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Assigning a specialized physical therapist to sepsis patients at an advanced emergency critical care center significantly shortened the number of days until a patient can begin rehabilitation after hospital admittance and improved activities of daily living after hospital discharge.
