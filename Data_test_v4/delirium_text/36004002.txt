36004002|a|Objective: To compare the discriminant validity of three different single-question assessments of subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) for dementia in a community-based older adult population in Singapore. Methods: Eligible older adults aged >=60 were recruited into phase I for identifying those who require further assessment using the Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT) and progressive forgetfulness question (PFQ). Participants who failed either tests entered phase II and were administered various single-question assessments of SCC, such as the 8th question on the patient Ascertain Dementia 8 (AD8-8pt), informant AD8 (AD8-8info), and the 10th item on the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-10), followed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and a formal neuropsychological battery to identify the participant's cognitive status by a research diagnosis and DSM-IV criteria. Differences in characteristics among diagnostic groups were compared. All discriminatory indices (sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values, overall accuracy) for these single-question assessments and their combinations with the MoCA were calculated and reported to confirm their discriminant validity in identifying the existence of subjective complaints and objective impairment. Results: A total of 3,780 participants were assessed at phase I, of which 957 entered and completed phase II. Of whom, 911 were dementia-free and 46 had dementia. The MoCA (13/14) displayed good sensitivity (95.6%), specificity (81.5%), and overall accuracy (82.1%) for dementia detection. The GDS-10 and AD8-8pt showed poor discriminant validity, while the AD8-8info had the highest specificity (83.2%) and the greatest overall accuracy (82.5%) for dementia. Compensatory combination of the AD8-8info with MoCA, the sensitivity and positive predictive values were optimized (100%), while the conjunctive combination of two tools achieved excellent specificity (96.3%) and overall accuracy (94.8%) in discriminating dementia patients. Conclusion and implications: Combining a reliable single-question SCC assessment with an objective tool can efficiently discriminate dementia patients from healthy older adults in the community.
