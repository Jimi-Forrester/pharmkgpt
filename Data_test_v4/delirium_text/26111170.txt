26111170|t|Progress in Studies on Rutaecarpine. II.--Synthesis and Structure-Biological Activity Relationships.
26111170|a|Rutaecarpine is a pentacyclic indolopyridoquinazolinone alkaloid found in Evodia rutaecarpa and other related herbs. It has a variety of intriguing biological properties, which continue to attract the academic and industrial interest. Studies on rutaecarpine have included isolation from new natural sources, development of new synthetic methods for its total synthesis, the discovery of new biological activities, metabolism, toxicology, and establishment of analytical methods for determining rutaecarpine content. The present review focuses on the synthesis, biological activities, and structure-activity relationships of rutaecarpine derivatives, with respect to their antiplatelet, vasodilatory, cytotoxic, and anticholinesterase activities.
