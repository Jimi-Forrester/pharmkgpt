34088252|t|Group 1 Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors in Neurological and Psychiatric Diseases: Mechanisms and Prospective.
34088252|a|Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are G-protein coupled receptors that are activated by glutamate in the central nervous system (CNS). Basically, mGluRs contribute to fine-tuning of synaptic efficacy and control the accuracy and sharpness of neurotransmission. Among eight subtypes, mGluR1 and mGluR5 belong to group 1 (Gp1) family, and are implicated in multiple CNS disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, autism, Parkinson's disease, and so on. In the present review, we systematically discussed underlying mechanisms and prospective of Gp1 mGluRs in a group of neurological and psychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, Huntington's disease, intellectual disability, Down's syndrome, Rett syndrome, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, anxiety, nociception, schizophrenia, and depression, in order to provide more insights into the therapeutic potential of Gp1 mGluRs.
