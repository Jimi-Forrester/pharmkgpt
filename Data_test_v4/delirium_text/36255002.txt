36255002|a|The onset of retinal degenerative disease is often associated with neuronal loss. Therefore, how to regenerate new neurons to restore vision is an important issue. NeuroD1 is a neural transcription factor with the ability to reprogram brain astrocytes into neurons in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that in adult mice, NeuroD1 can reprogram Muller cells, the principal glial cell type in the retina, to become retinal neurons. Most strikingly, ectopic expression of NeuroD1 using two different viral vectors converted Muller cells into different cell types. Specifically, AAV7m8 GFAP681::GFP-ND1 converted Muller cells into inner retinal neurons, including amacrine cells and ganglion cells. In contrast, AAV9 GFAP104::ND1-GFP converted Muller cells into outer retinal neurons such as photoreceptors and horizontal cells, with higher conversion efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Muller cell conversion induced by AAV9 GFAP104::ND1-GFP displayed clear dose- and time-dependence. These results indicate that Muller cells in adult mice are highly plastic and can be reprogrammed into various subtypes of retinal neurons.
