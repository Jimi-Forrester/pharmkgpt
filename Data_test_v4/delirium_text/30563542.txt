30563542|t|Expression of microRNAs in cerebrospinal fluid of dogs with central nervous system disease.
30563542|a|In this pilot study we investigated the expression of 14 microRNAs in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of dogs with neoplastic, inflammatory and degenerative disorders affecting the central nervous system (CNS). CSF microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles were compared to those from dogs with neurological signs but no evidence of structural or inflammatory CNS disease. Seven miRNAs were easily detected in all samples: miR-10b-5p, miR-19b, miR-21-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-103a-3p, miR-124, and miR-128-3p. Expression of miR-10b-5p was significantly higher in the neoplastic group compared to other groups. There was no relation between miRNA expression and either CSF nucleated cell count or CSF protein content. Higher expression of miR-10b-5p in the neoplastic group is consistent with previous reports in human medicine where aberrant expression of miR-10b is associated with various neoplastic diseases of the CNS.
