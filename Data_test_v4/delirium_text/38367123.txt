38367123|t|Association of reduced cerebrospinal fluid NPTX2 levels with postoperative delirium in patients undergoing knee/hip replacement: a prospective cohort study.
38367123|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication with poor prognosis in the elderly, but its mechanism has not been fully elucidated. There is evidence that the changes in synaptic activity in the brain are closely related to the occurrence of POD. And neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2) can regulate synaptic activity in vivo. AIMS: This study aims to explore whether decreased NPTX2 levels affects POD and whether the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of POD mediate this association. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we interviewed patients with knee/hip replacement 1 day before surgery to collect patient information and assess their cognitive function. CSF was extracted for measuring the CSF levels of NPTX2 and other POD biomarkers on the day of surgery. And postoperative follow-up visits were performed 1-7 days after surgery. RESULTS: Finally, 560 patients were included in the study. The patients were divided into POD group and NPOD (non-POD) group. The POD group had a median age of 80 years, a female proportion of 45%, a median BMI of 24.1 kg/m2, and a median years of education of 9 years. The Mann-Whitney U test showed that CSF NPTX2 levels were significantly lower in POD group, compared with the NPOD group (P < 0.05). Univariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that reduced CSF levels of NPTX2 protected against POD (crude OR = 0.994, 95% CI 0.993-0.995, P < 0.001). The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve indicated that CSF NPTX2 level had high predictive value for POD. Mediation analyses showed that CSF T-tau (mediating proportion = 21%) and P-tau (mediating proportion = 29%) had significant mediating effects on the association between CSF NPTX2 and POD. CONCLUSION: CSF NPTX2 levels were associated with the occurrence of POD. Low CSF NPTX2 levels may be an independent protective factor for POD. CSF T-tau and P-tau could mediate the association between CSF NPTX2 and POD occurrence.
