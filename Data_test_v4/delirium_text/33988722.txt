33988722|t|[Alcohol as cultural asset-a historical, anthropological, and therapeutic perspective on alcohol consumption and its social role in western societies].
33988722|a|Alcohol is the dominant drug in Western societies with a history that spans from the Middle Ages through the colonial times to the present day. The historical variability of its consumption has always influenced the understanding of alcohol-related problems. To this day, public discourse about addiction and the structure of the care system have been shaped by outdated theories, which can contribute to the stigmatization and discrimination of the affected persons. In addition to an overview of the historical development of alcohol consumption, the sociocultural diversity in dealing with and assessing alcohol use in Western societies is examined and its relevance for clinical interventions is assessed. A national task force to reform the healthcare system is recommended in order to fully implement short interventions and other effective procedures in clinical practice.
