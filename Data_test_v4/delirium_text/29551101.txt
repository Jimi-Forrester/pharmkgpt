29551101|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of fish consumption with risk of dementia and its dose-response relationship, and investigate variations in the association among low-, middle- and high-income countries. DESIGN: A new community-based cross-sectional study and a systematic literature review.SettingsUrban and rural communities in China; population-based studies systematically searched from worldwide literature. SUBJECTS: Chinese adults aged >=60 years in six provinces (n 6981) took part in a household health survey of dementia prevalence and risk factors. In addition, 33 964 participants from eleven published and eligible studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. RESULTS: In the new study in China, 326 participants were diagnosed with dementia (4 7 %); those who consumed any amount of fish in the past two years v. those who consumed no fish had reduced risk of dementia (adjusted OR=0 73, 95 % CI 0 64, 0 99), but the dose-response relationship was not statistically significant. The meta-analysis of available data from the literature and the new study showed relative risk (RR) of dementia of 0 80 (95 % CI 0 74, 0 87) for people with fish consumption; the impact was similar among countries with different levels of income. Pooled dose-response data revealed RR (95 % CI) of 0 84 (0 72, 0 98), 0 78 (0 68, 0 90) and 0 77 (0 61, 0 98) in people with low, middle and high consumption of fish, respectively. Corresponding figures for Alzheimer's disease were 0 88 (0 74, 1 04), 0 79 (0 65, 0 96) and 0 67 (0 58, 0 78), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Greater consumption of fish is associated with a lower risk of dementia. Increasing fish consumption may help prevent dementia worldwide regardless of income level.
