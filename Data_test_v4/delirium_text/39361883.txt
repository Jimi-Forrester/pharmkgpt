39361883|t|Mobility Loss in Hospitalized Adults Predicts Poor Clinical Outcomes.
39361883|a|BACKGROUND: The Johns Hopkins Activity and Mobility Program is a systematic approach to measure and improve patient mobility. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between mobility loss and quality outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study design was used. Patients were categorized into 3 groups (gain, loss, no change in mobility) using the Johns Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility (JH-HLM) scores. The association between mobility loss and falls risk, in-hospital mortality, delirium, discharge to a facility, length of stay, and 30 day readmissions were assessed. RESULTS: Those who lost mobility were more at risk of being a high fall risk, in-hospital mortality, delirium, discharging to a facility, and had 48% longer lengths of stay. There was no association between mobility loss and 30-day readmissions. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of mobility assessed using JH-HLM scores is associated with worse patient outcomes.
