33667547|a|Human PrP (huPrP) is a high-affinity receptor for oligomeric amyloid beta (Abeta) protein aggregates. Binding of Abeta oligomers to membrane-anchored huPrP has been suggested to trigger neurotoxic cell signaling in Alzheimer's disease, while an N-terminal soluble fragment of huPrP can sequester Abeta oligomers and reduce their toxicity. Synthetic oligomeric Abeta species are known to be heterogeneous, dynamic, and transient, rendering their structural investigation particularly challenging. Here, using huPrP to preserve Abeta oligomers by coprecipitating them into large heteroassemblies, we investigated the conformations of Abeta(1-42) oligomers and huPrP in the complex by solid-state MAS NMR spectroscopy. The disordered N-terminal region of huPrP becomes immobilized in the complex and therefore visible in dipolar spectra without adopting chemical shifts characteristic of a regular secondary structure. Most of the well-defined C-terminal part of huPrP is part of the rigid complex, and solid-state NMR spectra suggest a loss in regular secondary structure in the two C-terminal alpha-helices. For Abeta(1-42) oligomers in complex with huPrP, secondary chemical shifts reveal substantial beta-strand content. Importantly, not all Abeta(1-42) molecules within the complex have identical conformations. Comparison with the chemical shifts of synthetic Abeta fibrils suggests that the Abeta oligomer preparation represents a heterogeneous mixture of beta-strand-rich assemblies, of which some have the potential to evolve and elongate into different fibril polymorphs, reflecting a general propensity of Abeta to adopt variable beta-strand-rich conformers. Taken together, our results reveal structural changes in huPrP upon binding to Abeta oligomers that suggest a role of the C terminus of huPrP in cell signaling. Trapping Abeta(1-42) oligomers by binding to huPrP has proved to be a useful tool for studying the structure of these highly heterogeneous beta-strand-rich assemblies.
