34802196|a|OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine critical care continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) utilization and downstream anti-seizure treatment patterns, their association with outcomes, and generate hypotheses for larger comparative effectiveness studies of cEEG-guided interventions. METHODS: Single-center retrospective study of critically ill patients (n = 14,523, age >=18 years). Exposure defined as >=24 h of cEEG and subsequent anti-seizure medication (ASM) escalation, with or without concomitant anesthetic. Exposure window was the first 7 days of admission. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Multivariable analysis was performed using penalized logistic regression. RESULTS: One thousand and seventy-three patients underwent >=24 h of cEEG within 7 days of admission. After adjusting for disease severity, >=24 h of cEEG followed by ASM escalation in patients not on anesthetics (n = 239) was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (OR 0.76 [0.53-1.07]), though the finding did not reach significance. ASM escalation with concomitant anesthetic use (n = 484) showed higher odds for mortality (OR 1.41 [1.03-1.94]). In the seizures/status epilepticus subgroup, post cEEG ASM escalation without anesthetics showed lower odds for mortality (OR 0.43 [0.23-0.74]). Within the same subgroup, ASM escalation with concomitant anesthetic use showed higher odds for mortality (OR 1.34 [0.92-1.91]) though not significant. INTERPRETATION: Based on our findings we propose the following hypotheses for larger comparative effectiveness studies investigating the direct causal effect of cEEG-guided treatment on outcomes: (1) cEEG-guided ASM escalation may improve outcomes in critically ill patients with seizures; (2) cEEG-guided treatment with combination of ASMs and anesthetics may not improve outcomes in all critically ill patients.
