15683967|a|Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the most neglected dementia by pharmacological research. Nevertheless, FTD can be now diagnosed with a good accuracy. Serotonin deficit is found in FTD and most of FTD are tauopathies. Pharmacological agents such as trazodone have showed a positive effect on behavioral symptoms, but the cognitive symptoms can not be significantly improved and parameters to follow a long-term trial in FTD remain to be identified. The recognition of the differences between FTD and Alzheimer's disease allows to determine a specific management of FTD patients and their caregivers.
