37821638|t|Shift in hospital opioid use during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil: a time-series analysis of one million prescriptions.
37821638|a|The pronounced change in the profile of hospitalized patients during COVID-19 and the severe respiratory component of this disease, with a great need for mechanical ventilation, led to changes in the consumption pattern of some medicines and supplies. This time-series study analyzed the in-hospital consumption of opioids during the COVID-19 pandemic in 24 Brazilian hospitals compared to the pre-pandemic period. Data included 711,883 adult patients who had opioids prescribed. In 2020, the mean consumption was significantly higher compared to 2019 for parenteral fentanyl, enteral methadone, and parenteral methadone. It was significantly lower for parenteral morphine parenteral sufentanil, and parenteral tramadol. For remifentanil, it did not differ. The number of patients in 2020 was lower but the mean consumption was higher for fentanyl, parenteral methadone, and remifentanil. It was lower for enteral methadone and parenteral sufentanil. The consumption of parenteral morphine and parenteral tramadol was stable. There was a relevant increase in hospital consumption of some potent opioids during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. These results reinforce the concern about epidemiological surveillance of opioid use after periods of increased hospital use since in-hospital consumption can be the gateway to the misuse or other than the prescribed use of opioids after discharge.
