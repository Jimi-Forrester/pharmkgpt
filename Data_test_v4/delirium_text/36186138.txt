36186138|t|The Potential Role of Cytokines in Diabetic Intervertebral Disc Degeneration.
36186138|a|Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a major cause of low back pain. Diabetes mellitus is a chronic inflammatory disease that may cause or aggravate IVDD; however, the mechanism by which diabetes induce IVDD is currently unclear. Compared to non-diabetic individuals, diabetic patients have higher levels of plasma cytokines, especially TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, and IL-18. Due to the crucial role of cytokines in the process of intervertebral disc degeneration, we hypothesized that elevation of these cytokines in plasma of diabetic patients may be involved in the process of diabetes-induced IVDD. In this review, changes in plasma cytokine levels in diabetic patients were summarized and the potential role of elevated cytokines in diabetes-induced IVDD was discussed. Results showed that some cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-1beta may accelerate the development of IVDD, while others such as IL-10 is supposed to prevent its development. Apoptosis, senescence, and extracellular matrix metabolism were found to be regulated by these cytokines in IVDD. Further studies are required to validate the cytokines targeted strategy for diabetic IVDD therapy.
