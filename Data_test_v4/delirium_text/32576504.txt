32576504|t|Emergence Delirium in Elderly Patients as a Potential Predictor of Subsequent Postoperative Delirium: A Descriptive Correlational Study.
32576504|a|PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the incidence of emergence delirium (ED) in elderly patients under general anesthesia and to determine the correlation between ED and delirium at five subsequent postoperative days. DESIGN: This research is a descriptive correlational study. METHODS: A total of 168 aged patients undergoing elective general anesthesia were recruited from a comprehensive tertiary teaching hospital with 2,400 beds in Southern China from April 2018 to September 2018. The Nursing Delirium Screening Scale was used to assess delirium at 30 and 60 minutes after extubation or on discharge from the postanesthesia care unit. Patients were assessed for delirium at postoperative days one through five using the same method. Patients' demographic information, including cognitive function, were collected. FINDINGS: Among the 168 aged patients, 58 suffered from ED (34.5%), including the 79.3% for the 46 patients who experienced postoperative delirium (POD). A positive correlation existed between ED and POD (chi2 = 111.744; P < .01). Logistic regression analysis included seven variables: age, preoperative Mini-Mental State Examination score, underlying diseases, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, surgery duration, postoperative complications, and the presence of ED. Age and ED were concluded to be independent predictive factors of POD. CONCLUSIONS: ED in the first hour after tracheal tube removal is a predictor of delirium at five subsequent postoperative days. Accurate and timely assessment of recovery period can effectively guide the treatment and rehabilitation of POD and maximize prevention of adverse consequences.
