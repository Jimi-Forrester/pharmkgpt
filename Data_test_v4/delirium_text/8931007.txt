8931007|a|The distribution of calbindin-D28k-immunoreactive cells and fibres in five human amygdalae was analysed from sections that had been stained immunohistochemically with a monoclonal antibody raised against calbindin-D28k. The highest density of calbindin-D28k-positive neurons were found in the anterior cortical, medial, posterior cortical and accessory basal nuclei, in the parvicellular division of the basal nucleus and in the amygdalohippocampal area. The lowest densities of immunopositive neurons were found in the paralaminar nucleus, in the periamygdaloid cortex (PAC1 and PACo) and in some of the intercalated nuclei. The deep nuclei (lateral, basal and accessory basal nuclei) contained a high density of calbindin-D28k-immunoreactive fibres and terminals. The cortical nuclei and the central nucleus were characterized by intense neuropil labelling. Morphologically, a large majority of the calbindin-D28k-immunoreactive neurons were aspiny or sparsely spiny and resembled inhibitory local circuit neurons. A small population of lightly-stained, pyramidal-shaped neurons was also observed. In most of the amygdaloid nuclei, calbindin-D28k-immunoreactive fibres travelled close to each other and formed bundles, which suggests that some of the immunostained neurons were double-bouquet cells. In the paralaminar nucleus, the calbindin-D28k-immunoreactive axons formed tortuous plexus (100-200 microns in diameter) that surrounded several unstained somata. This study provides baseline information on the morphology and distribution of calcium-binding protein-containing inhibitory cells and fibres immunoreactive for calbindin-D28k in the human amygdaloid complex. This information can be used in future studies on the pathogenesis of diseases known to damage the amygdala, such as Alzheimer's disease and temporal lobe epilepsy.
