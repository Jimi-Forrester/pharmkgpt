37196868|a|BMS906024, a gamma-secretase inhibitor that blocks Notch signaling, was previously shown to inhibit Cryptosporidium parvum growth in vitro. A structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis of BMS906024 reported herein demonstrates the importance of the stereochemistry of the C-3 benzodiazepine and the succinyl beta-substituent. However, concomitant removal of the succinyl alpha-substituent and switching the primary amide with secondary amides was tolerated. For example, 32 (SH287) inhibited C. parvum growth in HCT-8 host cells with an EC50 = 6.4 nM and an EC90 = 16 nM; however, blocking C. parvum growth with BMS906024 derivatives was correlative with inhibition of Notch signaling, highlighting that additional SAR analysis will be needed to separate these two activities.
