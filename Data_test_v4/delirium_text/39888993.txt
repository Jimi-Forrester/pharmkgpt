39888993|t|Monoaminergic neurotransmitters are bimodal effectors of tau aggregation.
39888993|a|Neurotransmitters (NTs) mediate trans-synaptic signaling, and disturbances in their levels are linked to aging and brain disorders. Here, we ascribe an additional function for NTs in mediating intracellular protein aggregation by interaction with cytosolic protein fibrils. Cell-based seeding experiments revealed monoaminergic NTs as inhibitors of tau. Seeding is a disease-relevant mechanism involving catalysis by fibrils, leading to the aggregation of proteins in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Chemotyping small molecules with varied backbone structures revealed determinants of aggregation inhibitors and catalysts. Among those identified were monoaminergic NTs. Dose titrations revealed bimodal effects indicative of fibril disaggregation, with aggregation catalysis occurring at low ratios of NTs and inhibited seeding ensuing at higher concentrations. Bimodal effects by NTs extend from in vitro systems to dopaminergic neurons, suggesting that pharmacotherapies that modify intracellular NT levels could shape the neuronal protein aggregation environment.
