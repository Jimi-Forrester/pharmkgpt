37470979|t|Increased Metabolic Potential, Efficacy, and Safety of Emerging Treatments in Schizophrenia.
37470979|a|Patients with schizophrenia experience a broad range of detrimental health outcomes resulting from illness severity, heterogeneity of disease, lifestyle behaviors, and adverse effects of antipsychotics. Because of these various factors, patients with schizophrenia have a much higher risk of cardiometabolic abnormalities than people without psychiatric illness. Although exposure to many antipsychotics increases cardiometabolic risk factors, mortality is higher in patients who are not treated versus those who are treated with antipsychotics. This indicates both direct and indirect benefits of adequately treated illness, as well as the need for beneficial medications that result in fewer cardiometabolic risk factors and comorbidities. The aim of the current narrative review was to outline the association between cardiometabolic dysfunction and schizophrenia, as well as discuss the confluence of factors that increase cardiometabolic risk in this patient population. An increased understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia has guided discovery of novel treatments that do not directly target dopamine and that not only do not add, but may potentially minimize relevant cardiometabolic burden for these patients. Key discoveries that have advanced the understanding of the neural circuitry and pathophysiology of schizophrenia now provide possible pathways toward the development of new and effective treatments that may mitigate the risk of metabolic dysfunction in these patients. Novel targets and preclinical and clinical data on emerging treatments, such as glycine transport inhibitors, nicotinic and muscarinic receptor agonists, and trace amine-associated receptor-1 agonists, offer promise toward relevant therapeutic advancements. Numerous areas of investigation currently exist with the potential to considerably progress our knowledge and treatment of schizophrenia.
