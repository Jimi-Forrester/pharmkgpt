35439097|t|The Relationship Between Sleep Disturbance and Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 in Adults With Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease Dementia: An Integrative Review.
35439097|a|BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE epsilon4) was shown to be a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. When coupled with sleep disturbance, APOE epsilon4 posed additional risks to cognitive impairment. But the literature on the association between sleep disturbance and the APOE epsilon4 status of persons who are cognitively impaired has not yet been systematically examined. OBJECTIVES: To explore and synthesize the relationship between sleep disturbance and APOE epsilon4 status of adults with MCI and AD. METHODS: An integrative review was guided by Whittemore and Knafl's methodology. Systematic searches identified studies with multiple sources published before May 20, 2021. A matrix and narrative synthesis was employed to organize and synthesize the findings. Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal tools (2020) were used to evaluate the quality of the selected studies. RESULTS: A total of 7 studies were included. APOE epsilon4 was associated with poor sleep quality in terms of the deterioration of nighttime total sleep time, 24-hour total sleep time, rapid eye movement, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and wake after sleep onset in a population with MCI or AD. The interacted and adjusted relationship between sleep disturbance and APOE epsilon4 on the progression of cognitive decline was inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence to support an association between sleep disturbance and APOE epsilon4 in individuals with cognitive impairment, but a further examination of the relationship between sleep parameters and APOE epsilon4 is warranted, especially as the causal or dose-response relationship remains unclear.
