39491374|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a common neurodegenerative disease showed progressive cognitive dysfunction and behavioral impairment. Currently, the deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) remains the main pathomechanism. However, preventing neuronal death induced by Abeta remains elusive, and no effective strategy in clinic was found to combat AD. Herein, a multifunctional double selenium nanosphere (CLNDSe) was designed and prepared, and A2AAR agonist (CGS) modification endowed CLNDSe NPs with A2AAR-targeted blood brain barrier (BBB) delivery in vitro and in vivo. CLNDSe NPs after modification of LPFFD short peptide effectively inhibited Abeta42 aggregation and attenuated Abeta42-induced neural toxicity by inhibiting oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunctions. Nerve growth factor (NGF) linked to large Se sphere significantly attenuated Tau phosphorylation and gliocytes activation in APP/PS1 mice. CLNDSe NPs administration in vivo also effectively restored GPX1/4 antioxidant ability, alleviated neural loss and neurofibrillary tangles, prevented neural ferroptosis, and eventually ameliorated cognitive deficits of APP/PS1 mice. Importantly, CLNDSe NPs showed good safety and biocompatibility. Taken together, our finding validated the rational design that BBB-targeted delivery of double selenium nanosphere may be a novel strategy to ameliorate Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting neural ferroptosis.
