39407889|t|Physical Activity and Cognitive Impairment in a Group of Adults with Down Syndrome from North-Eastern Romania.
39407889|a|Background: Down syndrome (DS) is the most prevalent chromosomal condition, with the average life expectancy significantly rising from 25 years in 1983 to 60 years in 2020. People with DS generally can participate in most physical activities that individuals without the disability can, despite some physical limitations. However, the varying degrees of cognitive deficits can present challenges when it comes to performing physical activities. Methods: We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional study in the Cardiovascular Rehabilitation Clinic from the Clinical Rehabilitation Hospital from Iasi, Romania, between July 2022 and February 2024 that included 28 patients diagnosed with DS. We collected data regarding age and comorbidities and performed several tests (MMSE, timed-up-and-go test, and handgrip strength). Results: The group consisted of 11 (39%) females and 17 (61%) males with a mean age of 28.07 +- 9.51 years. The weight profile of the study group differed according to the degree of physical activity: 62.50% of those with moderate physical activity were moderately overweight, while 75% of those with minimal activity were overweight or obese. The muscle strength and MMSE score was higher in the group of patients who performed moderate physical activity. Regarding comorbidities, there was a statistically significant difference in the percentage of patients with hearing loss among those with minimal physical activity. Conclusions: Our results provide an update on the very limited data available. The study indicates that people with DS are generally less physically active and face unique health challenges (hearing loss, intellectual disabilities, and osteoarticular pathologies).
