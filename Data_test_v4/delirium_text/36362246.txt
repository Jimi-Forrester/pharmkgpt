36362246|t|The IL-33/ST2 Pathway in Cerebral Malaria.
36362246|a|Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is an immunomodulatory cytokine which plays critical roles in tissue function and immune-mediated diseases. IL-33 is abundant within the brain and spinal cord tissues where it acts as a key cytokine to coordinate the exchange between the immune and central nervous system (CNS). In this review, we report the recent advances to our knowledge regarding the role of IL-33 and of its receptor ST2 in cerebral malaria, and in particular, we highlight the pivotal role that IL-33/ST2 signaling pathway could play in brain and cerebrospinal barriers permeability. IL-33 serum levels are significantly higher in children with severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria than children without complications or noninfected children. IL-33 levels are correlated with parasite load and strongly decrease with parasite clearance. We postulate that sequestration of infected erythrocytes or merozoites liberation from schizonts could amplify IL-33 production in endothelial cells, contributing either to malaria pathogenesis or recovery.
