22173754|t|Functional and structural MR imaging in neuropsychiatric disorders, Part 1: imaging techniques and their application in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease.
22173754|a|During the past decade, the application of advanced MR imaging techniques in neuropsychiatric disorders has seen a rapid increase. Disease-specific alterations in brain function can be assessed by fMRI. Structural GM and WM properties are increasingly investigated by DTI and voxel-based approaches like VBM. These methods provide neurobiologic correlates for brain architecture and function, evaluation tools for therapeutic approaches, and potential early markers for diagnosis. The aim of this review was to provide insight into the principles of functional and structural imaging and to delineate major findings in MCI, AD (Part 1), autism, and schizophrenia (Part 2), which are common psychiatric disorders covering different stages of the life span. Part 2 will conclude by summarizing current applications, limitations, and future prospects in the field of MR imaging-based neuroimaging.
