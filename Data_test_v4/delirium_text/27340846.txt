27340846|t|Adults at Increased Alzheimer's Disease Risk Display Cognitive-Motor Integration Impairment Associated with Changes in Resting-State Functional Connectivity: A Preliminary Study.
27340846|a|BACKGROUND: Many neuroimaging parameters have demonstrated utility as biomarkers in preclinical AD, including resting-state functional connectivity in the default mode network. However, neuroimaging is not a practical, cost effective screening instrument. OBJECTIVE: Here we investigate the relationship between performance on a cognitive-motor integration assessment and alterations in resting-state functional connectivity in an at-risk population. METHODS: Three groups of ten adults (young: mean age = 26.6 +- 2.7, low AD risk: mean age = 58.7 +- 5.6, and high AD risk: mean age = 58.5 +- 6.9) performed a simple cognitive-motor integration task using a dual-touchscreen laptop and also underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging at rest. RESULTS: We found poorer cognitive-motor integration performance in high AD risk participants, as well as an association with lower resting-state functional connectivity in this group. CONCLUSION: These findings provide novel insight into underlying AD-related brain alterations associated with a behavioral assessment that can be easily administered clinically.
