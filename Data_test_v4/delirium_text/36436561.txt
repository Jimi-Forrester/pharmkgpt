36436561|a|The Apolipoprotein E-epsilon4 allele (APOE-epsilon4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer disease (AD). ApoE plays a critical role in amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation in AD, and genetic deletion of the murine ApoE gene in mouse models results in a decrease or inhibition of Abeta deposition. The association between the presence of ApoE and amyloid in amyloidoses suggests a more general role for ApoE in the fibrillogenesis process. However, whether decreasing levels of ApoE would attenuate amyloid pathology in different amyloidoses has not been directly addressed. Familial Danish dementia (FDD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of widespread parenchymal and vascular Danish amyloid (ADan) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles. A transgenic mouse model for FDD (Tg-FDD) is characterized by parenchymal and vascular ADan deposition. To determine the effect of decreasing ApoE levels on ADan accumulation in vivo, we generated a mouse model by crossing Tg-FDD mice with ApoE KO mice (Tg-FDD+/-/ApoE-/-). Lack of ApoE results in inhibition of ADan deposition up to 18 months of age. Additionally, our results from a genetic screen of Tg-FDD+/-/ApoE-/- mice emphasize the significant role for ApoE in neurodegeneration in FDD via glial-mediated mechanisms. Taken together, our findings suggest that the interaction between ApoE and ADan plays a key role in FDD pathogenesis, in addition to the known role for ApoE in amyloid plaque formation in AD.
