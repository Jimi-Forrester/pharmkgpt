33097022|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) characterized by the airway and lung inflammation, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially among smokers over 40 years of age and individuals exposed to biomass smoke. Although the detailed mechanisms of this disease remain elusive, there is feasible evidence that protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) may play a role in its pathoetiology. We thus conducted studies to dissect the effect of cigarette smoke extracts (CSE) on the change of SUMOylated substrates in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEs). METHODS: Samples were collected in HBEs with or without 24 h of CSE insult and then subjected to Western-blot and LC-MS/MS analysis. Subsequently, bioinformatic tools were used to analyze the data. The effect of SUMOylation on cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) was evaluated by flow cytometry. RESULTS: It was noted that CSE stimulated HBEs to undergo a SUMOylation turnover as evidenced by the changes of SUMOylated substrates and SUMOylation levels for a particular substrate. The SUMOylated proteins are relevant to the regulation of biological processes, molecular function and cellular components. Particularly, CSE stimulated a significant increase of SUMOylated CYP1A1, a critical enzyme involved in the induction of oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide a protein SUMOylation profile for better understanding of the mechanisms underlying COPD and support that smoking induces oxidative stress in HBEs, which may predispose to the development of COPD in clinical settings.
