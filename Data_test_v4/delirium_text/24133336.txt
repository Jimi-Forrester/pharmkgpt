24133336|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to assess the impact of neurological consultation and intervention upon patient outcome in intensive care unit (ICU). SETTINGS: A retrospective observational study was conducted in the 24-bedded multispecialty ICU of a 350 bedded tertiary care hospital over 8 months period, from January 2011 to August 2011. Critically, ill-patients with varied neurological symptomatology affecting the course of illness and ICU discharge were included. Neurological consult sought for, investigations ordered by the neurologist, interventions carried out, treatment started and the impact of such treatment on the outcome of patients were noted. The length of ICU stay was also noted. RESULTS: Over a period of 8 months, there were 864 ICU admissions. On neurological consult, 23 patients had a positive finding affecting the outcome: 5 patients were diagnosed to have parkinson's disease, 4 patients had neuromuscular disease, 9 patients had high creatinine phosphokinase levels, 2 patients had restless legs syndrome and 3 patients were diagnosed to have seizure disorder. CONCLUSIONS: On being examined and investigated by neurologist, a variety of co-existing neurological disorders could be diagnosed and if managed early, patients had a faster recovery, rapid weaning and early discharge from the ICU.
