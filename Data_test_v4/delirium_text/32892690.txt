32892690|t|RAGE signalling in obesity and diabetes: focus on the adipose tissue macrophage.
32892690|a|The advanced glycosylation end product receptor (RAGE) acts as a recognition receptor and interacts with different types of ligands that form and accumulate in the tissues and circulation, such as diabetes, inflammation, insulin resistance, and obesity. In these environments, RAGE is expressed on the surface of various cells associated with tissue disturbance. This review mainly summarizes the characteristics of RAGE-related signalling, with a particular emphasis on the role of RAGE in the development of obesity. We also briefly describe the phenotypes and characteristics of macrophages and focus on the role of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) and the regulatory mechanisms in obesity, diabetes, and other related metabolic diseases. Besides, we will also elaborate on the prospect of new strategies for treating diabetes and obesity-related metabolic diseases by inhibiting RAGE signalling and regulating ATMs recruitment and polarization.
