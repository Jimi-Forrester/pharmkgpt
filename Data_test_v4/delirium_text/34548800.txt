34548800|t|Association of Metabolic Syndrome with Aerobic Exercise and LPL rs3779788 Polymorphism in Taiwan Biobank Individuals.
34548800|a|PURPOSE: The Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene is a significant contributor to dyslipidemia. It has shown associations with several conditions including atherosclerosis, obesity, and metabolic syndrome (MetS). We assessed the interactive association between MetS and rs3779788 of the LPL gene based on aerobic exercise. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were available for 7532 Taiwan Biobank (TWB) participants recruited between 2008 and 2016. We used multiple logistic regression to determine the odds ratios (OR) for MetS and their 95% confident intervals (C.I.). Potential variables included LPL rs3779788, aerobic exercise, sex, age, education, marital status, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption, midnight snacking, vegetarian diet, coffee, dietary fat, and tea drinking. RESULTS: Aerobic exercise was protective against MetS (OR, 0.858; 95% C.I., 0.743-0.991). Compared to CC/CT genotype, the OR for developing MetS was 0.875, (95% C.I., 0.571-1.341) in TT individuals. The test for interaction was significant for the rs3779788 variant and aerobic exercise (p = 0.0484). In our group analyses, the OR for MetS was 0.841 (95% C.I., 0.727-0.974) in CC/CT and 4.076 (95% C.I., 1.158-14.346) in TT individuals who did aerobic exercise compared to those who did not. CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that aerobic exercise improved metabolic syndrome in Taiwanese adults with rs3779788 CC/CT genotype relative to those with TT genotype.
