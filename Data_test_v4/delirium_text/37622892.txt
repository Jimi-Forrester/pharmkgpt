37622892|t|From Enzymatic Dopamine Biosensors to OECT Biosensors of Dopamine.
37622892|a|Neurotransmitters are an important category of substances used inside the nervous system, whose detection with biosensors has been seriously addressed in the last decades. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter from the catecholamine family, was recently discovered to have implications for cardiac arrest or muscle contractions. In addition to having many other neuro-psychiatric implications, dopamine can be detected in blood, urine, and sweat. This review highlights the importance of biosensors as influential tools for dopamine recognition. The first part of this article is related to an introduction to biosensors for neurotransmitters, with a focus on dopamine. The regular methods in their detection are expensive and require high expertise personnel. A major direction of evolution of these biosensors has expanded with the integration of active biological materials suitable for molecular recognition near electronic devices. Secondly, for dopamine in particular, the miniaturized biosensors offer excellent sensitivity and specificity and offer cheaper detection than conventional spectrometry, while their linear detection ranges from the last years fall exactly on the clinical intervals. Thirdly, the applications of novel nanomaterials and biomaterials to these biosensors are discussed. Older generations, metabolism-based or enzymatic biosensors, could not detect concentrations below the micro-molar range. But new generations of biosensors combine aptamer receptors and organic electrochemical transistors, OECTs, as transducers. They have pushed the detection limit to the pico-molar and even femto-molar ranges, which fully correspond to the usual ranges of clinical detection of human dopamine in body humors that cover 0.1 / 10 nM. In addition, if ten years ago the use of natural dopamine receptors on cell membranes seemed impossible for biosensors, the actual technology allows co-integrate transistors and vesicles with natural receptors of dopamine, like G protein-coupled receptors. The technology is still complicated, but the uni-molecular detection selectivity is promising.
