677611|t|[Semantics of psychopathological expressions. 2. Productive interpretation and narrative semantics in delirious expressions].
677611|a|The second part of "The semantics of psychopathological statements" concerns delirious utterances. The relations between the utterance act and the statements implicity constitute the delirium in the operational texture of the psychopathological process. Only the productive interpretation can relate the links between the diegetic elements of the utterance to the ensuing reading effects the words of which diachronically constitute a delusion. The meaning effects of the clinical statements, i.e. the symptoms and their narration have recurring repercussions on the semantics of the delirium process.
