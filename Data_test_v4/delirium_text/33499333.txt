33499333|a|Non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs) are nowadays the principal cause of death, especially in most industrialized nations. These illnesses have increased exponentially with the consumption of diets very high in fat and sugar, not to mention stress and physical inactivity among other factors. The potential impact of suboptimal diets on NCDs' morbidity and mortality rates brings to the forefront the necessity for a new way of improving dietary habits. The literature provides extensive scientific work that presents evidence that phenolic compounds from diets have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative activities that impact human health. Gut microbiota modulation by some phenolic compounds leads to favorable changes in abundance, diversity, and in the immune system. However, polyphenol's limited bioavailability needs to be overcome, highlighting their application in new delivery systems and providing their health benefits in well-established ways such as health maintenance, treatment or adjuvant to conventional pharmacological treatments. In this context, novel dietary approaches, including new food supplements, have emerged to prevent diseases and preserve health.
