10767583|a|Previous research has shown that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may affect REM sleep, however, results are inconclusive. From the present findings it is concluded that the effects of rivastigmine, a reversible acetycholinesterase inhibitor, on REM sleep are more pronounced in the elderly where we found REM latency to be significantly reduced. This may be explained by better bioavailability and/or by reduced stability of the circadian rhythmicity in elderly individuals. Because rivastigmine is used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, further research investigating the relationship between the REM enhancing properties of rivastigmine and cognitive functioning seems promising.
