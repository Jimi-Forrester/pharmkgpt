33479350|t|Leakage of astrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles in stress-induced exhaustion disorder: a cross-sectional study.
33479350|a|Patients with stress-induced exhaustion disorder (SED) demonstrate cognitive dysfunction similar to patients with minor traumatic brain injury (TBI). We have previously detected elevated concentrations of astrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in patients with TBI. As such, we hypothesized that astrocyte-derived EVs could be higher in patients with SED than in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls. Patients with SED (n = 31), MDD (n = 31), and healthy matched controls (n = 61) were included. Astrocyte-derived EVs (previously known as microparticles) were measured in plasma with flow cytometry and labeled against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and aquaporin 4 (AQP4). In addition, platelet EVs and their CD40 ligand expression were measured. Patients with SED had significantly higher concentrations of AQP4 and GFAP-positive EVs and EVs co-expressing AQP4/GFAP than patients with MDD and healthy controls. Patients with MDD had significantly higher concentrations of GFAP-positive EVs and EVs co-expressing AQP4/GFAP than healthy controls. Platelet EVs did not differ between groups. CD40 ligand expression was significantly higher in patients with SED and MDD than in controls. In conclusion, the present study suggests that patients with SED, and to some extent, patients with MDD, have increased leakage of astrocyte-derived EVs through the blood-brain barrier.
