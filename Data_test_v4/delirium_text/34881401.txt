34881401|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate if there is epidemiological evidence of an association between edentulism and cognitive decline beside that currently available from limited sample-sized case series and cross-sectional studies considering limited co-variables. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from two USA national health surveys [NHIS 2014-2017 and NHANES 2005-2018] were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression to study the impact of type of edentulism and number of remaining teeth on memory and concentration problems. Age, gender, socioeconomic status, education level, cardiovascular health index, body mass index, exercise, alcohol, smoking habits, and anxiety and depression were used as covariates. RESULTS: The combined population sample was 102,291 individuals. Age, socioeconomic status, educational level, anxiety and depression levels, and edentulism showed the highest odds ratios for cognitive decline. Number of teeth present in the mouth was found to be a predictor of cognitive status. This association showed a gradient effect, so that the lower the number of teeth, the greater the risk of exhibiting cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: Edentulism was found among the higher ORs for cognitive impairment. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Maintenance of functional teeth through the promotion of oral health may contribute to the preservation of memory/concentration and other essential cognitive functions. Thus, increasing and efficiently coordinating efforts aimed at preventing of tooth loss in the adult population could substantially contribute to reduce the incidence of cognitive impairment.
