29302797|a|The number of older patients undergoing surgery is increasing due to changing demographics, surgical and anaesthetic advances and shifts in patient expectations of healthcare. The benefits of surgery in older people are well documented and include symptom control and increased life expectancy. However, older surgical patients present not only with the index pathology requiring surgery but with concurrent age related physiological decline, multimorbidity and geriatric syndromes. These additional issues increase the risk of adverse postoperative outcome, in particular of postoperative medical and functional complications. In recent years, there has been recognition of the need for collaborative surgical and geriatric medicine working to address the health care needs of the increasingly complex older surgical population. Guidelines have been published to support clinicians looking after older surgical patients, however, there has been little published on the establishment of such services. In this paper, we describe the evolution of the proactive care of older patients undergoing surgery (POPS) service and how through the use of comprehensive geriatric assessment methodology and intervention throughout the surgical pathway, outcomes for complex older surgical patients can be improved.
