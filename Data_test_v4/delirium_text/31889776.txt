31889776|a|The main objective of this study is to establish the best preparation technology of the particles of Acanthopanax senticosus. First, take the reflux extraction method extract of Acanthopanax senticosus coarse powder, optimized by orthogonal experimental method, to flavonoids flavonoids extraction extraction rate as the indexes to determine the effects of extraction temperature, ethanol concentration, extraction time on flavonoids content. Then by a wet granulation of thorn slender acanthopanax particles, taste with granules, forming rate, melting rate as index to investigate the influences of materials adding amount of granules effect. The results showed that the ethanol water heating reflux extraction method to extract the temperature of 70 deg, the percentage of ethanol 75%, extraction time 2.5 h, the highest content of total flavonoids in the extract. Join the 5 ml and 10 g in the extract of acacia honey, dextrin, starch, sugar ratio for 3:4:8, the best taste of Acanthopanax granules. In the end, the best preparation technology of the granules is established, and the process is simple, which is suitable for the large-scale production of the factory.
