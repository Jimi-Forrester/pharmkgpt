35325467|a|BACKGROUND: Emergence delirium (ED) and postoperative delirium (POD) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality and occur in up to one-third of patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery, where the underlying pathogenesis is multifactorial, including increased inflammation. We aimed to assess the effect of pre-operative high- versus low-dose glucocorticoid on the occurrence of ED and POD. METHODS: This was a substudy from a randomized, double-blinded clinical trial. Patients >=18 years, undergoing open liver resection were randomized 1:1 to high-dose (HD, 10 mg/kg methylprednisolone) or low-dose (LD, 8 mg dexamethasone) glucocorticoid and assessed for ED and POD for a maximum of 4 days during hospitalization. The 3-min Diagnostic Interview for CAM-defined delirium (3D-CAM) was used for assessment, 15 and 90 min after arrival in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), and subsequently once daily in the ward. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were included in this secondary substudy (26 HD-group and 27 LD-group). ED occurred in n = 5 HD versus n = 6 LD patients 15 min after PACU arrival. At 90 min after PACU arrival, 4 patients had ED, all from LD-group, and resulted in significantly longer PACU admission, 273 versus 178 min in ED versus Non-ED patients. During the first 4 days in the ward, n = 5 patients had at least one occurrence of POD, all from LD-group. CONCLUSIONS: The primary finding of the current substudy was a lower occurrence of ED/POD in the PACU 90 min after arrival and during the first four postoperative days in patients receiving high-dose glucocorticoid compared with patients receiving low-dose glucocorticoid. The two study groups were not evenly balanced concerning known explanatory factors, i.e., age and size of surgery, which calls for larger studies to elucidate the matter.
