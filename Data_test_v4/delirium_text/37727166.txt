37727166|t|A Comprehensive Literature Review on Managing Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Addressing Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Females and Its Autoimmune Disease Associations.
37727166|a|This review aimed to evaluate the mechanism of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, particularly in the female population, and emphasize the need for early management interventions; explore the association between SLE and two autoimmune diseases, myasthenia gravis (MG) and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS), and their management strategies; and evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions in managing SLE, focusing on premenopausal females, females of childbearing age, and pregnant patients. We conducted a comprehensive literature review to achieve these objectives using various databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane. The collected data were analyzed and synthesized to provide an evidence-based overview of SLE, its management strategies as an independent disease, and some disease associations. The treatment should be focused on remission, preventing organ damage, and improving the overall quality of life (QOL). Extensive emphasis should also be focused on diagnosing SLE and concurrent underlying secondary diseases timely and managing them appropriately.
