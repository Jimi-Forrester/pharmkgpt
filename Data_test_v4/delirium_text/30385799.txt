30385799|t|The synthesis, crystal, hydrogen sulfide detection and cell assement of novel chemsensors based on coumarin derivatives.
30385799|a|A series of chemsensors (1-4) containing fluorobenzene group based on coumarin derivatives have been developed for the selective and sensitive detection of H2S. The advantages of the synthesized fluorescent probe (compound 1) were the low detection limit (4 x 10-6 mol L-1), good selectivity and high sensitivity which had been demonstrated through UV-vis, fluorescent titration experiments. Besides cytotoxicity test of compounds (1 and 2) was studied and the results indicated that compounds (1 and 2) showed almost no cytotoxicityat at a concentration of 150 mug mL-1. The interacted mechanism was the thiolysis reaction of dinitrophenyl ether which had been confirmed by fluorescence and HRMS titration experiment. In addition, probe 1 can also detect HS- selectively by naked eye in pure DMSO solvent.
