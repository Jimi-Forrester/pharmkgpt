36911206|t|Comparison of cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, blood flow, and bispectral index under general anesthesia.
36911206|a|Significance: The optical measurement of cerebral oxygen metabolism was evaluated. Aim: Compare optically derived cerebral signals to the electroencephalographic bispectral index (BIS) sensors to monitor propofol-induced anesthesia during surgery. Approach: Relative cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (  rCMRO 2   ) and blood flow (rCBF) were measured by time-resolved and diffuse correlation spectroscopies. Changes were tested against the relative BIS (rBIS) ones. The synchronism in the changes was also assessed by the R-Pearson correlation. Results: In 23 measurements, optically derived signals showed significant changes in agreement with rBIS: during propofol induction, rBIS decreased by 67% [interquartile ranges (IQR) 62% to 71%],  rCMRO 2   by 33% (IQR 18% to 46%), and rCBF by 28% (IQR 10% to 37%). During recovery, a significant increase was observed for rBIS (48%, IQR 38% to 55%),  rCMRO 2   (29%, IQR 17% to 39%), and rCBF (30%, IQR 10% to 44%). The significance and direction of the changes subject-by-subject were tested: the coupling between the rBIS,  rCMRO 2   , and rCBF was witnessed in the majority of the cases (14/18 and 12/18 for rCBF and 19/21 and 13/18 for  rCMRO 2   in the initial and final part, respectively). These changes were also correlated in time ( R > 0.69  to R = 1  , p - values < 0.05  ). Conclusions: Optics can reliably monitor  rCMRO 2   in such conditions.
