16179507|t|Delineating and understanding cerebellar neuroprotective pathways: potential implication for protecting the cortex.
16179507|a|The cerebellum is a brain region that is resistant to many of the neurodegenerative disorders such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, the neocortex (cerebrum, cerebral cortex) is vulnerable to these disorders. While there may be many reasons for the differences in vulnerability to acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders, the cerebellum appears to be equipped with the tools necessary to protect itself against these types of insults. Over the last century, evidence has accumulated to suggest that the cerebellum is also involved in memory and higher cognitive function. We have discovered that intrinsic survival pathways exist in cerebellar granule cells that are regulated by low level stimulation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Activation of NMDA receptors protects vulnerable neurons against glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity acting on NMDA receptors. This report focuses on how modulation of neuronal survival by NMDA receptors through a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-mediated pathway may be incorporated into a network of cerebellar function, particularly in light of recent findings suggesting that the cerebellum plays a vital role in learning, memory, fear conditioning, and cognitive processing.
