37303326|t|Investigation of Whole Blood Thiamine Concentration in Independently Ambulatory Residents of a Provincial Town in Japan: A Cross-Sectional Study.
37303326|a|Background Thiamine deficiency (TD) is an important public health problem in nutrition, occurring in 2-6% of the population in Europe and the US, whereas thiamine levels are reported to be significantly reduced by 36.6-40% in some populations of East Asia. However, there is little information available at present, regarding factors such as age, despite the continued aging of society. Further, studies such as those mentioned above have not yet been undertaken in Japan, the country in which population aging is most advanced. Objective To investigate TD in the Japanese community-dwelling individuals who are independently ambulatory. Methods We undertook an examination of TD in blood samples obtained from 270 citizens in a provincial town, aged 25-97 years, who were able to walk to the venue and provide informed consent for inclusion in this research and of whom 8.9% had a history of cancer. We summarized the demographic characteristics of the subjects. The whole-blood thiamine concentrations were measured using the high-performance liquid chromatography method. A value of 21.3 ng/ml or less was taken as low and a borderline value was set as less than 28 ng/ml. Results The mean (+-SD) whole blood thiamine concentration was 47.6 +- 8.7 ng/ml. No TD was observed to exist participating in this study, with no subjects even showing show borderline values. Further, there was no significant difference in thiamine level between those aged 65 or older and those aged less than 65. Conclusions No cases of TD were observed among the subjects in this study, nor was the concentration of thiamine found to be related to age. It is possible that the frequency of TD might be very low in citizens who have a certain level of activity. In the future, it is necessary to expand the prevalence of TD to a wider range of subjects.
