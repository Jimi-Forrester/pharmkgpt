34834567|t|Longitudinal Study of the Association between General Anesthesia and Increased Risk of Developing Dementia.
34834567|a|The association between exposure to general anesthesia (GA) and the risk of dementia is still undetermined. To investigate a possible link to the development of dementia in older people who have undergone GA, we analyzed nationwide representative cohort sample data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service. The study cohort comprised patients over 55 years of age who had undergone GA between January 2003 and December 2004 and consisted of 3100 patients who had undergone GA and 12,400 comparison subjects who had not received anesthesia. After the nine-year follow-up period, we found the overall incidence of dementia was higher in the patients who had undergone GA than in the comparison group (10.5 vs. 8.8 per 1000 person-years), with the risk being greater for women (adjusted HR of 1.44; 95% CI, 1.19-1.75) and those with comorbidities (adjusted HR of 1.39; 95% CI, 1.18-1.64). Patients who underwent GA showed higher risks for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia (adjusted HR of 1.52; 95% CI, 1.27-1.82 and 1.64; 95% CI, 1.15-2.33, respectively). This longitudinal study using a sample cohort based on a nationwide population sample demonstrated a significant positive association between GA and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.
