35200367|a|Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) is an important cofactor involved in metabolic redox reactions in living cells. The detection of NADH in living animal cells is a challenge. We developed a one-step monitoring method for NADH via an electrocatalytic reaction that uses a surface-modified, screen-printed electrode (SPE) having a redox active monolayer 4'-mercapto-N-phenlyquinone diamine (NPQD) formed by a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of an aromatic thiol, 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP). This electrode has a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.49 muM and a sensitivity of 0.0076 +- 0.0006 muM/muA in cell culture media, which indicates that it retains its selectivity. The applicability of this NADH sensor was demonstrated for the first time by cell viability monitoring via NADH-sensing in cell culture supernatants.
