39091890|a|Deficits in attention are common across a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. A multitude of brain regions, including the frontal cortex (FC) and locus coeruleus (LC), have been implicated in attention. Regulators of these brain regions at the molecular level are not well understood, but might elucidate underlying mechanisms of disorders with attentional deficits. To probe this, we used chemogenetic stimulation of neurons in the LC with axonal projections to the FC, and subsequent bulk RNA-sequencing from the mouse FC. We found that stimulation of this circuit caused an increase in transcription of the Apoe gene. To investigate cell type-specific expression of Apoe in the FC, we used a dual-virus approach to express either the excitatory DREADD receptor hM3Dq in LC neurons with projections to the FC, or a control virus, and found that increases in Apoe expression in the FC following depolarization of LC inputs is enriched in GABAergic neurons in a sex-dependent manner. The results of these experiments yield insights into how Apoe expression affects function in cortical microcircuits that are important for attention-guided behavior, and point to interneuron-specific expression of Apoe as a potential target for the amelioration of attention symptoms in disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
