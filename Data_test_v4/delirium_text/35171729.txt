35171729|t|Associations Between Regional Cerebral Blood Flow and Psychiatric Symptoms in Dementia With Lewy Bodies Without Parkinsonism.
35171729|a|Because dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) has various psychiatric symptoms, early diagnosis in patients without parkinsonism is difficult. To reveal associations between regional brain perfusion and psychiatric symptoms in DLB patients without parkinsonism, we quantified brain perfusion using an automated brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography analysis program, FineSRT. We statistically analyzed the differences in brain perfusion between groups, divided by the presence or absence of psychiatric symptoms. In DLB patients with depression, there were significant brain perfusion increases in the left angular gyrus and right upper precuneus. In DLB patients with visual hallucinations, there were significant decreases in the left inferior parietal lobule, left superior temporal gyrus, and right primary visual cortex. In DLB patients with auditory hallucinations, there were significant increases in the right middle occipital and right inferior occipital gyri. Our findings provide clues about the pathomechanisms of psychiatric symptoms and may enable early diagnosis of DLB in the future.
