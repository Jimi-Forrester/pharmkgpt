37554876|a|Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) is a neurological disorder usually after rapid correction of hyponatremia. Only few cases of ODS with hypernatremia and diabetes insipidus (DI) in postpartum state is reported. Postpartum hypernatremia is described as severe hypernatremia in postpartum period and presents as an encephalopathy with rhabdomyolysis with diffuse white matter hyperintensities suggestive of osmotic demyelination. Case presentation: The authors present a case of 29-year-old female who presented with chief complaint of altered sensorium and quadriparesis. Two days prior to onset of symptoms, she underwent caesarean section, was kept on nil per oral and free fluid restriction, after which she had confusion, altered sensorium, and weakness in all four limbs. Sodium level was 170 mEq/l. Urine osmolality and plasma osmolality was 150 and 410 mOsm/kg of water, respectively. MRI showed high signal intensity lesion in pons suggestive of demyelination. She was diagnosed ODS with transient DI and quadriparesis, in postpartum period due to further rise in sodium after free fluid restriction and nil per oral. She was treated with desmopressin, 5% dextrose and 0.9% normal saline, her quadriparesis recovered and desmopressin was tapered and stopped over 45 days and discharged at stable state. Clinical discussion: ODS can rarely be associated with hypernatremia in postpartum female presenting as quadriparesis and altered sensorium. Conclusion: Clinicians should be familiar of ODS with hypernatremia with transient DI in postpartum period, which is reversible and can be managed by desmopressin and fluid replacement.
