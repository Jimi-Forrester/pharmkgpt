34829710|a|Glutathione (GSH) is a major endogenous antioxidant. Several studies have shown GSH redox imbalance and altered GSH levels in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Early detection is crucial for the outcome of AD. However, whether GSH can serve as a biomarker during the very early-phase of AD, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), remains unknown. The current prospective study aimed to examine the longitudinal change in plasma GSH concentration and its influence on cognitive decline in MCI. Overall, 49 patients with MCI and 16 healthy individuals were recruited. Plasma GSH levels and cognitive function, measured by the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), were monitored every 6 months. We employed multiple regressions to examine the role of GSH level in cognitive decline in the 2 years period. The MCI patients showed significant decline in plasma GSH levels and cognitive function from baseline to endpoint (month 24). In comparison, the healthy individuals' GSH concentration and cognitive function did not change significantly. Further, both GSH level at baseline and GSH level change from baseline to endpoint significantly influenced cognitive decline among the MCI patients. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that both plasma GSH levels and cognitive function declined 2 years later among the MCI patients in a prospective manner. If replicated by future studies, blood GSH concentration may be regarded as a biomarker for monitoring cognitive change in MCI.
