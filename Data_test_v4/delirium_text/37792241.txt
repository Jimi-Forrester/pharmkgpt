37792241|t|Outcomes of hip fracture in centenarians: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
37792241|a|PURPOSE: Outcomes of hip fractures in centenarians remain underreported owing to the small number of patients reaching 100 years of age. This review aimed to determine outcomes of hip fracture in centenarians and to identify the most common comorbidities among centenarians with hip fracture to better characterise this population. METHODS: Published and unpublished literature databases, conference proceedings and the reference lists of included studies were searched to the 25th of January 2023. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed. Included studies were appraised using tools respective of study design. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies (6970 centenarians) were included (retrospective period: 1990-2020). The evidence was largely moderate to low in quality. One-year mortality following a hip fracture was 53.8% (95% CI 47.2 to 60.3%). Pooled complication rate following a hip fracture in centenarians was 50.5% (95% CI 25.3 to 75.6%). Dementia (26.2%, 95% CI 15.7 to 38.2%), hypertension (15.6%, 95% CI 3.4 to 33.1%), and diabetes (5.5%, 95% CI 1.9 to 10.7%) were the most common comorbidities among centenarians with hip fracture. CONCLUSION: Hip fractures in centenarians typically involve complex patient presentations with diverse comorbidities. However, the current evidence-base is moderate to low in quality. Effective cross-discipline communication and intervention is suggested to promote treatment outcomes.
