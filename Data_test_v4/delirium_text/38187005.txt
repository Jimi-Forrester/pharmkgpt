38187005|a|Background: Functional deterioration following emergency general surgery (EGS) poses a significant challenge in super-elderly patients. However, limited research has focused on assessing the deterioration in postoperative performance status (PS). This study aimed to investigate the impact of EGS on PS deterioration in super-elderly patients, and the extent to which deteriorated PS is recovered. Methods: This historical cohort study comprised 77 super-elderly patients who underwent EGS between July 2015 and December 2020. Functional deterioration was evaluated by comparing preoperative and postoperative Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS). The Emergency Surgical Score (ESS) was used as a risk-adjustment tool. Questionnaires were mailed to the patients and their families to assess post-discharge PS and obtain their impressions of EGS. Results: Postoperative PS deteriorated in 35/77 patients (45.5 %). Significant differences were observed between the groups in terms of sex, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, ESS scores, preoperative ECOG-PS, duration of operation, and major complications. Multivariate analysis of preoperative factors showed that ESS >=7 (OR: 3.7, 95 % CI: 1.0-13), preoperative ECOG-PS <=2 (OR: 5.9, 95 % CI: 1.7-21), and female sex (OR: 5.8, 95 % CI: 1.6-21) were associated with postoperative ECOG-PS deterioration. According to the questionnaire results, PS recovery post-discharge was observed in 6/36 (17 %) patients, and 34/36 (94 %) patients and their families expressed positive impressions of EGS. Conclusions: EGS in super-elderly patients highly caused a deterioration in their PS, particularly in patients with maintained preoperative PS. PS hardly recovered; however, most patients and their families had positive impressions of the EGS. Key message: We assessed the pre- and postoperative performance status of super-elderly patients who underwent emergency general surgery. Surgery caused a marked deterioration in patients' functional performance, which seldom recovered postoperatively.
