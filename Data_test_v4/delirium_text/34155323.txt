34155323|a|Delirium develops through a multifactorial process and include multiple subtypes with different pathological factors. To refine the treatment and care for delirium, a more detailed examination of these subtypes is needed. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the factors affecting delirium in cases in which hallucinations are conspicuous. In total, 602 delirium cases referred to the psychiatry department at a general hospital between May 2015 and August 2020 were enrolled. The Delirium Rating Scale-revised-98 was used to assess perceptual disturbances and hallucinations in patients with delirium. Multiple regression analysis was applied to determine whether individual factors were associated with the hallucinations. A total of 156 patients with delirium (25.9%) experienced hallucinations, with visual hallucinations being the most common subtype. Alcohol drinking (p < 0.0005), benzodiazepine withdrawal (p = 0.004), and the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (p = 0.007) or dopamine receptor agonists (p = 0.014) were found to be significantly associated with hallucinations in patients with delirium. The four factors detected in this study could all be reversible contributing factors derived from the use of or withdrawal from exogenous substances.
