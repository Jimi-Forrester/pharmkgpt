39618093|t|Rates and predictors of opioid deprescribing after fracture: A retrospective study of Medicare fee-for-service claims.
39618093|a|BACKGROUND: Adults with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (ADRD) or frailty are susceptible to fractures. Opioid analgesics are frequently prescribed after fractures. Documenting post-fracture opioid discontinuation rates and predictors of discontinuation among adults with ADRD or frailty can inform clinical practice, identify potential disparities, and improve pain management guidelines. The objective of this paper was to investigate opioid discontinuation in opioid-naive older adults who used opioids after an acute fracture. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included opioid-naive Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries (N = 33,027) >=65 years of age who filled an opioid prescription within 30 days of a vertebral, lower extremity, or upper extremity fracture from 2013 to 2018. Beneficiaries were classified according to ADRD (yes/no) and frailty (yes/no) status using validated claims-based algorithms. The primary outcome was opioid discontinuation, defined as a 30-day supply gap. We estimated discontinuation rates with the Kaplan-Meier method and identified predictors of opioid discontinuation using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: The 30-day opioid discontinuation rate was similar among non-frail beneficiaries without ADRD (81% [95% CI, 80%-81%]) and those who were non-frail with ADRD (83% [81%-84%]). Comparatively, 30-day discontinuation rates were lower among those with frailty and ADRD (76% [75%-77%]) and those with frailty alone (77% [75%-78%]). After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, health status, healthcare utilization, and calendar year, beneficiaries with both ADRD and frailty (HR, 0.90 [0.87-0.93]) and those with frailty alone (HR, 0.85 [0.82-0.89]), but not those with ADRD alone (HR, 1.06 [1.01-1.10]), were less likely to discontinue opioids compared with those without ADRD or frailty. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our findings suggest that frailty, but not ADRD, was associated with a lower likelihood of opioid discontinuation among older adults who initiated opioids after an acute fracture. Further research is needed to understand how opioid deprescribing practices depend on patient and provider preferences.
