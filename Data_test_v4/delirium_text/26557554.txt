26557554|t|Clinical Profile and Predictors of Outcomes in Older Inpatients with Pyelonephritis in a Tertiary Care Hospital in Southern India.
26557554|a|BACKGROUND: Pyelonephritis is a serious infection associated with significant morbidity and mortality in the elderly with an estimated annual incidence rate of around 10% from previous studies. Older people are at a higher risk for pyelonephritis due to multiple factors including structural, functional and co-existent conditions. There is very little data on the incidence, clinical features and outcomes among elderly patients with pyelonephritis in India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of case records of 100 consecutive patients over the age of 60 years with pyelonephritis admitted to a tertiary care hospital. RESULTS: One fourth of our patients (26%) did not have fever, 49% had delirium and 52% had systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Sixty five percent of the patients were diabetic and 60% had infections caused by extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms. As in other studies, the commonest organism isolated was E.coli (49%). A low serum albumin level was a predictor of mortality (p<0.001) and increased length of hospital stay (p<0.005). Delirium was also associated with a poor outcome (p=0.009) in these patients. Patients with pyelonephritis secondary to ESBL producing organisms had a higher length of stay (p<0.005). CONCLUSION: Hypoalbuminemia and delirium predicted poor outcomes in our patients. We found a high prevalence of ESBL infections in this study. Further research is required to assess the efficacy of aggressive management of delirium and low albumin in improving health and cost outcomes.
