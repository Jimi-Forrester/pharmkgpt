34589575|a|OBJECTIVES: Boerhaave's syndrome is a life-threatening disease with high mortality and morbidity. Endoscopic negative pressure therapy (ENPT) can be used to treat oesophageal perforations. CASE PRESENTATION: We report on a case of oesophageal rupture with peritonitis in a 35-year-old male patient. The start of treatment was 11 h after the perforation event. The treatment of the perforation defect was performed exclusively by intraluminal ENPT, the treatment of peritonitis was performed by laparotomy with abdominal lavage. For ENPT we used two different types of open-pore drains. The first treatment cycle of four days was performed with an open-pored polyurethane foam drainage (OPD), which was placed intraluminal to cover the perforation defect and to empty the stomach permanently. The second treatment cycle of nine days was performed with a thin nasogastric tube like double-lumen open-pored film drainage (OFD). For suction OPD and OFD were connected with an electronic vacuum pump (-125 mmHg). OFD enables active gastric emptying with simultaneous intestinal feeding via an integrated feeding tube. Intraluminal ENPT with a total treatment duration of 13 days was able to achieve the complete healing of the defect. Surgical treatment of the perforation defect was not necessary. The patient was discharged 20 days after initial treatment with a non-irritating abdominal wound and a closed perforation. CONCLUSIONS: In suitable cases, endoscopic negative pressure therapy is a minimally invasive, organ-preserving procedure for the treatment of spontaneous oesophageal rupture.
