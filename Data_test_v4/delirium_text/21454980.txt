21454980|t|A case of gamma-butyrolactone associated with severe withdrawal delirium and acute renal failure.
21454980|a|gamma-Butyrolactone (GBL) is a popular drug of abuse which is easily available over the internet. Following a UK classification change to a class C drug in January 2010, internet supply has become difficult. Some of the effects have resulted in sourcing GBL from industrial solvents. We report a case of a 24-year-old man who was admitted for detoxification from GBL. He reported having sourced the GBL by diluting the contents of nail varnish remover pads with water. During his admission he developed a severe withdrawal delirium and acute renal failure. He required admission to the intensive care unit. Physicians and psychiatrists should be aware of toxic sources of GBL leading to renal failure and consider GBL in those presenting with agitation, psychosis or coma.
