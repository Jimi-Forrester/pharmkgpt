33633873|t|Empyema Tube or No Tube?
33633873|a|We report the case of a 36-year-old man with cirrhosis who presented with recurrent infection of his right-sided hepatic hydrothorax in the form of fever, dyspnea, and cough. The pleural fluid analysis showed transudative fluid with normal pH, lactic acid dehydrogenase, and glucose, but with Escherichia coli growth. An uncommon diagnosis of high mortality, spontaneous bacterial empyema was made. Criteria for chest tube drainage were met, but he was managed without one. He developed hospital-acquired pneumonia during his stay, but his pleural fluid showed the same characteristics. His empyema and pneumonia were managed with antibiotics and other supportive measures. On follow-up, he was readmitted on three other occasions with similar complaints and succumbed to upper gastrointestinal bleed during the fifth admission. A chest tube is not indicated in patients with spontaneous bacterial empyema unless frank pus is present.
