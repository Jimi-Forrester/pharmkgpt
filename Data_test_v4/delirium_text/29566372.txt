29566372|t|Prevalence, Recognition, and Treatment of Dementia in Assisted Living Facilities.
29566372|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Dementia and psychiatric disorders are common in assisted living facilities (ALFs) and have suboptimal rates of recognition and treatment. Therefore, we aimed to obtain a direct estimate of the prevalence of cognitive impairment and especially dementia among residents of ALFs in western Slovakia and their rates of primary recognition and adequate treatment. METHODS: We conducted two cross-sectional studies. Ten ALFs within the city of Bratislava were chosen for the study in 2004, and again in 2011. A total of 866 residents in ALFs were examined in 2004, and 821 residents in ALFs were examined in 2011. The rate and characterization of dementia, its primary recognition and adequate treatment were investigated in both cross-sectional studies. RESULTS: In 2004, 57% of the participants had dementia. Only 7.2% of the participants with probable Alzheimer disease were treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. In 2011, we observed a significant improvement in primary diagnostics and therapy. 66.9% of the cases of dementia were adequately evaluated, and 52.1% were adequately treated. CONCLUSION: Cognitive deficit and dementia are significantly underdiagnosed and undertreated in assisted living settings. In the second cross-sectional study we detected significant but not complete improvement in the primary recognition and adequate therapy of dementia.
