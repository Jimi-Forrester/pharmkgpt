32722559|t|The Functional Roles and Applications of Immunoglobulins in Neurodegenerative Disease.
32722559|a|Natural autoantibodies, immunoglobulins (Igs) that target self-proteins, are common in the plasma of healthy individuals; some of the autoantibodies play pathogenic roles in systemic or tissue-specific autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Recently, the field of autoantibody-associated diseases has expanded to encompass neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), with related studies examining the functions of Igs in the central nervous system (CNS). Recent evidence suggests that Igs have various effects in the CNS; these effects are associated with the prevention of neurodegeneration, as well as induction. Here, we summarize the functional roles of Igs with respect to neurodegenerative disease (AD and PD), focusing on the target antigens and effector cell types. In addition, we review the current knowledge about the roles of these antibodies as diagnostic markers and immunotherapies.
