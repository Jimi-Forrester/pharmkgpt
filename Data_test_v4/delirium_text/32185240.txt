32185240|a|OBJECTIVE: Measures of spinal cord structure can be a useful phenotype to track disease severity and development; this observational study measures the hereditability of cervical spinal cord anatomy and its correlates in healthy human beings. METHODS: Twin data from the Human Connectome Project were analyzed with semiautomated spinal cord segmentation, evaluating test-retest reliability and broad-sense heritability with an AE model. Relationships between spinal cord metrics, general physical measures, regional brain structural measures, and motor function were assessed. RESULTS: We found that the spinal cord C2 cross-sectional area (CSA), left-right width (LRW), and anterior-posterior width (APW) are highly heritable (85%-91%). All measures were highly correlated with the brain volume, and CSA only was positively correlated with thalamic volumes (p = 0.005) but negatively correlated with the occipital cortex area (p = 0.001). LRW was correlated with the participant's height (p = 0.00027). The subjects' sex significantly influenced these metrics. Analyses of a test-retest data set confirmed validity of the approach. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the evidence of genetic influence on spinal cord structure. MRI metrics of cervical spinal cord anatomy are robust and not easily influenced by nonpathological environmental factors, providing a useful metric for monitoring normal development and progression of neurodegenerative disorders affecting the spinal cord, including-but not limited to-spinal cord injury and MS.
