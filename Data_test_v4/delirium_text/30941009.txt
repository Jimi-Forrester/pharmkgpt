30941009|t|Neurotrophic, Gene Regulation, and Cognitive Functions of Carboxypeptidase E-Neurotrophic Factor-alpha1 and Its Variants.
30941009|a|Carboxypeptidase E, also known as neurotrophic factor-alpha1 (CPE-NFalpha1), was first discovered as an exopeptidase and is known to work by cleaving C-terminal basic amino acids from prohormone intermediates to produce mature peptide hormones and neuropeptides in the endocrine and central nervous systems, respectively. CPE-NFalpha1 also plays a critical role in prohormone sorting and secretory vesicle transportation. Recently, emerging studies have indicated that CPE-NFalpha1 exerts multiple non-enzymatic physiological roles in maintaining normal central nervous system function and in neurodevelopment. This includes potent neuroprotective and anti-depressant activities, as well as stem cell differentiation functions. In addition, N-terminal truncated variants of CPE-NFalpha1 have been identified to regulate expression of important neurodevelopmental genes. This mini-review summarizes recent advances in understanding the mechanisms underlying CPE-NFalpha1's function in neuroprotection during stress and aspects of neurodevelopment.
