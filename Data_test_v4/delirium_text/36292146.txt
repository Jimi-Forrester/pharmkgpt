36292146|t|The Impact of Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy on Functional Outcome of Patients Affected by Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage Discharged from Intensive Inpatient Rehabilitation: A Cohort Study.
36292146|a|Background: Sporadic CAA is recognized as a major cause of sICH and sABI. Even if intensive rehabilitation is recommended to maximize functional recovery after sICH, no data are available on whether CAA may affect rehabilitation outcomes. In this observational prospective study, to explore the impact of CAA on rehabilitation results, functional outcomes after intensive rehabilitation have been compared between patients affected by sICH with and without a diagnosis of CAA. Methods: All adults affected by sABI due to sICH and admitted to the IRU of IRCCS-Don-Gnocchi-Foundation were consecutively enrolled for 12 months. Demographic and clinical data were recorded upon admission and discharge. Results: Among 102 sICH patients (age: 66 (IQR = 16), 53% female), 13% were diagnosed as probable/possible-CAA. TPO and functional assessment were comparable upon admission, but CAA patients were significantly older (p = 0.001). After a comparable LOS, CAA patients presented higher care burden (ERBI: p = 0.025), poorer functional recovery (FIM: p = 0.02) and lower levels of global independence (GOSE > 4: p = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, CAA was significantly correlated with a lower FIM (p = 0.019) and a lower likelihood of reaching GOS-E > 4, (p = 0.041) at discharge, independently from age. Conclusions: CAA seems to be independently associated with poorer rehabilitation outcomes, suggesting the importance of improving knowledge about CAA to better predict rehabilitation outcomes.
