38759006|t|Associations of Nativity and the Role of the Hispanic Paradox on the Cognitive Health of Older Latinos Living in the United States.
38759006|a|Background: US-based Latinos have lower education and income combined with higher health risks than non-Latino whites, but often 'paradoxically' evidence better health-related outcomes. Less work has investigated this paradox for cognitive-related outcomes despite nativity diversity. Objective: We evaluated cognitive aging within older Latinos of diverse nativity currently living in the US and participating in Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center studies. Methods: Participants without baseline dementia, who completed annual neuropsychological assessments (in English or Spanish) were grouped by US-born (n = 117), Mexico-born (n = 173), and born in other Latin American regions (LAr-born = 128). Separate regression models examined associations between nativity and levels of (N = 418) or change in (n = 371; maximum follow-up ~16 years) global and domain-specific cognition. Results: Demographically-adjusted linear regression models indicated that foreign-born nativity was associated with lower levels of global cognition and select cognitive domains compared to US-born Latinos. No associations of nativity with cognitive decline emerged from demographically-adjusted mixed-effects models; however, Mexico-born nativity appeared associated with slower declines in working memory compared to other nativity groups (p-values >= 0.051). Mexico-born Latinos had relatively higher vascular burden and lower education levels than other nativity groups; however, this did not alter results. Conclusions: Nativity differences in baseline cognition may be due, in part, to accumulated stressors related to immigration and acculturation experienced by foreign-born Latinos which may hasten meeting criteria for dementia later in life. In contrast, Mexico-born participants' slower working memory declines, taken in the context of other participant characteristics including vascular burden, suggests the Hispanic Paradox may relate to factors with the potential to affect cognition.
