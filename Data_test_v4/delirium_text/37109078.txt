37109078|t|Voiding Dysfunction Due to Urethral Sphincter Dysfunction Might Be an Early Neurological Presentation of Central Nervous System Disorders in Aged Patients.
37109078|a|PURPOSE: To investigate the incidence of central nervous system (CNS) diseases in adult patients with voiding dysfunction and videourodynamics (VUDS) proven urethral sphincter dysfunction. METHODS: This retrospective analysis reviewed the medical charts of patients aged > 60 years who underwent VUDS for non-prostatic voiding dysfunction from 2006 to 2021. A chart review was performed to search for the occurrence and treatment of CNS diseases after the VUDS examination up to 2022. The diagnosis of CNS disease, such as cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementia, by neurologists was also retrieved from the charts. Based on the VUDS findings, patients were divided into the following subgroups: dysfunctional voiding (DV), poor relaxation of the external sphincter (PRES), and hypersensitive bladder (HSB) and coordinated sphincter subgroups. The incidence of CVA, PD, and dementia in each subgroup was recorded and compared among them using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: A total of 306 patients were included. VUDS examinations revealed DV in 87 patients, PRES in 108, and HSB in 111. Among them, 36 (11.8%) patients had CNS disease, including CVA in 23 (7.5%), PD in 4 (1.3%), and dementia in 9 (2.9%). Among the three subgroups, the DV group had the highest incidence rate of CNS disease (n = 16, 18.4%), followed by PRES (n = 12, 11.1%) and HSB (n = 8, 7.2%). However, no significant difference was noted in the incidence of CNS disease across the three subgroups. Nevertheless, the incidence of CNS disease was higher in patients with DV and PRES than that in the general population. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CNS diseases was high in patients aged > 60 years with voiding dysfunction due to urethral sphincter dysfunction. Patients with VUDS-confirmed DV had the highest incidence of CNS disease among the three subgroups.
