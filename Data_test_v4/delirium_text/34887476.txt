34887476|t|Peptide backbone modifications of amyloid beta (1-40) impact fibrillation behavior and neuronal toxicity.
34887476|a|Fibril formation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides is one of the key molecular events connected to Alzheimer's disease. The pathway of formation and mechanism of action of Abeta aggregates in biological systems is still object of very active research. To this end, systematic modifications of the Phe19-Leu34 hydrophobic contact, which has been reported in almost all structural studies of Abeta40 fibrils, helps understanding Abeta folding pathways and the underlying free energy landscape of the amyloid formation process. In our approach, a series of Abeta40 peptide variants with two types of backbone modifications, namely incorporation of (i) a methylene or an ethylene spacer group and (ii) a N-methylation at the amide functional group, of the amino acids at positions 19 or 34 was applied. These mutations are expected to challenge the inter-beta-strand side chain contacts as well as intermolecular backbone beta-sheet hydrogen bridges. Using a multitude of biophysical methods, it is shown that these backbone modifications lead, in most of the cases, to alterations in the fibril formation kinetics, a higher local structural heterogeneity, and a somewhat modified fibril morphology without generally impairing the fibril formation capacity of the peptides. The toxicological profile found for the variants depend on the type and extent of the modification.
