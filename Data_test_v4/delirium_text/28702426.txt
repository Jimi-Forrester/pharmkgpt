28702426|t|The Chemical Characteristics and Immune-Modulating Activity of Polysaccharides Isolated from Cold-Brew Coffee.
28702426|a|To elucidate new biological ingredients in cold-brew coffee extracted with cold water, crude polysaccharide (CCP-0) was isolated by ethanol precipitation, and its immune-stimulating activities were assayed. CCP-0 mainly comprised galactose (53.6%), mannose (15.7%), arabinose (11.9%), and uronic acid (12.4%), suggesting that it might exist as a mixture of galactomannan and arabinogalactan. CCP-0 significantly increased cell proliferation on both murine peritoneal macrophages and splenocytes in a dose dependent manner. CCP-0 also significantly augmented nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species production by murine peritoneal macrophages. In addition, macrophages stimulated by CCP-0 enhanced production of various cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-12. In an in vitro assay for intestinal immune-modulating activity, CCP-0 showed higher bone-marrow cell-proliferation activity through Peyer's patch cells at 100 mug/mL than the negative control. These results suggest that CCP-0 may potentially enhance macrophage functions and the intestinal immune system.
