39387105|a|INTRODUCTION: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a main cause of cognitive dysfunction in the elderly. We investigated specific cognitive profiles, cognitive function in the stage before intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and the association between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) burden in CAA because data on these topics are limited. METHODS: We included Dutch-type hereditary CAA (D-CAA) mutation carriers with and without ICH, patients with sporadic CAA (sCAA), and age-matched controls. Cognition was measured with a standardized test battery. Linear regression was performed to assess the association between MRI-cSVD burden and cognition. RESULTS: D-CAA ICH- mutation carriers exhibited poorer global cognition and executive function compared to age-matched controls. Patients with sCAA performed worse across all cognitive domains compared to D-CAA ICH+ mutation carriers and age-matched controls. MRI-cSVD burden is associated with decreased processing speed. DISCUSSION: CAA is associated with dysfunction in multiple cognitive domains, even before ICH, with increased MRI-cSVD burden being associated with slower processing speed. HIGHLIGHTS: Cognitive dysfunction is present in early disease stages of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) before the occurrence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH). Presymptomatic Dutch-type CAA (D-CAA) mutation carriers show worse cognition than age-matched controls. More early awareness of cognitive dysfunction in CAA before first sICH is needed. Increased cerebral small vessel disease CAA-burden on magnetic resonance imaging is linked to a decrease in processing speed.
