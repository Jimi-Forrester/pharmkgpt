37942469|a|Background: Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease caused by specific microorganisms that gradually damage the periodontal and tooth-supporting tissues, thereby reducing a person's quality of life. Periodontal disease is closely associated with high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, with a high receptor activator of nuclear factor kbeta ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin (OPG) ratio. Konjac glucomannan (KGM) is produced from the porang root, which has several properties. For example, it can reduce oxidative stress. The current study analyzed the osteoclastogenesis inhibitory and antioxidant properties of KGM based on histomorphometric findings, RANKL/OPG ratio, and ROS levels in the Swiss Webster mouse periodontitis model. Methods: Eight-week-old male Swiss Webster mice were divided into the nonligation, nonligation + KGM, ligation + Porphyromonas gingivalis, and ligation + P. gingivalis + KGM groups. KGM suspension was administered for 14 days. Periodontitis induction was performed from 7th to 14th day. On the 14th day, maxillae, gingival, and gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected to assess the histomorphometry of bone damage, gene expression ratio of RANKL/OPG, and ROS protein levels. Results: The periodontitis group pretreated with KGM presented with significantly reduced alveolar bone damage, RANKL/OPG ratio, and ROS level than without KGM group. KGM treatment had no harmful/toxic effects in mice. Conclusion: Administration of KGM could act as an adjunctive in periodontal therapy by suppressing periodontal disease via osteoclastogenesis inhibitory and antioxidant properties.
