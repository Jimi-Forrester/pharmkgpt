14531256|a|BACKGROUND: Influence of the type of anesthesia on postoperative delirium was examined in geriatric patients with femoral neck fracture. METHODS: Forty patients aged 70 or more were randomly allocated to receive either general anesthesia (sevoflurane, nitrous oxide in oxygen, G group, n = 21) or spinal anesthesia (0.5% bupivacaine, S group, n = 19). G group received the oxygen therapy during the 12-hour postoperative period. Postoperative assessments included the rate of postoperative delirium during the 4-day postoperative period, oxygen saturation during the 18-hour postoperative period, the value of hemoglobin at 1 postoperative day and the number of analgesics requirements during the 4-day postoperative period. RESULTS: The rate of postoperative delirium was similar between the two groups during the 4-day postoperative period. However, that of S group tended to be higher during the 1-day postoperative period. Postoperative analgesic effect and the value of hemoglobin at 1 postoperative day were similar between the two groups. Oxygen saturation was similar between the two groups except 6 hours after the operation. CONCLUSIONS: The type of anesthesia, general or spinal, does not affect the postoperative delirium in geriatric patients with femoral neck fracture.
