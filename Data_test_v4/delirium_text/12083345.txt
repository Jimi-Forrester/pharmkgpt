12083345|a|This study evaluates the effectiveness of Basic Care I, a dementia-specific training course offered by the St. Louis Alzheimer's Association. Using three standardized measures, the effects of the course on knowledge gain, stress level, and sense of work-related self-esteem are examined Findings suggest that participation in Basic Care I increases retained learning, as 76.4 percent of the sample showed improvement on dementia knowledge scores. The outcomes of stress and self-esteem measures are inconclusive but indicate areas for future study. Implications for program planning are discussed.
