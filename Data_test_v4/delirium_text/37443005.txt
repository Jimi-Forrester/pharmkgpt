37443005|a|BACKGROUND: Prime editing (PE) is the most recent gene editing technology able to introduce targeted alterations to the genome, including single base pair changes, small insertions, and deletions. Several improvements to the PE machinery have been made in the past few years, and these have been tested in a range of model systems including immortalized cell lines, stem cells, and animal models. While double nicking RNA (dncRNA) PE systems PE3 and PE5 currently show the highest editing rates, they come with reduced accuracy as undesired indels or SNVs arise at edited loci. Here, we aimed to improve single ncRNA (sncRNA) systems PE2 and PE4max by generating novel all-in-one (pAIO) plasmids driven by an EF-1alpha promoter, which is especially suitable for human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) models. RESULTS: pAIO-EF1alpha-PE2 and pAIO-EF1alpha-PE4max were used to edit the voltage gated potassium channel gene KCNQ2 and voltage gated sodium channel gene SCN1A. Two clinically relevant mutations were corrected using pAIO-EF1alpha-PE2 including the homozygous truncating SCN1A R612* variant in HEK293T cells and the heterozygous gain-of-function KCNQ2 R201C variant in patient-derived hiPSC. We show that sncRNA PE yielded detectable editing rates in hiPSC ranging between 6.4% and 9.8%, which was further increased to 41% after a GFP-based fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) cell sorting step. Furthermore, we show that selecting the high GFP expressing population improved editing efficiencies up to 3.2-fold compared to the low GFP expressing population, demonstrating that not only delivery but also the number of copies of the PE enzyme and/or pegRNA per cell are important for efficient editing. Edit rates were not improved when an additional silent protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM)-removing alteration was introduced in hiPSC at the target locus. Finally, there were no genome-wide off-target effects using pAIO-EF1alpha-PE2 and no off-target editing activity near the edit locus highlighting the accuracy of snc prime editors. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our study shows an improved efficacy of EF-1alpha driven sncRNA pAIO-PE plasmids in hiPSC reaching high editing rates, especially after FACS sorting. Optimizing these sncRNA PE systems is of high value when considering future therapeutic in vivo use, where accuracy will be extremely important.
