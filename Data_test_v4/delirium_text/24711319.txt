24711319|a|One of the most devastating impacts of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is the toll on caregivers. Evidence from randomized clinical trials has demonstrated the effectiveness of providing psychosocial interventions for caregivers to lessen their burden. However, the implementation of such interventions in community settings has proved challenging. This case study describes outcomes of the implementation of an evidence-based intervention in a multisite program in Minnesota. Consistent with the original randomized clinical trial of the intervention, assessments of this program showed decreased depression and distress among caregivers. Participating in a greater number of caregiver counseling sessions was also associated with longer time to nursing home placement for the person with dementia. Some of the challenges in the community setting included having caregivers complete the full six counseling sessions and acquiring complete outcome data. Given the challenges faced in the community setting, web-based training for providers may be a cost-effective way to realize the maximum benefits of the intervention for vulnerable adults with dementia and their families.
