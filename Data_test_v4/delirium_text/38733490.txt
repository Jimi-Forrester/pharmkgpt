38733490|t|Edaravone Alleviates Traumatic Brain Injury by Inhibition of Ferroptosis via FSP1 Pathway.
38733490|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a highly severe form of trauma with complex series of reactions in brain tissue which ultimately results in neuronal damage. Previous studies proved that neuronal ferroptosis, which was induced by intracranial haemorrhage and other reasons, was one of the most primary causes of neuronal damage following TBI. However, the association between neuronal mechanical injury and ferroptosis in TBI and relevant treatments remain unclear. In the present study, we first demonstrated the occurrence of neuronal ferroptosis in the early stage of TBI and preliminarily elucidated that edaravone (EDA), a cerebroprotective agent that eliminates oxygen radicals, was able to inhibit ferroptosis induced by TBI. A cell scratching model was established in PC12 cells, and it was confirmed that mechanical injury induced ferroptosis in neurons at the early stage of TBI. Ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) plays a significant role in inhibiting ferroptosis, and we found that iFSP, a ferroptosis agonist which is capable to inhibit FSP1 pathway, attenuated the anti-ferroptosis effect of EDA. In conclusion, our results suggested that EDA inhibited neuronal ferroptosis induced by mechanical injury in the early phase of TBI by activating FSP1 pathway, which could provide evidence for future research on prevention and treatment of TBI.
