32071582|t|Antipsychotic Use in the Prevention and Treatment of Intensive Care Unit Delirium in Pediatric Patients.
32071582|a|OBJECTIVES: To describe the antipsychotics, route of administration, dosage regimen, and outcomes reported to prevent or treat delirium in hospitalized children. METHODS: Medline, Embase, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were searched using the keywords "haloperidol," "olanzapine," "quetiapine," "risperidone," "ziprasidone," and "delirium." Articles evaluating the use of these agents to manage delirium in hospitalized children that were published between 1946 and August 2019 were included. Two authors independently screened each article for inclusion. Reports were excluded if they were published abstracts or included fewer than 3 patients in the report. RESULTS: Thirteen reports that included 370 children receiving haloperidol, quetiapine, olanzapine, and/or risperidone for delirium treatment were reviewed. Most children received haloperidol (n = 131) or olanzapine (n = 125). Significant variability in dosing was noted. A total of 23 patients (6.2%) had an adverse drug event, including 13 (56.5%) who experienced dystonia and 3 (13.0%) with a prolonged corrected QT interval. Most reports described improvement in delirium symptoms; however, only 5 reports used a validated screening tool for PICU delirium to evaluate antipsychotic response. CONCLUSIONS: Most reports noted efficacy with antipsychotics, but these reports were limited by sample size and lacked a validated PICU delirium tool. Future research is needed to determine the optimal agent and dosage regimen to treat PICU delirium.
