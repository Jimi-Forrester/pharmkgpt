7989283|t|Delirium associated with the combination of a neuroleptic, an SSRI, and benztropine.
7989283|a|BACKGROUND: On the basis of recent findings, the increased use of serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in combination with antipsychotics and concomitant benztropine is likely. METHOD: Five patients who developed delirium while receiving a neuroleptic, an SSRI, and benztropine are described. RESULTS: The timing of the delirium in relation to drug administration suggests the delirium was the result of an interaction of the SSRI and benztropine. CONCLUSION: Possible mechanisms are explored. Clinicians should be aware that patients receiving this combination may be at increased risk for delirium.
