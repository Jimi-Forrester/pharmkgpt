24092527|a|There is currently no treatment for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's diseases. While spinal cord injury has no treatment either, nerve injuries are being treated with autologous grafts, a procedure that in turn translates into a loss of function in the donor area. The development of therapies for these pathologies has become urgent as population keeps on ageing. A promising direction of investigation is the use of regenerative techniques to re-grow healthy and functional tissue in the injured area. In this review article, various approaches currently investigated to promote neural regeneration are covered. Those include approaches based on (and many times combining) stem cell therapy, scaffolds made of hydrogel, electrospun fibers and conductive materials as well as the use of soluble or non-diffusible growth factors.
