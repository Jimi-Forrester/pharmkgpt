34433255|a|BACKGROUND: Pain is one of the most critical issues in older adults, and the place of residence may play an important role in pain characteristics and related factors. However, it is an understudied subject. This study investigated differences in pain characteristics and functional associations between nursing home residents and community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: Older adult participants were recruited from nursing homes (n=73) and the community (n=73). Pain characteristics, including type, intensity, and number of pain sites, were evaluated. Other outcome measures were functional mobility, walking speed, functional independence, physical activity, anxiety, depression, and health-related quality of life. RESULTS: Nursing home residents experienced musculoskeletal pain more frequently and had a greater number of pain sites than community-dwelling older adults (p<0.05). Walking speed and mobility were significantly lower and anxiety and depression were significantly higher in nursing home residents (p<0.05). While higher pain intensity was significantly correlated with low scores on physical measures, low health-related quality of life, and higher depression and anxiety symptoms in both groups (p<0.05), the magnitudes of the correlations were much higher in nursing home residents. The number of pain sites was significantly correlated with low scores on physical measures, low health-related quality of life, and higher depression and anxiety symptoms mainly in nursing home residents (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Compared to community-dwelling older adults, nursing home residents experienced musculoskeletal pain more frequently and at more sites in the body. Higher pain intensity and number of pain sites were associated with worse clinical variables, mainly in nursing home residents. This study highlights the importance of regular pain assessment, especially in nursing home care settings.
