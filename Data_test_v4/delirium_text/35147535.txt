35147535|t|The Rationale and Design of Behavioral Interventions for Management of Agitation in Dementia in a Multi-Site Clinical Trial.
35147535|a|BACKGROUND: Agitation and aggression are common in patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and pose a significant burden on patients, caregivers, and the healthcare systems. Guidelines recommend personalized behavioral interventions as the first-line treatment; however, these interventions are often underutilized. The Standardizing Care for Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and Quality of Life in Dementia (StaN) study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier # NCT0367220) is a multisite randomized controlled trial comparing an Integrated Care Pathway, that includes a sequential pharmacological algorithm and structured behavioral interventions, with treatment-as-usual to treat agitation in dementia in long-term care and inpatient settings. OBJECTIVE: To describe the rationale and design of structured behavioral interventions in the StaN study. METHODS: Structured behavioral interventions are designed and implemented based on the following considerations: 1) personalization, 2) evidence base, 3) dose and duration, 4) measurement-based care, and 5) environmental factors and feasibility. RESULTS: The process to design behavioral interventions for each individual starts with a comprehensive assessment, followed by personalized, evidence-based interventions delivered in a standardized manner with ongoing monitoring of global clinical status. Measurement-based care is used to tailor the interventions and integrate them with pharmacotherapy. CONCLUSION: Individualized behavioral interventions in patients with dementia may be challenging to design and implement. Here we describe a process to design and implement individualized and structured behavioral interventions in the context of a multisite trial in long-term care and inpatient settings. This process can inform the design of behavioral interventions in future trials and in clinical settings for the treatment of agitation in dementia.
