32009708|a|OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of postoperative (PO) analgesic effects of intraoperative (IO) Dexmedetomidine (DEX) compared to remifentanil (REMI) infusions during sevoflurane anesthesia for laparoscopic gastric sleeve surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and thirty-two patients with body mass index >35 kg.m-2 and ASA Grades II or III were randomly divided into group R received REMI infusion (6-18 mug.kg-1.h-1) and Group D received DEX infusion (0.2-0.5 mug.kg-1.h-1) after tracheal intubation till before stoppage of inhalational anesthetic. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure were noninvasively monitored during and after surgery. Emergence time, time until postanesthetic care unit transfer, and total operating room (OR) time was recorded. PO shoulder-tip pain and wound pain scores were recorded and rescue analgesia was provided as 50 mg pethidine intramuscular injection. Occurrence of PO nausea and vomiting (PONV) and frequency of the need for antiemetic therapy were recorded. Primary study outcome was the ability of the study infusions to reduce consumption of PO pethidine down to one dose during 24-hr PO. RESULTS: IO use of REMI or DEX infusion allowed hemodynamic control to surgical stresses with nonsignificant difference between both infusions. REMI infusion insured significantly rapid recovery and short OR times but required larger volume of sevoflurane during surgery and proper PO follow-up for pain and PONV. DEX infusion significantly improved control of PO pain with a larger number of patient requested rescue analgesia only once, reduced the dose of PO analgesia, reduced the frequency of PONV, and the need for antiemetic therapy. CONCLUSION: REMI or DEX infusion as IO adjuvant to general anesthesia is appropriate option to achieve hemodynamic control of surgical stresses and to improve perioperative outcomes. REMI infusion may be preferred for its induced rapid recovery and short OR time, whereas DEX infusion may be chosen for its improved control of PO pain and reduction of PO analgesia and frequency of PONV.
