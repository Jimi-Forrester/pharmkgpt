35804948|t|Postoperative Delirium in Patients with Oral Cancer: Is Intraoperative Fluid Administration a Neglected Risk Factor?
35804948|a|Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a malignant tumor derived from squamous cells and can be found in different localizations. In the oral cavity especially, it represents the most common type of malignant tumor. First-line therapy for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is surgery, including tumor resection, neck dissection, and maybe reconstruction. Although perioperative mortality is low, complications such as delirium are very common, and may have long-lasting consequences on the patient's quality of life. This study examines if excessive fluid administration, among other parameters, is an aggravating factor for the development of postoperative delirium. A total of 198 patients were divided into groups concerning the reconstruction technique used: group A for primary wound closure or reconstruction with a local flap, and group B for microsurgical reconstruction. The patients with and without delirium in both groups were compared regarding intraoperative fluid administration, fluid balance, and other parameters, such as blood loss, duration of surgery and overall ventilation, alcohol consumption, and creatinine, albumin, natrium, and hematocrit levels. The logistic regression for group A shows that fluid intake (p = 0.02, OR = 5.27, 95% CI 1.27-21.8) and albumin levels (p = 0.036, OR = 0.22, CI 0.054-0.908) are independent predictors for the development of delirium. For group B, gender (p = 0.026, OR = 0.34, CI 0.133-0.879) with a protective effect for females, fluid intake (p = 0.003, OR = 3.975, CI 1.606-9.839), and duration of ventilation (p = 0.025, OR = 1.178, CI 1.021-1.359) are also independent predictors for delirium. An intake of more than 3000 mL for group A, and 4150 mL for group B, increases the risk of delirium by approximately five and four times, respectively. Fluid management should be considered carefully in patients with OSCC, in order to reduce the occurrence of postoperative delirium. Different factors may become significant for the development of delirium regarding different surgical procedures.
