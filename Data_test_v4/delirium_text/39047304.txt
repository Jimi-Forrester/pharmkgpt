39047304|t|Dual orexin receptor antagonist ameliorates sleep deprivation-induced learning and memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice.
39047304|a|Sleep is considered closely related to cognitive function, and cognitive impairment is the main clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sleep disturbance in AD patients is more severe than that in healthy elderly individuals. Additionally, sleep deprivation reportedly increases the activity of the hypothalamic orexin system and the risk of AD. To investigate whether intervention with the orexin system can improve sleep disturbance in AD and its impact on AD pathology. In this study, six-month-old amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 mice were subjected to six weeks of chronic sleep deprivation and injected intraperitoneally with almorexant, a dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA), to investigate the effects and mechanisms of sleep deprivation and almorexant intervention on learning and memory in mice with AD. We found that sleep deprivation aggravated learning and memory impairment and increased brain beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition in mice with AD. The application of almorexant can increase the total sleep time of sleep-deprived mice and reduce cognitive impairment and Abeta deposition, which is related to the improvement in Aquaporin-4 polarity. Thus, DORA may be an effective strategy for delaying the progression of AD patients by improving the sleep disturbances.
