35624877|a|The lack of a direct connection between solid edible or medical natural products and bioactive compound profiling is a bottleneck in natural product research and quality control. Here, a novel integrated system, online extraction (OLE)-2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-HPLC-DAD-QTOF-MS, was fabricated to extract, screen, and identify antioxidants from the whole fruit of Citrus aurantium L. var. amara (CAVA, Rutaceae) simply, rapidly, and efficiently. The system consumes less sample (1.0 mg of CAVA powder) and requires a shorter analytical time (45 min for sample extraction, antioxidants screening, separation, and identification). Eight antioxidant flavonoids were screened and identified, and six available flavanones were sensitively, precisely, and accurately quantified. Two major flavanone glycosides, naringin (50.37 +- 0.43 mg/g) and neohesperidin (38.20 +- 0.27 mg/g), exhibit potent DPPH scavenging activities with IC50 values of 111.9 +- 10.06 and 178.55 +- 11.28 mug/mL. A minor flavanone aglycone, hesperitin (0.73 +- 0.06 mg/g), presents stronger DPPH scavenging activity (IC50, 39.07 +- 2.51 mug/mL). Furthermore, density functional theory calculations demonstrated their electron transport ability and chemical reactivity, which confirmed the screened results. The results indicate that the developed OLE-DPPH-HPLC-DAD-QTOF-MS system provides new perspectives for analysis of antioxidants from complex natural products, which also contribute to the quality evaluation of CAVA.
