32485811|t|Relevance of SIRT1-NF-kappaB Axis as Therapeutic Target to Ameliorate Inflammation in Liver Disease.
32485811|a|Inflammation is an adaptive response in pursuit of homeostasis reestablishment triggered by harmful conditions or stimuli, such as an infection or tissue damage. Liver diseases cause approximately 2 million deaths per year worldwide and hepatic inflammation is a common factor to all of them, being the main driver of hepatic tissue damage and causing progression from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and, ultimately, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The metabolic sensor SIRT1, a class III histone deacetylase with strong expression in metabolic tissues such as the liver, and transcription factor NF-kappaB, a master regulator of inflammatory response, show an antagonistic relationship in controlling inflammation. For this reason, SIRT1 targeting is emerging as a potential strategy to improve different metabolic and/or inflammatory pathologies. In this review, we explore diverse upstream regulators and some natural/synthetic activators of SIRT1 as possible therapeutic treatment for liver diseases.
