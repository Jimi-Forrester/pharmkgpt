18075249|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS AND METHODS: Perseveration is common in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We document the type and quantitative burden of perseveration as cognitive decline progresses from normal aging (n = 30) through mild AD (n = 20) to moderate AD (n = 20) by administering a semantic verbal fluency task. RESULTS: We found perseveration to increase significantly with increasing severity of AD and different types of perseveration that distinguish the subject groups in a statistically significant manner. Recurrent and continuous perseverations appear early in AD. As the disease progresses in severity into moderate stage, the number of recurrent and continuous perseverations increases, and stuck-in-set perseverations emerge. CONCLUSION: The different types of perseveration are likely to reflect the progressive deterioration of different brain regions in AD.
