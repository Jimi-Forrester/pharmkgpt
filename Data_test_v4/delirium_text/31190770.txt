31190770|t|The value of screening for cognition, depression, and frailty in patients referred for TAVI.
31190770|a|Background: Current surgical risk assessment tools fall short of appreciating geriatric risk factors including cognitive deficits, depressive, and frailty symptoms that may worsen outcomes post-transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This study hypothesized that a screening tool, SMARTIE, would improve detection of these risks pre-TAVI, and thus be predictive of postoperative delirium (POD) and 30-day mortality post-TAVI. Design: Prospective observational cohort study, using a historical cohort for comparison. Participants: A total of 234 patients (age: 82.2+-6.7 years, 59.4% male) were included. Half were screened using SMARTIE. Methods: The SMARTIE cohort was assessed for cognitive deficits and depressive symptoms using the Mini-Cog test and PHQ-2, respectively. Measures of frailty included activities of daily living inventory, the Timed Up and Go test and grip strength. For the pre-SMARTIE cohort, we extracted cognitive deficits, depression and frailty symptoms from clinic charts. The incidence of POD and 30-day mortality were recorded. Bivariate chi-square analysis or t-tests were used to report associations between SMARTIE and pre-SMARTIE groups. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed to identify independent predictors of POD and 30-day mortality. Results: More patients were identified with cognitive deficits (chi2=11.73, p=0.001), depressive symptoms (chi2=8.15, p=0.004), and physical frailty (chi2=5.73, p=0.017) using SMARTIE. Cognitive deficits were an independent predictor of POD (OR: 8.4, p<0.01) and 30-day mortality (OR: 4.04, p=0.03). Conclusion: This study emphasized the value of screening for geriatric risk factors prior to TAVI by demonstrating that screening increased identification of at-risk patients. It also confirmed findings that cognitive deficits are predictive of POD and mortality following TAVI.
