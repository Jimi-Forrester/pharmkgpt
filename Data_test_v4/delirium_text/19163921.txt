19163921|a|The current paper presents details regarding the early developments of a memory prompt solution for persons with early dementia. Using everyday technology, in the form of a cell-phone, video reminders are delivered to assist with daily activities. The proposed CPVS system will permit carers to record and schedule video reminders remotely using a standard personal computer and web cam. It is the aim of the three year project that through the frequent delivery of helpful video reminders that a 'virtual carer' will be present with the person with dementia at all times. The first prototype of the system has been fully implemented with the first field trial scheduled to take place in May 2008. Initially, only three patient carer dyads will be involved, however, the second field trial aims to involve 30 dyads in the study. Details of the first prototype and the methods of evaluation are presented herein.
