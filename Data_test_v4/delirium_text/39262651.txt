39262651|t|Associations Between Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and Inflammation in Neurodegenerative Dementia: A Systematic Review.
39262651|a|Background: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in dementia and linked to adverse outcomes. Inflammation is increasingly recognized as playing a role as a driver of early disease progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. Inflammation has also been linked to primary psychiatric disorders, however its association with neuropsychiatric symptoms in neurodegenerative dementias remains uncertain. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review investigating associations between inflammation and neuropsychiatric symptoms in neurodegenerative dementias, including AD, Lewy body, Frontotemporal, Parkinson's (PD) and Huntington's disease dementias. Results: Ninety-nine studies met our inclusion criteria, and the majority (n = 59) investigated AD and/or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Thirty-five studies included PD, and only 6 investigated non-AD dementias. Inflammation was measured in blood, CSF, by genotype, brain tissue and PET imaging. Overall, studies exhibited considerable heterogeneity and evidence for specific inflammatory markers was inconsistent, with lack of replication and few longitudinal studies with repeat biomarkers. Depression was the most frequently investigated symptom. In AD, some studies reported increases in peripheral IL-6, TNF-a associated with depressive symptoms. Preliminary investigations using PET measures of microglial activation found an association with agitation. In PD, studies reported positive associations between TNF-a, IL-6, CRP, MCP-1, IL-10 and depression. Conclusion: Central and peripheral inflammation may play a role in neuropsychiatric symptoms in neurodegenerative dementias; however, the evidence is inconsistent. There is a need for multi-site longitudinal studies with detailed assessments of neuropsychiatric symptoms combined with replicable peripheral and central markers of inflammation.
