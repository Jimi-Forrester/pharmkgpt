30970926|t|Sialic Acid-Targeted Biointerface Materials and Bio-Applications.
30970926|a|Sialic acids (SAs) are typically found as terminal monosaccharides attached to cell surface glycoconjugates, which play crucial roles in various biological processes, and aberrant sialylation is closely associated with many diseases, particularly cancers. As SAs are overexpressed in tumor-associated glycoproteins, the recognition and specific binding of SA are crucial for monitoring, analyzing and controlling cancer cells, which would have a considerable impact on diagnostic and therapeutic application. However, both effective and selective recognition of SA on the cancer cell surface remains challenging. In recent years, SA-targeted biointerface materials have attracted great attention in various bio-applications, including cancer detection and imaging, drug delivery for cancer therapy and sialylated glycopeptide separation or enrichment. This review provides an overview of recent advances in SA-targeted biointerface materials and related bio-applications.
