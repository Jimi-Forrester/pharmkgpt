37931848|a|In Alzheimer disease (AD), amyloid precursor protein (APP) and production of amyloid beta (Abeta) which is generated by amyloidogenic pathway is implicated in neurotoxicity and neuronal cell deaths. However, physiological Abeta level is essential to improves neuronal survival, attenuates neuronal apoptosis and has neuroprotective effect. In addition, physiological APP level has neurotrophic effect on the central nervous system (CNS). APP has a critical role in the brain growth and development via activation of long-term potentiation (LTP) and acceleration of neurite outgrowth. Moreover, APP is cleaved by alpha secretase to form a neuroprotective soluble APP alpha (sAPPalpha) in non-amyloidogenic pathway. Consequently, this mini-review purposes to highlight the possible beneficial role of APP and Abeta. In addition, this mini-review discussed the modulation of APP processing and Abeta production.
