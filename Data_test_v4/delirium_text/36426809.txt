36426809|a|BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that the high-dose opioid requirement in patients carrying the rs4680-GG variant in the COMT gene encoding catechol-O-methyltransferase would be greater for patients taking morphine than for those taking oxycodone, thus providing a much-needed biomarker to inform opioid selection for cancer pain. METHODS: A randomized, multicenter, open-label trial was conducted at a Japanese hospital's palliative care service. Patients with cancer pain treated with regular doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or acetaminophen were enrolled and randomized (1:1) into morphine (group M) and oxycodone (group O) groups. The minimum standard dose of immediate-release (IR) oral opioids was repeatedly administered by palliative care physicians to achieve pain-reduction goals (Pain reduction >= 33% from baseline and up to <= 3 on a numerical rating scale). The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects requiring high-dose opioids on day 0 with the GG genotype. RESULTS: Of 140 participants who developed cancer-related pain among 378 subjects registered and pre-screened for the genotype, 139 were evaluated in the current study. Among patients carrying a COMT rs4680-GG genotype, 48.3% required high-dose opioids in group M, compared with the 20.0% in group O (95% CI, 3.7%-50.8%; P = .029). Of those with the non-GG genotype, 41.5% treated with morphine and 23.1% with oxycodone required high-dose opioids (95% CI, 3.3%-38.3%; P = 0.098). CONCLUSION: Using the COMT rs4680 genotype alone is not recommended for selecting between morphine and oxycodone for pain relief.
