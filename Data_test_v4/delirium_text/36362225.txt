36362225|t|The New Markers of Early Obesity-Related Organ and Metabolic Abnormalities.
36362225|a|The objective of our study was to identify new markers related to excessive body adiposity and its early consequences. For this purpose we determined serum FGF-19 and FGF-21 concentrations in obese rats, whose role in the pathogenesis of obesity is not yet established. In addition, a total reflection X-ray fluorescence technique was applied to determine the elemental chemistry of certain tissues affected by obesity. Next, the new biochemical and molecular parameters were correlated with well-known obesity-related markers of metabolic abnormalities. Our obese rats were characterized by increased calorie consumption and body adiposity, hypercholesterolemia, elevated levels of liver enzymes and FGF-21, while the level of FGF-19 was reduced. Strong relationships between new hormones and established metabolic parameters were observed. Furthermore, we demonstrated that obesity had the greatest effect on elemental composition in the adipose tissue and liver and that rubidium (Rb) had the highest importance in distinguishing the studied groups of animals. Tissue Rb strongly correlated with both well-known and new markers of obesity. In conclusion, we confirmed serum FGF-19 and FGF-21 as useful new markers of obesity-related metabolic alternations and we robustly propose Rb as a novel indicator of excessive body adiposity and its early consequences. However, further investigations are encouraged to address this clinical issue.
