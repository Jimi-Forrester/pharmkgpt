28974765|t|Identification of key regions and residues controlling Abeta folding and assembly.
28974765|a|Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) assembly is hypothesized to be a seminal neuropathologic event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used an unbiased D-amino acid substitution strategy to determine structure-assembly relationships of 76 different Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptides. We determined the effects of the substitutions on peptide oligomerization, secondary structure dynamics, fibril assembly dynamics, and fibril morphology. Our experiments revealed that the assembly of Abeta42 was more sensitive to chiral substitutions than was Abeta40 assembly. Substitutions at identical positions in the two peptides often, but not always, produced the same effects on assembly. Sites causing substantial effects in both Abeta40 and Abeta42 include His14, Gln15, Ala30, Ile31, Met35, and Val36. Sites whose effects were unique to Abeta40 include Lys16, Leu17, and Asn 27, whereas sites unique to Abeta42 include Phe20 and Ala21. These sites may be appropriate targets for therapeutic agents that inhibit or potentiate, respectively, these effects.
