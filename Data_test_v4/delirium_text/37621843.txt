37621843|a|Aim: The underlying pathological mechanisms of CNS human herpesvirus-7 (HHV-7) related infections are still unknown, especially among immunocompetent adults. Although HHV-7 meningitis in immunocompetent adults is usually uncommon, serious consideration for possible HHV-7 involvement should be taken when assessing CNS infection of unknown etiology. Case presentation: We report a 53-year-old female who presented for fever and progressive headaches. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was compatible with a viral meningitis. CSF cultures were negative and HHV-7 DNA was the only strain detected in the CSF analysis. The patient died 1 month later following complications and cardiac arrest. Conclusion: HHV-7 CNS infection in immunocompetent patient can be a serious infection. Prompt diagnosis and treatment management are essential for better outcome.
