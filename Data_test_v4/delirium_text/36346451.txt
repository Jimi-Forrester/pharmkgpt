36346451|a|Acute ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke account for significant disability and morbidity burdens worldwide. The myeloid arm of the peripheral innate immune system is critical in the immunological response to acute ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke. Neutrophils, monocytes, and dendritic cells (DC) contribute to the evolution of pathogenic local and systemic inflammation, whilst maintaining a critical role in ongoing immunity protecting against secondary infections. This review aims to summarise the key alterations to myeloid immunity in acute ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), and subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). By integrating clinical and preclinical research, we discover how myeloid immunity is affected across multiple organ systems including the brain, blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lung, and evaluate how these perturbations associate with real-world outcomes including infection. These findings are placed in the context of the rapidly developing field of human immunology, which offers a wealth of opportunity for further research.
