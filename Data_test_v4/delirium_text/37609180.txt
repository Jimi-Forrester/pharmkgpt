37609180|t|Brain Specific Estrogen Ameliorates Cognitive Effects of Surgical Menopause in Mice.
37609180|a|Menopause is a major endocrinological shift that leads to an increased vulnerability to the risk factors for cognitive impairment and dementia. This is thought to be due to the loss of circulating estrogens, which exert many potent neuroprotective effects in the brain. Systemic replacement of estrogen post-menopause has many limitations, including increased risk for estrogen-sensitive cancers. A more promising therapeutic approach therefore might be to deliver estrogen only to the brain thus limiting adverse peripheral side effects. We examined whether we could enhance cognitive performance by delivering estrogen exclusively to the brain in post-menopausal mice. We modeled surgical menopause via bilateral ovariectomy (OVX). We treated mice with the pro-drug 10beta,17beta-dihydroxyestra-1,4-dien-3-one (DHED), which can be administered systemically but is converted to 17beta-estradiol only in the brain. Young (2.5-month) and middle-aged (11-month-old) female C57BL/6J mice received ovariectomy and a subcutaneous implant containing vehicle (cholesterol) or DHED. At 3.5 months old (young group) and 14.5 months old (middle-aged group), mice underwent behavior testing to assess memory. DHED did not significantly alter metabolic status in middle-aged, post-menopausal mice. In both young and middle-aged mice, the brain-specific estrogen DHED improved spatial memory. Additional testing in middle-aged mice also showed that DHED improved working and recognition memory. These promising results lay the foundation for future studies aimed at determining if this intervention is as efficacious in models of dementia that have comorbid risk factors.
