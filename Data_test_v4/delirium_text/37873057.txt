37873057|a|Background: Spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is the most severe form of hemorrhagic stroke and accounts for 5-7% of all strokes. Several chemical enzymes and cytokines are thought to cause reactions that may affect the mortality and morbidity of SAH patients. This study aimed to examine the possible relationships between these parameters and the occurrence of SAH and the clinical-radiological parameters in patients with acute SAH. Methods: This study evaluated 44 patients, including 20 with SAH and 24 controls. We obtained blood from the patients and control groups, which was stored in heparinized tubes and used in determining tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), caspase-3, and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes. Results: TNF-alpha, BDNF, AChE, and BChE enzyme levels were not related to the Glasgow Coma scale (GCS) score in the patient group (p > 0.05), whereas higher enzyme levels of caspase-3 were associated with lower GCS scores (p < 0.05). The difference between the control and patient groups in terms of mean TNF-alpha levels was statistically significant (p < 0.01). The BDNF levels were statistically insignificant in the patient groups (p > 0.05). Caspase-3, AChE, and BChE levels were significantly different between the control and patient groups (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Our results may be valuable for predicting the prognosis, diagnosis, and follow-up of patients with SAH. However, further studies are required to elucidate the relationship between the clinical and radiological results in patients with SAH and certain enzymes, cytokines, and growth factors.
