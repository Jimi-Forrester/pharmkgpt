37656172|t|The myth of brain damage: no change of neurofilament light chain during transient cognitive side-effects of ECT.
37656172|a|Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective, safe, and mostly well-tolerated treatment for patients with severe or difficult to treat depression or psychotic disorders. However, a relevant number of patients experience subjective and/or objective cognitive side-effects. The mechanism of these transient deficits is not yet clear. Thus, our study prospectively investigated neurofilament light chain (NfL) concentrations as a highly sensitive biomarker for neuroaxonal damage along with cognitive performance during a course of ECT. Serum NfL concentrations from 15 patients with major depressive disorder receiving ECT were analyzed (1) 24 h before the first ECT, (2) 24 h and (3) 7 days after the last ECT (45 measurements in total). Neuropsychological testing including memory, executive functions and attention was performed at each time-point. NfL concentrations did not change between the three time-points, while a temporary cognitive impairment was found. Even in the subset of patients with the strongest impairment, NfL concentrations remained unchanged. Neuropsychological testing revealed the common pattern of transient cognitive side-effects with reduced performance 24 h post-ECT (global cognition score: p < 0.001; memory: p = 0.043; executive functions: p = 0.002) and return to baseline after 7 days (all p < 0.001). Our study adds to the evidence that neither ECT per se nor the transient cognitive side-effects seem to be associated with an increase of NfL as a marker of neuroaxonal damage. In contrast, we discuss cognitive side effects to be potentially interpreted as a byproduct of ECT's neuroplastic effects.
