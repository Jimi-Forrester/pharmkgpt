37008058|t|Strategies for the Emergency Treatment of Pregnant Women with Neurological Symptoms during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
37008058|a|Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has been spreading all over the world for more than two years. Though several kinds of vaccines are currently available, emergence of new variants, spike mutations and immune escape have raised new challenges. Pregnant women are vulnerable to respiratory infections due to their altered immune defence and surveillance functions. Besides, whether pregnant persons should receive a COVID-19 vaccine is still under debate because limited data are available on the efficacy and safety of receiving a vaccine during pregnancy. Physiological features and lack of effective protection making pregnant women at high risk of getting infected. Another concern is that pregnancy may trigger the onset of underlying existing neurological disease, which is highly similar to those neurological symptoms of pregnant women caused by COVID-19. These similarities interfere with diagnosis and delay timely and effective management. Therefore, providing efficient emergency support for pregnant women suffering from neurological symptoms caused by COVID-19 remains a challenge among neurologists and obstetricians. To improve the diagnosis and treatment efficiency of pregnant women with neurological symptoms, we propose an emergency management framework based on the clinicians' experience and available resources. This emergency care system aimed at addressing the conundrums faced by the emergency guarantee system under COVID-19 pandemic and could serve as a potential multisystem project for clinical practice and medical education.
