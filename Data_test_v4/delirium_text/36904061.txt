36904061|a|The aim of this research was to identify and quantify biologically active compounds from avocado (Persea americana L.) seeds (AS) utilizing different techniques with the use of ultrasound (US), ethanol (EtOH), and supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) for possible applications in (bio)medicine, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, or other relevant industries. Initially, a study of the process efficiency (eta) was carried out, which revealed yields in the range of 2.96-12.11 wt%. The sample obtained using scCO2 was found to be the richest in total phenols (TPC) and total proteins (PC), while the sample obtained with the use of EtOH resulted in the highest content of proanthocyanidins (PAC). Phytochemical screening of AS samples, quantified by the HPLC method, indicated the presence of 14 specific phenolic compounds. In addition, the activity of the selected enzymes (cellulase, lipase, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, protease, transglutaminase, and superoxide dismutase) was quantified for the first time in the samples from AS. Using DPPH radical scavenging activity, the highest antioxidant potential (67.49%) was detected in the sample obtained with EtOH. The antimicrobial activity was studied using disc diffusion method against 15 microorganisms. Additionally, for the first time, the antimicrobial effectiveness of AS extract was quantified by determination of microbial growth-inhibition rates (MGIRs) at different concentrations of AS extract against three strains of Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas fluorescens) bacteria, three strains of Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacteria, and fungi (Candida albicans). MGIRs and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC90) values were determined after 8 and 24 h of incubation, thus enabling the screening of antimicrobial efficacy for possible further applications of AS extracts as antimicrobial agents in (bio)medicine, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, or other industries. For example, the lowest MIC90 value was determined for B. cereus after 8 h of incubation in the case of UE and SFE extracts (70 mug/mL), indicating an outstanding result and the potential of AS extracts, as the MIC values for B. cereus have not been investigated so far.
