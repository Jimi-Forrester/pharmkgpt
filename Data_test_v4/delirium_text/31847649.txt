31847649|a|Objective: Recent extensive evidence suggests that the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is closely implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, no relative data exist regarding vascular dementia (VD). This study aimed to investigate the association between serum soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) and vascular dementia in Chinese Han population.Methods: A total of 120 VD patients and 120 cognitively normal controls matched for age and gender were enrolled for this study. Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded at admission. Cognitive functions were assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and serum sTREM2 levels were detected using sandwich ELISA method.Results: Demographic and clinical characteristics did not differ dramatically between groups. Serum sTREM2 levels in VD patients are significantly decreased compared with normal controls. In VD patients, the serum sTREM2 levels were positively correlated with MMSE scores (r = 0.387, p = 0.008), and the association was independent of demographic and clinical characteristics (beta = 0.396, p < 0.001).Conclusion: VD patients have significantly lower serum sTREM2 levels in comparison to normal controls. Serum sTREM2 levels may be used as a potential predictive biomarker of cognitive decline in VD.
