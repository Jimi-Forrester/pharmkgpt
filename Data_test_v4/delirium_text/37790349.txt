37790349|a|Women are the main target of intimate partner violence (IPV), which is escalating worldwide. Mechanisms subtending IPV-related disorders, such as anxiety, depression and PTSD, remain unclear. We employed a mouse model molded on an IPV scenario (male vs. female prolonged violent interaction) to unearth the neuroendocrine alterations triggered by an aggressive male mouse on the female murine brain. Experimental IPV (EIPV) prompted marked anxiety-like behavior in young female mice, coincident with high circulating/cerebral corticosterone levels. The hippocampus of EIPV-inflicted female animals displayed neuronal loss, reduced BrdU-DCX-positive nuclei, decreased mature DCX-positive cells, and diminished dendritic arborization level in the dentate gyrus (DG), features denoting impaired neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation. These hallmarks were associated with marked down-regulation of estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) density in the hippocampus, especially in the DG and dependent prosurvival ERK signaling. Conversely, ERalpha expression was unchanged. After EIPV, the DG harbored lowered local BDNF pools, diminished TrkB phosphorylation, and elevated glucocorticoid receptor phosphorylation. In unison, ERbeta KO mice had heightened anxiety-like behavior and curtailed BDNF levels at baseline, despite enhanced circulating estradiol levels, while dying prematurely during EIPV. Thus, reiterated male-to-female violence jeopardizes hippocampal homeostasis in the female brain, perturbing ERbeta/BDNF signaling, thus instigating anxiety and chronic stress.
