32246645|a|Schwann cell proliferation, migration and remyelination of regenerating axons contribute to regeneration after peripheral nervous system injury. Lithium promotes remyelination by Schwann cells and improves peripheral nerve regeneration. However, whether lithium modulates other phenotypes of Schwann cells, especially their proliferation and migration remains elusive. In the current study, primary Schwann cells from rat sciatic nerve stumps were cultured and exposed to 0, 5, 10, 15, or 30 mM lithium chloride (LiCl) for 24 hours. The effects of LiCl on Schwann cell proliferation and migration were examined using the Cell Counting Kit-8, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, Transwell and wound healing assays. Cell Counting Kit-8 and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assays showed that 5, 10, 15, and 30 mM LiCl significantly increased the viability and proliferation rate of Schwann cells. Transwell-based migration assays and wound healing assays showed that 10, 15, and 30 mM LiCl suppressed the migratory ability of Schwann cells. Furthermore, the effects of LiCl on the proliferation and migration phenotypes of Schwann cells were mostly dose-dependent. These data indicate that lithium treatment significantly promotes the proliferation and inhibits the migratory ability of Schwann cells. This conclusion will inform strategies to promote the repair and regeneration of peripheral nerves. All of the animal experiments in this study were ethically approved by the Administration Committee of Experimental Animal Center of Nantong University, China (approval No. 20170320-017) on March 2, 2017.
