32711124|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research is to identify the stage of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients through the use of mobility data and deep learning models. This process facilitates the monitoring of the disease and allows actions to be taken in order to provide the optimal treatment and the prevention of complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed data from 35 patients with AD collected by smartphones for a week in a daycare center. The data sequences of each patient recorded the accelerometer changes while daily activities were performed and they were labeled with the stage of the disease (early, middle or late). Our methodology processes these time series and uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to recognize the patterns that identify each stage. RESULTS: The CNN-based method achieved a 90.91% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.897, greatly improving the results obtained by the traditional feature-based classifiers. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In our research, we show that mobility data can be a valuable resource for the treatment of patients with AD as well as to study the progress of the disease. The use of our CNN-based method improves the accuracy of the identification of AD stages in comparison to common supervised learning models.
