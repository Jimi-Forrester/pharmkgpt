39470483|a|Liver failure is a metabolic disorder caused by a variety of mixed factors. For such diseases, adopting cluster care can effectively improve the relevant symptoms of patients. To explore the nursing effect of nutritional nursing combined with clustered nursing for patients with severe liver failure. A total of 129 patients with severe liver failure were selected as retrospective study subjects. Nine cases were due to an end event, such as death. The other patients were divided into control group and observation group according to different nursing methods. Among them, the control group adopted nutrition nursing, and the observation group implemented cluster nursing on this basis. The differences of liver function, anxiety and depression score, gastrointestinal recovery, nutritional status, and sleep quality were compared between the 2 groups before and after nursing. After nursing, the total bilirubin, albumin, and aspartate aminotransferase of the observation group were significantly higher than those of the control group (P < .05). The nursing staff used Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale of the observation group, which were slightly lower than those of the control group. The difference was statistically significant after testing (P < .05). After nursing, the observation group's upper arm circumference, brachial tri-scalp fold thickness, and hemoglobin were better than those of the control group. Statistics showed that the difference was statistically significant (P < .05). The depth of sleep, time to fall asleep, number of awakenings, time to fall asleep after awakening, overall sleep quality, and intensive care unit environmental noise intensity in the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire sleep scale after nursing in the 2 groups were significantly higher than those before nursing, and the scores of the observation group were significantly lower than those in the observation group. In the control group, this difference was statistically significant (P < .05). Nutritional nursing combined with clustered nursing can effectively promote the recovery of gastrointestinal function in patients with severe liver failure.
