33202634|t|Oral Nutrition during and after Critical Illness: SPICES for Quality of Care!
33202634|a|Malnutrition is associated to poor outcomes in critically ill patients. Oral nutrition is the route of feeding in less than half of the patients during the intensive care unit (ICU) stay and in the majority of ICU survivors. There are growing data indicating that insufficient and/or inadequate intakes in macronutrients and micronutrients are prevalent within these populations. The present narrative review focuses on barriers to food intakes and considers the different points that should be addressed in order to optimize oral intakes, both during and after ICU stay. They are gathered in the SPICES concept, which should help ICU teams improve the quality of nutrition care following 5 themes: swallowing disorders screening and management, patient global status overview, involvement of dieticians and nutritionists, clinical evaluation of nutritional intakes and outcomes, and finally, supplementation in macro-or micronutrients.
