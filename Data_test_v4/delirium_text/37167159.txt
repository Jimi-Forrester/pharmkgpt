37167159|a|AIM: To assess the effect of pandemic COVID-19 on the course of STEMI patients of the Regional Vascular Center in 2020, compared with the previous year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with acute coronary syndrome and, in particular, STEMI hospitalized at Regional Vascular Center in 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: In 2019, 981 patients with STEMI were admitted; in 2020 - 728 patients. The baseline clinical and demographic patients characteristics did not differ significantly. In 2020, the number of pneumonia has doubled, the number of mechanical ventilator support has increased by 20%; sepsis was diagnosed 5 times more often. However, patients in 2020 were less likely to develop delirium, minor and major bleeding. There were more patients admitted in the 1st day of the disease, and they were more frequently performed both primary angioplasty and angioplasty in general. Patients with STEMI in 2020 had more frequently registered pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock and re-infarction. Lethality in the group of patients without angioplasty tended to be higher in 2020 compared with the previous year. None of 30 patients with COVID-19 died in our department, they were timely transferred either to COVID-hospital or to outpatient follow-up care. When analyzing various parameters during the spring and autumn periods, which were the peak periods for pneumonias in 2020, only mortality had a clear upward trend. CONCLUSION: The patient portrait of myocardial infarction in 2020 was dominated by pneumonia, sepsis, and re-infarction compared with the previous year. An upward trend in mortality was detected in those without angioplasty and those hospitalized in the spring and autumn wave of COVID-19. We believe that there are hidden mechanisms of pandemic effect on mortality in STEMI.
