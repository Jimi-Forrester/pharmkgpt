33500383|a|D-Serine acts as a co-agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) which appear overactivated in AD, while D-aspartate is a modulatory molecule acting on NMDAR as a second agonist. The aim of this work is to clarify whether the levels of these D-amino acids in serum are deregulated in AD, with the final goal to identify novel and precocious biomarkers in AD. Serum levels of L- and D-enantiomers of serine and aspartate were determined by HPLC using a pre-column derivatization procedure and a selective enzymatic degradation. Experimental data obtained from age-matched healthy subjects (HS) and AD patients were statistically evaluated by considering age, gender, and disease progression, and compared. Minor changes were apparent in the serum L- and D-aspartate levels in AD patients compared to HS. A positive correlation for the D-serine level and age was apparent in the AD cohort. Notably, the serum D-serine level and the D-/total serine ratio significantly increased with the progression of the disease. Gender seems to have a minor effect on the levels of all analytes tested. This work proposes that the serum D-serine level and D-/total serine ratio values as novel and valuable biomarkers for the progression of AD: the latter parameter allows to discriminate CDR 2 and CDR 1 patients from healthy (CDR 0) individuals.
