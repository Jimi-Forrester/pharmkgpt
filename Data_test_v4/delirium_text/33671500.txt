33671500|t|Regenerative Stem Cell Therapy for Neurodegenerative Diseases: An Overview.
33671500|a|Neurodegenerative diseases resulting from the progressive loss of structure and/or function of neurons contribute to different paralysis degrees and loss of cognition and sensation. The lack of successful curative therapies for neurodegenerative disorders leads to a considerable burden on society and a high economic impact. Over the past 20 years, regenerative cell therapy, also known as stem cell therapy, has provided an excellent opportunity to investigate potentially powerful innovative strategies for treating neurodegenerative diseases. This is due to stem cells' capability to repair injured neuronal tissue by replacing the damaged or lost cells with differentiated cells, providing a conducive environment that is in favor of regeneration, or protecting the existing healthy neurons and glial cells from further damage. Thus, in this review, the various types of stem cells, the current knowledge of stem-cell-based therapies in neurodegenerative diseases, and the recent advances in this field are summarized. Indeed, a better understanding and further studies of stem cell technologies cause progress into realistic and efficacious treatments of neurodegenerative disorders.
