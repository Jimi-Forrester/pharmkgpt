38474009|a|The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex non-cellular three-dimensional macromolecular network present within all tissues and organs, forming the foundation on which cells sit, and composed of proteins (such as collagen), glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, minerals, and water. The ECM provides a fundamental framework for the cellular constituents of tissue and biochemical support to surrounding cells. The ECM is a highly dynamic structure that is constantly being remodeled. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are among the most important proteolytic enzymes of the ECM and are capable of degrading all ECM molecules. MMPs play a relevant role in physiological as well as pathological processes; MMPs participate in embryogenesis, morphogenesis, wound healing, and tissue remodeling, and therefore, their impaired activity may result in several problems. MMP activity is also associated with chronic inflammation, tissue breakdown, fibrosis, and cancer invasion and metastasis. The periodontium is a unique anatomical site, composed of a variety of connective tissues, created by the ECM. During periodontitis, a chronic inflammation affecting the periodontium, increased presence and activity of MMPs is observed, resulting in irreversible losses of periodontal tissues. MMP expression and activity may be controlled in various ways, one of which is the inhibition of their activity by an endogenous group of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), as well as reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK).
