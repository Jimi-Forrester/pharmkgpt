38965205|t|Epigenetic signals associated with delirium replicated across four independent cohorts.
38965205|a|Delirium is risky and indicates poor outcomes for patients. Therefore, it is crucial to create an effective delirium detection method. However, the epigenetic pathophysiology of delirium remains largely unknown. We aimed to discover reliable and replicable epigenetic (DNA methylation: DNAm) markers that are associated with delirium including post-operative delirium (POD) in blood obtained from patients among four independent cohorts. Blood DNA from four independent cohorts (two inpatient cohorts and two surgery cohorts; 16 to 88 patients each) were analyzed using the Illumina EPIC array platform for genome-wide DNAm analysis. We examined DNAm differences in blood between patients with and without delirium including POD. When we compared top CpG sites previously identified from the initial inpatient cohort with three additional cohorts (one inpatient and two surgery cohorts), 11 of the top 13 CpG sites showed statistically significant differences in DNAm values between the delirium group and non-delirium group in the same directions as found in the initial cohort. This study demonstrated the potential value of epigenetic biomarkers as future diagnostic tools. Furthermore, our findings provide additional evidence of the potential role of epigenetics in the pathophysiology of delirium including POD.
