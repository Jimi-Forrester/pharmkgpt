23768700|a|Increases in the generation of reactive oxygen species and decreases in antioxidant enzyme activities with aging have been reported in the prostate, and are also observed in age-related disorders such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and cataracts. Several studies have demonstrated that proteins are targets for reactive oxidants in cells, and that oxidized proteins accumulate during aging, oxidative stress and in some pathological conditions. However, only a limited number of studies have actually evaluated oxidative damage in relation to HDL-cholesterol-associated antioxidant enzyme activities or have assessed its relationship with prostate cancer. In this study, we examined the effect of HDL-cholesterol-associated antioxidant enzyme activities, paraoxonase1, arylesterase and new oxidative stress parameters (total oxidant status, total antioxidant status [and oxidative stress index]) in newly-diagnosed prostate cancer patients and healthy controls. There were no significant differences in oxidative stress parameters and lipid parameters between prostate cancer patients and controls, however, paraoxonase1 enzyme activity, and non-HDL-cholesterol levels were higher in prostate cancer patients than controls. The results of this study were derived from a small number of subjects, but might represent an important working hypothesis for further research in a larger number of cases to clarify the role of paraoxonase1 overproduction on the prostate and its clinical relevance.
