36421346|t|Outcome of Hospitalized Cancer Patients with Hypernatremia: A Retrospective Case-Control Study.
36421346|a|Hypernatremia (>145 mmol/L) is a relatively rare event, and the data regarding its role in the outcome of inpatients on an oncology ward are weak. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence, prognosis, and outcome of hospitalized cancer patients with hypernatremia. We performed a retrospective case-control study of data obtained from inpatients with a solid tumor at the St. Claraspital, Basel, Switzerland, who were admitted between 2017 and 2020. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Hypernatremia was found in 93 (3.16%) of 2945 inpatients bearing cancer or lymphoma. From 991 eligible normonatremic control patients, 93 were matched according to diagnosis, age, and sex. The median overall survival time (OS) of patients with hypernatremia was 1.5 months compared to 11.7 months of the normonatremic controls (HR 2.69, 95% CI 1.85-3.90, p < 0.0001). OS of patients with irreversible compared to reversible hypernatremia was significantly shorter (23 versus 88 days, HR 4.0, 95% CI 2.04-7.70, p < 0.0001). The length of hospital stay was significantly longer for the hypernatremic than for the normonatremic group (p < 0.0001). Significantly more patients with hypernatremia died in the hospital (30.1% versus 8.6%, p < 0.001). These results suggest hypernatremia to be associated with an unfavorable outcome and a very short OS.
