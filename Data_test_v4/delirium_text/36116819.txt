36116819|t|Extracorporeal Life Support in Respiratory Failure.
36116819|a|Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) has a role in different types of respiratory failure including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), decompensated pulmonary hypertension, bridge to lung transplantation, and primary graft dysfunction after lung transplantation. ECLS in ARDS allows for lung-protective ventilation with the goal to reduce the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury. ECLS use in severe ARDS should be considered when conventional management strategies are not sufficient to safely support gas exchange. More research is needed to identify optimal mechanical ventilation during ECLS, weaning ECLS support, strategies for mobilization, sedation and anticoagulation, and long-term outcomes post-ECLS.
