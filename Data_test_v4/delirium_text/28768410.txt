28768410|t|Synthesis, Characterization, and Activity of a Triazine Bridged Antioxidant Small Molecule.
28768410|a|Metal-ion misregulation and oxidative stress continue to be components of the continually evolving hypothesis describing the molecular origins of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, these features are viable targets for synthetic chemists to explore through hybridizations of metal-binding ligands and antioxidant units. To date, the metal-binding unit in potential therapeutic small molecules has largely been inspired by clioquinol with the exception of a handful of heterocyclic small molecules and open-chain systems. Heterocyclic small molecules such as cyclen (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane) have the advantage of straightforward N-based modifications, allowing the addition of functional groups. In this work, we report the synthesis of a triazine bridged system containing two cyclen metal-binding units and an antioxidant coumarin appendage inspired by nature. This new potential therapeutic molecule shows the ability to bind copper in a unique manner compared to other chelates proposed to treat Alzheimer's disease. DPPH and TEAC assays exploring the activity of N-(2-((4,6-di(1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecan-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)amino)ethyl)-2-oxo-2H-chromene-3-carboxamide (molecule 1) show that the molecule is antioxidant. Cellular studies of molecule 1 indicate a low toxicity (EC50 = 80 muM) and the ability to protect HT-22 neuronal cells from cell death induced by Abeta + copper(II), thus demonstrating the potential for molecule 1 to serve as a multimodal therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease.
