36830938|a|Gastrointestinal problems are among the most common health problems which can acutely affect the healthy population and chronically involve health risks, seriously affecting the quality of life. Identifying the risk of gastrointestinal diseases in the early phase by indirect methods can increase the healing rate and the quality of life.: The proposal of this study is to verify a correlation between gastrointestinal and periodontal problems and the risk of inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases (IBD). The study was conducted on 123 people who were observed to have gastrointestinal and psychological problems. The participants were divided into three groups, depending on each one's diagnosis. The control group (CG) was composed of 37 people who did not fit either irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) according to the ROME IV criteria, nor were inflammatory markers positive for IBD. Group 2 (IBS) was composed of 44 participants diagnosed with IBS according to the ROME IV criteria. Group 3 was composed of 42 participants who were diagnosed with IBD. All study participants underwent anthropometric, micro-Ident, and quality of life tests. A directly proportional relationship of the presence of bacteria with IBD patients with the exception of Capnocytophaga spp. and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was observed. These two bacteria correlated significantly with IBS. Follow-up of the study participants will help determine whether periodontal disease can be used as an indicator of severe colorectal disease. In addition, this study should be continued especially in the case of IBD more thoroughly to follow and reduce the risk of malignancy.
