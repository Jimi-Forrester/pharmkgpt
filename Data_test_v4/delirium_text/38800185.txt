38800185|t|Missing Renal Stone Diagnosis in Dementia Patients With Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections: A Case Report and Literature Review.
38800185|a|In older adults, diagnosing, treating, and preventing urinary tract infections (UTIs) can be challenging. This case is of an 82-year-old female of white descent, who was admitted to a post-acute care facility following hospitalization for delirium and a UTI. Hypoactive delirium may be the only clinical manifestation of recurrent UTI. Due to challenges in obtaining a history from this patient with dementia, she had to be admitted multiple times for sepsis. During her final hospitalization, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was ordered, which revealed an obstructed kidney stone as the cause of her recurrent UTIs. Recurrent UTIs especially in patients with dementia should prompt further imaging to look for kidney stones. Factors like dehydration and poor oral intake are risk factors for kidney stones, which patients with dementia are susceptible to.
