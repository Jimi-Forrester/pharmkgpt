39808341|a|Neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction are early events in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and contribute to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Evidence suggests that the inflammatory axis mediated by macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) binding to its receptor, CD74, plays an important role in many central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as AD. Our group has developed DRhQ, a novel CD74 binding construct which competitively inhibits MIF binding, blocks macrophage activation and migration into the CNS, enhances anti-inflammatory microglia cell numbers and reduces pro-inflammatory gene expression. Here, we evaluate its effects in amyloid-beta (Abeta) overexpressing mice. 5xFAD mice and their wild type littermates were treated with DRhQ (100 microg) or vehicle for 4 weeks. DRhQ improved cognition and cortical mitochondrial function in both male and female 5xFAD mice. Abeta plaque burden in 5xFAD animals was not robustly impacted by DRhQ treatment in either the hippocampus or the cortex. Cortical microglial activation was similarly not apparently affected by DRhQ treatment, although in the hippocampus there was evidence of a reduction in activated microglia for female 5xFAD mice. Future studies are needed to confirm this possible sex-dependent response on microglial activation, as well as to optimize the dose and timing of DRhQ treatment and gain a better understanding of its mechanism of action in AD.
