29793530|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid-beta (Abeta) immunotherapy is one of the most promising disease-modifying strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite recent progress targeting aggregated forms of Abeta, low antibody brain penetrance remains a challenge. In the present study, we used transferrin receptor (TfR)-mediated transcytosis to facilitate brain uptake of our previously developed Abeta protofibril-selective mAb158, with the aim of increasing the efficacy of immunotherapy directed toward soluble Abeta protofibrils. METHODS: Abeta protein precursor (AbetaPP)-transgenic mice (tg-ArcSwe) were given a single dose of mAb158, modified for TfR-mediated transcytosis (RmAb158-scFv8D3), in comparison with an equimolar dose or a tenfold higher dose of unmodified recombinant mAb158 (RmAb158). Soluble Abeta protofibrils and total Abeta in the brain were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Brain distribution of radiolabeled antibodies was visualized by positron emission tomography (PET) and ex vivo autoradiography. RESULTS: ELISA analysis of Tris-buffered saline brain extracts demonstrated a 40% reduction of soluble Abeta protofibrils in both RmAb158-scFv8D3- and high-dose RmAb158-treated mice, whereas there was no Abeta protofibril reduction in mice treated with a low dose of RmAb158. Further, ex vivo autoradiography and PET imaging revealed different brain distribution patterns of RmAb158-scFv8D3 and RmAb158, suggesting that these antibodies may affect Abeta levels by different mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: With a combination of biochemical and imaging analyses, this study demonstrates that antibodies engineered to be transported across the blood-brain barrier can be used to increase the efficacy of Abeta immunotherapy. This strategy may allow for decreased antibody doses and thereby reduced side effects and treatment costs.
