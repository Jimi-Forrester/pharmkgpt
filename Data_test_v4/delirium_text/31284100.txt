31284100|t|The green synthesis and molecular docking of novel N-substituted rhodanines as effective inhibitors for carbonic anhydrase and acetylcholinesterase enzymes.
31284100|a|Recently, inhibition effects of enzymes such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and carbonic anhydrase (CA) has appeared as a promising approach for pharmacological intervention in a variety of disorders such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease and obesity. For this purpose, novel N-substituted rhodanine derivatives (RhAs) were synthesized by a green synthetic approach over one-pot reaction. Following synthesis the novel compounds, RhAs derivatives were tested against AChE and cytosolic carbonic anhydrase I, and II (hCAs I, and II) isoforms. As a result of this study, inhibition constant (Ki) were found in the range of 66.35 +- 8.35 to 141.92 +- 12.63 nM for AChE, 43.55 +- 14.20 to 89.44 +- 24.77 nM for hCA I, and 16.97 +- 1.42 to 64.57 +- 13.27 nM for hCA II, respectively. Binding energies were calculated with docking studies as -5.969, -5.981, and -9.121 kcal/mol for hCA I, hCA II, and AChE, respectively.
