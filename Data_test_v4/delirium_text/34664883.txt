34664883|a|ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study is to investigate the predictive factors of home discharge for rehabilitation patients with cancer bone metastasis.Cancer patients with bone metastasis who underwent rehabilitation between April 2014 and March 2017 were retrospectively enrolled. Data on discharge destination were collected from medical records as outcomes. Multiple regression analyses were carried out to investigate the predictive factors of home discharge.Ninety-eight patients (mean age: 68.6 years, 42 females and 56 males) were included. Fifty patients were discharged home, 38 patients were discharged to other facilities, and 10 patients died. There were no skeletal-related events among these patients during their hospital stay. The receiver-operating curve for the predictive factors for home discharge of the Barthel Index at admission, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status at admission, and number of immediate family members living at home were 60 points (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.74, sensitivity = 0.6400, 1-specificity = 0.2766), 2 score (AUC = 0.65, sensitivity = 0.5400, 1-specificity = 0.2222), and 1 family member (AUC = 0.65, sensitivity = 0.9592, 1-specificity = 0.7222), respectively.In order to plan for cancer patients with bone metastasis to be discharged home, it is important to take into consideration the patients' Barthel Index and Performance Status at the time of hospital admission and the number of immediate family members living at home.
