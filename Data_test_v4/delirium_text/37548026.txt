37548026|a|BACKGROUND: Persons living with dementia (PLWD) experience high rates of hospitalization and rehospitalization, exposing them to added risk for adverse outcomes including delirium, hastened cognitive decline, and death. Hospitalizations can also increase family caregiver strain. Despite disparities in care quality surrounding hospitalizations for PLWD, and evidence suggesting that exposure to neighborhood-level disadvantage increases these inequities, experiences with hospitalization among PLWD and family caregivers exposed to greater levels of neighborhood disadvantage are poorly understood. This study examined family caregiver perspectives and experiences of hospitalizations among PLWD in the context of high neighborhood-level disadvantage. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Stakeholders Understanding of Prevention Protection and Opportunities to Reduce HospiTalizations (SUPPORT) study, an in-depth, multisite qualitative study examining hospitalization and rehospitalization of PLWD in the context of high neighborhood disadvantage, to identify caregiver perspectives and experiences of in-hospital care. Data were analyzed using rapid identification of themes; duplicate transcript review was used to enhance rigor. RESULTS: Data from N = 54 individuals (47 individual interviews, 2 focus groups with 7 individuals) were analyzed. Sixty-three percent of participants identified as Black/African American, 35% as non-Hispanic White, and 2% declined to report. Caregivers' experiences were largely characterized by PLWD receiving suboptimal care that caregivers viewed as influenced by system pressures and inadequate workforce competencies, leading to communication breakdowns and strain. Caregivers described poor collaboration between clinicians and caregivers with regard to in-hospital care delivery, including transitional care. Caregivers also highlighted the lack of person-focused care and the exclusion of the PLWD from care. CONCLUSIONS: Caregiver perspectives highlight opportunities for improving hospital care for PLWD in the context of neighborhood disadvantage and recognition of broader issues in care structure that limit their capacity to be actively involved in care. Further work should examine and develop strategies to improve caregiver integration during hospitalizations across diverse contexts.
