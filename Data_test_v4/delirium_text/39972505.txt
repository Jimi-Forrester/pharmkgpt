39972505|t|Safety and effectiveness of inhaled sedation in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
39972505|a|BACKGROUND: Sedation is a landmark treatment in the intensive care unit; however, the disadvantages of intravenous sedative drugs are increasingly prominent. Volatile sedation is becoming increasingly popular in ICUs due to fewer technical issues with the development of anaesthesia reflectors. OBJECTIVE: To explore the safety and effectiveness of inhaled sedation in critically ill patients. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for all randomized trials comparing awakening and extubation times, ICU length of stay, and side effects of different inhaled sedative drugs using an anaesthetic-conserving device (ACD) with intravenous sedation. SELECTION CRITERIA: The inclusion criteria were formulated in accordance with the PICOS: P, use of sedatives after admission to the ICU, aged > 18 years; I, intravenous sedatives; C, use of volatile sedatives (heptafluoride, sevoflurane, isoflurane, or desflurane) by AnaConDa or Mirus reflector; O, at least one primary outcome (awakening time, extubation time, ICU length of stay) or secondary outcome (postoperative nausea and vomiting, PONV) or incidence of delirium was reported; and S, RCT. The extubation time was defined as time from ICU admission to extubation. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two researchers independently conducted literature screening, data extraction, and literature quality evaluation and reached a consensus after cross-checking. MAIN RESULTS: Fifteen trials with a total of 1185 patients were included, including 568 in the inhaled sedation group and 617 in the intravenous sedation group. Compared with intravenous sedation, inhaled sedation administered through an ACD shortened the awakening time and extubation time. There were no differences in the occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Inhaled sedation has advantages over intravenous sedation in terms of awakening time, extubation time, and ICU LOS (non-cardiac ICU); however, there is no significant difference in the incidence of PONV. Inhaled sedation may be safe and effective for critically ill patients.
