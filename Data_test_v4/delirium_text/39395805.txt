39395805|a|Elucidating the intricate molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires a multidimensional analysis incorporating various omics data. In this study, we employed transcriptome and proteome profiling of AppNL-G-F, a human APP knock-in model of amyloidosis, at the early and mid-stages of amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology to delineate the impacts of Abeta deposition on brain cells. By contrasting AppNL-G-F mice with TREM2 (Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) knockout models, our study further investigates the role of TREM2, a well-known AD risk gene, in influencing microglial responses to Abeta pathology. Our results highlight altered microglial states as a central feature of Abeta pathology, characterized by the significant upregulation of microglia-specific genes related to immune responses such as complement system and antigen presentation, and catabolic pathways such as phagosome formation and lysosome biogenesis. The absence of TREM2 markedly diminishes the induction of these genes, impairs Abeta clearance, and exacerbates dystrophic neurite formation. Importantly, TREM2 is required for the microglial engagement with Abeta plaques and the formation of compact Abeta plaque cores. Furthermore, this study reveals substantial disruptions in energy metabolism and protein synthesis, signaling a shift from anabolism to catabolism in response to Abeta deposition. This metabolic alteration, coupled with a decrease in synaptic protein abundance, occurs independently of TREM2, suggesting the direct effects of Abeta deposition on synaptic integrity and plasticity. In summary, our findings demonstrate altered microglial states and metabolic disruption following Abeta deposition, offering mechanistic insights into Abeta pathology and highlighting the potential of targeting these pathways in AD therapy.
