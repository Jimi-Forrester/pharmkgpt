29995978|a|Recent studies have proposed that microRNAs (miR) function as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a common disease among the elderly. In the current study, we aim to explore the effect of miR-186 on oxidative stress injury of neuron in rat models of AD with the involvement of the interleukin-2 (IL2) and the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathways. AD rat models were established, and dual-luciferase reporter assay and online software were used to confirm the targeting relationship between miR-186 and IL2. Immunohistochemistry was used evaluating the positive rate of IL2. Afterward, to define the role of miR-186 in AD, miR-186, IL2, and JAK-STAT related protein (JAK2, STAT3) expressions were quantified. Cell proliferation was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, and cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. We observed downregulated miR-186 and IL2 and upregulated JAK-STAT signaling pathway related genes in AD. The overexpression of miR-186 was shown to significantly promote cell proliferation while suppressing cell apoptosis along with the expression of the IL2 and JAK-STAT signaling pathway related protein. Collectively, the key findings obtained from the current study define the potential role of miR-186 as an inhibitor of AD development by downregulation of IL2 through suppression of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.
