35358850|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and is associated with the accumulation of amyloid peptide beta in the brain parenchyma. Vascular damage and microvascular thrombosis contribute to the neuronal degeneration and the loss of brain function typical of this disease. In this study, we utilised a murine model of Alzheimer's disease to evaluate the neurovascular effects of this disease. Upon detection of an increase in the phosphorylation of the endothelial surface receptor VE-cadherin, we focused our attention on endothelial cells and utilised two types of human endothelial cells cultured in vitro: 1) human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and 2) human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs). Using an electrical current impedance system (ECIS) and FITC-albumin permeability assays, we discovered that the treatment of human endothelial cells with amyloid peptide beta causes a loss in their barrier function, which is oxidative stress-dependent and similarly to our observation in mouse brain associates with VE-cadherin phosphorylation. The activation of the superoxide anion-generating enzyme NADPH oxidase 1 is responsible for the oxidative stress that leads to the disruption of barrier function in human endothelial cells in vitro. In summary, we have identified a novel molecular mechanism explaining how the accumulation of amyloid peptide beta in the brain parenchyma may induce the loss of neurovascular barrier function, which has been observed in patients. Neurovascular leakiness plays an important role in brain inflammation and neuronal degeneration driving the progression of the Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, this study provides a novel and promising target for the development of a pharmacological treatment to protect neurovascular function and reduce the progression of the neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's patients.
