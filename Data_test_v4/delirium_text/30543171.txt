30543171|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder in a central nervous system seen. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the miR-107 in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology through regulating SYK and NF-kappaB signaling pathway. METHOD: Bioinformatics analysis was performed to screen NF-kappaB signaling pathway and differentially expressed genes. The target relationship between miR-107 and SYK was verified by dual luciferase assay. QRT-PCR and western blot analysis were used to verify the expression level of miR-107, SYK and NF- kappaB signaling pathway related proteins of hippocampus primary neurons. BAY61-3606 and BAY11-7082 were purchased for functional examination. Morris water maze tests were performed to access spatial memory of AD mice with SYK and NF-kappaB signaling pathway inhibition. Fluorescence microscope dyeing experiment investigated the neurons nuclear form and apoptosis. RESULTS: MiR-107 was lowly expressed while SYK was highly expressed in Tg19959 mouse model. Luciferase Assay confirmed the target relationship in miR-107 and SYK. With the inhibition of miR-107, SYK was up-regulated and the increase of p-p65 and the decrease of p-IkappaB-alpha suggested that NF-kappaB signaling pathway was activated in vitro. Morris water maze test indicated that the spatial memory of Tg19959 mice was increased with the treatment. The result of DAPI staining indicated that the inhibition of SYK or NF-kappaB signaling pathway reduced the apoptosis of Tg19959 mice neuron cell. CONCLUSION: MiR-107 exerts its effects through suppression of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway and SYK, the inhibition of SYK and NF-kappaB signaling pathway can improve spatial memory and suppress cell apoptosis.
