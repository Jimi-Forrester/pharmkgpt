39023159|a|Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer disease (AD). In this study, we compared functional decline between LBD and AD patients, considering motor dysfunction, over an 18-month follow-up period. We included all patients >70 years of age, with initial MMSE >= 20 and a diagnosis of possible or probable LBD or AD, who consulted at the memory centre of the Pitie-Salpetriere hospital. Statistical analyses were performed using univariate tests and multivariate linear regression. Thirty-seven AD and 36 LBD patients were included, with a median age of 81 and a median MMSE score of 24/30. Global ADL Katz score decreased significantly for LBD people, compared to AD patients: -0.40 +- 0.75 versus 0 +- 0.24; p=0.003. Global IADL score decreased in the two populations but without a significant difference between the two groups: -1.71 +- 2.19 in LBD versus -1.32 (+- 1.55); p=0.38. This study shows a significant decrease in autonomy in LBD patients over time that was faster than that in AD patients, related, in particular, to bathing, dressing and personal care.
