38540715|t|Iron Dysregulation in Alzheimer's Disease: LA-ICP-MS Bioimaging of the Distribution of Iron and Ferroportin in the CA1 Region of the Human Hippocampus.
38540715|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and neuropathological hallmarks, including beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques, Tau tangles, synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Emerging evidence suggests that abnormal iron (Fe) metabolism plays a role in AD pathogenesis, but the precise spatial distribution of the Fe and its transporters, such as ferroportin (FPN), within affected brain regions remains poorly understood. This study investigates the distribution of Fe and FPN in the CA1 region of the human hippocampus in AD patients with a micrometer lateral resolution using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). For this purpose, we visualized and quantified Fe and FPN in three separated CA1 layers: stratum molecular-radial (SMR), stratum pyramidal (SP) and stratum oriens (SO). Additionally, chromogenic immunohistochemistry was used to examine the distribution and colocalization with Tau and Abeta proteins. The results show that Fe accumulation was significantly higher in AD brains, particularly in SMR and SO. However, FPN did not present significantly changes in AD, although it showed a non-uniform distribution across CA1 layers, with elevated levels in SP and SO. Interestingly, minimal overlap was observed between Fe and FPN signals, and none between Fe and areas rich in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) or neuritic plaques (NP). In conclusion, the lack of correlation between Fe and FPN signals suggests complex regulatory mechanisms in AD Fe metabolism and deposition. These findings highlight the complexity of Fe dysregulation in AD and its potential role in disease progression.
