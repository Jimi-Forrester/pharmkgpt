37901140|a|Objectives: Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activity is specifically active in neurogenesis, and Cdk5 and neocortical neurons migration related biomarker are expressed in Cos-7 cells. However, the function of Cdk5 on the transformation of immortalized Cos-7 cells into neuronal-like cells is not clear. Methods: Cdk5 kinase activity was measured by [gamma-32P] ATP and p81 phosphocellulose pads based method. The expression of neuron liker markers was evaluated by immunofluorescence, real-time PCR, Western blot, and Elisa. Results: P35 overexpression upregulated Cdk5 kinase activity in Cos-7 cells. p35 mediated Cdk5 expression promoted the generation of nerite-like outgrowth. Compared with the empty vector, p35-induced Cdk5 activation resulted in time-dependent increase in neuron-like marker, including Tau, NF-H, NF-H&M, and TuJ1. Tau-5 and NF-M exhibited increased expression at 48 h while TuJ1 was only detectable after 96 h in p35 expressed Cos-7 cells. Additionally, the neural cell biomarkers exhibited well colocation with p35 proteins. Next-generation RNA sequence showed that p35 overexpression significantly upregulated the level of nerve growth factor (NGF). Gene set enrichment analysis showed significant enrichment of multiple neuron development pathways and increased NGF expression after p35 overexpression. Conclusion: p35-mediated Cdk5 activation promotes the transformation of immortalized Cos-7 cells into neuronal-like cells by upregulating NGF level.
