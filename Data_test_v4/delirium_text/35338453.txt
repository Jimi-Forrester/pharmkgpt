35338453|a|PURPOSE: The routine use of validated diagnostic instruments is key to identifying delirious patients early and expediting care. The 3-Minute Diagnostic Assessment for Delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method (3D-CAM) instrument is a brief, easy to use, sensitive, and specific delirium assessment tool for hospitalized patients. We aimed to translate the original English version into French, and then adapt it to older high-risk patients. METHODS: Translation and adaptation of the questionnaire were guided by an expert committee and the 3D-CAM instrument developer. During the translation phase, we achieved semantic and conceptual equivalence of the instrument by conducting forward and backward translations. During the adaptation phase, we assessed the face validity, clarity of wording, and ease of use of the translated questionnaire by administering it to 30 patients and their caregivers in peri-interventional and medical intermediate care units. During both phases, we used qualitative (goal and adequacy of the questionnaire) and quantitative (Sperber score, clarity score) criteria. RESULTS: Translation: four items were judged inadequate and were revised until all reached a Sperber score of < 3/7. Face validity: 91% of patients thought the questionnaire was designed to assess memory, thoughts, or reasoning. Clarity: eight items required adjustments until all scored >= 9/10 for clarity. Ease of use: all bedside caregivers reported that the questionnaire was easy to complete after receiving brief instructions. CONCLUSIONS: We produced a culturally adapted French version of the 3D-CAM instrument that is well understood and well-received by older high-risk patients and their caregivers.
