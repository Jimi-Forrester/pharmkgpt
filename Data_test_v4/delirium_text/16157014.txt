16157014|t|Identification of nitrated proteins in the normal rat brain using a proteomics approach.
16157014|a|BACKGROUND: The nitration of tyrosine has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: In the present study, we identified four targets of protein nitration, T-complex polypeptide 1 alpha subunit (TCP-1), neurofilament L (NFL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and clathrin heavy chain (CHC), in the normal rat cortex using a proteomics approach. CONCLUSIONS: There have been no reports on these proteins being identified by proteomics as nitrated forms in the brain. For further study, we have to investigate alterations in these nitrated proteins during aging and in neurodegenerative disorders.
