38240101|a|Periodontitis is a common chronic inflammatory and destructive disease in the mouth and is considered to be associated with systemic diseases. Accumulating evidence has suggested that periodontitis is a risk factor for pulmonary diseases such as pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and lung cancer. The presence of common periodontal pathogens has been detected in samples from a variety of pulmonary diseases. Periodontal pathogens can be involved in lung diseases by promoting the adhesion and invasion of respiratory pathogens, regulating the apoptosis of respiratory epithelium and inducing overexpression of mucin and disrupting the balance of immune systemin respiratory epithelium cells. Additionally, measures to control plaque and maintain the health of periodontal tissue can decrease the incidence of respiratory adverse events. This evidence suggests a close association between periodontitis and pulmonary diseases. The present study aimed to review the clinical association between periodontitis and pneumonia, COPD, asthma, COVID-19 and lung cancer, and propose a possible mechanism and potential role of periodontal pathogens in linking periodontal disease and lung disease. This could provide a direction for further research on the association between periodontitis and lung disease and provide novel ideas for the clinical diagnosis and treatment management of these two diseases.
