24616596|a|Umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been introduced as a possible therapy in acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This case history is reported of a 59-yr-old man who was treated with MSCs in the course of ARDS and subsequent pulmonary fibrosis. He received a long period of mechanical ventilation and weaning proved difficult. On hospital day 114, he underwent the intratracheal administration of UCB-derived MSCs at a dose of 1 x 10(6)/kg. After cell infusion, an immediate improvement was shown in his mental status, his lung compliance (from 22.7 mL/cmH2O to 27.9 mL/cmH2O), PaO2/FiO2 ratio (from 191 mmHg to 334 mmHg) and his chest radiography over the course of three days. Even though he finally died of repeated pulmonary infection, our current findings suggest the possibility of using MSCs therapy in an ARDS patient. It is the first clinical case of UCB-derived MSCs therapy ever reported.
