35077612|t|Synthesis of Aminoethyl-Substituted Piperidine Derivatives as sigma1 Receptor Ligands with Antiproliferative Properties.
35077612|a|A series of novel sigma1 receptor ligands with a 4-(2-aminoethyl)piperidine scaffold was prepared and biologically evaluated. The underlying concept of our project was the improvement of the lipophilic ligand efficiency of previously synthesized potent sigma1 ligands. The key steps of the synthesis comprise the conjugate addition of phenylboronic acid at dihydropyridin-4(1H)-ones 7, homologation of the ketones 8 and introduction of diverse amino moieties and piperidine N-substituents. 1-Methylpiperidines showed particular high sigma1 receptor affinity and selectivity over the sigma2 subtype, whilst piperidines with a proton, a tosyl moiety or an ethyl moiety exhibited considerably lower sigma1 affinity. Molecular dynamics simulations with per-residue binding free energy deconvolution demonstrated that different interactions of the basic piperidine-N-atom and its substituents (or the cyclohexane ring) with the lipophilic binding pocket consisting of Leu105, Thr181, Leu182, Ala185, Leu186, Thr202 and Tyr206 are responsible for the different sigma1 receptor affinities. Recorded logD7.4 and calculated clogP values of 4a and 18a indicate low lipophilicity and thus high lipophilic ligand efficiency. Piperidine 4a inhibited the growth of human non-small cell lung cancer cells A427 to a similar extent as the sigma1 antagonist haloperidol. 1-Methylpiperidines 20a, 21a and 22a showed stronger antiproliferative effects on androgen negative human prostate cancer cells DU145 than the sigma1 ligands NE100 and S1RA.
