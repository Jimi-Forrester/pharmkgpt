31566067|t|Nocturnal Mean Arterial Pressure Rising Is Associated With Mortality in the Intensive Care Unit: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
31566067|a|Background Disrupted circadian rhythm of blood pressure is commonly observed in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). This study assessed the association of nocturnal mean arterial pressure rising (NMAPR) with short- and long-term mortality in critically ill adult patients. Methods and Results Adult patients with a complete record of mean arterial pressure monitoring during the first 24 hours of ICU stay in the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II (MIMIC-II) database were included in this retrospective cohort study. All patients were divided into the non-NMAPR group (<=1) or the NMAPR group (>1), according to the value of mean nighttime divided by daytime mean arterial pressure. The associations of NMAPR with ICU, hospital, 28-day, and 1-year mortality were assessed using multivariable logistic regression or a Cox proportional hazards model. Interaction and subgroup analyses were performed for those patients who had a first Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of >=8 or <8. The overall cohort comprised 5185 patients. The patients with NMAPR (n=1865) had higher ICU, hospital, 28-day, and 1-year mortality than the non-NMAPR group (n=3320). After adjusting for covariates, the analysis showed that NMAPR was significantly associated with mortality in the ICU (odds ratio: 1.34; 95% CI, 1.10-1.65), in the hospital (odds ratio: 1.35; 95% CI, 1.12-1.63), at 28 days (hazard ratio: 1.27; 95% CI, 1.10-1.48), and at 1 year (hazard ratio: 1.24; 95% CI, 1.10-1.40). All results of the interaction analysis had no statistical significance, and similar results persisted in the patients with different SOFA scores. Conclusions NMAPR may aid in the early identification of critically ill patients at high risk of ICU, hospital, 28-day, or 1-year mortality.
