35600245|a|Background: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal muscle wasting disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Due to their phenotypic similarity to human patients, large animal models are invaluable tools for pre-clinical trials. The DE50-MD dog is a relatively new model of DMD, and carries a therapeutically-tractable mutation lying within the hotspot for human patients, making it especially valuable. Prior to conducting therapeutic trials using this novel animal model, it is essential to establish a panel of viable biomarkers. Methods: We evaluated a panel of blood-borne biomarkers of musculoskeletal disease in the DE50-MD dog. Venous blood samples were obtained monthly throughout an 18-month study period in DE50-MD (N=18) and wild-type (WT) control (N=14) dogs. A panel of potential plasma/serum biomarkers of DMD was measured and their theoretical utility in future clinical trials determined using sample size calculations. Results: Compared to WT dogs, DE50-MD dogs had substantially higher circulating creatine kinase (CK) activities, myomesin-3 (MYOM3), and the dystromiRs miR-1, miR-133a and miR-206, but significantly lower serum myostatin concentrations. An age-associated pattern, similar to that observed in DMD patients, was seen for CK and MYOM3. Sample size calculations suggested that low cohort sizes (N<=3) could be used to detect up to a 50% improvement in DE50-MD results towards WT levels for each biomarker or a combination thereof (via principal component analysis); as few as N=3 animals should enable detection of a 25% improvement using a combined biomarker approach (alpha 0.05, power 0.8). Conclusions: We have established a panel of blood-borne biomarkers that could be used to monitor musculoskeletal disease or response to a therapeutic intervention in the DE50-MD dog using low numbers of animals. The blood biomarker profile closely mimics that of DMD patients, supporting the hypothesis that this DMD model would be suitable for use in pre-clinical trials.
