39216441|a|Abnormal amyloid beta-protein (Abeta42) fibrillation is a key event in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and photodynamic therapy (PDT) possesses great potential in modulating Abeta42 self-assembly. However, the poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, low biocompatibility, and limited tissue penetration depth of existing photosensitizers limit the progress of photo-oxidation strategies. In this paper, novel indocyanine green-modified graphene quantum dot nano-assemblies (NBGQDs-ICGs) were synthesized based on a molecular assembly strategy of electrostatic interactions for PDT inhibition of Abeta42 self-assembly process and decomposition of preformed fibrils under near-infrared light. Combining the small-size structure of graphene quantum dots and the near-infrared light-responsive properties of ICGs, the NBGQDs-ICGs could achieve BBB penetration under 808 nm irradiation. More importantly, the neuroprotective mechanism of NBGQDs-ICG was studied for the first time by AFM, which effectively weakened the adhesion of Abeta42 aggregates to the cell surface by blocking the interaction between Abeta42 and the cell membrane, and restored the mechanical stability and adhesion of the neuron membrane. Meanwhile, NBGQDs-ICG promoted phagocytosis of Abeta42 by microglia. In addition, the good biocompatibility and stability ensured the biosafety of NBGQDs-ICG in future clinical applications. We anticipate that such multifunctional nanocomponents may provide promising avenues for the development of novel AD inhibitors.
