26154755|a|BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The CISD2 gene has been related to life span control and mitochondrial dysfunction in animals. In addition, inhibition of mitochondrial enzymes due to an accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide has been related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to explore the association between sequence variants of the CISD2 gene and risk for AD, which has not been explored previously. METHODS: This was a case-control study involving a total of 276 patients with AD who were recruited from three teaching hospitals in Taiwan from 2007 to 2010; 460 controls were recruited from elderly individuals attending for health check-ups and volunteers in the hospital during the same period of time. All participants were aged 60 years or older. Two haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs), rs223330 and rs223331, were selected from the CISD2 gene to test the association between their polymorphisms and the risk for dementia, and how ApoE e4 status, sex, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus might modify this association. RESULTS: rs223330 variant carriage was not associated with risk for AD [TT versus CC: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.59-1.62; TC versus CC: AOR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.47-1.11]. Similar findings were observed for rs223331 (AA versus TT: AOR = 1.12; AT versus TT: AOR = 0.99). In addition, hypertension significantly modified the association between rs223331 and risk for AD (p = 0.005).Three common haplotypes (with a frequency of 99.8%) were observed for CISD2. Common CISD2 haplotypes were not associated with the risk for AD. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that CISD2 htSNPs are not associated with AD risk.
