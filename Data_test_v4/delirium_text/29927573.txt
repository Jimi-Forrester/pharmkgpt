29927573|a|Accumulating evidence supports the abnormal deposition of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) as the main cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, fighting against the formation, deposition, and toxicity of Abeta is a basic strategy for the treatment of AD. In the process of in vitro nerve cell culture, screening out drugs that can antagonize a series of toxic reactions caused by beta-amyloid deposition has become an effective method for the follow-up treatment of AD. Our previous studies showed that tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (TDNs) had good biocompatibility and had some positive effects on the biological behavior of cells. In this study, the main aim of our work was to explore the effects and potential mechanism of TDNs in protecting neuronal PC12 cells from the toxicity of Abeta. Our study demonstrated that TDNs can protect and rescue PC12 cell death through Abeta25-35-induced PC12 cell apoptosis. Further studies showed that TDNs significantly improved the apoptosis by affecting the abnormal cell cycle, restoring abnormal nuclear morphology and caspase activity. Western blot analysis showed that TDNs could prevent the damage caused by Abeta deposition by activating the ERK1/2 pathway and thus be a potential therapeutic agent with a neuroprotective effect in Alzheimer's disease. Our finding provides a potential application of TDNs in the prevention and treatment of AD.
