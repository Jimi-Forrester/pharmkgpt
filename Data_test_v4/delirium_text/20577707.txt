20577707|t|[Administration of intravenous immunoglobulins in neurology. An evidence-based consensus: update 2010].
20577707|a|Our knowledge on the clinical efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) in neurological diseases has greatly increased in the last 5 years. Liquid formulations with a higher concentration of IVIg have simplified administration. Despite a worldwide increase in plasma production it is still a valuable biological product which is why current indications must be continuously validated. Long-term efficacy of the preparation Gamunex could be demonstrated in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). In acute myasthenic worsening a dose of 1 g IVIg/kg body weight appears to be sufficient for clinical stabilization. New indications, such as the postpolio syndrome or Alzheimer's disease are being explored in clinical trials. In addition to the consensus statement from 2004 the evidence for clinical use of IVIg has been re-evaluated and recommendations are given.
