14576165|a|The Alzheimer's disease-associated presenilin (PS) 1 is intimately involved in gamma-secretase cleavage of beta-amyloid precursor protein and other proteins. In addition, PS1 plays a role in beta-catenin signaling and in the regulation of apoptosis. Here we demonstrate that phosphorylation of PS1 is regulated by two independent signaling pathways involving protein kinase (PK) A and PKC and that both kinases can directly phosphorylate the large hydrophilic domain of PS1 in vitro and in cultured cells. A phosphorylation site at serine residue 346 was identified that is selectively phosphorylated by PKC but not by PKA. This site is localized within a recognition motif for caspases, and phosphorylation strongly inhibits proteolytic processing of PS1 by caspase activity during apoptosis. Moreover, PS1 phosphorylation reduces the progression of apoptosis. Our data indicate that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at the caspase recognition site provides a mechanism to reversibly regulate properties of PS1 in apoptosis.
