36201426|t|Glaucoma and Alzheimer: Neurodegenerative disorders show an adrenergic dysbalance.
36201426|a|Glaucoma disease is characterized by an increased intraocular pressure (IOP), glaucomatous alterations of the optic disc and corresponding visual field defects. Even lowering the main risk factor IOP until an individual target level does not prevent this neurodegenerative disorder from proceeding. Several autoimmune mechanisms were discovered, partly showing a functionality. One of these autoimmune phenomena targets the ss2-adrenergic receptor (ss2-AR; i.e. agonistic autoantibodies; ss2-agAAb) and is linked to an elevated IOP and an impaired retinal microcirculation. As neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is postulated to share a common molecular mechanism with glaucoma. In the present study we investigated autoimmune phenomena targeting the ss2-AR in patients with AD. Sera of the patients were analyzed in a rat cardiomyocyte bioassay for the presence of functional autoantibodies against ss2-AR. In addition, different species of amyloid beta (Ass) monomers were tested (Ass1-14, Ass10-25, Abeta10-37 Ass1-40, Ass1-42, Abeta28-40, and Ass-[Pyr]3-43). Our results demonstrate that none of the short-chain Ass (Ass1-14, Ass10-25, or Abeta28-40) showed any agonistic or inhibitory effect on ss2-AR. Contrary, long-chain Ass-[Pyr]3-43, representing a major neurogenic plaque component, exerted an activation that after blocking by the ss2-AR antagonist ICI118.551, could be identified as that the effect was realized via the ss2-AR. Moreover, the long chain Ass1-40, Abeta1-42, and Abeta10-37, yet not the short-chain Ass peptides prevented the clenbuterol induced desensitization of the ss2-AR. In addition, we identified functional autoantibodies in the sera of AD patients, activating the ss2-AR, like the ss2-agAAb found in patients with glaucoma. As autoimmune mechanisms were reportedly involved in the pathogenesis of glaucoma and Alzheimer's Disease, we postulate that overstimulation of the ss2-AR pathway can induce an adrenergic overdrive, that may play an important role in the multifactorial interplay of neurodegenerative disorders.
