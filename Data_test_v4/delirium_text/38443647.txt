38443647|t|An Update on Stiripentol Mechanisms of Action: A Narrative Review.
38443647|a|Stiripentol (Diacomit ) (STP) is an orally active antiseizure medication (ASM) indicated as adjunctive therapy, for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS), a severe form of childhood epilepsy, in conjunction with clobazam and, in some regions valproic acid. Since the discovery of STP, several mechanisms of action (MoA) have been described that may explain its specific effect on seizures associated with DS. STP is mainly considered as a potentiator of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission: (i) via uptake blockade, (ii) inhibition of degradation, but also (iii) as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, especially those containing alpha3 and delta subunits. Blockade of voltage-gated sodium and T-type calcium channels, which is classically associated with anticonvulsant and neuroprotective properties, has also been demonstrated for STP. Finally, several studies indicate that STP could regulate glucose energy metabolism and inhibit lactate dehydrogenase. STP is also an inhibitor of several cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of other ASMs, contributing to boost their anticonvulsant efficacy as add-on therapy. These different MoAs involved in treatment of DS and recent data suggest a potential for STP to treat other neurological or non-neurological diseases.
