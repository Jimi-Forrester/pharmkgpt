37881573|t|Hippocampal Network Dysfunction in Early Psychosis: A 2-Year Longitudinal Study.
37881573|a|Background: Hippocampal abnormalities are among the most consistent findings in schizophrenia. Numerous studies have reported deficits in hippocampal volume, function, and connectivity in the chronic stage of illness. While hippocampal volume and function deficits are also present in the early stage of illness, there is mixed evidence of both higher and lower functional connectivity. Here, we use graph theory to test the hypothesis that hippocampal network connectivity is broadly lowered in early psychosis and progressively worsens over 2 years. Methods: We examined longitudinal resting-state functional connectivity in 140 participants (68 individuals in the early stage of psychosis, 72 demographically similar healthy control individuals). We used an anatomically driven approach to quantify hippocampal network connectivity at 2 levels: 1) a core hippocampal-medial temporal lobe cortex (MTLC) network; and 2) an extended hippocampal-cortical network. Group and time effects were tested in a linear mixed effects model. Results: Early psychosis patients showed elevated functional connectivity in the core hippocampal-MTLC network, but contrary to our hypothesis, did not show alterations within the broader hippocampal-cortical network. Hippocampal-MTLC network hyperconnectivity normalized longitudinally and predicted improvement in positive symptoms but was not associated with increasing illness duration. Conclusions: These results show abnormally elevated functional connectivity in a core hippocampal-MTLC network in early psychosis, suggesting that selectively increased hippocampal signaling within a localized cortical circuit may be a marker of the early stage of psychosis. Hippocampal-MTLC hyperconnectivity could have prognostic and therapeutic implications.
