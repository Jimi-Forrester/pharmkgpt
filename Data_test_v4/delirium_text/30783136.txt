30783136|a|The aggregation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) is a pathological feature of a number of neurodegenerative conditions, including Parkinson's disease. Genetic mutations, abnormal protein synthesis, environmental stress, and aging have all been implicated as causative factors in this process. The importance of water in the polymerisation of monomers, however, has largely been overlooked. In the present study, we highlight the role of hyperosmotic stress in inducing human alpha-syn to aggregate in cells in vitro, through rapid treatment of the cells with three different osmolytes: sugar, salt and alcohol. This effect is cell-dependent and not due to direct protein-osmolyte interaction, and is specific for alpha-syn when compared to other neurodegeneration-related proteins, such as Tau or Huntingtin. This new property of alpha-syn not only highlights a unique aspect of its behaviour which may have some relevance for disease states, but may also be useful as a screening test for compounds to inhibit the aggregation of alpha-syn in vitro.
