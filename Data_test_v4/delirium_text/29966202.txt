29966202|t|Real-World, Multinational, Retrospective Observational Survey of the ADAS-Cog and Associations with Healthcare Resource Utilization in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.
29966202|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most costly conditions, both economically and regarding patient disability and dependency. The huge costs coupled with the predicted increase in prevalence worldwide are likely to challenge healthcare systems in the future. The classic version of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition subscale (ADAS-Cog) is generally seen as the current gold standard primary outcome measure of cognitive symptom progression in dementia clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the relationship between ADAS-Cog scores as a measure of clinical progression and the healthcare resource utilization (HCRU)-measured burden of cognitive impairment in patients with mild cognitive impairment, AD, or suspected AD in the real world. METHODS: A retrospective observational survey of physicians and their consulting patients with multiple ADAS-Cog scores. Regression models were constructed for HCRU variables (e.g., consultations, hospitalizations, caregiving requirements) with ADAS-Cog rate of change, baseline ADAS-Cog, and their interaction included as exposure variables. RESULTS: 651 patient records were completed by 154 physicians. Approximately 70% of patients had mild to moderate dementia. In 56.7% of patients, clinical progression was maintained/stable from baseline. Mean change in ADAS-Cog (adjusted to 12 months) was 2.8 points and change scores increased with increasing dementia severity. Most HCRU variables increased significantly (p < 0.05; joint test) with increasing ADAS-Cog scores (indexing clinical deterioration). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that further understanding the relationship between HCRU and ADAS-Cog changes in real-world clinical practice could potentially provide a baseline upon which the success of disease-modifying, as well as newer symptomatic, dementia therapies can be judged.
