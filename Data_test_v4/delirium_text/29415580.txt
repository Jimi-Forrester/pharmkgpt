29415580|t|A non-interventional comparative study of the 20:1 combination of cafedrine/theodrenaline versus ephedrine for the treatment of intra-operative arterial hypotension: the 'HYPOTENS' study design and rationale.
29415580|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of 20:1 cafedrine/theodrenaline approved for use in Germany to ephedrine in the restoration of arterial blood pressure and on post-operative outcomes in patients with intra-operative arterial hypotension of any origin under standard clinical practice conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS: 'HYPOTENS' is a national, multi-center, prospective, open-label, two-armed, non-interventional study. Effectiveness and post-operative outcome following cafedrine/theodrenaline or ephedrine therapy will be evaluated in two cohorts of hypotensive patients. Cohort A includes patients aged >=50 years with ASA-classification 2-4 undergoing non-emergency surgical procedures under general anesthesia. Cohort B comprises patients undergoing Cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Participating surgical departments will be assigned to a treatment arm by routinely used anti-hypotensive agent. To minimize bias, matched department pairs will be compared in a stratified selection process. The composite primary end-point is the lower absolute deviation from individually determined target blood pressure (IDTBP) and the incidence of heart rate >=100 beats/min in the first 15 min. Secondary end-points include incidence and degree of early post-operative delirium (cohort A), severity of fetal acidosis in the newborn (cohort B), upper absolute deviation from IDTBP, percentage increase in systolic blood pressure, and time to IDTBP. CONCLUSION: This open-label, non-interventional study design mirrors daily practice in the treatment of patients with intra-operative hypotension and ensures full treatment decision autonomy with respect to each patient's individual condition. Selection of participating sites by a randomization process addresses bias without interfering with the non-interventional nature of the study. First results are expected in 2018.
