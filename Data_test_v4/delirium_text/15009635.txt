15009635|a|Altered energy metabolism, including reductions in activities of the key mitochondrial enzymes alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC) and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), are characteristic of many neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD). Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase is a critical subunit of KGDHC and PDHC. We tested whether mice that are deficient in dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (Dld+/-) show increased vulnerability to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), malonate and 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), which have been proposed for use in models of PD and HD. Administration of MPTP resulted in significantly greater depletion of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the substantia nigra of Dld+/- mice than that seen in wild-type littermate controls. Striatal lesion volumes produced by malonate and 3-NP were significantly increased in Dld+/- mice. Studies of isolated brain mitochondria treated with 3-NP showed that both succinate-supported respiration and membrane potential were suppressed to a greater extent in Dld+/- mice. KGDHC activity was also found to be reduced in putamen from patients with HD. These findings provide further evidence that mitochondrial defects may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.
