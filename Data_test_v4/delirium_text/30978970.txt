30978970|t|Novel Anti-Aging Benzoquinone Derivatives from Onosma bracteatum Wall.
30978970|a|The aim of this study was to investigate anti-aging molecules from Onosma bracteatum Wall, a traditional medicinal plant used in the Unani and Ayurvedic systems of medicine. During bioassay-guided isolation, two known benzoquinones, allomicrophyllone (1) and ehretiquinone (2) along with three novel benzoquinones designated as ehretiquinones B-D (3-5) were isolated from O. bracteatum. Their structures were characterized by spectroscopic analysis through 1D and 2D NMR, by MS spectroscopic analysis and comparing with those reported in the literatures. The anti-aging potential of the isolated benzoquinones was evaluated through a yeast lifespan assay, and the results indicated that 1, 2, 4 and 5 significantly extended the replicative lifespan of K6001 yeast, indicating that these benzoquinones obtained from O. brateatum have the ability to be employed as a potential therapeutic agent against age-related diseases.
