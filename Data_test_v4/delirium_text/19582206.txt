19582206|t|The kinin system--bradykinin: biological effects and clinical implications. Multiple role of the kinin system--bradykinin.
19582206|a|The present review article regarding the kinin system-bradykinin is dealing with the biological effects of the abovementioned entity mediated by specific B1 and B2 receptors as well as with its clinical implications known nowadays. The activation of the kinin system-bradykinin is particularly important in blood pressure regulation and in inflammatory reactions, through bradykinin ability to elevate vascular permeability and to cause vasodilatation in some arteries and veins. Recent data on bradykinin formation and release, synergy with ligands, receptors for bradykinin as well as on bradykinin participation in the mitogenesis process, are given in detail. Therapeutic potentials and future applications in many clinical situations including respiratory allergic reactions, septic shock, hypertension and its treatment, hypotensive transfusion reactions, heart diseases, pancreatitis, hereditary and acquired angioedema, Alzheimer disease and liver cirrhosis with ascites, are discussed in brief. Its role as a neuromediator, regulator of several vascular and renal functions, and its participation in signaling pathways, is also discussed in some detail.
