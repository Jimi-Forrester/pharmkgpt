37771410|a|Background: The use of patient health and treatment information captured in structured and unstructured formats in computerized electronic health record (EHR) repositories could potentially augment the detection of safety signals for drug products regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Natural language processing and other artificial intelligence (AI) techniques provide novel methodologies that could be leveraged to extract clinically useful information from EHR resources. Objective: Our aim is to develop a novel AI-enabled software prototype to identify adverse drug event (ADE) safety signals from free-text discharge summaries in EHRs to enhance opioid drug safety and research activities at the FDA. Methods: We developed a prototype for web-based software that leverages keyword and trigger-phrase searching with rule-based algorithms and deep learning to extract candidate ADEs for specific opioid drugs from discharge summaries in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database. The prototype uses MedSpacy components to identify relevant sections of discharge summaries and a pretrained natural language processing (NLP) model, Spark NLP for Healthcare, for named entity recognition. Fifteen FDA staff members provided feedback on the prototype's features and functionalities. Results: Using the prototype, we were able to identify known, labeled, opioid-related adverse drug reactions from text in EHRs. The AI-enabled model achieved accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-scores of 0.66, 0.69, 0.64, and 0.67, respectively. FDA participants assessed the prototype as highly desirable in user satisfaction, visualizations, and in the potential to support drug safety signal detection for opioid drugs from EHR data while saving time and manual effort. Actionable design recommendations included (1) enlarging the tabs and visualizations; (2) enabling more flexibility and customizations to fit end users' individual needs; (3) providing additional instructional resources; (4) adding multiple graph export functionality; and (5) adding project summaries. Conclusions: The novel prototype uses innovative AI-based techniques to automate searching for, extracting, and analyzing clinically useful information captured in unstructured text in EHRs. It increases efficiency in harnessing real-world data for opioid drug safety and increases the usability of the data to support regulatory review while decreasing the manual research burden.
