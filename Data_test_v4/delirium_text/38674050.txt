38674050|t|Detrimental Roles of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1alpha in Severe Hypoxic Brain Diseases.
38674050|a|Hypoxia stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), facilitating adaptation to hypoxic conditions. Appropriate hypoxia is pivotal for neurovascular regeneration and immune cell mobilization. However, in central nervous system (CNS) injury, prolonged and severe hypoxia harms the brain by triggering neurovascular inflammation, oxidative stress, glial activation, vascular damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death. Diminished hypoxia in the brain improves cognitive function in individuals with CNS injuries. This review discusses the current evidence regarding the contribution of severe hypoxia to CNS injuries, with an emphasis on HIF-1alpha-mediated pathways. During severe hypoxia in the CNS, HIF-1alpha facilitates inflammasome formation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death. This review presents the molecular mechanisms by which HIF-1alpha is involved in the pathogenesis of CNS injuries, such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer's disease. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms of HIF-1alpha will contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies for severe hypoxic brain diseases.
