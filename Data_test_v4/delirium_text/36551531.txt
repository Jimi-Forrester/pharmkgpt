36551531|t|The Intricate Interplay between the ZNF217 Oncogene and Epigenetic Processes Shapes Tumor Progression.
36551531|a|The oncogenic transcription factor ZNF217 orchestrates several molecular signaling networks to reprogram integrated circuits governing hallmark capabilities within cancer cells. High levels of ZNF217 expression provide advantages to a specific subset of cancer cells to reprogram tumor progression, drug resistance and cancer cell plasticity. ZNF217 expression level, thus, provides a powerful biomarker of poor prognosis and a predictive biomarker for anticancer therapies. Cancer epigenetic mechanisms are well known to support the acquisition of hallmark characteristics during oncogenesis. However, the complex interactions between ZNF217 and epigenetic processes have been poorly appreciated. Deregulated DNA methylation status at ZNF217 locus or an intricate cross-talk between ZNF217 and noncoding RNA networks could explain aberrant ZNF217 expression levels in a cancer cell context. On the other hand, the ZNF217 protein controls gene expression signatures and molecular signaling for tumor progression by tuning DNA methylation status at key promoters by interfering with noncoding RNAs or by refining the epitranscriptome. Altogether, this review focuses on the recent advances in the understanding of ZNF217 collaboration with epigenetics processes to orchestrate oncogenesis. We also discuss the exciting burgeoning translational medicine and candidate therapeutic strategies emerging from those recent findings connecting ZNF217 to epigenetic deregulation in cancer.
