33833255|a|Reduced NREM sleep in humans is associated with AD neuropathology. Recent work has demonstrated a reduction in NREM sleep in preclinical AD, pointing to its potential utility as an early marker of dementia. We test the hypothesis that reduced NREM delta power and increased tauopathy are associated with shared underlying cortical molecular networks in preclinical AD. We integrate multi-omics data from two extensive public resources, a human Alzheimer's disease cohort from the Mount Sinai Brain Bank (N = 125) reflecting AD progression and a (C57BL/6J x 129S1/SvImJ) F2 mouse population in which NREM delta power was measured (N = 98). Two cortical gene networks, including a CLOCK-dependent circadian network, are associated with NREM delta power and AD tauopathy progression. These networks were validated in independent mouse and human cohorts. Identifying gene networks related to preclinical AD elucidate possible mechanisms associated with the early disease phase and potential targets to alter the disease course.
