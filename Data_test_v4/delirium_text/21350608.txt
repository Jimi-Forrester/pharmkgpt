21350608|t|Abeta internalization by neurons and glia.
21350608|a|In the brain, the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) exists extracellularly and inside neurons. The intracellular accumulation of Abeta in Alzheimer's disease brain has been questioned for a long time. However, there is now sufficient strong evidence indicating that accumulation of Abeta inside neurons plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Intraneuronal Abeta originates from intracellular cleavage of APP and from Abeta internalization from the extracellular milieu. We discuss here the different molecular mechanisms that are responsible for Abeta internalization in neurons and the links between Abeta internalization and neuronal dysfunction and death. A brief description of Abeta uptake by glia is also presented.
