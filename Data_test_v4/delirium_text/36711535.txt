36711535|t|Gesture profiles distinguish primary progressive aphasia variants.
36711535|a|Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by progressive language deficits. There are three main variants of PPA - semantic (svPPA), logopenic (lvPPA), and nonfluent (nfvPPA) - that can be challenging to distinguish. Limb praxis may also be affected in PPA, but it is unclear whether different variants of PPA are associated with differences in gesture production. Prior research with neurotypical individuals indicates that the left temporal lobe is a critical locus of manipulable object and hand posture representations. Moreover, when imitating gestures, individuals whose strokes include the left temporal lobe show reduced benefit of gesture meaning and disproportionate impairment in hand posture as compared to arm kinematics. We tested the hypothesis that svPPA - who typically exhibit primarily temporal lobe atrophy - would differentially show these expected patterns of gesture imitation performance. Nineteen participants with PPA completed meaningful and meaningless gesture imitation tasks, and performance was scored for hand posture and arm kinematics accuracy. Generalized logistic mixed-effect regression models controlling for dementia severity showed overall benefits from gesture meaning, and greater impairments in hand posture than arm kinematics. We also found that svPPA participants were the most impaired in gesture imitation overall. Critically, there was also a significant three-way interaction of group, meaning, and gesture component: only svPPA participants showed relative impairments of hand posture for meaningful gestures as well as meaningless gestures. Thus, unlike lvPPA and nfvPPA, the hand postures of svPPA failed to benefit from gesture meaning. This research extends prior findings on the role of the temporal lobe in hand posture representations associated with manipulable objects, and is the first to indicate that there may be distinct gesture imitation patterns as a function of PPA variant. Characterizing componential gesture deficits in PPA may help to inform differential diagnosis, compensatory communication strategies, and cognitive praxis models of PPA.
