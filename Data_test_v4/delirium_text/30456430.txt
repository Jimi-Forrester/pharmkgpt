30456430|t|The consistency of care for older patients with a hip fracture: are the results of the integrated orthogeriatric treatment model of the Centre of Geriatric Traumatology consistent 10 years after implementation?
30456430|a|In the past 10 years after implementation, the orthogeriatric treatment model led in general to consistent outcomes for 1555 older adults in terms of most of the complications and mortality. Surgery was more often delayed to 24-48 h after arrival at the hospital, while the length of hospital stay shortened. INTRODUCTION: Since 1 April 2008, patients aged >= 70 years presenting themselves with a hip fracture at Ziekenhuisgroep Twente (ZGT) have been treated according to the orthogeriatric treatment model. The aim of this study was to investigate if outcomes of the orthogeriatric treatment model are consistent over the first 10 years after implementation. METHODS: Between 1 April 2008 and 31 December 2016, patients aged >= 70 years who were surgically treated at ZGT for a hip fracture were included and divided into three periods equally distributed in time. Patient characteristics, in-hospital logistics, complications, and mortality data were compared between the three periods. RESULTS: A total of 1555 patients were included. There was a shift in the surgical treatment for the fractured neck of femur from dynamic hip screw/cannulated screws to hemiarthroplasty (p < 0.001). Surgery within 24 h after arrival to the hospital decreased (p < 0.001), while surgery within 48 h stayed the same (p = 0.085). Length of hospital stay significantly decreased over time (p < 0.001). Complication rates were consistent except for the number of postoperative anemia, delirium, and urinary tract infections. Mortality rates did not change over the years. CONCLUSIONS: The orthogeriatric treatment model leads in general to consistent outcomes concerning mortality and most of the complications, except for postoperative anemia, delirium, and urinary tract infections. Inconsistent complication rates were influenced by altered diagnosis and treatment protocols. Length of hospital stay reduced, while time to surgery was more often delayed to 24-48 h. Monitoring clinical outcomes of the orthogeriatric treatment model over time is recommended in order to optimize and maintain the quality of care for this frail patient population.
