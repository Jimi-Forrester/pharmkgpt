Since Tau is a microtubule-associated protein, a prevalent concept to explain the pathogenesis of tauopathies is that abnormal Tau modification contributes to dissociation from microtubules, assembly into multimeric beta-sheets, proteotoxicity, neuronal dysfunction and cell loss. Tau also localizes in the cell nucleus and evidence supports an emerging function of Tau in DNA stability and epigenetic modulation. Methods: To better characterize the possible role of Tau in regulation of chromatin compaction and subsequent gene expression, we performed a bioinformatics analysis of transcriptome data obtained from Tau-depleted human neuroblastoma cells. Results: Among the transcripts deregulated in a Tau-dependent manner, we found an enrichment of target genes for the polycomb repressive complex 2. We further describe decreased cellular amounts of the core components of the polycomb repressive complex 2 and lower histone 3 trimethylation in Tau deficient cells. Among the de-repressed polycomb repressive complex 2 target gene products, IGFBP3 protein was found to be linked to increased senescence induction in Tau-deficient cells. Discussion: Our findings propose a mechanism for Tau-dependent epigenetic modulation of cell senescence, a key event in pathologic aging.
