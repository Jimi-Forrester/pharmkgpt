31209175|t|Sleep as a Potential Biomarker of Tau and beta-Amyloid Burden in the Human Brain.
31209175|a|Recent proposals suggest that sleep may be a factor associated with accumulation of two core pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD): tau and beta-amyloid (Abeta). Here we combined PET measures of Abeta and tau, electroencephalogram sleep recordings, and retrospective sleep evaluations to investigate the potential utility of sleep measures in predicting in vivo AD pathology in male and female older adults. Regression analyses revealed that the severity of impaired slow oscillation-sleep spindle coupling predicted greater medial temporal lobe tau burden. Abeta burden was not associated with coupling impairment but instead predicted the diminished amplitude of <1 Hz slow-wave-activity, results that were statistically dissociable from each other. Additionally, comparisons of AD pathology and retrospective, self-reported changes in sleep duration demonstrated that changes in sleep across the lifespan can predict late-life Abeta and tau burden. Thus, quantitative and qualitative features of human sleep represent potential noninvasive, cost-effective, and scalable biomarkers (current and future forecasting) of AD pathology, and carry both therapeutic and public health implications.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Several studies have linked sleep disruption to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau and beta-amyloid (Abeta), the primary pathological features of AD, are associated with both objective and subjective changes in sleep. However, it remains unknown whether late life tau and Abeta burden are associated with distinct impairments in sleep physiology or changes in sleep across the lifespan. Using polysomnography, retrospective questionnaires, and tau- and Abeta-specific PET, the present study reveals human sleep signatures that dissociably predict levels of brain tau and Abeta in older adults. These results suggest that a night of polysomnography may aid in evaluating tau and Abeta burden, and that treating sleep deficiencies within decade-specific time windows may serve in delaying AD progression.
