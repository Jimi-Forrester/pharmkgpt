31194969|a|During the last two decades, neuropathological examination of the brain has evolved both technically and scientifically. The increasing use of immunohistochemistry to detect protein aggregates paralleled a better understanding of neuroanatomical progression of protein deposition. As a consequence, an international effort was achieved to standardize hyperphosphorylated-Tau (phospho-TAU), ssAmyloid (Ass), alpha syncuclein (alpha-syn), phosphorylated transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (phospho-TDP43) and vascular pathology detection. Meanwhile harmonized staging systems emerged in order to increase inter rater reproducibility. Therefore, a refined definition of Alzheimer's disease was recommended., a clearer picture of the neuropathological lesions diversity emerged secondarily to the systematic assessment of concomitant pathology highlighting finally a low rate of pure AD pathology. This brings new challenges to laboratory medicine in the field of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of Alzheimer's disease: how to further validate total Tau, phospho-TAU, Ass40 and Ass42 and new marker level cut-offs while autopsy rates are declining?
