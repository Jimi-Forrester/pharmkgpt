35566053|a|A novel biologically active thiosemicarbazide derivative ligand L (N-[(phenylcarbamothioyl)amino]pyridine-3-carboxamide) and a series of its five metal(II) complexes, namely: [Co(L)Cl2], [Ni(L)Cl2(H2O)], [Cu(L)Cl2(H2O)], [Zn(L)Cl2] and [Cd(L)Cl2(H2O)] have been synthesized and thoroughly investigated. The physicochemical characterization of the newly obtained compounds has been performed using appropriate analytical techniques, such as 1H and l3C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), inductively coupled plasma (ICP), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and magnetic measurements. In order to study the pharmacokinetic profile of the compounds, ADMET analysis was performed. The in vitro studies revealed that the synthesized compounds exhibit potent biological activity against A549 human cancer cell line.
