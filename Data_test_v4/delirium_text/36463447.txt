36463447|a|BACKGROUND: The relationship between transesophageal echocardiography findings and cognitive function. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to establish an association between transesophageal echocardiography findings and cognitive function in stroke survivors. METHODS: A single-center study was conducted between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2022. All subjects that were included had a past history of ischemic stroke and were admitted after >21 days from onset. The participants underwent cognitive function tests including a Mini-Mental State Examination, Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale, Frontal Assessment Battery, and transesophageal echocardiography. RESULTS: The results of 126 participants were analyzed. The cognitive function of participants with a spontaneous echo contrast (+) in the left atrium including appendage or of those with an aorta-arch plaque with a maximum thickness >=4 mm significantly worse while neither the patent foramen ovale nor the branch extending plaque influenced cognitive function (The median cognitive scores of the spontaneous echo contrast (-) versus (+) were 26 versus 22, p < 0.01**, 26 versus 21, p < 0.001***, and 14 versus 11, p < 0.01**. Those of the aortic-arch plaque max thickness (<4 mm) versus (>=4 mm) were 26 versus 25, p < 0.05*, 27 versus 24, p < 0.05*, and 15 versus 13, p < 0.05*). CONCLUSION: Our findings show that spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrium and aortic-arch atheroma detected by transesophageal echocardiography, were negatively associated with cognitive function.
