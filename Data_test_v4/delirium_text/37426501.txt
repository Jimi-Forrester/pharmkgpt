37426501|a|Addictive use of Alcohol has been a considerable health problem, not only having impact on individual and families, but creates a lasting social burden on the society. One third of the Indian population is using alcohol in an unhealthy manner, the complications are wide and varied among which, the Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is the dominant factor. AWS is a set of symptoms that can occur when a heavy drinker suddenly stops or significantly reduces their alcohol intake. The presentation varies from mild sleep loss or anxiety to the life threatening situation like delirium (confusion). The excessive intake of unwholesome alcohol leads to Mathathiyam (Kudiveri Noi in the Siddha - Indian Tamil language) and it degrades knowledge and health according to Siddha medicine and practise. Manifestation occur as per the aggravated/ vitiated three biological forces (Vali, Azhal, Iyyam - Indian Tamil language) leads to cause impair the quality or efficiency of life, and which may even leads to death. Hence, there is a need for AWS management at an early stage. The aim is to minimize the withdrawal symptoms which prevents complications and reduces the intense use for alcohol using the siddha system of medicines. The efficacy of Inji rasayanam (Rejuvenator), Brahmi nei (Medicated ghee), and Ammukkara chooranam (Medicated powder) for AWS is well known. Therefore, it is of interest to describe the case of a 35 years old male patient presented with AWS and treated with Siddha drugs for 48 days. The condition was assessed before and after treatment using the clinical institute withdrawal assessment for alcohol scale revised (CIWA-Ar). Data shows effective management of AWS using the Siddha medicines.
