34885083|t|Clinical Biomarkers for Early Identification of Patients with Intracranial Metastatic Disease.
34885083|a|Nearly 30% of patients with cancer will develop intracranial metastatic disease (IMD), and more than half of these patients will die within a few months following their diagnosis. In light of the profound effect of IMD on survival and quality of life, there is significant interest in identifying biomarkers that could facilitate the early detection of IMD or identify patients with cancer who are at high IMD risk. In this review, we will highlight early efforts to identify biomarkers of IMD and consider avenues for future investigation.
