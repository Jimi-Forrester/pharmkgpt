27448396|t|Effect of Red Wine Polyphenols on the Expression of Transthyretin in Murine Choroid Plexus.
27448396|a|Plasmatic transthyretin may be regarded as a suitable candidate biomarker for the onset, severity, and progression of Alzheimer disease. The aim of the present experimental work was to evaluate the effect of red wine polyphenols (RWPs) on the expression of transthyretin in murine choroid plexus. In contrast to what generally reported in literature for polyphenols, our experimental results indicated a correlation between RWPs assumption and a decrease of transthyretin expression, with a non-dose dependent trend. The present study would point out the attention on the possible pro-oxidant effects of red wine polyphenols at certain doses, although further in vitro, in vivo, and clinical experiments must be performed in order to clarify the mechanisms of action at the base of observed results.
