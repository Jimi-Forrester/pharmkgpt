34413643|t|Green Synthesis and Characterization of Carboxymethyl Cellulose Fabricated Silver-Based Nanocomposite for Various Therapeutic Applications.
34413643|a|PURPOSE: The current study proposed the simple, eco-friendly and cost-effective synthesis of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) structured silver-based nanocomposite (CMC-AgNPs) using Syzygium aromaticum buds extract. METHODS: The CMC-AgNPs were characterized by ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transmission infra-red (FTIR), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques. The synthesized nanocomposites were evaluated for their bactericidal kinetics, in-vivo anti-inflammatory, anti-leishmaniasis, antioxidant and cytotoxic activities using different in-vitro and in-vivo models. RESULTS: The spherical shape nanocomposite of CMC-AgNPs was synthesized with the mean size range of 20-30 nm, and the average pore diameter is 18.2 nm while the mean zeta potential of -31.6 +- 3.64 mV. The highly significant (P < 0.005) antibacterial activity was found against six bacterial strains with the ZIs of 24.6 to 27.9 mm. More drop counts were observed in Gram-negative strains after 10 min exposure with CMC-AgNPs. Significant damage in bacterial cell membrane was also observed in atomic force microscopy (AFM) after treated with CMC-AgNPs. Nanocomposite showed highly significant anti-inflammatory activity in cotton pellet induced granuloma model (Phase I) in rats with the mean inhibitions of 43.13% and 48.68% at the doses of 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg, respectively, when compared to control. Reduction in rat paw edema (Phase II) was also highly significant (0.025 mg/kg; 42.39%; 0.05 mg/kg, 47.82%). At dose of 0.05 mg/kg, CMC-AgNPs caused highly significant decrease in leukocyte counts (922 +- 83), levels of CRP (8.4 +- 0.73 mg/mL), IL-1 (177.4 +- 21.3 pg/mL), IL-2 (83.7 +- 11.5 pg/mL), IL-6 (83.7 +- 11.5 pg/mL) and TNF-alpha (18.3 +- 5.3 pg/mL) as compared to control group. CMC-AgNPs produced highly effective anti-leishmaniasis activity with the viable Leishmania major counts decreased up to 36.7% within 24 h, and the IC50 was found to be 28.41 mug/mL. The potent DPPH radical scavenging potential was also observed for CMC-AgNPs with the IC50 value of 112 mug/mL. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity was assessed using HeLa cell lines with the LC50 of 108.2 mug/mL. CONCLUSION: The current findings demonstrate positive attributes of CMC fabricated AgNPs as a promising antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-leishmaniasis, and antioxidant agent with low cytotoxic potential.
