29487944|t|Overexpression of Amyloid Precursor Protein Promotes the Onset of Seborrhoeic Keratosis and is Related to Skin Ageing.
29487944|a|Seborrhoeic keratosis (SK) is an age-related skin disease. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of age-related Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to elucidate the expression characteristics of APP in SK tissues (n = 50), and explore whether the production of APP is related to the onset of SK and skin ageing, including ultraviolet (UV)-induced ageing, as observed in normal skin (n = 79). The results of immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR showed that APP and its downstream products (i.e. amyloid-beta42) were more highly expressed in SK than in paired adjacent normal skin tissues. In contrast, the expression of its key secretase (i.e. beta-secretase1) was generally low. Furthermore, APP expression was higher in UV-exposed than non-exposed skin sites, and expression in the older age group (61-85 years) was greater than that in the younger age group (41-60 years) in SK tissues (p<0.05). APP expression correlated positively with age in epidermis (p<0.05), but not in dermis. These findings suggest that overexpression of APP may promote the onset of SK and is a marker of skin ageing and UV damage. Further research will elucidate whether therapeutic mitigation of increased levels of APP in the skin might delay the onset of SK and skin ageing.
