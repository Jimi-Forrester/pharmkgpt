33150583|a|BACKGROUND: Atabecestat is an orally administered BACE inhibitor developed to treat Alzheimer's disease. Elevations in hepatic enzymes were detected in a number of in trial patients, which resulted in termination of the drug development programme. Immunohistochemical characterization of liver tissue from an index case of atabecestat-mediated liver injury revealed an infiltration of T-lymphocytes in areas of hepatocellular damage. This coupled with the fact that liver injury had a delayed onset suggests that the adaptive immune system may be involved in the pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to generate and characterize atabecestat(metabolite)-responsive T-cell clones from patients with liver injury. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured with atabecestat and its metabolites (diaminothiazine [DIAT], N-acetyl DIAT & epoxide) and cloning was attempted in a number of patients. Atabecestat(metabolite)-responsive clones were analysed in terms of T-cell phenotype, function, pathways of T-cell activation and cross-reactivity with structurally related compounds. RESULTS: CD4+ T-cell clones activated with the DIAT metabolite were detected in 5 out of 8 patients (up to 4.5% cloning efficiency). Lower numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ clones displayed reactivity against atabecestat. Clones proliferated and secreted IFN-gamma, IL-13 and cytolytic molecules following atabecestat or DIAT stimulation. Certain atabecestat and DIAT-responsive clones cross-reacted with N-acetyl DIAT; however, no cross-reactivity was observed between atabecestat and DIAT. CD4+ clones were activated through a direct, reversible compound-HLA class II interaction with no requirement for protein processing. CONCLUSION: The detection of atabecestat metabolite-responsive T-cell clones activated via a pharmacological interactions pathway in patients with liver injury is indicative of an immune-based mechanism for the observed hepatic enzyme elevations.
