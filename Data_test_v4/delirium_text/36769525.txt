36769525|t|Assessment of Clinical Indicators Registered on Admission to the Hospital Related to Mortality Risk in Cancer Patients with COVID-19.
36769525|a|BACKGROUND: Oncology patients are a particularly vulnerable group to the severe course of COVID-19 due to, e.g., the suppression of the immune system. The study aimed to find links between parameters registered on admission to the hospital and the risk of later death in cancer patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The study included patients with a reported history of malignant tumor (n = 151) and a control group with no history of cancer (n = 151) hospitalized due to COVID-19 between March 2020 and August 2021. The variables registered on admission were divided into categories for which we calculated the multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were successfully obtained for the following categories: Patient data, Comorbidities, Signs recorded on admission, Medications used before hospitalization and Laboratory results recorded on admission. With the models developed for oncology patients, we identified the following variables that registered on patients' admission were linked to significantly increased risk of death. They are: male sex, presence of metastases in neoplastic disease, impaired consciousness (somnolence or confusion), wheezes/rhonchi, the levels of white blood cells and neutrophils. CONCLUSION: Early identification of the indicators of a poorer prognosis may serve clinicians in better tailoring surveillance or treatment among cancer patients with COVID-19.
