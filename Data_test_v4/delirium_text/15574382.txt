15574382|a|Nitric oxide (NO) free radical as a major signaling molecule in nervous systems has been shown to have close relationship with neurodegenerative diseases. The results about the relation of NO and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and stroke in recent years are reviewed. Particularly, the results of antioxidants and NO in neurodegenerative disorders from author's own laboratory are included in this paper.
