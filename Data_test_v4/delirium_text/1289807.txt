1289807|t|On the base sequence of the promoter of Alzheimer's disease amyloid A4 precursor gene in transcription initiation.
1289807|a|The base sequence of a specific DNA region of the APP gene identified as the promoter was analyzed by means of the quantity Sr corresponding to superdelocalizability of oxygen ion of each phosphate for the ten DNA dimer units (XY/Y' X') and the six [(XY/Y'X')+H+] complexes. The base sequence of the -35 signal was determined to be 5'-CAGCTG-3' (-49 to -44). On the other hand, the base sequence of the -10 signal was found several ones. Therefore, transcription is to initiate at multiple sites. The mechanisum how RNA polymerases can recognize each transcription site, was proposed. The result explains fairly well some characteristics of the promoter of the APP gene experimentally found so far.
