8761993|t|No association between very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDL-R) and Alzheimer disease in American Caucasians.
8761993|a|The very low density lipoprotein receptor gene (VLDL-R) is a receptor for apolipoprotein-epsilon (APOE)-containing lipoproteins, and thus has been suggested as a possible risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD). Recently, Okuizumi et al. [Nature Genet, II (1995) 207-209] reported an association between the 96 bp allele at the VLDL-R locus and AD in a Japanese population. The association resulted in a two-fold increase of risk that decreased with increasing age. We have examined this association in 316 Caucasian sporadic AD patients, comparing their findings to 160 Caucasian AD spouse controls. We also investigated 53 late-onset Caucasian AD families for association and linkage. Our data failed to confirm linkage and/or association to the VLDL-R locus. Stratification by age at onset or APOE genotype also failed to show significant results.
