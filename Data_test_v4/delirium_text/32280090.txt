However, less is known about this disparity among Veterans. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the racial disparity in AD/ADRD among the Veterans. METHODS: Of the 5,413,418 Veterans>=65 years receiving care at the Veterans Health Administration (1999-2016), 4,045,269 were free of prevalent AD/ADRD, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder at baseline. Of these, 432,469 were African American. Race was self-identified and incident AD/ADRD during 20 (median 6.7) years of follow-up was ascertained using International Classification of Diseases codes. RESULTS: Patients had a mean age of 70.4 (+-6.6) years and 97.8% were men. Age-sex-adjusted incidence of AD/ADRD per 1,000 person-year was 19.3 and 10.8 for African American and white Veterans, respectively (age-sex-adjusted hazard ratio associated with African American race, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.75-1.79; p < 0.0001). This association remained essentially unchanged after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio, 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.65-1.69; p < 0.0001). Among the key baseline characteristics that were significant predictors of AD/ADRD in both races, stroke was a significantly stronger predictor among African Americans, and Hispanic ethnicity and depression among whites (p-value for all interaction,<0.0001). CONCLUSION: The findings of a higher incidence of AD/ADRD among African American Veterans is consistent with the findings in the general population reported in the literature, although the overall incidence appears to be lower than that in the general population. Future studies need to examine this disparity in incidence as well as the between-race heterogeneity in AD/ADRD risk.
