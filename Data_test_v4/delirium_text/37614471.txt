37614471|t|A nerve-wracking buzz: lessons from Drosophila models of peripheral neuropathy and axon degeneration.
37614471|a|The degeneration of axons and their terminals occurs following traumatic, toxic, or genetically-induced insults. Common molecular mechanisms unite these disparate triggers to execute a conserved nerve degeneration cascade. In this review, we will discuss how models of peripheral nerve injury and neuropathy in Drosophila have led the way in advancing molecular understanding of axon degeneration and nerve injury pathways. Both neuron-intrinsic as well as glial responses to injury will be highlighted. Finally, we will offer perspective on what additional questions should be answered to advance these discoveries toward clinical interventions for patients with neuropathy.
