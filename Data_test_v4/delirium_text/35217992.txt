35217992|t|Nanotechnological approaches for pentamidine delivery.
35217992|a|Pentamidine (PTM), which is a diamine that is widely known for its antimicrobial activity, is a very interesting drug whose mechanism of action is not fully understood. In recent years, PTM has been proposed as a novel potential drug candidate for the treatment of mental illnesses, myotonic dystrophy, diabetes, and tumors. Nevertheless, the systemic administration of PTM causes severe side effects, especially nephrotoxicity. In order to efficiently deliver PTM and reduce its side effects, several nanosystems that take advantage of the chemical characteristics of PTM, such as the presence of two positively charged amidine groups at physiological pH, have been proposed as useful delivery tools. Polymeric, lipidic, inorganic, and other types of nanocarriers have been reported in the literature for PTM delivery, and they are all in different development phases. The available approaches for the design of PTM nanoparticulate delivery systems are reported in this review, with a particular emphasis on formulation strategies and in vitro/in vivo applications. Furthermore, a critical view of the future developments of nanomedicine for PTM applications, based on recent repurposing studies, is provided. Created with BioRender.com.
