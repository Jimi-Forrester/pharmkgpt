34487050|a|Chronic periodontitis caused by Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) infection generally lasts for a lifetime. The long-term existence and development of P. gingivalis infection gradually aggravate the accumulation of inflammatory signals and toxic substances in the body. Recent evidence has revealed that P. gingivalis infection may be relevant to some central nervous system (CNS) diseases. The current work collects information and tries to explore the possible relationship between P. gingivalis infection and CNS diseases, including the interaction or pathways between peripheral infection and CNS injury, and the underlying neurotoxic mechanisms.
