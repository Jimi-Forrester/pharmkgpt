23849878|t|3-Hydroxybutyrate methyl ester as a potential drug against Alzheimer's disease via mitochondria protection mechanism.
23849878|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is induced by many reasons, including decreased cellular utilization of glucose and brain cell mitochondrial damages. Degradation product of microbially synthesized polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), namely, 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB), can be an alternative to glucose during sustained hypoglycemia. In this study, the derivative of 3HB, 3-hydroxybutyrate methyl ester (HBME), was used by cells as an alternative to glucose. HBME inhibited cell apoptosis under glucose deprivation, rescued activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes that were impaired in AD patients and decreased the generation of ROS. Meanwhile, HBME stabilized the mitochondrial membrane potential. In vivo studies showed that HBME crossed the blood brain barrier easier compared with charged 3HB, resulting in a better bioavailability. AD mice treated with HBME performed significantly better (p < 0.05) in the Morris water maze compared with other groups, demonstrating that HBME has a positive in vivo pharmaceutical effect to improve the spatial learning and working memory of mice. A reduced amyloid-beta deposition in mouse brains after intragastric administration of HBME was also observed. Combined with the in vitro and in vivo results, HBME was proposed to be a drug candidate against AD, its working mechanism appeared to be mediated by various effects of protecting mitochondrial damages.
