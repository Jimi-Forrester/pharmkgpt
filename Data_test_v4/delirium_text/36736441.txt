36736441|a|The number of people diagnosed with metabolic syndrome (MetS) has increased dramatically to reach alarming proportions worldwide. The origin of MetS derives from bad eating habits and sedentary lifestyle. Most people consume foods high in carbohydrates and saturated fat. In recent years, it has been reported that alterations in insulin at the brain level could have an impact on the appearance of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia, depression, and other types of disorders that compromise brain function. These alterations have been associated with damage to the structure and function of neurons located in the reptilian and limbic systems, a decrease in dendritic arborization and an exacerbated inflammatory state that impaired learning and memory and increased in the state of stress and anxiety. Although the molecular mechanisms induced by MetS to cause neurodegeneration are not fully understood. The aim of this study is to know the effect of the intake of hypercaloric diets on the structure and function of neurons located in the frontal cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus and its impact on behavior in rats with metabolic syndrome. In conclusion, the present study illustrated that chronic exposure to hypercaloric diets, with a high content of sugars and saturated fatty acids, induces a proinflammatory state and exacerbates oxidative stress in brain regions such as the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and frontal cortex, leading to dysfunction. metabolism, neuronal damage, and recognition memory loss.
