38947090|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) biomarker measurement is key to aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. In the research setting, participant recruitment and retention and optimization of sample use, is one of the main challenges that observational studies face. Thus, obtaining accurate established biomarker measurements for stratification and maximizing use of the precious samples is key. Accurate technologies are currently available for established biomarkers, mainly immunoassays and immunoprecipitation liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (IP-MS), and some of them are already being used in clinical settings. Although some immunoassays- and IP-MS based platforms provide multiplexing for several different coding proteins there is not a current platform that can measure all the stablished and emerging biomarkers in one run. The NUcleic acid Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay (NULISA ) is a mid-throughput platform with antibody-based measurements with a sequencing output that requires 15muL of sample volume to measure more than 100 analytes, including those typically assayed for AD. Here we benchmarked and compared the AD-relevant biomarkers including in the NULISA against validated assays, in both CSF and plasma. Overall, we have found that CSF measures of Ass42/40, NfL, GFAP, and p-tau217 are highly correlated and have similar predictive performance when measured by immunoassay, mass-spectrometry or NULISA. In plasma, p-tau217 shows a performance similar to that reported with other technologies when predicting amyloidosis. Other established and exploratory biomarkers (total tau, p-tau181, NRGN, YKL40, sTREM2, VILIP1 among other) show a wide range of correlation values depending on the fluid and the platform. Our results indicate that the multiplexed immunoassay platform produces reliable results for established biomarkers in CSF that are useful in research settings, with the advantage of measuring additional novel biomarkers using minimal sample volume.
