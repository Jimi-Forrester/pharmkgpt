26492244|t|Folic Acid Inhibits Amyloid beta-Peptide Production through Modulating DNA Methyltransferase Activity in N2a-APP Cells.
26492244|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease resulting in progressive dementia, and is a principal cause of dementia among older adults. Folate acts through one-carbon metabolism to support the methylation of multiple substrates. We hypothesized that folic acid supplementation modulates DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity and may alter amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) production in AD. Mouse Neuro-2a cells expressing human APP695 were incubated with folic acid (2.8-40 mumol/L), and with or without zebularine (the DNMT inhibitor). DNMT activity, cell viability, Abeta and DNMTs expression were then examined. The results showed that folic acid stimulated DNMT gene and protein expression, and DNMT activity. Furthermore, folic acid decreased Abeta protein production, whereas inhibition of DNMT activity by zebularine increased Abeta production. The results indicate that folic acid induces methylation potential-dependent DNMT enzymes, thereby attenuating Abeta production.
