32664512|t|Genetic Variation in Complex Traits in Transgenic alpha-Synuclein Strains of Caenorhabditis elegans.
32664512|a|Different genetic backgrounds can modify the effect of mutated genes. Human alpha-synuclein (SNCA) gene encodes alpha-synuclein, and its oligomeric complexes accumulate with age and mediate the disruption of cellular homeostasis, resulting in the neuronal death that is characteristic of Parkinson's Disease. Polymorphic variants modulate this complex pathologic mechanism. Previously, we constructed five transgenic introgression lines of a Caenorhabditis elegans model of alpha-synuclein using genetic backgrounds that are genetically diverse from the canonical wild-type Bristol N2. A gene expression analysis revealed that the alpha-synuclein transgene differentially affects genome-wide transcription due to background modifiers. To further investigate how complex traits are affected in these transgenic lines, we measured the alpha-synuclein transgene expression, the overall accumulation of the fusion protein of alpha-synuclein and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), the lysosome-related organelles, and the body size. By using quantitative PCR (qPCR), we demonstrated stable and similar expression levels of the alpha-synuclein transgene in different genetic backgrounds. Strikingly, we observed that the levels of the a-synuclein:YFP fusion protein vary in different genetic backgrounds by using the COPAS  biosorter. The quantification of the Nile Red staining assay demonstrates that alpha-synuclein also affects lysosome-related organelles and body size. Our results show that the same alpha-synuclein introgression in different C. elegans backgrounds can produces differing effects on complex traits due to background modifiers.
