32251872|a|BACKGROUND: Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) could induce neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). microRNA (miR)-34a-5p and miR-125b-5p have been reported to be aberrantly expressed in AD patients. However, the roles and mechanisms of these two miRNAs in AD remain poorly understood. METHODS: Serum samples of 27 AD patients were collected. Primary mouse cortical neurons (MCN) and Neuro2a (N2a) cells were incubated with Abeta. The expression levels of miR-34a-5p, miR-125b-5p and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot. The effect of miRNAs or epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on Abeta-induced neurotoxicity was investigated by cell viability, Caspase 3 activity, apoptosis and intracellular ROS production. The interaction between BACE1 and miR-34a-5p or miR-125b-5p was analyzed by luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: miR-34a-5p and miR-125b-5p levels were decreased and BACE1 mRNA expression was increased in AD patients and Abeta-treated MCN and N2a cells. Addition of miR-34a-5p or miR-125b-5p attenuated Abeta-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress. BACE1 acted as a target of miR-34a-5p and miR-125b-5p and its restoration weakened the effect of miR-34a-5p or miR-125b-5p on Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, EGCG could mitigate Abeta-induced neurotoxicity, which might be associated with miR-34a-5p and miR-125b-5p. CONCLUSION: miR-34a-5p and miR-125b-5p inhibited Abeta-induced neurotoxicity by decreasing apoptosis and oxidative stress via targeting BACE1, providing novel targets for treatment of AD.
