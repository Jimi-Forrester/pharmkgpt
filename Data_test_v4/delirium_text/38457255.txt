38457255|t|CD2AP is a potential prognostic biomarker of renal clear cell carcinoma.
38457255|a|BACKGROUND: CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) is a podocyte-associated gene and its reduced expression is associated with the development of proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis. However, few studies have focused on the correlation between the expression and prognosis of CD2AP in renal clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Therefore, we aimed to assess the regulation of CD2AP expression and prognostic value in ccRCC. METHODS: Multiple databases were employed to examine the expression of CD2AP in ccRCC. RT-qPCR, Western Blot and immunohistochemistry were used to validate CD2AP expression in different cell lines and tissue samples. Kaplan-Meier analysis and ROC curve analysis were performed on the predictive prognostic performance of CD2AP. COX regression was used to construct CD2AP-related prognostic models. The TIMER and TISIDB databases were used to analyze the correlation of tumor-infiltrating immune cells with gene expression, mutations, somatic copy number variation, and immune molecules. Mass spectrometry was used to detect methylation status of the promoter CpG site of CD2AP in multiple cells. RESULTS: We found that CD2AP expression was downregulated in ccRCC and its lower expression level was correlation with worse patient prognosis, higher tumor stage and grade and distant metastasis through analysis of databases, ccRCC cell lines and clinical tissue samples. Moreover, database and mass spectrometry techniques identified and validated cg12968598 hypermethylation as one of the key reasons for the downregulation of CD2AP expression. CD2AP expression was also associated with macrophage and neutrophil infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results suggest that CD2AP can be used as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in ccRCC patients and that DNA hypermethylation plays an important role in reducing CD2AP expression.
