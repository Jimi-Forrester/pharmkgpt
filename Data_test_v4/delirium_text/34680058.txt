34680058|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes infectious disease, and manifests in a wide range of symptoms from asymptomatic to severe illness and even death. Severity of infection is related to many risk factors, including aging and an array of underlying conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cancer. It remains poorly understood how these conditions influence the severity of COVID-19. Expansion of the CD28null senescent T-cell populations, a common phenomenon in aging and several chronic inflammatory conditions, is associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates in COVID-19. Here, we summarize the potential mechanisms whereby CD28null cells drive adverse outcomes in disease and predispose patients to devastating COVID-19, and discuss possible treatments for individuals with high counts of CD28null senescent T-cells.
