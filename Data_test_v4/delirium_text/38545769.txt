38545769|a|Recently, natural herbs have gained increasing attention owing to their comparatively low toxicity levels and the abundance of historical medical documentation regarding their use. Nevertheless, owing to a lack of knowledge regarding these herbs and their compounds, attempts to find those that could be beneficial for treating diseases have often been ad hoc; thus, there is now a growing demand for an in silico method to identify beneficial herbs. In this study, we present a computational approach for identifying natural herbs specifically effective in treating cognitive decline in AD sufferers, which analyzes the similarities between herbal compounds and known drugs targeting AD-related proteins. Our in silico method suggests that C. ternata can improve cognitive decline in AD sufferers. Behavioral tests with an AD mouse model for the confirmation of the in-silico prediction reveals that C. ternata significantly alleviated the cognitive decline (memory and motor functions) caused by neurodegeneration. Further pathology analyses reveal that C. ternata decreases the level of Abeta plaques, reduces neuroinflammation, and promotes autophagy flux, and thus C. ternata can be clinically effective for preventing mild cognitive impairment during the early stages of AD. These findings highlight the potential utility of our in silico method and the potential clinical application of the identified natural herb in treating and preventing AD.
