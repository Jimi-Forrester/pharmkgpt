37341227|t|Fructose Consumption Alters Biogenic Amines Associated with Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors.
37341227|a|BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the major cause of mortality worldwide, whose most prominent risk factor is unhealthy eating habits, such as high fructose intake. Biogenic amines (BAs) perform important functions in the human body. However, the effect of fructose consumption on BA levels is still unclear, as is the association between these and CVD risk factors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to establish the association between BA levels and CVD risk factors in animals that consumed fructose. METHODS: Male Wistar rats received standard chow (n=8) or standard chow + fructose in drinking water (30%) (n=8) over a 24-week period. At the end of this period, the nutritional and metabolic syndrome (MS) parameters and plasmatic BA levels were analyzed. A 5% level of significance was adopted. RESULTS: Fructose consumption led to MS, reduced the levels of tryptophan and 5-hydroxitryptophan, and increased histamine. Tryptophan, histamine, and dopamine showed a correlation with metabolic syndrome parameters. CONCLUSION: Fructose consumption alters BAs associated with CVD risk factors.
