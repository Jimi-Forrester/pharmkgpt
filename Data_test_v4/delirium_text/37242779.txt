37242779|t|Cinchonain Ia Shows Promising Antitumor Effects in Combination with L-Asparaginase-Loaded Nanoliposomes.
37242779|a|Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide, with no effective and safe treatment to date. This study is the first to co-conjugate the natural compound cinchonain Ia, which has promising anti-inflammatory activity, and L-asparaginase (ASNase), which has anticancer potential, to manufacture nanoliposomal particles (CALs). The CAL nanoliposomal complex had a mean size of approximately 118.7 nm, a zeta potential of -47.00 mV, and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.120. ASNase and cinchonain Ia were encapsulated into liposomes with approximately 93.75% and 98.53% efficiency, respectively. The CAL complex presented strong synergistic anticancer potency, with a combination index (CI) < 0.32 in two-dimensional culture and 0.44 in a three-dimensional model, as tested on NTERA-2 cancer stem cells. Importantly, the CAL nanoparticles demonstrated outstanding antiproliferative efficiency on cell growth in NTERA-2 cell spheroids, with greater than 30- and 2.5-fold increases in cytotoxic activity compared to either cinchonain Ia or ASNase liposomes, respectively. CALs also presented extremely enhanced antitumor effects, reaching approximately 62.49% tumor growth inhibition. Tumorized mice under CALs treatment showed a survival rate of 100%, compared to 31.2% in the untreated control group (p < 0.01), after 28 days of the experiment. Thus, CALs may represent an effective material for anticancer drug development.
