7724043|a|Glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-containing proteoglycans are associated with the neuritic plaques and cerebrovascular beta-amyloid deposits of Alzheimer's disease as well as with the amyloid deposits of prion and other disorders. GAGs and other sulfate-containing compounds have previously been shown to bind beta-amyloid peptide in vitro, suggesting possible effects of beta-amyloid deposition and/or toxicity in vivo. Using reduction of the redox dye 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) to measure beta-amyloid neurotoxicity in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, several polysulfated GAGs and synthetic sulfate-containing compounds were found to attenuate the neurotoxic effects of beta-amyloid fragments beta 25-35 and beta 1-40. These results suggest that by binding beta-amyloid these compounds may prevent toxic interactions of the peptide with cells.
