27987306|t|Identification of Sidt2 as a lysosomal cation-conducting protein.
27987306|a|A screen to identify lysosomal-expressed ion channels led to the discovery of the human Sidt2 protein. Sidt2 is expressed within lysosomal organelles but as a result of heterologous overexpression the protein is also detectable within the plasma membrane of human embryonic kidney cells. The overexpressed protein leads to cell depolarization upon sodium addition. Accordingly in whole-cell patch clamp experiments a spontaneous noninactivating monovalent cation current can be detected in Sidt2-overexpressing cells. Strong overexpression of Sidt2 in HEK293 cells is attended by a significant reduction/loss of detectable lysosomes, indicating that the overexpressed protein leads to lysosomal dysfunction, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Sidt2 is located on chromosome 11q23, a locus repeatedly found by chromosomal mapping of Alzheimer's disease-related genes.
