35383067|t|Potentially avoidable causes of hospitalisation in people with dementia: contemporaneous associations by stage of dementia in a South London clinical cohort.
35383067|a|OBJECTIVES: To estimate the frequency of all-cause and ambulatory care sensitive condition (ACSCs)-related hospitalisations among individuals with dementia. In addition, to investigate differences by stage of dementia based on recorded cognitive function. SETTING: Data from a large London dementia care clinical case register, linked to a national hospitalisation database. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged >=65 years with a confirmed dementia diagnosis with recorded cognitive function. OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute general hospital admissions were evaluated within 6 months of a randomly selected cognitive function score in patients with a clinical diagnosis of dementia. To evaluate associations between ACSC-related hospital admissions (overall and individual ACSCs) and stage of dementia, an ordinal regression was performed, modelling stage of dementia as the dependant variable (to facilitate efficient model selection, with no implication concerning the direction of causality). RESULTS: Of the 5294 people with dementia, 2993 (56.5%) had at least one hospitalisation during a 12-month period of evaluation, and 1192 (22.5%) had an ACSC-related admission. Proportions with an all-cause or ACSC-related hospitalisation were greater in the groups with more advanced dementia (all-cause 53.9%, 57.1% and 60.9%, p 0.002; ACSC-related 19.5%, 24.0% and 25.3%, p<0.0001 in the mild, moderate and severe groups, respectively). An ACSC-related admission was associated with 1.3-fold (95% CI 1.1 to 1.5) increased odds of more severe dementia after adjusting for demographic factors. Concerning admissions for individual ACSCs, the most common ACSC was urinary tract infection /pyelonephritis (9.8% of hospitalised patients) followed by pneumonia (7.1%); in an adjusted model, these were each associated with 1.4-fold increased odds of more severe dementia (95% CI 1.2 to 1.7 and 1.1 to 1.7, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Potentially avoidable hospitalisations were common in people with dementia, particularly in those with greater cognitive impairment. Our results call for greater attention to the extent of cognitive status impairment, and not just dementia diagnosis, when evaluating measures to reduce the risk of potentially avoidable hospitalisations.
