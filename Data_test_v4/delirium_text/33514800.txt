33514800|t|Linking the oral microbiome and salivary cytokine abundance to circadian oscillations.
33514800|a|Saliva has immense potential as a diagnostic fluid for identification and monitoring of several systemic diseases. Composition of the microbiome and inflammation has been associated and reflective of oral and overall health. In addition, the relative ease of collection of saliva further strengthens large-scale diagnostic purposes. However, the future clinical utility of saliva cannot be fully determined without a detailed examination of daily fluctuations that may occur within the oral microbiome and inflammation due to circadian rhythm. In this study, we explored the association between the salivary microbiome and the concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-8 in the saliva of 12 healthy adults over a period of 24 h by studying the 16S rRNA gene followed by negative binomial mixed model regression analysis. To determine the periodicity and oscillation patterns of both the oral microbiome and inflammation (represented by the cytokine levels), two of the twelve subjects were studied for three consecutive days. Our results indicate that the Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) belonging to Prevotella, SR1 and Ruminococcaceae are significantly associated to IL-1beta while Prevotella and Granulicatella were associated with IL-8. Our findings have also revealed a periodicity of both the oral microbiome (OTUs) and inflammation (cytokine levels) with identifiable patterns between IL-1beta and Prevotella, and IL-6 with Prevotella, Neisseria and Porphyromonas. We believe that this study represents the first measure and demonstration of simultaneous periodic fluctuations of cytokine levels and specific populations of the oral microbiome.
