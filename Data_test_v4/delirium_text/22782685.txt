22782685|a|The ongoing debate as to whether we are or are not early enough in treatment for Alzheimer's disease presents distinct vantage points. Points expressed range from stressing the need for early preventive measures to highlighting the failure of "alternative" therapies, and concluding that we are unfortunately doing all that we can at present. Herein, we stress the worth of nutritional intervention, and review why such studies are often inherently compromised. We conclude that considerable education is needed to advance lifestyle modifications early enough to obtain their optimal effect, and instead of positioning "classical" interventions against "alternative" interventions, the combinations of both may impart maximal benefit. The introduction of novel detection methods at the earliest indications of cognitive impairment may provide a window of opportunity for initiation of preventative approaches.
