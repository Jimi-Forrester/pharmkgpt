33271123|t|Cross-Cultural Adaptation and Validation of the Italian Version of the Observational Scale of Level of Arousal.
33271123|a|OBJECTIVES: Along with deficit of attention, level of arousal is a primary criterion for the diagnosis of delirium. The Observational Scale of Level of Arousal (OSLA) is a quick, simple, and observational instrument used to evaluate the variation of arousal for rapid screening of delirium in clinical practice. The current study aims to perform a cross-cultural adaption of and to validate the Italian version of the OSLA scale to detect delirium in older aged, hospitalized patients. DESIGN: Longitudinal study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In hospital and transitional care setting. Old age patients. METHODS: A cross-cultural adaptation of the OSLA from English into Italian was conducted, including back-translation. The validation of the OSLA was assessed in 116 older patients (age >65 years) admitted to geriatric, internal medicine, and transitional care wards. The 4 "A"s Test serves as the gold standard for the measurement of delirium. RESULTS: Incident delirium was assessed longitudinally at different time points during hospitalization. The Italian version of OSLA demonstrated adequate internal consistency, specificity, sensitivity, agreement, test-retest reliability, and sensitivity to change, indicating adequate its clinometric properties in the detection of delirium in a real world hospitalized cohort of older adults. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The current study is among the few studies to assess arousal as a core feature of delirium by virtue of a longitudinal assessment of delirium, moving a step forward in the implementation of a brief and easy to use delirium-screening tool for the measurement of important clinical outcomes in a frail, old aged hospitalized population.
