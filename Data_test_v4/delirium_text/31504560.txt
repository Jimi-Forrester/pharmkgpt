31504560|t|Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions During Antipsychotic Treatment: Results of AMSP, A Drug Surveillance Program Between 1993 and 2013.
31504560|a|BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases are still the leading cause of global mortality. Some antipsychotic agents can show severe cardiovascular side effects and are also associated with metabolic syndrome. METHODS: This observational study was based on data of AMSP (Arzneimittelsicherheit in der Psychiatrie), a multicenter drug surveillance program in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, that recorded severe drug reactions in psychiatric inpatients. RESULTS: A total of 404 009 inpatients were monitored between 1993 and 2013, whereas 291 510 were treated with antipsychotics either in combination or alone. There were 376 cases of severe cardiovascular adverse reactions reported in the given timespan, yielding a relative frequency of 0.13%. The study revealed that incidence rates of cardiovascular adverse reactions were highest during treatment with ziprasidone (0.35%), prothipendyl (0.32%), and clozapine (0.23%). The lowest rate of cardiovascular symptoms occurred during treatment with promethazine (0.03%) as well as with aripiprazole (0.06%). The most common clinical symptoms were orthostatic collapse and severe hypotonia, sinustachycardia, QTc prolongation, myocarditis, and different forms of arrhythmia. The dosage at the timepoint when severe cardiovascular events occurred was not higher in any of the given antipsychotics than in everyday clinical practice and was in average therapeutic ranges. In terms of subclasses of antipsychotics, no significant statistical difference was seen in the overall frequencies of adverse reactions cases, when first-generation high potency, first-generation low potency, and second-generation antipsychotics were compared. Thirty percent of adverse events among second-generation antipsychotics were induced by clozapine. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings on cardiovascular adverse reactions contribute to a better understanding of cardiovascular risk profiles of antipsychotic agents in inpatients.
