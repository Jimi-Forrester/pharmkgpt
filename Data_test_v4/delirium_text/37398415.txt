37398415|a|Cognitive decline has been reported as a common consequence of COVID-19, and studies have suggested a link between COVID-19 infection and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. To shed light on this link, we conducted an integrated genomic analysis using a novel Robust Rank Aggregation method to identify common transcriptional signatures of the frontal cortex, a critical area for cognitive function, between individuals with AD and COVID-19. We then performed various analyses, including the KEGG pathway, GO ontology, protein-protein interaction, hub gene, gene-miRNA, and gene-transcription factor interaction analyses to identify molecular components of biological pathways that are associated with AD in the brain also show similar changes in severe COVID-19. Our findings revealed the molecular mechanisms underpinning the association between COVID-19 infection and AD development and identified several genes, miRNAs, and TFs that may be targeted for therapeutic purposes. However, further research is needed to investigate the diagnostic and therapeutic applications of these findings.
