35103068|a|Metastasis and recurrence are major causes of colorectal cancer (CRC) death, but their molecular mechanisms are unclear. In this study, genes associated with CRC metastasis and recurrence were identified by weighted gene coexpression network analysis, selecting the top 25% most variant genes in the dataset GSE33113. By average linkage hierarchical clustering, a total of 21 modules were generated. One key module was identified as the most relevant to the prognosis of CRC. Gene Ontology analysis indicated that genes associated with tumor metastasis and recurrence in this module were significantly enriched in inflammatory biological functions. Functional analysis was performed on the key module, and candidate hub genes (ADAM8, LYN, and S100A9) were screened out by expression and survival analysis. In summary, the three core genes identified in this study could greatly improve our understanding of CRC metastasis and recurrence. The results also provide a theoretical basis for the use of three core genes (ADAM8, LYN, and S100A9) as a combined marker for early diagnosis, which could benefit CRC patients.
