36286550|t|The Glymphatic System: a Potential Key Player in Bacterial Meningitis.
36286550|a|The glial-lymphatic system (glymphatic system) is a recently characterized fluid clearance pathway of the central nervous system. Glymphatic system disfunctions leading to defects in drainage of the cerebrospinal fluid have been associated with several neurological disorders. In their article, J. S. Generoso, S. Thorsdottir, A. Collodel, R. R. E. Santo, et al. (mBio 13:e01886-22, 2022, https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01886-22) have now associated impaired glymphatic system functionality to neurological sequelae of murine meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their work provides an initial and important step into the systematic evaluation of a potential impact of glymphatic system functionality on disease severity and sequelae in meningitis.
