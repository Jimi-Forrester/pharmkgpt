37510818|t|One-Year Survival after Cardiac Surgery in Frail Older People-Social Support Matters: A Prospective Cohort Study.
37510818|a|There are increasing rates of cardiac surgery in the elderly. Frailty, depression, and social vulnerability are frequently present in older people, and should be considered while assessing risk and providing treatment options. We aimed to analyse the impact of clinically relevant variables on survival at one year, and identify areas of future intervention. We performed a prospective cohort study at a University Hospital, with a sample of 309 elective cardiac surgery patients 65 years old and over. Their socio-demographic and clinical variables were collected. Frailty prevalence was 61.3%, while depression was absent in the majority of patients. Mortality was 1.6% and 7.8% at 30 days and 12 months, respectively. After Kaplan-Meier analysis, severe frailty (p = 0.003), severe depression (p = 0.027), pneumonia until 30 days (p = 0.014), and re-operation until 12 months (p = 0.003) significantly reduced survival, while social support increased survival (p = 0.004). In the adjusted multivariable Cox regression model, EuroSCORE II (HR = 1.27 [95% CI 1.069-1.499] p = 0.006), pneumonia until 30 days (HR = 4.19 [95% CI 1.169-15.034] p = 0.028), re-intervention until 12 months (HR = 3.14 [95% CI 1.091-9.056] p = 0.034), and social support (HR = 0.24 [95% CI 0.079-0.727] p = 0.012) explained time until death. Regular screening for social support, depression, and frailty adds relevant information regarding risk stratification, perioperative interventions, and decision-making in older people considered for cardiac surgery.
