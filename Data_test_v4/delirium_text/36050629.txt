36050629|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative sore throat (POST) is one of the main adverse postoperative outcome after tracheal intubation using double-lumen endobronchial tubes (DLTs). The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of ultrasound (US)-guided block of the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (iSLN) for alleviating POST after intubation of DLTs. METHODS: Patients undergoing thoracic surgery between August 2019 and August 2021 were randomized into two groups depending on whether they received US-guided iSLN block immediately after the operation. In the control group, the patients underwent a thoracic surgery under general anesthesia (GA) with DLTs without any special treatment, while the patients in the experimental group received US-guided iSLN block bilaterally with 2 ml of 0.25% ropivacaine on either side immediately after the operation. The primary outcome was the grading of sore throat at three-time points after the operation, i.e., immediate extubation, 2 h after extubation, and 24 h after extubation. Secondary outcomes included the rate of nausea and vomiting, hoarseness, dyspnea, and choking cough after swallowing saliva at 2 h after extubation. RESULTS: The incidence and severity of sore throat were significantly lower in the experimental group than the control group at all time intervals (all P < 0.01). The rate of nausea and vomiting, hoarseness, dyspnea, and choking cough after swallow saliva at 2 h after extubation had no statistical difference (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The use of US-guided iSLN block can be effectively and safely applied to relieve POST after intubation of DLTs on thoracic surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study protocol was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( http://www.chictr.org.cn , NO. ChiCTR2000032188, 22/04/2020).
