38610190|t|The Time Trajectory of Choroid Plexus Enlargement in Multiple Sclerosis.
38610190|a|Choroid plexus (CP) can be seen as a watchtower of the central nervous system (CNS) that actively regulates CNS homeostasis. A growing body of literature suggests that CP alterations are involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. CPs are enlarged and inflamed in relapsing-remitting (RRMS) but also in clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) stages, far beyond MS diagnosis. Increases in the choroid plexus/total intracranial volume (CP/TIV) ratio have been robustly associated with increased lesion load, higher translocator protein (TSPO) uptake in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and thalami, as well as with higher annual relapse rate and disability progression in highly active RRMS individuals, but not in progressive MS. The CP/TIV ratio has only slightly been correlated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings (cortical or whole brain atrophy) and clinical outcomes (EDSS score) in progressive MS. Therefore, we suggest that plexus volumetric assessments should be mainly applied to the early disease stages of MS, whereas it should be taken into consideration with caution in progressive MS. In this review, we attempt to clarify the pathological significance of the temporal CP volume (CPV) changes in MS and highlight the pitfalls and limitations of CP volumetric analysis.
