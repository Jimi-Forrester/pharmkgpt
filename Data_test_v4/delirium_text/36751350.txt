36751350|t|Exploring perceptions regarding family-based delirium management in the intensive care unit.
36751350|a|Background: Delirium is a common complication in patients treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). Family members can help alleviate patient anxiety and may be able to aid in the management of delirium. This study aimed to explore the perceptions of former ICU patients and their families together, regarding the involvement of family in delirium management. Method: Nine audio-recorded, semi-structured interviews took place with former ICU patients together with a family member. Participants were interviewed after their intensive care follow-up clinic appointment in an East Midlands hospital in England. Interviews were transcribed, coded and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Three themes were identified: 'understanding about delirium'; 'influencers of delirium management: family and healthcare professionals' and 'family-based delirium care'. Participants expressed that family have a valuable role to play in the management of delirium in the ICU. However, education and guidance is needed to support the family in how delirium can be managed and the current treatment options available. It is important for ICU staff to gain an understanding of the patient's life and personality to personalise delirium management to the needs of the patient and their family. Conclusion: This study found that family presence and knowledge about the patient may be beneficial to delirium management in the ICU. Further research should investigate the effectiveness of the strategies and interventions to understand their influence on delirium management in ICU patients.
