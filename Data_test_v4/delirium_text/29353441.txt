29353441|t|Pre- and postoperative management of risk factors for postoperative delirium: who is in charge and what is its essence?
29353441|a|Postoperative delirium (POD) is an adverse clinical outcome characterized by cognitive, affective and behavioral symptoms with typically an acute onset and a fluctuating course. POD is attributed to certain patients' predisposing factors as well as to treatment-related precipitating factors. While there are several single-component interventions for the prevention of POD, evolving evidence suggests the importance of a system approach in the prevention of POD. This involves strategies by multidisciplinary teams with additional geriatric consultation services to identify risk factors for POD and to modify their impact on the perioperative course. Some patients may profit from postponing an elective surgery and undergoing a prehabilitation program to optimize his/her resilience for the surgical and anesthesiologic stressors.
