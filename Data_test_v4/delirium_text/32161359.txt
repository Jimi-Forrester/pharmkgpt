32161359|a|Reelin is a secreted protein that plays versatile roles in neuronal development and function. The strength of Reelin signaling is regulated by proteolytic processing, but its importance in vivo is not yet fully understood. Here, we generated Reelin knock-in (PA-DV KI) mice in which the key cleavage site of Reelin was abolished by mutation. As expected, the cleavage of Reelin was severely abrogated in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of PA-DV KI mice. The amount of Dab1, whose degradation is induced by Reelin signaling, decreased in these tissues, indicating that the signaling strength of Reelin was augmented. The brains of PA-DV KI mice were largely structurally normal, but unexpectedly, the hippocampal layer was disturbed. This phenotype was ameliorated in hemizygote PA-DV KI mice, indicating that excess Reelin signaling is detrimental to hippocampal layer formation. The neuronal dendrites of PA-DV KI mice had more branches and were elongated compared to wild-type mice. These results present the first direct evidence of the physiological importance of Reelin cleavage.
