2456818|t|A comparison of lexical-semantic impairments in left hemisphere stroke and Alzheimer's disease.
2456818|a|Patients with aphasia due to left hemisphere stroke and patients with Alzheimer's disease, who were matched for severity of naming impairment, were compared on tests of lexical-semantic processing. The results suggest that the lexical-semantic impairments in both groups are due to a combination of impaired access to, and loss of, lexical-semantic information, but that impaired access is more prominent in stroke patients, whereas Alzheimer's disease patients suffer a greater loss of information. The results are discussed in terms of a brain model of the storage and processing of lexical-semantic information, and with respect to implications for treatment strategies.
