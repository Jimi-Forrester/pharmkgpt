36711695|t|Comparing risk prediction models aimed at predicting hospitalizations for adverse drug events in community dwelling older adults: a protocol paper.
36711695|a|Background The objective of this paper is to describe the creation, validation, and comparison of two risk prediction modeling approaches for community-dwelling older adults to identify individuals at highest risk for adverse drug event-related hospitalizations. One approach will use traditional statistical methods, the second will use a machine learning approach. Methods We will construct medication, clinical, health care utilization, and other variables known to be associated with adverse drug event-related hospitalizations. To create the cohort, we will include older adults (>= 65 years of age) empaneled to a primary care physician within the Cedars-Sinai Health System primary care clinics with polypharmacy (>= 5 medications) or at least 1 medication commonly implicated in ADEs (certain oral hypoglycemics, anti-coagulants, anti-platelets, and insulins). We will use a Fine-Gray Cox proportional hazards model for one risk modeling approach and DataRobot, a data science and analytics platform, to run and compare several widely used supervised machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors. We will use a variety of metrics to compare model performance and to assess the risk of algorithmic bias. Discussion In conclusion, we hope to develop a pragmatic model that can be implemented in the primary care setting to risk stratify older adults to further optimize medication management.
