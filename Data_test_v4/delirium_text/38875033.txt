38875033|t|Factors Associated with Quality of Life in Patients with Dementia with Lewy Bodies: Additional Analysis of a Cross-Sectional Study.
38875033|a|Background: Quality of life (QOL) and treatment needs of patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and their caregivers are important factors to consider when developing treatment strategies. Objective: To investigate factors associated with QOL in patients with DLB, and to examine factors associated with activities of daily living (ADL) if ADL was associated with QOL. Methods: We previously conducted a questionnaire survey study to investigate the treatment needs of patients with DLB and their caregivers. This pre-specified additional analysis evaluated the Physical Component Score (PCS) and Mental Component Score (MCS) of the Short Form-8 for QOL, and the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part II total score for ADL. Results: In total, 231 patient- caregiver pairs and 38 physicians were included. Multivariable analysis of QOL showed that the MDS-UPDRS Part II total score (standard regression coefficient [beta], - 0.432) was associated with the PCS, and presence of depression (beta, - 0.330) was associated with the MCS. The severity of postural instability/gait disorder (PIGD) (beta, 0.337) and rigidity (beta, 0.266), presence of hallucinations (beta, 0.165), male sex (beta, 0.157), and use of "short stay" or "small-scale, multifunctional home care" (beta, 0.156) were associated with worsened ADL. Conclusions: In patients with DLB, QOL was negatively impacted by severity of ADL disability and depression, and ADL was negatively impacted by severity of PIGD and rigidity, hallucinations, male sex, and use of "short stay" or "small-scale, multifunctional home care."
