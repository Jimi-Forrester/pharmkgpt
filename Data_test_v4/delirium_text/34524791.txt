34524791|a|The pathological amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients contain not only the wild-type beta-amyloid (wt-Abeta) peptide sequences but also a variety of post-translationally modified variants. The pyroglutamate-3 Abeta (pyroE3-Abeta), which is generated from its truncated precursors DeltaE3-Abeta, shows the highest abundance among all modified Abeta variants. Previous works have shown that pyroE3-Abeta and/or DeltaE3-Abeta, compared with the wild-type sequences, led to a more rapid fibrillation process and final fibrils with higher neuronal cytotoxicity levels. However, much less is known about how the formation of pyroE3/DeltaE3-Abeta fibrils would affect the amyloid deposition of wt-Abeta peptides, which are the main pathological events in AD. We show in the present work that the pyroE3/DeltaE3-Abeta40 fibrils differ significantly from the wt-Abeta40 fibrils in terms of their molecular structures. When added into monomeric wt-Abeta40 peptides, these variant fibrils can cross-seed the formation of wt-Abeta40 fibrils with fibrillation kinetics that are greater than the self-seeded fibrillation of wt-Abeta40. Furthermore, the cross-seeding process modulates the molecular structures of the yielded wt-Abeta40 fibrils, which show similar features as their variant seeds. The cross-seeded fibrillation process also induces higher cytotoxicity levels compared with the self-seeded fibrillation of wt-Abeta40. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that pyroE3 and DeltaE3-Abeta40 variants may serve as triggering factors of the pathological amyloid aggregation of wt-Abeta40 and may underlie the pathological significance of pyroE3/DeltaE3-Abeta40 variants on the structural polymorphism of Abeta deposits.
