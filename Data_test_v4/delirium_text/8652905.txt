8652905|a|Delirium is a complication related with the treatment and the evolution of cancer diseases. This disorder occurs more often among patients who are under treatment (chemo or radiotherapy) and among those who are terminally ill. Estimates of prevalence of delirium range from 4% to 40%. Delirium must be detected and treated as soon as possible because it is often associated with a poor prognosis of the cancer disease and with the development of an important distress of patients and their relatives. Delirium may have several underlying causes. Management of delirium has to be symptomatic and etiological, including support of the family. Education of the caregivers, for a better detection, treatment and control of these disorders, should be more systematic in order to improve the quality of the care given to patients with cancer. The present work reviews literature concerning these different aspects.
