38098025|t|Care intervention on psychological outcomes among patients admitted to intensive care unit: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
38098025|a|BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have explored care interventions to improve the psychological outcome of intensive care unit (ICU) patients, but inconclusive evidence makes it difficult for decision-makers, managers, and clinicians to get familiar with all available literature and find appropriate interventions. This umbrella review aimed to analyze the relationship between care intervention and psychological outcomes of ICU patients based on existing systematic reviews. METHODS: An umbrella review of evidence across systematic reviews and meta-analyses published between 1987 and 2023 was undertaken. We systematically searched reviews that examined the association between care intervention and the improvement of adverse psychological outcomes in ICU patients using PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and manual reference screening. The measurement tool (AMSTAR 2) was applied to evaluate the methodological quality of included studies. The excess significance bias, between-study heterogeneity expressed by I2, small-study effect, and evidence class were estimated. RESULTS: A total of 5110 articles were initially identified from the search databases and nine of them were included in the analysis. By applying standardized criteria, only weak evidence was observed in 13 associations, even though most included reviews were of moderate to high methodological quality. These associations pertained to eight interventions (music therapy, early rehabilitation, post-ICU follow-up, ICU diary, information intervention, preoperative education, communication and psychological support, surrogate decision-making) and five psychological outcomes (post-intensive care syndrome, transfer anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression). Weak or null association was shown among the rest of the associations (e.g., weak association between music therapy and maternal anxiety or stress level). CONCLUSIONS: The evidence of these eight supporting interventions to improve the adverse psychological outcomes of ICU patients and caregivers was weak. Data from more and better-designed studies with larger sample sizes are needed to establish robust evidence.
