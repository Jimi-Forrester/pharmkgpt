33353137|t|The [DPPH /DPPH-H]-HPLC-DAD Method on Tracking the Antioxidant Activity of Pure Antioxidants and Goutweed (Aegopodium podagraria L.) Hydroalcoholic Extracts.
33353137|a|The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-reverse phase (RP)-HPLC-diode array detector (DAD) method was tested on standard antioxidants (AOs), i.e., reduced glutathione (GSH), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and alcoholic extracts of A. podagraria L. An elaborated HPLC procedure enabled the simultaneous measurement of the redox couple DPPH-R (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical)/DPPH-H (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazine). Both forms were fully separated (Rs = 2.30, alpha = 1.65) on a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column eluted with methanol-water (80:20, v/v) and detected at different wavelengths in the range of 200-600 nm. The absorbance increases of the DPPH-H as well as the DPPH-R peak inhibition were measured at different wavelengths in visible and UV ranges. The chromatographic method was optimized, according to reaction time (slow, fast kinetics), the linearity range of DPPH radical depending on the detection conditions as well as the kind of the investigated antioxidants (reference chemicals and the ground elder prepared from fresh and dry plants). The scavenging capacity was expressed by the use of percentage of peak inhibition and the IC50 parameters. The evaluated extracts displayed antioxidant activity, higher than 20% inhibition against 350 microM DPPH free radical. The results show that extract prepared from dry plants in the ultrasonic bath exhibits the highest antioxidant potential (IC50 = 64.74 +- 0.22 microL/mL).
