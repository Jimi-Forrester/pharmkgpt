34189360|t|Relationship between Toxoplasma Gondii and Psychotic Disorders with Implications toward a Brain-based Diagnostic System and Novel Treatment Approaches: A Study Protocol.
34189360|a|What role infectious agents play in the causation of psychotic disorders? To investigate this area, we have aimed to investigate the relationship between Toxoplasma gondii and psychotic disorders. A hospital-based cross-sectional study is designed. IgM and IgG antibodies to T. gondii in patients with psychotic disorders will be measured and presented in result. Seropositivity rates will be compared with first-degree relatives and healthy volunteers. Also, types of psychotic disorders and seropositivity rate will be compared. Here, we are presenting the study protocol with implications toward a brain-based diagnostic system and novel treatment approaches.
