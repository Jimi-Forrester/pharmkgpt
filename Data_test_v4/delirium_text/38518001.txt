38518001|a|BACKGROUND: To date, there is no standardized practice for the use of pharmacological sedatives during flexible bronchoscopy, particularly for elderly patients. This exploratory study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of remimazolam at a single induced dose for deep sedation in elderly patients undergoing diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy (DFB), and compare with midazolam, a commonly used sedative. METHODS: A total of 100 elderly patients (age range 65-80 yr; American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status I-III) undergoing DFB were randomly allocated into 2 groups according to the sedatives used for induction: the remimazolam group and the midazolam group. Sedation induction was initiated by an intravenous bolus of remimazolam (0.135 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg), respectively, both groups were combined with a high-dose of alfentanil (18 microg/kg), and supplemented with high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen supply at a flow rate of 45 L/min. If the target depth of sedation was not achieved, propofol would be titrated as a rescue. The primary outcome was the success rate of sedation at a single induced dose to achieve target depth (Ramsay sedation score [RSS] = 4) during induction, intraoperative changes in vital signs, postoperative follow-up situation and incidence of post-bronchoscopy adverse events were evaluated as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The success rate of sedation in the remimazolam group was significantly higher than that in the midazolam group (65.2% vs 39.6%, P = .013), while the incidence of extra sleep within 6 hours after procedure was lower in the remimazolam group as compared to the midazolam group (10.9% vs 31.3%, P = .016). No statistically significant differences were observed between the 2 groups regarding hemodynamic fluctuations, incidence of hypoxemia, and cough response during the procedure, as well as postoperative recall, willingness to undergo reexamination, and other post-bronchoscopy adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Bolus administration of remimazolam offers advantages over midazolam for deep sedation in elderly patients undergoing DFB, in terms of a higher success rate of sedation and a lower incidence of extra sleep within 6 hours after procedure, though the safety profiles of both groups were favorable.
