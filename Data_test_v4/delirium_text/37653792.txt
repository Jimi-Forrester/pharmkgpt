37653792|a|Butylphthalide can improve blood circulation in patients with acute cerebral infarction. Complement 3a receptor 1 (C3aR1) is involved in the regulation of innate immune response and pathogen monitoring, which is closely related to the pathophysiological processes of breast cancer, neurogenesis and lipid catabolism. Our study explored the therapeutic effect of butylphthalide on improving the neurological function of patients with acute anterior circulation cerebral infarction after mechanical thrombectomy, and evaluated the correlation between serum C3aR1 and butylphthalide on improving the neurological function after mechanical thrombectomy. 288 patients with acute anterior circulation cerebral infarction who were admitted to our hospital from January 2019 to November 2022 and were treated with mechanical thrombectomy for the first time were included in this retrospective study and divided into the butylphthalide group and control group that they received treatment methods. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scale was used to evaluate the patient neurological function treatment efficacy, and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scale was used to measure the patient neurological function status 3 months after surgery. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method was used to determine the content of C3aR1 in serum. Two weeks after thrombus removal, the NIHSS efficacy of the butylphthalide group and the control group were 94.44% and 72.22%, respectively. The butylphthalide group was significantly higher than the control group (P < .001). Three months after the operation, the mRS score of the butylphthalide group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P = .001), and the excellent and good rate was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < .001). The serum C3aR1 level of the butylphthalide group was significantly lower than that of the control group 2 weeks after operation and 3 months after operation (P < .001). The serum C3aR1 was positively correlated with the efficacy of NIHSS (R = 0.815, P = .004), which was positively correlated with mRS score (R = 0.774, P = .007). Butylphthalide can improve the therapeutic effect of neurological function in patients with acute anterior circulation cerebral infarction after mechanical thrombus removal. The patient serum C3aR1 is related to the patient neurotherapy efficacy and neurological function status, and its level can reflect the patient neurological function recovery to a certain extent.
