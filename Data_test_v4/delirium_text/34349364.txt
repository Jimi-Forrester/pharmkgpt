To answer this question on how it compares and contrasts with ARDS from other causes, the authors reviewed the published literature and management guidelines as well as their own clinical experience while managing patients with COVID-19 ARDS. For research, a PubMed search was conducted on 01.04.2021 using the systematic review filter to identify articles that were published using MeSH terms COVID-19 and ARDS. Systematic reviews or meta-analyses were selected from a systematic search for literature containing diagnostic, prognostic and management strategies in MEDLINE/PubMed. Those were compared and reviewed to the existing practices by the various treating specialists and recommendations were made. Specifically, the COVID-19 ARDS, its risk factors and pathophysiology, lab diagnosis, radiological findings, rational of recommendation of drugs proposed so far, oxygenation and ventilation strategies and the psychological ramifications of the disease were. discussed. Because of the high mortality in mechanically ventilated patients, the above recommendations and findings direct the potential for improvement in the management of patients with COVID-19 ARDS.
