35459104|a|BACKGROUND: Health services are critically important for older adults, particularly during the Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, COVID-19 risks, worse financial situation, and lowered income may seriously impact health services by feasibility and accessibility. Therefore, the aim of the present study was empirically to explore how health-seeking behaviors are influenced by new health conditions through COVID-19 risks, worse financial situation, and lowered income. METHODS: Data were from ELSA COVID-19 waves 1 and 2 which included a sample of 6952 and 6710 older adults in the United Kingdom, respectively. The frequency distribution analyses were conducted by Chi-square analysis by gender groups. Zero-inflated Poisson regressions were used to examine how worse financial situation and lowered income were associated with COVID-19 risks and new health conditions. Logistic regressions were employed to examine the associations of COVID-19 risks, worse financial situation, and lowered income with treatment cancellation and accessible care. Cross-sectional mediation models, cross-sectional moderation models, longitudinal mediation models, and longitudinal moderation models were conducted based on Hayes model 6, Hayes model 29, Montoya model 1, and Montoya model 2, respectively. RESULTS: Most of the sample was >65 years old, females, located in urban place, and involved in long-standing condition. Regression analysis showed that COVID-19 risks, worse financial situation, and lowered income were associated with treatment cancellation and accessible care. In the longitudinal mediations, effect coefficients of 'X'   (treatment cancellation in wave 1 (Tcn1)- treatment cancellation in wave 2 (Tcn2))(beta = -.0451, p < .0001, low limit confidence interval (LLCI) = -.0618, upper limit confidence interval (ULCI) = -.0284), 'X'   (COVID-19 risks in wave 1 (Csk1)- COVID-19 risks in wave 2 (Csk2)) (beta = .0592, p < .0001, LLCI = .0361, ULCI = .0824), and 'X'   (lowered income in wave 1 (CIn1)- lowered income in wave 2 (CIn2)) (beta = -.0351, p = .0001, LLCI = -.0523, ULCI = -.0179) were significant. Additionally, effect coefficients of 'X'   (accessible care in wave 1 (Acr1)- accessible care in wave 2 (Acr2)) (beta = .3687, p < .0001, LLCI = .3350, ULCI = .4025),'X'   (Csk1- Csk2) (beta = .0676, p = .0005, LLCI = .0294, ULCI = .1058), and 'X'   (worse financial situation in wave 1- worse financial situation in wave 2) (beta = -.0369, p = .0102, LLCI = -.0650, ULCI = -.0087) were significant. CONCLUSIONS: There were longitudinal mediating effects of COVID-19 risks, worse financial situation, and lowered income on the relationship between new health conditions and treatment cancellation and relationship between new health conditions and accessible care. These findings suggest that worse financial situation, lowered income, and COVID-19 risks exerted an influence on the relationship between new health conditions and treatment cancellation and relationship between new health conditions and accessible care among older adults. Findings suggest that longitudinal mediations may be important components of interventions aiming to meet service needs. Long-term health policy implications indicate the need for reducing COVID-19 risks, improving financial situation, and increasing income among the targeted population.
