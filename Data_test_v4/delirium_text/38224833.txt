38224833|a|OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the scientific evidence on the relationship between periodontitis and neurological disease, and particularly cerebrovascular disease and dementia. We also issue a series of recommendations regarding the prevention and management of periodontitis and these neurological diseases at dental clinics and neurology units. DEVELOPMENT: In response to a series of questions proposed by the SEPA-SEN working group, a literature search was performed, with no restrictions on study design, to identify the most relevant articles on the association between periodontitis and cerebrovascular disease and dementia from the perspectives of epidemiology, treatment, and the biological mechanisms involved in these associations. CONCLUSIONS: Periodontitis increases the risk of ischaemic stroke and Alzheimer dementia. Recurrent bacterial infections and increased low-grade systemic inflammation seem to be possible biological mechanisms underlying this association. Limited evidence suggests that various oral health interventions can reduce the future risk of cerebrovascular disease and dementia.
