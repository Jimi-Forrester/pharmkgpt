38342410|a|Nitrotyrosine, or 3-nitrotyrosine, is an oxidative post-translational modification induced by reactive nitrogen species. Although nitrotyrosine is considered as a marker of oxidative stress and has been associated with inflammation, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease and cancer, identification of nitrotyrosine-modified proteins remains challenging owing to its low stoichiometric levels in biological samples. To facilitate a comprehensive analysis of proteins and peptides containing nitrotyrosine, we optimized an immunoprecipitation-based enrichment workflow using a cell line model. The identification of proteins and peptides containing nitrotyrosine residues was carried out after peroxynitrite treatment of cell lysates, which generated modified nitrotyrosine residues on susceptible sites on proteins. We evaluated the efficacy of enriching nitrotyrosine-modified proteins and peptides by employing four different commercially available monoclonal antibodies directed against nitrotyrosine. LC-MS/MS analysis resulted in the identification of 1,377 and 1,624 nitrotyrosine-containing peptides from protein- and peptide-based enrichment experiments, respectively. Although the yield of nitrotyrosine-containing peptides was higher in experiments where peptides rather than proteins were enriched, we found a substantial proportion (37-65%) of identified nitrotyrosine-containing peptides contained nitrotyrosine at the N-terminus. However, in protein-based immunoprecipitation <9% of nitrotyrosine-containing peptides had nitrotyrosine modification at the N-terminus of the peptide. Overall, our study resulted in the identification of 2,603 nitrotyrosine-containing peptides of which >2,000 have not previously been reported. We synthesized 101 novel nitrotyrosine-containing peptides identified in our analysis and analyzed them by LC-MS/MS to validate our findings. We have confirmed the validity of 70% of these peptides, as they demonstrated a similarity score exceeding 0.7 when compared to peptides identified through experimental methods. Finally, we also validated presence of nitrotyrosine modification on PKM and EF2 proteins in peroxynitrite-treated samples by immunoblot analysis. The large catalog presented in this study along with the workflow should facilitate investigation of nitrotyrosine as an oxidative modification in a variety of settings in greater detail.
