37200642|a|Background The use of oral corticosteroids has been linked to a variety of mental health problems, including mental disorders such as anxiety, depression, and psychosis. In a recent study, researchers investigated the prevalence of steroid-induced neuropsychiatric side effects in a population of patients receiving steroid treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the association between steroids and mental disorders among patients in King Abdulaziz Medical City. Methods A retrospective descriptive study was conducted in King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from January 2016 to November 2022. Data were acquired from all the registered inpatients and outpatients who were using oral corticosteroids for more than 28 days. Data were entered into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) for analysis after data collection. The numerical data were presented as mean and standard deviation and a test of significance was applied (p<0.05). For categorical data, frequency and percentages were computed. The chi-square test of significance was applied across groups and the test of significance was computed (p<0.05). Results The study included 3138 patients who were using oral corticosteroids for more than 28 days, and electronic medical records were screened for the presence of a concurrent mental disorder. Moreover, 142 out of 3138 developed a mental disorder after the prolonged use of oral corticosteroids. The most commonly reported mental disorder was anxiety followed by psychological sexual dysfunction and depressive disorders. Gender, age, and type of steroid prescribed had a significant association (p<0.001) with the development of psychiatric adverse events. Conclusion These findings highlight the importance of monitoring patients who are receiving oral corticosteroid treatment for signs of mental health problems and adjusting treatment as needed. Healthcare providers should also educate patients about the potential risks associated with corticosteroids and encourage them to seek medical attention if they experience any mental health symptoms.
