38812709|t|Alcohol Use Disorder and Dementia: A Review.
38812709|a|PURPOSE: By 2040, 21.6% of Americans will be over age 65, and the population of those older than age 85 is estimated to reach 14.4 million. Although not causative, older age is a risk factor for dementia: every 5 years beyond age 65, the risk doubles; approximately one-third of those older than age 85 are diagnosed with dementia. As current alcohol consumption among older adults is significantly higher compared to previous generations, a pressing question is whether drinking alcohol increases the risk for Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. SEARCH METHODS: Databases explored included PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect. To accomplish this narrative review on the effects of alcohol consumption on dementia risk, the literature covered included clinical diagnoses, epidemiology, neuropsychology, postmortem pathology, neuroimaging and other biomarkers, and translational studies. Searches conducted between January 12 and August 1, 2023, included the following terms and combinations: "aging," "alcoholism," "alcohol use disorder (AUD)," "brain," "CNS," "dementia," "Wernicke," "Korsakoff," "Alzheimer," "vascular," "frontotemporal," "Lewy body," "clinical," "diagnosis," "epidemiology," "pathology," "autopsy," "postmortem," "histology," "cognitive," "motor," "neuropsychological," "magnetic resonance," "imaging," "PET," "ligand," "degeneration," "atrophy," "translational," "rodent," "rat," "mouse," "model," "amyloid," "neurofibrillary tangles," "alpha-synuclein," or "presenilin." When relevant, "species" (i.e., "humans" or "other animals") was selected as an additional filter. Review articles were avoided when possible. SEARCH RESULTS: The two terms "alcoholism" and "aging" retrieved about 1,350 papers; adding phrases-for example, "postmortem" or "magnetic resonance"-limited the number to fewer than 100 papers. Using the traditional term, "alcoholism" with "dementia" resulted in 876 citations, but using the currently accepted term "alcohol use disorder (AUD)" with "dementia" produced only 87 papers. Similarly, whereas the terms "Alzheimer's" and "alcoholism" yielded 318 results, "Alzheimer's" and "alcohol use disorder (AUD)" returned only 40 citations. As pertinent postmortem pathology papers were published in the 1950s and recent animal models of Alzheimer's disease were created in the early 2000s, articles referenced span the years 1957 to 2024. In total, more than 5,000 articles were considered; about 400 are herein referenced. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Chronic alcohol misuse accelerates brain aging and contributes to cognitive impairments, including those in the mnemonic domain. The consensus among studies from multiple disciplines, however, is that alcohol misuse can increase the risk for dementia, but not necessarily Alzheimer's disease. Key issues to consider include the reversibility of brain damage following abstinence from chronic alcohol misuse compared to the degenerative and progressive course of Alzheimer's disease, and the characteristic presence of protein inclusions in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, which are absent in the brains of those with AUD.
