30402339|t|Transient Generalized Chorea in Influenza A Encephalopathy.
30402339|a|Background: Influenza A infections are a rare cause of movement disorders. Previously described patients have suffered from acute-onset myoclonus and/or dystonia or post-viral parkinsonism. Case Report: We present the case of a 74-year-old female patient with transient generalized chorea due to influenza A-mediated encephalopathy. Discussion: We discuss whether the clinical presentation and the magnetic resonance imaging changes may be attributable to cytokine-mediated encephalopathy or to direct cytotoxic effects of the virus. Additionally, we would like to make clinicians aware of this clinical sign in the context of viral encephalopathy.
