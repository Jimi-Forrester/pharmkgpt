30791677|t|Association between Nutritional Status and Mortality after Aortic Valve Replacement Procedure in Elderly with Severe Aortic Stenosis.
30791677|a|Background: There is still a lack of data on the nutritional status of older people with aortic stenosis (AS) and the effect of poor nutrition on the occurrence of complications and mortality after an aortic valve replacement (AVR) procedure. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of selected nutritional status parameters in elderly patients with severe AS on the occurrence of postoperative complications and one-year mortality after the AVR procedure. Methods: 101 elderly patients with AS aged 74.6 +- 5.2 years who qualified for surgical treatment (aortic valve area [AVA] 0.73 +- 0.2 cm2) were enrolled in the study. A nutritional status assessment was performed before AVR surgery, and the frequency of postoperative complications occurring within 30 days of surgery was assessed. The one-year mortality rate was also captured. Results: Adverse events (both major and minor) up to 30 days occurred in 49.5% (n = 50) of the study population. Low Mini Nutritional Assessment (f-MNA) and Subjective Global Assessment (7-SGA) scores and low concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and prealbumin were associated with a higher risk of postoperative complications. The risk of complications increased 1.22 times (95% CI; 1.030-1.453; p = 0.019) with an impaired nutritional status. The annual mortality rate in the study group was 7.9%. Unintentional weight loss of >2.8% in the six months preceding surgery proved useful for predicting death within the first year after AVR surgery. Conclusions: The results indicate that poor nutritional status is an important factor affecting the adverse outcomes in elderly patients with severe aortic valve stenosis undergoing an AVR procedure.
