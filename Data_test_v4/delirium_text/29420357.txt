29420357|a|BACKGROUND: Clinical and preclinical studies firmly support the involvement of the inflammation in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) being widely used in AD patients, there is no conclusive evidence about their impact on the inflammatory response. METHODS: This study investigates peripheral proinflammatory cytokines (interferon gamma [IFN-gamma], tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha], and interleukins 1beta [IL-1beta] and 6 [IL-6]) by firstly comparing peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived secretion in drug-naive and AChEI-treated AD patients versus healthy controls. A subset of those drug-naive AD patients, who were prescribed the AChEI donepezil, was followed-up for 6 months to investigate if donepezil suppresses proinflammatory cell-derived cytokine secretion. RESULTS: Patients with AD showed higher levels of PBMC-derived proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6) in comparison with healthy controls. On reexamination, previously drug-naive AD patients who received donepezil treatment for 6 months displayed a decrease in cell-derived IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6. CONCLUSIONS: Proinflammatory PBMC-derived cytokines were increased in patients with AD in comparison with healthy controls and donepezil-reduced proinflammatory cytokines when examining drug-naive AD patients before and after AChEI treatment.
