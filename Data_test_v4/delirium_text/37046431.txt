37046431|t|Computational Intelligence-Based Disease Severity Identification: A Review of Multidisciplinary Domains.
37046431|a|Disease severity identification using computational intelligence-based approaches is gaining popularity nowadays. Artificial intelligence and deep-learning-assisted approaches are proving to be significant in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of several diseases. In addition to disease identification, these approaches have the potential to identify the severity of a disease. The problem of disease severity identification can be considered multi-class classification, where the class labels are the severity levels of the disease. Plenty of computational intelligence-based solutions have been presented by researchers for severity identification. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent approaches for identifying disease severity levels using computational intelligence-based approaches. We followed the PRISMA guidelines and compiled several works related to the severity identification of multidisciplinary diseases of the last decade from well-known publishers, such as MDPI, Springer, IEEE, Elsevier, etc. This article is devoted toward the severity identification of two main diseases, viz. Parkinson's Disease and Diabetic Retinopathy. However, severity identification of a few other diseases, such as COVID-19, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, tuberculosis, sepsis, sleep apnea, psychosis, traumatic brain injury, breast cancer, knee osteoarthritis, and Alzheimer's disease, was also briefly covered. Each work has been carefully examined against its methodology, dataset used, and the type of disease on several performance metrics, accuracy, specificity, etc. In addition to this, we also presented a few public repositories that can be utilized to conduct research on disease severity identification. We hope that this review not only acts as a compendium but also provides insights to the researchers working on disease severity identification using computational intelligence-based approaches.
