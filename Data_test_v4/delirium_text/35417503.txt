35417503|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies have attempted to characterize depression using electroencephalography (EEG), but results have been inconsistent. New noise reduction technology allows EEG acquisition during conversation. METHODS: We recorded EEG from 40 patients with depression as they engaged in conversation using a single-channel EEG device while conducting real-time noise reduction and compared them to those of 40 healthy subjects. Differences in EEG between patients and controls, as well as differences in patients' depression severity, were examined using the ratio of the power spectrum at each frequency. In addition, the effects of medications were examined in a similar way. RESULTS: In comparing healthy controls and depression patients, significant power spectrum differences were observed at 3 Hz, 4 Hz, and 10 Hz and higher frequencies. In the patient group, differences in the power spectrum were observed between asymptomatic patients and healthy individuals, and between patients of each respective severity level and healthy individuals. In addition, significant differences were observed at multiple frequencies when comparing patients who did and did not take antidepressants, antipsychotics, and/or benzodiazepines. However, the power spectra still remained significantly different between non-medicated patients and healthy individuals. LIMITATIONS: The small sample size may have caused Type II error. Patients' demographic characteristics varied. Moreover, most patients were taking various medications, and cannot be compared to the non-medicated control group. CONCLUSION: A study with a larger sample size should be conducted to gauge reproducibility, but the methods used in this study could be useful in clinical practice as a biomarker of depression.
