34321565|a|The Naked Mole Rat (NMR), Heterocephalus glaber, provides an interesting model for studying biomarkers of longevity due to its long lifespan of more than 30 years, almost ten times longer than that of mice and rats. alpha-Klotho (klotho) is an aging-suppressor gene, and overexpression of klotho is associated with extended lifespan in mice. Klotho is predominantly expressed in the kidney. The expression profile of klotho in the NMR has not previously been reported. The present investigation studied the expression of klotho in the kidney of NMR with that of Rattus Norvegicus (RN) and demonstrated that klotho was expressed in the kidney of NMR at the same level as found in RN. Besides, a significant expression of Kl mRNA was found in the liver of NMR, in contrast to RN, where no hepatic expression was detected. The Klotho expression was further confirmed at the protein level. Thus, the results of the present comparative study indicate a differential tissue expression of klotho between different species. Besides its important function in the kidney, Klotho might also be of significance in the liver of NMR. It is suggested that the hepatic extrarenal expression of klotho may function as a further longevity-related factor in supplement to the Klotho in the kidney.
