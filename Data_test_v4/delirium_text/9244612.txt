9244612|a|The animal model of aged monkeys is a good homologue of Alzheimer's disease in humans, in which it has been shown that there is disproportionate slowing of the EEG when compared with healthy subjects paired for age. This is found both on the conventional EEG and quantitatively. In the latter, relative energy has been the measurement most commonly used for diagnosis and follow-up with various treatments. The follow-up parameters evaluated in this study were: absolute and relative energy of the quantitative EEG (EEGq) obtained in an aged (39 year old) baboon (Papio hamadryas) before and after infusion of intraventricular nerve growth factor (NGF). These findings were compared with those of a young animal (6 year old) of the same species, treated in the same way. Since the animals were first anaesthetized with ketamine and diacepam so as to be able to carry out the study, we used a cerebral function analyzer which allowed us to ascertain that the changes found on analysis of the EEGq were not due to the depth of anaesthesia. The analyzer evaluated the tendencies of amplitude and frequency of the EEG, which is a method widely used for the indirect evaluation of the level of anaesthesia.
