11836012|a|There is now ample evidence that beta-amyloid proteins decrease memory. The SAMP8 mouse (P8) develops an early decline in the ability to learn and to retain new information. The studies reviewed here suggest that this is due to overproduction of beta-amyloid. Both antibodies to beta-amyloid and specific antisense to the amyloid precursor protein reverse these deficits in the P8 mouse. This antisense can cross the blood brain barrier. It is hypothesized that the overproduction of beta-amyloid leads to a decline in Delta(9) desaturase activity with an alteration in membrane fatty acids. This results in altered membrane mobility leading to a decline in neurotransmitter activity and a decreased release of acetylcholine. This decreased cholinergic activity results in a decreased ability of the P8 mouse to learn and retain new information.
