32777867|t|How Does Androgen Deprivation Therapy Affect Mental Health including Cognitive Dysfunction in Patients with Prostate Cancer?
32777867|a|Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is used to block the release of androgen in prostate cancer to promote the regression of cancer cells, and hence, disease progression. Its indication has been widened from the metastatic setting to the localized setting in prostate cancer. Long-term ADT for suppressing androgen release leads to a rapid decrease in androgen, termed as andropause, resulting in several dose and duration dependent adverse effects, including cognitive dysfunction such as dementia. Many retrospective and prospective studies, as well as meta-analyses, have attempted to confirm the crucial relationship between ADT and cognitive dysfunction, but pro and contrary opinions regarding this issue are ongoing owing to the absence of randomized controlled trials. Additionally, several recent studies have suggested the negative effects of dose- and duration-dependent ADT on cognitive dysfunction, especially in 40-65-year-old patients with prostate cancer, who are currently active workers in the society. This review article discusses several studies examining the influence of ADT on mental health based on diverse significant perspectives, especially cognitive dysfunction.
