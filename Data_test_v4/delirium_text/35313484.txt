35313484|t|Symptom Management in Patients with Cirrhosis: a Practical Guide.
35313484|a|Purpose of the review: Though it is well known that cirrhosis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, management of symptoms in cirrhosis can be difficult. This review serves to offer practical guidance in the management of liver-specific symptoms of cirrhosis as well as other symptoms with special hepatic considerations. Recent findings: We discuss liver-specific symptoms and management, including ascites and refractory ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, pruritus, and muscle cramping. We also discuss the challenges of treating more generalized symptoms in cirrhosis, including pain, depression/anxiety, appetite, and fatigue. Medication management is, especially complex in this population given the altered metabolism of drugs, and we consider some strategies to approach this. Summary: With the right tools, provided throughout this review, hepatologists should be well equipped to manage the nuanced liver-specific and generalized symptoms in patients with cirrhosis.
