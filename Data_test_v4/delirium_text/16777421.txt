16777421|a|A key event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is the conversion of soluble amyloid Abeta-peptide into toxic aggregates. Here, we studied the effect of cholesterol depletion on the formation of insoluble Abeta. We found that reduction of neuronal cholesterol by approximately 25% reduced the neuronal formation of insoluble Abeta without affecting the secretion of soluble Abeta. Moreover, we demonstrate that Abeta-oligomers from Alzheimer's disease brains associate with a detergent-resistant membrane fraction in a cholesterol-dependent manner. These results suggest a key role for cholesterol in aggregation of Abeta.
