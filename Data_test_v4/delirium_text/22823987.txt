22823987|a|Neurogenesis occurs in discrete regions of the adult brain, particularly the hippocampus. It is enhanced in the hippocampus of animal models and patients with neurological diseases and disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and epilepsy. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is modulated by drugs used for treating AD and depression, particularly galantamine, memantine and fluoxetine. This reveals that adult neurogenesis and newly generated neuronal cells of the adult hippocampus are involved in neurological diseases and disorders and that adult neurogenesis and neural stem cells (NSCs) of the adult hippocampus are the target of drugs used for treating AD and depression. Hence, adult neurogenesis and NSCs open new opportunities for our understanding of the pathology of the nervous system and new avenues to discover and develop novel drugs for treating neurogical diseases and disorders; drugs that would target specifically the NSCs of the neurogenic regions in the adult brain, or neurogenic drugs, and that would reverse or compensate deficits and impairments associated with neurological diseases and disorders, particularly those associated with the hippocampus. Adult NSCs represent a model to discover and develop novel drugs for treating neurological diseases and disorders. These drugs may also have potential for regenerative medicine and the treatment of brain tumors.
