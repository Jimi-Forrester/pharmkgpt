38710966|t|Development and Validation of SCACOMS, a Composite Scale for Assessing Disease Progression and Treatment Effects in Spinocerebellar Ataxia.
38710966|a|Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are rare inherited neurodegenerative disorders characterized by a progressive impairment of gait, balance, limb coordination, and speech. There is currently no composite scale that includes multiple aspects of the SCA experience to assess disease progression and treatment effects. Applying the method of partial least squares (PLS) regression, we developed the Spinocerebellar Ataxia Composite Scale (SCACOMS) from two SCA natural history datasets (NCT01060371, NCT02440763). PLS regression selected items based on their ability to detect clinical decline, with optimized weights based on the item's degree of progression. Following model validation, SCACOMS was leveraged to examine disease progression and treatment effects in a 48-week SCA clinical trial cohort (NCT03701399). Items from the Clinical Global Impression-Global Improvement Scale (CGI-I), the Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) - functional stage, and the Modified Functional Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (f-SARA) were objectively selected with weightings based on their sensitivity to clinical decline. The resulting SCACOMS exhibited improved sensitivity to disease progression and greater treatment effects (compared to the original scales from which they were derived) in a 48-week clinical trial of a novel therapeutic agent. The trial analyses also provided a SCACOMS-derived estimate of the temporal delay in SCA disease progression. SCACOMS is a useful composite measure, effectively capturing disease progression and highlighting treatment effects in patients with SCA. SCACOMS will be a powerful tool in future studies given its sensitivity to clinical decline and ability to detect a meaningful clinical impact of disease-modifying treatments.
