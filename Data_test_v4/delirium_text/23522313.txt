23522313|a|INTRODUCTION: Hip fracture is common in elderly people who fall. We now describe clinical and social factors independently associated with incomplete functional recovery. OBJECTIVE: to identify clinical and social factors associated with postoperative function in elderly hip fracture. METHODS: A prospective, analytical study of elderly postoperative hip fracture, using non-probability sample of cases including consecutive patients older than 60 years with postoperative hip fracture, excluding those with hyperactive and hypoactive delirium or noy independent in activities of daily life before the injury. Data were collected on age, sex, number of comorbidities, type of fracture and surgery. Within the first 24 to 48 hours we evaluated the cognitive and emotional status, family status, with a final assessment of the Katz index at 3 months after the fracture. Statistical analysis was done using logistic regression. RESULTS: We obtained adjusted odds ratios (ORA) associated functionality, for age < 85 years: 7.21 (95% CI, 1.79-28.98), normal cognitive status 10.74 (95% CI, 3.13-38.83), and functional family situation 8.5 (95% CI, 1.97-32.76). CONCLUSIONS: Age, cognitive status, and family status are important predictors of functional recovery in the short term elderly postoperative hip fracture.
