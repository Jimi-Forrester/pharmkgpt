15573252|a|We investigated risk factors for delirium in 100 patients who underwent liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma. Postoperative delirium developed in 17 (17%). Univariate analysis revealed that advanced age (especially = 70 years old), a history of smoking, a decreased serum albumin concentration (especially < 3.8 g/dl), advanced cancer stage (II-IV), major hepatectomy, prolonged operating time, and large intraoperative blood loss were possible risk factors for postoperative delirium. When patients' preoperative condition and laboratory test results were subjected to multivariate analysis, only advanced age [odds ratio (OR) 1.201; confidence interval (CI) 1.063-1.357] and a decreased serum albumin concentration (OR 0.151; CI 0.025-0.900) were independent risk factors for the delirium. The percentages of patients with high aspartate and alanine aminotransferase activities, a high indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes, a low platelet count, and advanced cancer stage (II-IV) were higher in patients with a low (< 3.8 g/dl), rather than high (= 3.8 g/dl) serum albumin concentration. These findings indicate that multiple factors, including advanced age, impaired liver function, and advanced cancer stage, affect the development of postoperative delirium after liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma.
