37407252|a|BACKGROUND: Perioperative anxiety and emergence delirium (ED) in young children may cause a series of adverse events, which are worth investigating. Pharmacological treatments of anxiety and delirium remain uncertain, while non-pharmacological treatments lack personalization and pertinence. AIMS: The aim of study was to determine whether an individual cartoon video can alleviate perioperative anxiety and reduce ED in young children undergoing adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy. METHODS: Children between 3 and 7 years old undergoing adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy were randomly assigned to an individual cartoon video group (group V) or a control group (group C). In group V, an individual cartoon video of the child' s own choice was played throughout the whole waiting, anaesthesia induction and recovery periods. The children in group C were contacted through verbal conversation. The primary outcomes were anxiety measured by the Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale and ED assessed by the Paediatric Anaesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale. The secondary outcomes included cooperation during induction, postoperative pain and adverse events. RESULTS: The incidence of anxiety were comparable in group V and group C at the holding area (T0) (26% vs 22%, p=0.323), but the incidence of anxiety of group V were significantly lower than those of group C at the time of entering the operating room (T1), during the induction of anaesthesia (T2) and leaving the post anaesthesia care unit (T6) (p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001) after intervention. The peak PAED score in group V was significantly lower than that in group C (12.00 (9.00-13.00) vs 13.50 (10.00-15.00), p=0.016). We found no significant differences in cooperation during induction, postoperative pain or the incidence of adverse events between the groups (2.00 (0.00-4.00) vs 3.00 (1.25-4.00), p=0.110; F=0.059, Pgroup=0.808; 3 (7.5%) vs 4 (10), p=0.692). CONCLUSIONS: The individual cartoon video is an effective method of reducing perioperative anxiety and alleviating ED in children.
