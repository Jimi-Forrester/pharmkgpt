30727887|t|In vivo Evaluation and Alzheimer's Disease Treatment Outcome of siRNA Loaded Dual Targeting Drug Delivery System.
30727887|a|BACKGROUND: To deliver drugs to treat Alzheimer's Disease (AD), nanoparticles should firstly penetrate through blood brain barrier, and then target neurons. METHODS: Recently, we developed an Apo A-I and NL4 dual modified nanoparticle (ANNP) to deliver beta-amyloid converting enzyme 1 (BACE1) siRNA. Although promising in vitro results were obtained, the in vivo performance was not clear. Therefore, in this study, we further evaluated the in vivo neuroprotective effect and toxicity of the ANNP/siRNA. The ANNP/siRNA was 80.6 nm with good stability when incubated with serum. In vivo, the treatment with ANNP/siRNA significantly improves the spatial learning and memory of APP/PS1 double transgenic mice, as determined by mean escape latency, times of crossing the platform area during the 60 s swimming and the percentage of the distance in the target quadrant. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: After the treatment, BACE1 RNA level of ANNP/siRNA group was greatly reduced, which contributed a good AD treatment outcome. Finally, after repeated administration, the ANNP/siRNA did not lead to significant change as observed by HE staining of main organs, suggesting the good biocompatibility of ANNP/siRNA. These results demonstrated that the ANNP was a good candidate for AD targeting siRNA delivery.
