38608739|t|Dynamic microglia alterations associate with hippocampal network impairments: A turning point in amyloid pathology progression.
38608739|a|Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder causing memory loss and cognitive decline. The underlying causes of cognitive deterioration and neurodegeneration remain unclear, leading to a lack of effective strategies to prevent dementia. Recent evidence highlights the role of neuroinflammation, particularly involving microglia, in Alzheimer's disease onset and progression. Characterizing the initial phase of Alzheimer's disease can lead to the discovery of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets, facilitating timely interventions for effective treatments. We used the AppNL-G-F knock-in mouse model, which resembles the amyloid pathology and neuroinflammatory characteristics of Alzheimer's disease, to investigate the transition from a pre-plaque to an early plaque stage with a combined functional and molecular approach. Our experiments show a progressive decrease in the power of cognition-relevant hippocampal gamma oscillations during the early stage of amyloid pathology, together with a modification of fast-spiking interneuron intrinsic properties and postsynaptic input. Consistently, transcriptomic analyses revealed that these effects are accompanied by changes in synaptic function-associated pathways. Concurrently, homeostasis- and inflammatory-related microglia signature genes were downregulated. Moreover, we found a decrease in Iba1-positive microglia in the hippocampus that correlates with plaque aggregation and neuronal dysfunction. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that microglia play a protective role during the early stages of amyloid pathology by preventing plaque aggregation, supporting neuronal homeostasis, and overall preserving the oscillatory network's functionality. These results suggest that the early alteration of microglia dynamics could be a pivotal event in the progression of Alzheimer's disease, potentially triggering plaque deposition, impairment of fast-spiking interneurons, and the breakdown of the oscillatory circuitry in the hippocampus.
