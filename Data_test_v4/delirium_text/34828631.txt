34828631|t|Analysis of Factors Affecting Post-Stroke Fatigue: An Observational, Cross-Sectional, Retrospective Chart Review Study.
34828631|a|Post-stroke fatigue (PSF) is one of the most common emotional and mood disorders in stroke survivors. Several studies have suggested associations between PSF and various factors. However, they describe conflicting results. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the factors affecting PSF. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 178 hospitalized stroke patients. The collected data were compared between the PSF and control groups. To evaluate the association between factors and PSF, regression analysis was conducted. A total of 96 patients (53.9%) were assigned to the PSF group, and 82 patients were assigned to the control group. Age, neurological deficits, cognitive dysfunction, degree of depression, hs-CRP, and ESR differed significantly between the two groups. For both types of stroke, multiple linear regression analyses showed that degree of depression and degree of inflammation were significantly associated with PSF. Through subgroup analysis, multiple linear regression analyses showed that the degree of depression in ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke and the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio in hemorrhagic stroke had a significant association with PSF. In conclusion, post-stroke depression and degree of inflammation could be clinically significant predictors of PSF in all types of stroke patients. However, larger, prospective studies are required to obtain more concrete results.
