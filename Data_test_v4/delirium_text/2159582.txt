2159582|t|Chromatin structure and gene expression in Alzheimer's disease.
2159582|a|Light micrococcal nuclease digestion was used to examine DNA associated with nucleosome populations isolated from Alzheimer's disease (AD) affected superior temporal lobe neocortical nuclei. 46.1% of the immediate 5' upstream DNA sequence of the single copy neurofilament light chain (NF-L) gene was found to be associated with a mononucleosome fraction in control neocortices. This fraction was reduced to 7.4% in age-matched AD-affected neocortex. No differences in accessibility to the nuclease probe was found between AD-affected and control temporal grey matter nuclei for the human prion HuPrP gene or for the NF-L gene in nuclei isolated from the primary visual cortex or the cerebellum. An AvaI restriction endonuclease site, located 124 base pairs upstream from the TATAA box in the NF-L leader sequence, was also found to be occluded in AD-affected nuclei. From this and previous data we conclude that within the AD-affected nucleus, focused changes in neuronal chromatin conformation occur. Increases in the packing density of chromatin may reduce transcription and alter the ability of neurons to generate sufficient levels of gene products to maintain normal neocortical function.
