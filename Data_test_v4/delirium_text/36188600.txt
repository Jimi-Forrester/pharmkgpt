36188600|a|Recent studies have shown that physical activities can prevent aging-related neurodegeneration. Exercise improves the metabolic landscape of the body. However, the role of these differential metabolites in preventing neurovascular unit degeneration (NVU) is still unclear. Here, we performed single-cell analysis of brain tissue from young and old mice. Normalized mutual information (NMI) was used to measure heterogeneity between each pair of cells using the non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) method. Astrocytes and choroid plexus epithelial cells (CPC), two types of CNS glial cells, differed significantly in heterogeneity depending on their aging status and intercellular interactions. The MetaboAnalyst 5.0 database and the scMetabolism package were used to analyze and calculate the differential metabolic pathways associated with aging in the CPC. These mRNAs and corresponding proteins were involved in the metabolites (R)-3-Hydroxybutyric acid, 2-Hydroxyglutarate, 2-Ketobutyric acid, 3-Hydroxyanthranilic acid, Fumaric acid, L-Leucine, and Oxidized glutathione pathways in CPC. Our results showed that CPC age heterogeneity-associated proteins (ECHS1, GSTT1, HSD17B10, LDHA, and LDHB) might be directly targeted by the metabolite of oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Further molecular dynamics and free-energy simulations confirmed the insight into GSSG's targeting function and free-energy barrier on these CPC age heterogeneity-associated proteins. By inhibiting these proteins in CPC, GSSG inhibits brain energy metabolism, whereas exercise improves the metabolic pathway activity of CPC in NVU by regulating GSSG homeostasis. In order to develop drugs targeting neurodegenerative diseases, further studies are needed to understand how physical exercise enhances NVU function and metabolism by modulating CPC-glial cell interactions.
