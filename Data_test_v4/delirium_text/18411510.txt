18411510|t|[PC12 cells transfected with human mutant gene causing one of Alzheimer's disease forms have a high sensitivity to oxidative stress].
18411510|a|Used in this work are PC12 cells transfected with human gene expressing amyloid precursor protein of beta-peptide and carrying the so-called "Swedish mutation" leading to the appearance of one Alzheimer's disease family forms. It has been shown that the PC12 cells transfected with this mutant gene, at action of various hydrogen peroxide concentrations, die to the significant greater degree than the used for comparison PC12 cells transfected with analogous human gene of the wild type or than vector-transfected cells. It has been found that ganglioside GM1 at micro- or nanomolar concentrations is able to increase viability of the PC12 cells transfected with the mutant gene causing a significant accumulation of endogenous amyloid beta-peptide. The obtained data confirm an important role of oxidative stress in injury and death of brain nerve cells in Alzheimer's disease.
