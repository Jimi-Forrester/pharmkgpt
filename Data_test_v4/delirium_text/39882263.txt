39882263|a|Background: Insulin resistance is tightly related to cognition; however, the causal association between them remains a matter of debate. Our investigation aims to establish the causal relationship and direction between insulin resistance and cognition, while also quantifying the mediating role of brain cortical structure in this association. Methods: The publicly available data sources for insulin resistance (fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment beta-cell function and homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance, proinsulin), brain cortical structure, and cognitive phenotypes (visual memory, reaction time) were obtained from the MAGIC, ENIGMA, and UK Biobank datasets, respectively. We first conducted a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to examine the susceptibility of insulin resistance on cognitive phenotypes. Additionally, we applied a two-step MR to assess the mediating role of cortical surficial area and thickness in the pathway from insulin resistance to cognitive impairment. The primary Inverse-variance weighted, accompanied by robust sensitivity analysis, was implemented to explore and verify our findings. The reverse MR analysis was also performed to evaluate the causal effect of cognition on insulin resistance and brain cortical structure. Results: This study identified genetically determined elevated level of proinsulin increased reaction time (beta=0.03, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]=0.01 to 0.05, p=0.005), while decreasing the surface area of rostral middle frontal (beta=-49.28, 95%CI=-86.30 to -12.27, p=0.009). The surface area of the rostral middle frontal mediated 20.97% (95%CI=1.44% to 40.49%) of the total effect of proinsulin on reaction time. No evidence of heterogeneity, pleiotropy, or reverse causality was observed. Conclusions: Briefly, our study noticed that elevated level of insulin resistance adversely affected cognition, with a partial mediation effect through alterations in brain cortical structure.
