38483851|a|In vivo noninvasive imaging of neurometabolites is crucial to improve our understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases. Abnormal changes in synaptic organization leading to synaptic degradation and neuronal loss is considered as one of the primary factors driving Alzheimer's disease pathology. Magnetic resonance based molecular imaging techniques such as chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can provide neurometabolite specific information which may relate to underlying pathological and compensatory mechanisms. In this study, CEST and short echo time single voxel MRS was performed to evaluate the sensitivity of cerebral metabolites to beta-amyloid (Abeta) induced synaptic deficit in the hippocampus of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The CEST based spectra (Z-spectra) were acquired on a 9.4 Tesla small animal MR imaging system with two radiofrequency (RF) saturation amplitudes (1.47 muT and 5.9 muT) to obtain creatine-weighted and glutamate-weighted CEST contrasts, respectively. Multi-pool Lorentzian fitting and quantitative T1 longitudinal relaxation maps were used to obtain metabolic specific apparent exchange-dependent relaxation (AREX) maps. Short echo time (TE = 12 ms) single voxel MRS was acquired to quantify multiple neurometabolites from the right hippocampus region. AREX contrasts and MRS based metabolite concentration levels were examined in the ARTE10 animal model for Alzheimer's disease and their wild type (WT) littermate counterparts (age = 10 months). Using MRS voxel as a region of interest, group-wise analysis showed significant reduction in Glu-AREX and Cr-AREX in ARTE10, compared to WT animals. The MRS based results in the ARTE10 mice showed significant decrease in glutamate (Glu) and glutamate-total creatine (Glu/tCr) ratio, compared to WT animals. The MRS results also showed significant increase in total creatine (tCr), phosphocreatine (PCr) and glutathione (GSH) concentration levels in ARTE10, compared to WT animals. In the same ROI, Glu-AREX and Cr-AREX demonstrated positive associations with Glu/tCr ratio. These results indicate the involvement of neurotransmitter metabolites and energy metabolism in Abeta-mediated synaptic degradation in the hippocampus region. The study also highlights the feasibility of CEST and MRS to identify and track multiple competing and compensatory mechanisms involved in heterogeneous pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease in vivo.
