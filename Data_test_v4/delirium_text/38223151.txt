Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay were positive. Cerebrospinal fluid-VDRL was positive with grossly elevated proteins and glucose. HIV test was negative. Magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain was normal. We made a diagnosis of neurosphilis - General paralysis of insane (GPI) with co-existing early syphilis. The patient was started on crystalline penicillin for 14 days after which there was significant improvement in behavior. We are reporting a rare case of GPI with early syphilis.
