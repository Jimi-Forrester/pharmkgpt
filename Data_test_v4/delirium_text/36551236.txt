36551236|a|Extracellular amyloid beta-protein (1-42) (Abeta42) aggregates have been recognized as toxic agents for neural cells in vivo and in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate the cytotoxic effects of extracellular Abeta42 aggregates in soluble (or suspended, SAbeta42) and deposited (or attached, DAbeta42) forms on cell adhesion/re-adhesion, neurite outgrowth, and intracellular scaffold palladin using the neural cell lines SH-SY5Y and HT22, and to elucidate the potential relevance of these effects. The effect of extracellular Abeta42 on neural cell adhesion was directly associated with their neurotrophic or neurotoxic activity, with SAbeta42 aggregates reducing cell adhesion and associated live cell de-adherence more than DAbeta42 aggregates, while causing higher mortality. The reduction in cell adhesion due to extracellular Abeta42 aggregates was accompanied by the impairment of neurite outgrowth, both in length and number, and similarly, SAbeta42 aggregates impaired the extension of neurites more severely than DAbeta42 aggregates. Further, the disparate changes of intracellular palladin induced by SAbeta42 and DAbeta42 aggregates, respectively, might underlie their aforementioned effects on target cells. Further, the use of anti-oligomeric Abeta42 scFv antibodies revealed that extracellular Abeta42 aggregates, especially large DAbeta42 aggregates, had some independent detrimental effects, including physical barrier effects on neural cell adhesion and neuritogenesis in addition to their neurotoxicity, which might be caused by the rigid C-terminal clusters formed between adjacent Abeta42 chains in Abeta42 aggregates. Our findings, concerning how scaffold palladin responds to extracellular Abeta42 aggregates, and is closely connected with declines in cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth, provide new insights into the cytotoxicity of extracellular Abeta42 aggregates in Alzheimer disease.
