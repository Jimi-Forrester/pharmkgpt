39031388|t|Parkinson's Disease Drug Therapies in the Clinical Trial Pipeline: 2024 Update.
39031388|a|Background: For the past five years, our annual reports have been tracking the clinical development of new drug-based therapies for the neurodegenerative condition of Parkinson's disease (PD). These reviews have followed the progress both of "symptomatic treatments" (ST - improves/reduces symptoms of the condition) and "disease-modifying treatments" (DMT - attempts to delay/slow progression by addressing the underlying biology of PD). Efforts have also been made to further categorize these experimental treatments based on their mechanisms of action and class of drug. Methods: A dataset of clinical trials for drug therapies in PD using trial data downloaded from the ClinicalTrials.gov online registry was generated. A breakdown analysis of all the studies that were active as of January 31st, 2024, was conducted. This analysis involved categorizing the trials based on both the mechanism of action (MOA) and the drug target. Results: There were 136 active Phase 1-3 trials evaluating drug therapies for PD registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, as of January 31, 2024. Of these trials, 76 (56%) were classified as ST trials and 60 (44%) were designated DMT. More than half (58%) of the trials were in Phase 2 testing stage, followed by Phase 1 (30%) and Phase 3 (12%). 35 of the trials were registered since our last report, with the remaining 101 trials appearing in at least one earlier report. Conclusions: The drug development pipeline for PD remains in a robust state with a wide variety of approaches being developed and evaluated in Phase 1 and 2. Yet again, however, only a limited number of DMTs are transitioning to Phase 3.
