24243544|a|Flavonoids, a family of phenolic compounds, are widely present in our daily diet and exist in traditional Chinese medicines, in which they act as the major active functional ingredients. Different lines of evidence indicate that flavonoids have positive impacts on human health. Here, different subclasses of flavonoids were analyzed for their inductive roles in promoting the expression of synaptic proteins, synaptotagmin, and post-synaptic density protein-95 in cultured rat cortical neurons. Among the screened 65 flavonoids, (-)-catechin, luteolin, and isorhamnetin, in micromolar concentration, were found to induce the expression of synaptic proteins in a dose-dependent manner: the induction values were from 2- to 8-fold that of the control. Similar results were revealed in the flavonoid-treated hippocampal neurons. The identification of these synapse-promoting flavonoids could be very useful in finding potential drugs, or food supplements, for treating various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and depression.
