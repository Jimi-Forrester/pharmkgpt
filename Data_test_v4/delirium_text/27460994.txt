27460994|t|Recent trends in surgical research of cancer treatment in the elderly, with a primary focus on lung cancer: Presentation at the 2015 annual meeting of SIOG.
27460994|a|Surgical research concentrating on cancer in the elderly has changed from small single institution outcome studies of carefully selected patients to larger studies that test specific aspects of surgical selection, treatment, and outcome. The purpose of this paper is to review major new trends in surgical geriatric oncology research within the last decade. Reviewing PubMed listings of the last 10years reveals several identifiable areas of particular concentration. Although we use specific studies primarily from lung cancer treatment, the generalizations can be seen across the spectrum of geriatric cancers. These trends include screening for disease that can be successfully treated, integration of operative and non-operative therapies that are changing the indications for surgery, the use of prehabilitation to allow more borderline frail patients to be treated surgically, the use of rehabilitation to facilitate rapid and complete recovery, prevention and treatment of common morbidities, with a special recent focus on delirium and cognitive impairment. New areas of surgical research include research on team building in the OR and ICU. Recent surgical research is becoming quantitative and multi-institutionally based. Overall surgical mortality has dropped over the past 25years in both academic and community hospitals. Prevention of morbidity and loss of functional status is a major focus of research. Funding for new Quality Assurance Projects for elderly patients has been awarded to the American College of Surgeons, and should provide multi-institutional quality outcome data within 5years.
