39726015|t|N-terminus alpha-synuclein detection reveals new and more diverse aggregate morphologies in multiple system atrophy and Parkinson's disease.
39726015|a|BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are classified as alpha-synucleinopathies and are primarily differentiated by their clinical phenotypes. Delineating these diseases based on their specific alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) proteoform pathologies is crucial for accurate antemortem biomarker diagnosis. Newly identified alpha-Syn pathologies in PD raise questions about whether MSA exhibits a similar diversity. This prompted the need for a comparative study focusing on alpha-Syn epitope-specific immunoreactivities in both diseases, which could clarify the extent of pathological overlap and diversity, and guide more accurate biomarker development. METHODS: We utilised a multiplex immunohistochemical approach to detect multiple structural domains of alpha-Syn proteoforms across multiple regions prone to pathological accumulation in MSA (n = 10) and PD (n = 10). Comparison of epitope-specific alpha-Syn proteoforms was performed in the MSA medulla, inferior olivary nucleus, substantia nigra, hippocampus, and cerebellum, and in the PD olfactory bulb, medulla, substantia nigra, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex. RESULTS: N-terminus and C-terminus antibodies detected significantly more alpha-Syn pathology in MSA than antibodies for phosphorylated (pS129) alpha-Syn, which are classically used to detect alpha-Syn. Importantly, C-terminus immunolabelling is more pronounced in MSA compared to PD. Meanwhile, N-terminus immunolabelling consistently detected the highest percentage of alpha-Syn across pathologically burdened regions of both diseases, which could be of biological significance. As expected, oligodendroglial involvement distinguished MSA from PD, but in contrast to PD, no substantial astrocytic or microglial alpha-Syn accumulation in MSA occurred. These data confirm glial-specific changes between these diseases when immunolabelling the N-terminus epitope. In comparison, N-terminus neuronal alpha-Syn was present in PD and MSA, with most MSA neurons lacking pS129 alpha-Syn proteoforms. This explains why characterisation of neuronal MSA pathologies is lacking and challenges the reliance on pS129 antibodies for the accurate quantification of alpha-Syn pathological load across alpha-synucleinopathies. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the necessity of utilising a multiplex approach to detect alpha-Syn, most importantly including the N-terminus, to capture the entire spectrum of alpha-Syn proteoforms in alpha-synucleinopathies. The data provide novel insights toward the biological differentiation of these alpha-synucleinopathies and pave the way for more refined antemortem diagnostic methods to facilitate early identification and intervention of these neurodegenerative diseases.
