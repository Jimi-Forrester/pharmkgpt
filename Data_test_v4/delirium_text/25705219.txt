25705219|t|Therapeutic Effects of PPAR alpha on Neuronal Death and Microvascular Impairment.
25705219|a|Peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) is a broadly expressed nuclear hormone receptor and is a transcription factor for diverse target genes possessing a PPAR response element (PPRE) in the promoter region. The PPRE is highly conserved, and PPARs thus regulate transcription of an extensive array of target genes involved in energy metabolism, vascular function, oxidative stress, inflammation, and many other biological processes. PPARalpha has potent protective effects against neuronal cell death and microvascular impairment, which have been attributed in part to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Here we discuss PPARalpha's effects in neurodegenerative and microvascular diseases and also recent clinical findings that identified therapeutic effects of a PPARalpha agonist in diabetic microvascular complications.
