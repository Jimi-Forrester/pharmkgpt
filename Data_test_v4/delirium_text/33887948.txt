33887948|a|INTRODUCTION: Background and aims: a high nutritional risk can independently be associated with a longer hospital stay in elderly patients. This study aims to establish the prevalence of the risk of malnutrition and its associated factors in a high-complexity level hospital in Bogota, Colombia, during 2018. Methods: a cross-sectional study. The prevalence of the risk of malnutrition was measured using a malnutrition-screening tool (MST), and the association with hospital stage, age, and patient diagnoses was assessed. Results: a total of 7,192 patients comprised the cohort. Age range was 61 to 108 years, with an average of 77.1 +- 9.2 years, and subjects were mostly female (55.5 %). We identified as main conditions urinary tract infections (8.4 %), congestive heart failure (5.4 %), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with an acute exacerbation (4.6 %). The prevalence of the risk of malnutrition was 41.4 %, significantly associated with longer hospital stays (p < 0.001), older age (p < 0.001), and a diagnosis of delirium (OR = 5.98, 95 % CI: 2.78 to 12.86), diarrhea and gastroenteritis (OR = 5.01, 95 % CI: 2.44 to 10.32), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (OR = 4.44, 95 % CI: 2.38 to 8.28), specified pneumonia (OR = 4.43, 95% CI: 2.11 to 9.30), and high blood pressure (3.94, 95 % CI: 2.07 to 7.50). Other diagnoses included abdominal pain (other) (OR = 3.80, 95 % CI: 1.81 to 7.99), urinary tract infections (OR = 3.64, 95 % CI: 2.07 to 6.24), acute bronchitis (OR = 3.22, 95 % CI: 1.56 to 6.65), and bacterial pneumonia (OR = 3.02, 95 % CI: 1.65 to 5.55). Conclusion: the prevalence of the risk of malnutrition in our institution is approximately one in two patients, with a significant association to increased hospital stay >= 8 days, patient age >= 80 years, and mainly diagnoses of delirium, diarrhea, and gastroenteritis of suspected infectious etiology.
