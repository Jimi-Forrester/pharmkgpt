28150229|t|Identification of TP53BP2 as a Novel Candidate Gene for Primary Open Angle Glaucoma by Whole Exome Sequencing in a Large Multiplex Family.
28150229|a|Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a major type of glaucoma characterized by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells with associated visual field loss without an identifiable secondary cause. Genetic factors are considered to be major contributors to the pathogenesis of glaucoma. The aim of the study was to identify the causative gene in a large family with POAG by applying whole exome sequencing (WES). WES was performed on the DNA of four affected family members. Rare pathogenic variants shared among the affected individuals were filtered. Polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing were used to analyze variants segregating with the disease in additional family members. WES analysis identified a variant in TP53BP2 (c.109G>A; p.Val37Met) that segregated heterozygously with the disease. In silico analysis of the substitution predicted it to be pathogenic. The variant was absent in public databases and in 180 population-matched controls. A novel genetic variant in the TP53BP2 gene was identified in a family with POAG. Interestingly, it has previously been demonstrated that the gene regulates apoptosis in retinal ganglion cells. This supports that the TP53BP2 variant may represent the cause of POAG in this family. Additional screening of the gene in patients with POAG from different populations is required to confirm its involvement in the disease.
