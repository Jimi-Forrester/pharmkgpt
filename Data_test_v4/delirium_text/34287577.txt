34287577|t|Chondroitin sulfate from fish waste exhibits strong intracellular antioxidant potential.
34287577|a|Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a type of glycosaminoglycan described as an antioxidant molecule that has been found in animal species such as fish. Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) represents an eco-friendly source of this compound, since its economical processing generates usable waste, reducing the negative environmental impact. This waste was used for CS extraction, purification, characterization by enzymatic degradation, and evaluation of its antioxidant effect. CS obtained from tilapia presented sulfation mainly at carbon 4 of galactosamine, and it was not cytotoxic at concentrations up to 200 microg/mL. Furthermore, 100 microg/mL of CS from tilapia reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species to 47% of the total intracellular reactive oxygen species level. The ability of CS to chelate metal ions in vitro also suggested an ability to react with other pathways that generate oxidative radicals, such as the Haber-Weiss reaction, acting intracellularly in more than one way. Although the role of CS from tilapia remains unclear, the pharmacological effects described herein indicate that CS is a potential molecule for further study of the relationship between the structures and functions of chondroitin sulfates as antioxidants.
