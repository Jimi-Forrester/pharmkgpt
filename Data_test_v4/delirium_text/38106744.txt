38106744|t|In-Hospital Hip Fractures in a Large Irish Teaching Hospital: Patient Risk Factors and Outcomes.
38106744|a|INTRODUCTION: In-hospital hip fractures follow falls during unrelated admissions. Little data in the Irish setting is available on this vulnerable subset of hip fracture patients. Our objective is to review the incidence of in-hospital hip fractures, identify risk factors, and evaluate outcomes. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational review. We collected patient data in St. James' Hospital using the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry database and Electronic Patient Records for in-hospital hip fractures between 10/02/2017 and 22/04/2020. Comorbidity, survival, and discharge destination data were gathered. RESULTS: We identified 40 fractures, representing 11.5% of all hip fractures treated at our center during the study period. The patients were 60-95 years old. Median age was 77 years for males and 86 years for females. Most (72.5%) were identified as fall risks, and 52% were unwitnessed falls. Many had a history of falls (67.5%), dementia (52.5%), or both (42.5%). Delirium was common (42.5%), and 75% had at least one vascular/coagulation disorder. Mortality was 10.25% at 30 days, 23.1% at 90 days, and 51.4% at 12 months. Although 70% were admitted from home, only 10% were discharged back home. 30% were admitted to a nursing home, and 55% were discharged from a nursing home. CONCLUSION: In-hospital hip fractures accounted for 11.5% of all hip fractures treated at our center, confirming the need for a well-defined hospital protocol. Patients often present with previous falls, dementia, and cardiovascular disease. Outcomes are poor, with 51.4% mortality at 12 months and significant morbidity reflected by a loss of independent living.
