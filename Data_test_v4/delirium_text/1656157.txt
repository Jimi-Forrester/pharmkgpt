1656157|a|Neuritic plaque and cerebrovascular amyloid deposits have been detected in the aged monkey, dog, and polar bear and have rarely been found in aged rodents (Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun., 12 (1984) 885-890; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 82 (1985) 4245-4249). To determine if the primary structure of the 42-43 residue amyloid peptide is conserved in species that accumulate plaques, the region of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) cDNA that encodes the peptide region was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence was compared to those species where amyloid accumulation has not been detected. The DNA sequences of dog, polar bear, rabbit, cow, sheep, pig and guinea pig were compared and a phylogenetic tree was generated. We conclude that the amino acid sequence of dog and polar bear and other mammals which may form amyloid plaques is conserved and the species where amyloid has not been detected (mouse, rat) may be evolutionarily a distinct group. In addition, the predicted secondary structure of mouse and rat amyloid that differs from that of amyloid bearing species is its lack of propensity to form a beta sheeted structure. Thus, a cross-species examination of the amyloid peptide may suggest what is essential for amyloid deposition.
