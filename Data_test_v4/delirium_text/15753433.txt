15753433|a|The authors examined the relationship between hypertension and cognitive performance in 34 African-American patients with probable Alzheimer disease. Multiple regression analyses indicated that hypertension was associated with poorer overall performance on the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, particularly the Initiation/Perseveration and Conceptualization subscales, after controlling for gender, age, and education. The findings suggest that African-American patients with hypertension exhibit greater cognitive impairment, possibly reflecting executive dysfunction.
