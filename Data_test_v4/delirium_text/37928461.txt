37928461|a|Introduction: Patients suffering from severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are usually treated with mechanical ventilation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has traditionally been considered a life-saving therapy and was reserved as a last resort when other treatment options were exhausted. However, this report outlines our successful initial experience with early implementation of awake venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) in a case of pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia complicated by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), offering a promising new approach for recovery. Case presentation: We present a case report of the effective application of awake VV-ECMO in a 29 years-old man with severe ARDS caused by pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. The patient initially received antibiotic treatment and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) for respiratory distress, but these interventions failed to improve the worsening dyspnea that occurred in the patient. Following the combined antifungal therapy, high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy, and VV-ECMO for a duration of 7 days, the patient's symptoms improved, showing relief. Conclusion: Awake VV-ECMO proved to be an effective treatment for critically ill patients with ARDS, avoiding the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. However, increased clinical evidence is needed to verify whether awake ECMO could be widely used in severe ARDS caused by other diseases or conditions.
