31008274|t|Topographic distribution of white matter changes and lacunar infarcts in neurodegenerative and vascular dementia syndromes: A post-mortem 7.0-tesla magnetic resonance imaging study.
31008274|a|BACKGROUND: White matter changes and lacunar infarcts are regarded as linked to the same underlying small-vessel pathology. On magnetic resonance imaging, white matter changes are frequently observed, while the number of lacunar infarcts is probably underestimated. The present study post-mortem 7.0-tesla magnetic resonance imaging study compares the severity and the distribution of white matter changes and lacunar infarcts in different neurodegenerative and vascular dementia syndromes in order to determine their impact on the disease evolution. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-four post-mortem brains consisting of 15 patients with pure Alzheimer's disease and 12 with associated cerebral amyloid angiopathy, 14 patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, 7 with Lewy body dementia, 10 with progressive supranuclear palsy, 14 with vascular dementia and 12 control brains were examined. Six hemispheric coronal sections of each brain underwent 7.0-tesla magnetic resonance imaging. Location and severity of white matter changes and lacunar infarcts were evaluated semi-quantitatively in each section separately. RESULTS: White matter changes predominated in the prefrontal and frontal sections of frontotemporal lobar degeneration and in the post-central section of associated cerebral amyloid angiopathy brains, while overall increased in vascular dementia cases. Lacunar infarcts were more frequent in the vascular dementia brains and mainly increased in the centrum semiovale. CONCLUSIONS: White matter changes have a different topographic distribution in neurodegenerative diseases and are most severe and extended in vascular dementia. Lacunar infarcts predominate in the deep white matter of vascular dementia compared to the neurodegenerative diseases. Vascular cognitive impairment is mainly linked to white matter changes due to chronic ischaemia as well as to lacunar infarcts due to small-vessel occlusion.
