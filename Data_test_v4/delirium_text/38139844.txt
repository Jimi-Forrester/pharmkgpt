38139844|t|Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Management of Bone Loss in Patients with Critical Illness.
38139844|a|Patients with critical illnesses are at higher risk of comorbidities, which can include bone mineral density loss, bone turnover marker increase, and fragility fractures. Patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) have a higher risk of bone fractures. Since hypermetabolism is a characteristic of ICU patients, such patients are often rapidly affected by systemic deterioration, which often results in systemic wasting disease. Major risk factors for ICU-related bone loss include physical restraint, inflammation, neuroendocrine stress, malnutrition, and medications. A medical history of critical illness should be acknowledged as a risk factor for impaired bone metabolism. Bone loss associated with ICU admission should be recognized as a key component of post-intensive care syndrome, and further research that focuses on treatment protocols and prevention strategies is required. Studies aimed at maintaining gut integrity have emphasized protein administration and nutrition, while research is ongoing to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of anti-resorptive agents and physical therapy. This review examines both current and innovative clinical strategies that are used for identifying risk factors of bone loss. It provides an overview of perioperative outcomes and discusses the emerging novel treatment modalities. Furthermore, the review presents future directions in the treatment of ICU-related bone loss.
