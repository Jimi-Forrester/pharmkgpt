36593950|t|BAG2 drives chemoresistance of breast cancer by exacerbating mutant p53 aggregate.
36593950|a|Rationale: Chemoresistance is a major challenge in the clinical management of patients with breast cancer. Mutant p53 proteins tend to form aggregates that promote tumorigenesis in cancers. We here aimed to explore the mechanism for the generation of mutant p53 aggregates in breast cancer and assess its role in inducing chemoresistance. Methods: Expression of BCL2-associated athanogene 2 (BAG2) was evaluated by qRT-PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry in breast cancer patient specimens. The significance of BAG2 expression in prognosis was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the Cox regression model. The roles of BAG2 in facilitating the formation of mutant p53 aggregates were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and semi-denaturing detergent-agarose gel electrophoresis assays. The effects of BAG2 on the chemoresistance of breast cancer were demonstrated by cell function assays and mice tumor models. Results: In the present study, we found that BAG2 was significantly upregulated in relapse breast cancer patient tissues and high BAG2 was associated with a worse prognosis. BAG2 localized in mutant p53 aggregates and interacted with misfolded p53 mutants. BAG2 exacerbated the formation of the aggregates and recruited HSP90 to promote the propagation and maintenance of the aggregates. Consequently, BAG2-mediated mutant p53 aggregation inhibited the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, leading to chemoresistance in breast cancer. Importantly, silencing of BAG2 or pharmacological targeting of HSP90 substantially reduced the aggregates and increased the sensitivity of chemotherapy in breast cancer. Conclusion: These findings reveal a significant role of BAG2 in the chemoresistance of breast cancer via exacerbating mutant p53 aggregates and suggest that BAG2 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer patients with drug resistance.
