11450439|a|The analysis and justification of medicinal chemistry approaches for focused search of novel agents for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders treatment and prevention have been reviewed. The systematization of modern biochemical and structural date related to the action of physiologically active compounds on the nervous system apparatus engaged in the AD-like disorders pathogenesis was performed. The major attention was paid to the cholinomimetic, anti-amyloid and antimetabolic approaches, basing on the results published in scientific literature in 3-4 last years and results of preclinical and clinical trials, presented in the internet database in the fall of 2000.
