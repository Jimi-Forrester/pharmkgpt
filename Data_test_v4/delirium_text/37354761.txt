37354761|a|An analysis of delirium prevention considering only older adults is essential. Delirium markedly impacts the older adult population, as it is associated with inpatient occurrence rates from 14% to 56% and hospital mortality rates from 25% to 33% [2]. Ageing comes with a cumulative decline in physiological systems and is a relevant risk factor for chronic diseases [3,4]. Delirium causes in older adults can be multifactorial, including underlying medical conditions, medications, and environmental factors. Therefore, it is vital for healthcare providers to monitor for delirium symptoms in older adults and to implement appropriate interventions, such as addressing underlying medical conditions and addressing possible triggers [5]. Likewise, it is reasonable to think that eventual delirium preventive solutions for older patients would differentiate from the general population.
