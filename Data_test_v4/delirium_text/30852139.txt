30852139|a|Excessive or inappropriate inflammatory responses can cause serious and even fatal diseases. The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) gene encodes C/EBPalpha, a transcription factor that plays a fundamental role in controlling maturation of the myeloid lineage and is also expressed during the late phase of inflammatory responses when signs of inflammation are decreasing. MTL-CEBPA, a small activating RNA targeting for upregulation of C/EBPalpha, is currently being evaluated in a phase 1b trial for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. After dosing, subjects had reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and we therefore hypothesized that MTL-CEBPA has anti-inflammatory potential. The current study was conducted to determine the effects of C/EBPalpha saRNA - CEBPA-51 - on inflammation in vitro and in vivo after endotoxin challenge. CEBPA-51 led to increased expression of the C/EBPalpha gene and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines in THP-1 monocytes previously stimulated by E. coli-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Treatment with MTL-CEBPA in an LPS-challenged humanized mouse model upregulated C/EBPalpha mRNA, increased neutrophils, and attenuated production of several key pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, and IFN-gamma. In addition, a Luminex analysis of mouse serum revealed that MTL-CEBPA reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Collectively, the data support further investigation of MTL-CEBPA in acute and chronic inflammatory diseases where this mechanism has pathogenic importance.
