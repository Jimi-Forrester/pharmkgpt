32180936|a|Brain diseases including neurodegenerative disorders and tumours are among the most serious health problems, degrading the quality of life and causing massive economic cost. Nanoparticles that load and deliver drugs and genes have been intensively studied for the treatment of brain diseases, and have demonstrated some biological effects in various animal models. Among other efforts taken in the nanoparticle development, targeting of blood brain barrier, specific cell type or local intra-/extra-cellular space is an important strategy to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of the nanoparticle delivery systems. This review underlies the targeting issue in the nanoparticle development for the treatment of brain diseases, taking key exemplar studies carried out in various in vivo models.
