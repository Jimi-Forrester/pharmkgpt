32965437|a|OBJECTIVE: To identify the level of health literacy in informal caregivers of elders with Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Descriptive study with a quantitative and qualitative approach, with health literacy as a theoretical framework. Research carried out with 42 informal caregivers of elders with Alzheimer's from a geriatrics outpatient clinic, using a questionnaire with sociodemographic data and the Health Literacy instrument. RESULTS: The functional and conceptual levels were more prevalent, with regards to elders with Alzheimer's, than the empowering level. Caregivers searched, evaluated, and used health information and expressed abilities to use and judge the information received. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: The predominance of categories in the cognitive level of learning indicates the need to strengthen the empowering level of these caregivers. Health literacy made it possible to reveal the demands of informal caregivers of elders with Alzheimer's, evaluating their individual ability to offer this type of assistance. It is also a tool capable of reaching better health results.
