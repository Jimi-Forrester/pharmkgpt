37918323|a|INTRODUCTION: Delirium is the most common perioperative complication in older adults with hip fracture (HF), leading to a catastrophic impact on their functional recovery and cognitive status. Currently, the true prevalence of this syndrome is unknown as its detection and management are not standardized in clinical practice. METHODS: A multicenter observational cross-sectional study will be conducted nationwide, involving different orthogeriatric units in Spain. The prevalence of delirium will be assessed using the 4AT scale, along with its characteristics and its relationship with other geriatric syndromes, sociodemographic variables, surgical characteristics, and laboratory parameters. RESULTS: Data collection is scheduled to take place on World Delirium Day (Wednesday, March 13, 2024), and therefore, the results are expected during the second or third quarter of 2024. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the real prevalence and characteristics of delirium in older adults with HF could contribute to the development of strategies for its detection and management, reducing the impact of its consequences.
