29021727|t|Analgesia, sedation and arousal status in burn patients: the gap between recommendations and current practices.
29021727|a|Assessment and treatment of pain, agitation and delirium are integral parts of the management of critically ill patients. The purpose of this review is to describe how pain, delirium and agitation are managed in general intensive care units and in burn units, and to address whether management of these issues is compatible with internationally accepted recommendations. A substantial gap exists between the conception of the guidelines, clinical practice and physicians' statements regarding pain, sedation and delirium management. Specific training programs might be required to increase the implementation rate of guidelines and best practices on sedation, pain and delirium assessment and management in burn units.
