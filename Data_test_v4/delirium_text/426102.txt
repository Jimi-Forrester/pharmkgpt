426102|t|Delirium after cataract surgery: review and two cases.
426102|a|The authors define the delirium seen after cataract surgery on the basis of Dupuytren's original description and review studies using the criteria they set up on this basis. They then present prospective data on 2 patients with postcataractectomy delirium and 25 patients who did not experience this delirium. The data suggest that delirium after cataract surgery represents anticholinergic toxicity.
