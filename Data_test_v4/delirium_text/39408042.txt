39408042|a|(1) Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by cognitive decline and functional impairment. The NeuronUP platform is a computer program whose main function is cognitive stimulation through three types of activities that change so that the user does not manage to learn it. This program provides opportunities to work on various domains, including activities of daily living (ADLs), social skills, and cognitive functions. The main objective of this randomized clinical trial was to assess the impact of integrating the NeuronUP platform with conventional occupational therapy to enhance or maintain cognitive, perceptual, and quality of life (QoL) abilities in people with AD compared to a control group. (2) Methods: A randomized, single-blind clinical trial was conducted. The sample was randomized using a software program, OxMar, which allowed the separation of the sample into a control group (CG) that received their conventional occupational therapy sessions and an experimental group (EG) that received therapy with NeuronUP, in addition to their conventional occupational therapy sessions. An eighteen-week intervention was conducted. (3) Results: The study included 20 participants, and significant differences were observed in most variables analyzed, indicating improvements after the intervention, particularly in measures of QoL and cognitive status. (4) Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that an eighteen-week experimental protocol, incorporating the NeuronUP platform alongside conventional occupational therapy, led to improvements in cognitive status and QoL in older adults with AD. Thus, integrating the NeuronUP platform as a complementary tool to occupational therapy can be a valuable resource for enhancing the QoL of individuals with AD. However, due to the small sample size, further studies are needed to corroborate these findings.
