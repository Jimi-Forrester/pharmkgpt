38357675|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder which is associated with the accumulation of proteotoxic Abeta peptides, and pathologically characterized by the deposition of Abeta-enriched plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Given the social and economic burden caused by the rising frequency of AD, there is an urgent need for the development of appropriate therapeutics. Natural compounds are gaining popularity as alternatives to synthetic drugs due to their neuroprotective properties and higher biocompatibility. While natural compound's therapeutic effects for AD have been recently investigated in numerous in vitro and in vivo studies, only few have developed to clinical trials. The present review aims to provide a brief overview of the therapeutic effects, new insights, and upcoming perspectives of the preclinical and clinical trials of flavonoids for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
