33432494|t|Imaging Familial and Sporadic Neurodegenerative Disorders Associated with Parkinsonism.
33432494|a|In this paper, the structural and functional imaging changes associated with sporadic and genetic Parkinson's disease and atypical Parkinsonian variants are reviewed. The role of imaging for supporting diagnosis and detecting subclinical disease is discussed, and the potential use and drawbacks of using imaging biomarkers for monitoring disease progression is debated. Imaging changes associated with nonmotor complications of PD are presented. The similarities and differences in imaging findings in Lewy body dementia, Parkinson's disease dementia, and Alzheimer's disease are discussed.
