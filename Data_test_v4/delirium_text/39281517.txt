39281517|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological disease with memory loss and cognitive decline, which affects a large proportion of the aging population. Regrettably, there are no drug to reverse or cure AD and drug development for the primary theory of amyloid beta deposition has mostly failed. Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate novel strategies for preventing AD. Recent studies demonstrate that imbalance of mitochondrial homeostasis is a driver in Abeta accumulation, which can lead to the occurrence and deterioration of cognitive impairment in AD patients. This suggests that regulating neuronal mitochondrial homeostasis may be a new strategy for AD. We summarize the importance of mitochondrial homeostasis in AD neuron and its regulatory mechanisms in this review. In addition, we summarize the results of studies indicating mitochondrial dysfunction in AD subjects, including impaired mitochondrial energy production, oxidative stress, imbalance of mitochondrial protein homeostasis, imbalance of fusion and fission, imbalance of neuronal mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy, and altered mitochondrial motility, in hope of providing possible therapeutic approaches for AD.
