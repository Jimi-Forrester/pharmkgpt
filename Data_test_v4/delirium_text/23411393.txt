23411393|a|OBJECTIVE: We wished to develop a highly selective positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent targeting PHF-tau in human Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. METHODS: To screen potential tau binders, human AD brain sections were used as a source of native paired helical filament (PHF)-tau and Abeta rather than synthetic tau aggregates or Abeta fibrils generated in vitro to measure the affinity and selectivity of [(18)F]T807 to tau and Abeta. Brain uptake and biodistribution of [(18)F]T807 in mice were also tested. RESULTS: In vitro autoradiography results show that [(18)F]T807 exhibits strong binding to PHF-tau-positive human brain sections. A dissociation constant (Kd) of [(18)F]T807 (14.6 nM) was measured using brain sections from the frontal lobe of AD patients. A comparison of autoradiography and double immunohistochemical staining of PHF-tau and Abeta on adjacent sections demonstrated that [(18)F]T807 binding colocalized with immunoreactive PHF-tau pathology, but did not highlight Abeta plaques. In vivo studies in mice demonstrated that [(18)F]T807 was able to cross the blood-brain barrier and washed out quickly. CONCLUSIONS: [(18)F]T807 demonstrates high affinity and selectivity to PHF-tau as well as favorable in vivo properties, making this a promising candidate as an imaging agent for AD.
