36297281|t|Design and Synthesis of Aminopyrimidinyl Pyrazole Analogs as PLK1 Inhibitors Using Hybrid 3D-QSAR and Molecular Docking.
36297281|a|Cancer continues to be one of the world's most severe public health issues. Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is one of the most studied members of the polo-like kinase subfamily of serine/threonine protein kinases. PLK1 is a key mitotic regulator responsible for cell cycle processes, such as mitosis initiation, bipolar mitotic spindle formation, centrosome maturation, the metaphase to anaphase transition, and mitotic exit, whose overexpression is often associated with oncogenesis. Moreover, it is also involved in DNA damage response, autophagy, cytokine signaling, and apoptosis. Due to its fundamental role in cell cycle regulation, PLK1 has been linked to various types of cancer onset and progression, such as lung, colon, prostate, ovary, breast cancer, melanoma, and AML. Hence, PLK1 is recognized as a critical therapeutic target in the treatment of various proliferative diseases. PLK1 inhibitors developed in recent years have been researched and studied through clinical trials; however, most of them have failed because of their toxicity and poor therapeutic response. To design more potent and selective PLK1 inhibitors, we performed a receptor-based hybrid 3D-QSAR study of two datasets, possessing similar common scaffolds. The developed hybrid CoMFA (q2 = 0.628, r2 = 0.905) and CoMSIA (q2 = 0.580, r2 = 0.895) models showed admissible statistical results. Comprehensive, molecular docking of one of the most active compounds from the dataset and hybrid 3D-QSAR studies revealed important active site residues of PLK1 and requisite structural characteristics of ligand to design potent PLK1 inhibitors. Based on this information, we have proposed approximately 38 PLK1 inhibitors. The newly designed PLK1 inhibitors showed higher activity (predicted pIC50) than the most active compounds of all the derivatives selected for this study. We selected and synthesized two compounds, which were ultimately found to possess good IC50 values. Our design strategy provides insight into development of potent and selective PLK1 inhibitors.
