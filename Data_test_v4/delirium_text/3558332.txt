3558332|t|A case of psychosis and delirium following withdrawal from triazolam.
3558332|a|A 53-year-old man with a 3-month addiction to approximately 5 mg/day of triazolam experienced psychosis and delirium following relatively abrupt withdrawal from the drug. In contrast to a previous report suggesting that triazolobenzodiazepine withdrawal may not respond to replacement doses of other benzodiazepines, this patient's withdrawal syndrome was effectively treated with lorazepam.
