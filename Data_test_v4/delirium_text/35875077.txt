35875077|a|According to GLOBOCAN 2021 cancer incidence and mortality statistics compiled by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common malignancy in the human liver and one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Although there have been great advances in the treatment of HCC, such as regofenib, sorafenib, and lomvatinib, which have been developed and approved for the clinical treatment of advanced or metastatic HCC. However, they only prolong survival by a few months, and patients with advanced liver cancer are susceptible to tumor invasion metastasis and drug resistance. Ubiquitination modification is a type of post-translational modification of proteins. It can affect the physiological activity of cells by regulating the localization, stability and activity of proteins, such as: gene transcription, DNA damage signaling and other pathways. The reversible process of ubiquitination is called de-ubiquitination: it is the process of re-releasing ubiquitinated substrates with the participation of de-ubiquitinases (DUBs) and other active substances. There is growing evidence that many dysregulations of DUBs are associated with tumorigenesis. Although dysregulation of deuquitinase function is often found in HCC and other cancers, The mechanisms of action of many DUBs in HCC have not been elucidated. In this review, we focused on several deubiquitinases (DUBs) associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, including their structure, function, and relationship to hepatocellular carcinoma. hepatocellular carcinoma was highlighted, as well as the latest research reports. Among them, we focus on the USP family and OTU family which are more studied in the HCC. In addition, we discussed the prospects and significance of targeting DUBs as a new strategy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. It also briefly summarizes the research progress of some DUB-related small molecule inhibitors and their clinical application significance as a treatment for HCC in the future.
