38068441|t|Bicuspid Morphology and Rapid Deployment Valve Replacement: Is This Still a Contraindication?
38068441|a|When using rapid deployment surgical aortic valve replacement (RD SAVR) in treating bicuspid aortic valve morphology (BAV), several challenges are faced due to annular asymmetry. The Sievers classification has been traditionally used for the description of BAV morphology. In this study, we aimed to conduct a retrospective feasibility analysis of RD SAVR in relation to the Sievers classification. From January 2014 to March 2022, 31 patients with BAV morphology (15 patients with Sievers type 0 BAV and 16 with Sievers type 1 BAV) underwent RD SAVR. Specific surgical techniques were applied depending on the BAV morphology. Comparable clinical outcomes were observed. No paravalvular leaks and no valvular re-interventions occurred in either group. CPB and cross-clamping times, as well as the prosthesis sizes used, were also not significantly different. Postoperative mean gradients were comparable in both groups. No significant distinction was found between the groups in terms of postoperative pacemaker indication, postoperative stroke, or death. Annular symmetry can be adequately restored through precise prosthesis sizing and placement according to an individual's valve morphology regardless of the Sievers classification of BAV by choosing a different landmark for the initial suture. RD SAVR seems to be a safe approach for any bicuspid morphology, with good hemodynamic results and time-saving potential in experienced hands.
