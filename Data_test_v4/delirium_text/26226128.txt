26226128|t|Receptor for advanced glycation end-products in neurodegenerative diseases.
26226128|a|This review, for the first time, aims to summarize the current knowledge in the emerging field of RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end-products) studies in neurodegeneration and neurodegenerative diseases. RAGE, a member of the multiligand cell surface immunoglobulin family, has been implicated in numerous pathological conditions - from diabetes and cardiovascular diseases to tumors and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, familial amyloid polyneuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. Until now, the detailed mechanisms of the contribution of RAGE to neurodegeneration remain elusive; however, mounting evidence suggests that its detrimental actions are triggered by its ligand interactions and contribute to increased neuroinflammation, neuronal degeneration, and apoptosis. Deciphering the role of RAGE in neurodegenerative disorders will be a milestone in our basic understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration, helping to delineate molecular links between complex RAGE signaling pathways and neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration.
