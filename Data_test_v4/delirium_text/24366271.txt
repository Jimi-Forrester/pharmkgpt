24366271|a|Factors other than age and genetics may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer disease (AD). Accumulation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in the brain seems to initiate a cascade of key events in the pathogenesis of AD. Moreover, evidence is emerging that the sleep-wake cycle directly influences levels of Abeta in the brain. In experimental models, sleep deprivation increases the concentration of soluble Abeta and results in chronic accumulation of Abeta, whereas sleep extension has the opposite effect. Furthermore, once Abeta accumulates, increased wakefulness and altered sleep patterns develop. Individuals with early Abeta deposition who still have normal cognitive function report sleep abnormalities, as do individuals with very mild dementia due to AD. Thus, sleep and neurodegenerative disease may influence each other in many ways that have important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of AD.
