37605111|a|BACKGROUND: Although the association between multimorbidity (MM) and hospitalisation is known, the different effects of MM patterns by age and sex in this outcome needs to be elucidated. Our study aimed to analyse the association of hospitalisations' variables (occurrence, readmission, length of stay) and patterns of multimorbidity (MM) according to sex and age. METHODS: Data from 8.807 participants aged >= 50 years sourced from the baseline of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSI-Brazil) were analysed. Multimorbidity was defined as >= 2 (MM2) and >= 3 (MM3) chronic conditions. Poisson regression was used to verify the association between the independent variables and hospitalisation according to sex and age group. Multiple linear regression models were constructed for the outcomes of readmission and length of stay. Ising models were used to estimate the networks of diseases and MM patterns. RESULTS: Regarding the risk of hospitalisation among those with MM2, we observed a positive association with male sex, age >= 75 years and women aged >= 75 years. For MM3, there was a positive association with hospitalisation among males. For the outcomes hospital readmission and length of stay, we observed a positive association with male sex and women aged >= 75 years. Network analysis identified two groups that are more strongly associated with occurrence of hospitalisation: the cardiovascular-cancer-glaucoma-cataract group stratified by sex and the neurodegenerative diseases-renal failure-haemorrhagic stroke group stratified by age group. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the association between hospitalisation, readmission, length of stay, and MM changes when sex and age group are considered. Differences were identified in the MM patterns associated with hospitalisation according to sex and age group.
