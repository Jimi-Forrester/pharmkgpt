30097850|t|PRDX6 Inhibits Neurogenesis through Downregulation of WDFY1-Mediated TLR4 Signal.
30097850|a|Impaired neurogenesis has been associated with several brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The role of peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) in neurodegenerative diseases is very controversial. To demonstrate the role of PRDX6 in neurogenesis, we compared the neurogenesis ability of PRDX6-overexpressing transgenic (Tg) mice and wild-type mice and studied the involved molecular mechanisms. We showed that the neurogenesis of neural stem cells (NSCs) and the expression of the marker protein were lower in PRDX6 Tg-mice than in wild-type mice. To determine the factors involved in PRDX6-related neural stem cell impairment, we performed a microarray experiment. We showed that the expression of WDFY1 was dramatically decreased in PRDX6-Tg mice. Moreover, WDFY1 siRNA decreases the differentiation ability of primary neural stem cells. Interestingly, WDFY1 reportedly recruits the signaling adaptor TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-beta (TRIF) to toll-like receptors (TLRs); thus, we showed the relationship among TLRs, PRDX6, and WDFY1. We showed that TLR4 was dramatically reduced in PRDX6 Tg mice, and reduced TLR4 expression and neurogenesis was reversed by the introduction of WDFY1 plasmid in the neural stem cells from PRDX6 Tg mice. This study indicated that PRDX6 inhibits the neurogenesis of neural precursor cells through TLR4-dependent downregulation of WDFY1 and suggested that the inhibitory effect of PRDX6 on neurogenesis play a role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases in the PRDX6 overexpressing transgenic mice.
