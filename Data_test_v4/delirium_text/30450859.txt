30450859|t|Concerns for Older Adult Patients with Acute Hip Fracture.
30450859|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify concerns among older adult patients with acute hip fracture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was performed with 152 consecutive patients with hip fracture. Details were obtained on perioperative concerns about hip fracture using a questionnaire that was specifically designed for this study and was administered face to face upon admission. The study inclusion criteria were age older than 65 years and having experienced femur neck, intertrochanteric, or subtrochanteric fracture. The exclusion criteria were not understanding the study purpose, having difficulty communicating, or refusing to participate. RESULTS: Older adult patients with acute hip fracture expressed concerns regarding excessive pain, medical staff, postoperative recovery, rehabilitation, and hospital expenses. In addition, fear of falling from the bed and anxiety regarding re-fracture were the patients' most significant concerns. CONCLUSION: Older adult patients reported fear of falling from bed and re-fracture as primary concerns. To overcome these concerns, fracture liaison services to prevent re-fracture should be introduced and enforced.
