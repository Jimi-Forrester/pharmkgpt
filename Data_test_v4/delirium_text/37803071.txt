37803071|a|To examine the association between hip fracture and associated factors, including polypharmacy, and develop an optimal predictive model, we conducted a population-based matched case-control study using the health insurance claims data on hip fracture among Japanese patients. We included 34,717 hospitalized Japanese patients aged >= 65 years with hip fracture and 34,717 age- and sex- matched controls who were matched 1:1. This study included 69,434 participants. Overall, 16 variable comorbidities and 60 variable concomitant medications were used as explanatory variables. The participants were added to early elderly and late elderly categories for further analysis. The odds ratio of hip fracture increased with the number of medications only in the early elderly. AUC was highest for early elderly (AUC, 0.74, 95% CI 0.72-0.76). Use of anti-Parkinson's drugs had the largest coefficient and was the most influential variable in many categories. This study confirmed the association between risk factors, including polypharmacy and hip fracture. The risk of hip fracture increased with an increase in medication number taken by the early elderly and showed good predictive accuracy, whereas there was no such association in the late elderly. Therefore, the early elderly in Japan should be an active target population for hip fracture prevention.
