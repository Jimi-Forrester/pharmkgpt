22595040|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with cognitive deterioration and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Sensorimotor gating deficit has been identified in neuropsychiatric diseases. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible sensorimotor gating deficit and its correlation to memory impairment and cerebral beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaque deposits in an amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1) double transgenic mouse model of AD. The sensorimotor gating in 3-, 7- and-22-month-old non-transgenic and transgenic mice was evaluated in a prepulse inhibition (PPI) task. Results revealed that the PPI was lower in the 7- and 22-month-old transgenic mice compared with the age-matched control, while the response to startle pulse-alone in the transgenic and non-transgenic mice was comparable. Congo red staining showed that Abeta neuropathology of transgenic mice aggravated with age, and the 3-month-old transgenic mice started to have minimum brain Abeta plaques, corresponding to the early stage of AD phenotype. Furthermore, memory impairment in the 7-month-old transgenic mice was detected in a water maze test. These results suggest that the sensorimotor gating is impaired with the progressing of AD phenotype, and its deficit may be correlated to cerebral Abeta neuropathology and memory impairment in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD.
