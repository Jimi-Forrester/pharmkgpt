33407277|t|Ferulic acid attenuates microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in retinal degeneration.
33407277|a|BACKGROUND: Retinal degeneration is often accompanied by microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. Ferulic acid (FA), an active ingredient of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects. This study explores the impact of FA on microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and associated retinal degeneration in rd10 mice. METHODS: Rd10 mice received different concentrations of FA every day from postnatal day (P)4 to P24. On P25, the visual function of the mice was evaluated by electroretinogram, and retinae were collected for further investigation. Microglial activation and the expression of relevant cytokines in the retina were evaluated by qPCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. Retinal structure was assessed by haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. RESULTS: Supplementation with 50 mg/kg FA provided optimal protection against retinal degeneration, with treated mice exhibiting more photoreceptor nuclei as well as greater wave amplitude amplification on electroretinogram than untreated mice. FA suppressed microglial activation both in vivo and in vitro, and inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory factors Tnfalpha, IL1beta, and Ccl2 in the retinae of rd10 mice. Furthermore, FA suppressed the activation of STAT1 and subsequently inhibited IRF8 expression, potentially highlighting a role for these pathways in FA-mediated immunomodulatory activity. CONCLUSIONS: Attenuation of neuroinflammation by FA may be beneficial for retarding retinal degeneration.
