39470161|a|BACKGROUND: The Everyday Cognition scale (ECog-39) scores are associated with future cognitive decline. We investigated whether the 12-item ECog (ECog-12), which is being collected in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)4, can predict progression. METHODS: Baseline self (PT)- and study partner (SP)-ECog-12 data were extracted from the 39-item version collected in the ADNI. Weibull analysis examined the relationship between baseline ECog-12 and future clinical progression (change in Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes [CDR-SB] scores and diagnostic conversion). RESULTS: Higher PT- and SP-ECog-12 scores were associated with faster CDR-SB worsening, with hazard ratios in cognitively unimpaired (CU) 3.34 and 9.61, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 1.44 and 2.82, and dementia 0.93 and 1.82. They were associated with conversion from CU to MCI 3.01 and 6.24 and MCI to dementia 1.61 and 3.07. DISCUSSION: SP-ECog-12 provided a higher prognostic value for predicting clinical progression, so this can help identify and monitor patients at risk in research and health-care settings. HIGHLIGHTS: The 12-item Everyday Cognition scale (ECog-12) data obtained from both raters increased diagnostic conversion risk from cognitively unimpaired to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and from MCI to dementia. ECog-12, rated by study partners, was associated with an increased risk of Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes worsening in all diagnostic groups. Our results provide novel information about the specific scoring outputs and rater types (participant vs. study partner) of ECog-12 that can facilitate screening, prioritization, and longitudinal monitoring of the clinical progression of participants in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 4 and other Alzheimer's disease clinical studies, clinical trials, and in health-care settings.
