34385726|t|Validation of Malayalam Version of Everyday Abilities Scale for India.
34385726|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is usually associated with impairment in everyday activities. Scales to assess activities of daily living, like the Everyday Abilities Scale for India (EASI), have been employed as screening tools for dementia or major neurocognitive disorder. EASI had not been validated in Malayalam. This study's objective was to validate the Malayalam version of EASI (M-EASI) in those aged >=60 years. METHODS: In a study undertaken in a tertiary care center, those aged >=60 years attending psychiatry, neurology, or geriatric clinic of general medicine departments were evaluated using M-EASI and the Malayalam version of Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (M-ACE). A total of 304 participants were recruited for this questionnaire validation. Information for M-EASI was obtained from a reliable informant. RESULTS: The mean age of the sample was 70.04 years (standard deviation-7.33). The majority of them were males (58.6%) and educated up to primary school (42.4%), while the majority of the informants were sons/daughters/siblings (47.7%) and were females (73.7%). Taking M-ACE scores as the gold standard for diagnosing MNCD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition criteria, there were 162 cases of MNCD and 142 normal controls. Cronbach's alpha was 0.91. At an optimal cut-off of 4.5, adequate sensitivity (77.8%), and specificity (75.4%) were observed. The positive predictive value was 78.6%, and the negative predictive value, 74.5%. CONCLUSION: M-EASI has adequate psychometric properties as a screening tool for MNCD.
