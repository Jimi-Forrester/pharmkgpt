30257675|t|Cold shock proteins: from cellular mechanisms to pathophysiology and disease.
30257675|a|Cold shock proteins are multifunctional RNA/DNA binding proteins, characterized by the presence of one or more cold shock domains. In humans, the best characterized members of this family are denoted Y-box binding proteins, such as Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1). Biological activities range from the regulation of transcription, splicing and translation, to the orchestration of exosomal RNA content. Indeed, the secretion of YB-1 from cells via exosomes has opened the door to further potent activities. Evidence links a skewed cold shock protein expression pattern with cancer and inflammatory diseases. In this review the evidence for a causative involvement of cold shock proteins in disease development and progression is summarized. Furthermore, the potential application of cold shock proteins for diagnostics and as targets for therapy is elucidated.
