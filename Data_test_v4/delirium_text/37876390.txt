37876390|t|Neurological Manifestations in Hospitalized Geriatric Patients With COVID-19 at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Jeddah, Western Region, Saudi Arabia From 2020 to 2021: A Cross-Sectional Study.
37876390|a|Introduction COVID-19 involvement in the nervous system has been reported in many cases. Viral neuroinvasion has multiple routes of entry. Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 can be divided into ones of the central nervous system (CNS), such as headache, dizziness, altered mental status, ataxia, and seizure, and of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), including ageusia, anosmia, acute illness demyelinating polyneuropathy, and neuralgia. Aim and objectives This study aims to observe and report the neurological manifestations in geriatric patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at KAMC-J and report the duration of admission to the in-patient and ICU wards. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted on admitted geriatric patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 from April 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 at KAMC-J. Using Raosoft , the sample size was estimated with a CI of 95% and a 36.4% prevalence of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients to be 289. Convenience sampling was used, and the data were collected from BESTCare EMRs. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20 (Released 2011) was used for descriptive and inferential statistical analysis. Results In this study, a total of 290 patients' data were collected, 161 (55.5%) of which were males. In addition, the median age was 71 (Q1-Q3: 65-78) years; furthermore, the median body mass index (BMI) was 30(Q1-Q3: 25-34) kg/m2. In descending order, the most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (HTN) (70.3%), diabetes mellitus (DM) (68.6%), cardiac disease (42.1%), chronic kidney disease (26.6%), neurological disease (23.6%), cancer malignancy (13.1%), and finally chronic respiratory disease (11.4%). Regarding typical COVID-19 manifestations, 181 patients claimed to have experienced cough (62.4%), dyspnea by 164 (56.7%), fever by 154 (53.5%), fatigue by 93 (32.3%), a reading of anoxia by 68 (23.4%), abdominal pain by 58 (20.0%), diarrhea by 56 (19.4%), and finally throat pain by 19 (6.6%). Manifestations and pathologies of the CNS included headache (25.4%), dizziness (21.5%), impaired consciousness (17.2%), delirium (6.6%), ischemic stroke (4.1%), focal cranial nerve dysfunction (2.8%), seizure (2.8%), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) (0.3%), and ataxia (0.3%). Moreover, pathologies of the PNS manifested as taste impairment in 46 patients (15.9%), smell impairment in 33 (11.4%), nerve pain in 7 (24%), visual impairment in 5 (1.7%), Bell's palsy in 2 (0.7%), and Guillain-Barre syndrome in 1 (0.3%). Moreover, the majority of patients who developed an ischemic stroke or ICH, or required admission to the ICU had either DM or HTN. In addition, 17 (25.4%) of the 67 patients admitted to the ICU developed impaired consciousness. All-cause mortality in our study was 31 (10.71%) cases. Conclusion Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are common and can result in serious complications if not detected and managed early, especially in the elderly. These complications are mostly seen in severely ill patients and may be the only symptoms in COVID-19 patients. In addition, patients' clinical conditions could deteriorate rapidly and result in significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is required among healthcare providers when dealing with such cases. Moreover, we recommend systematically collecting data on the short- and long-term neurological complications of COVID-19 globally and documenting the functional long-term outcomes after these complications.
