37579500|t|APPI-Derived Cyclic Peptide Enhances Abeta42 Aggregation and Reduces Abeta42-Mediated Membrane Destabilization and Cytotoxicity.
37579500|a|An amyloid precursor protein inhibitor (APPI) and amyloid beta 42 (Abeta42) are both subdomains of the human transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP). In the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Abeta42 oligomerizes into aggregates of various sizes, with intermediate, low-molecular-weight Abeta42 oligomers currently being held to be the species responsible for the most neurotoxic effects associated with the disease. Strategies to ameliorate the toxicity of these intermediate Abeta42 oligomeric species include the use of short, Abeta42-interacting peptides that either inhibit the formation of the Abeta42 oligomeric species or promote their conversion to high-molecular-weight aggregates. We therefore designed such an Abeta42-interacting peptide that is based on the beta-hairpin amino acid sequence of the APPI, which exhibits high similarity to the beta-sheet-like aggregation site of Abeta42. Upon tight binding of this 20-mer cyclic peptide to Abeta42 (in a 1:1 molar ratio), the formation of Abeta42 aggregates was enhanced, and consequently, Abeta42-mediated cell toxicity was ameliorated. We showed that in the presence of the cyclic peptide, interactions of Abeta42 with both plasma and mitochondrial membranes and with phospholipid vesicles that mimic these membranes were inhibited. Specifically, the cyclic peptide inhibited Abeta42-mediated mitochondrial membrane depolarization and reduced Abeta42-mediated apoptosis and cell death. We suggest that the cyclic peptide modulates Abeta42 aggregation by enhancing the formation of large aggregates as opposed to low-molecular-weight intermediates and as such has the potential for further development as an AD therapeutic.
