38860108|t|Predictors of the Availability of Long-Acting Injectable Antipsychotics in US Mental Health Facilities Serving Older Adults.
38860108|a|INTRODUCTION:  Older adults are at increased risk of psychotic symptoms and even more at risk of medication nonadherence due to various factors specific to their age including memory impairment. This study aimed to examine the availability of long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) in US mental health (MH) facilities that serve older adults. METHODS: This study includes 1,216 MH facilities, using the 2022 National Substance Use and Mental Health Services Survey (N-SUMHSS) data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the availability of LAIs in US MHs that provide services to older adults while logistic regression was used to compare facilities that offer the services compared to those that do not. RESULTS: Of the total facilities included, 420 (35%) and 58 (4.8%) offered at least one LAI and all LAIs, respectively. Hospital-based facilities compared to community-based facilities, facilities that provided only MH services compared to those providing SU and MH services, facilities that offer special Alzheimer's programs compared to those that do not, and facilities in Midwest states compared to those in East South Central, New England, and Mountain regions of the US were more likely to offer at least one LAI. Facilities that offer special services for veterans were less likely to have all LAIs examined. Only 43% of the facilities were certified by the Joint Commission. CONCLUSION: Less than half of US MH facilities that serve older adults have at least one LAI service despite the usefulness of these medications in the studied population.
