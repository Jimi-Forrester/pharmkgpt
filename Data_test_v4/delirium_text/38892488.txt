38892488|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and neurogenerative disease (NDD), and it is also one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The number of AD patients is over 55 million according to 2020 Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI), and the number is increasing drastically without any effective cure. In this review, we discuss and analyze the potential role of anthocyanins (ACNs) against AD while understanding the molecular mechanisms. ACNs have been reported as having neuroprotective effects by mitigating cognitive impairments, apoptotic markers, neuroinflammation, aberrant amyloidogenesis, and tauopathy. Taken together, ACNs could be an important therapeutic agent for combating or delaying the onset of AD.
