26349766|a|Proteinase 3 (PR3) is released from neutrophil granules and is involved in the inflammatory process. PR3 is implicated in antimicrobial defense and cell death, but the exact role of PR3 in the brain is less defined. Microglia is the major immune effector cells in the CNS and is activated by brain injury. In the present study, the effect of PR3 on glial activation was investigated. Microglial activation was assessed by the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species and expression of inflammatory cytokines. The conditioned media from activated microglia by PR3 was used for measuring the neurotoxic effects of PR3-stimulated microglia. The effects of PR3 in vivo were measured by microinjecting PR3 into the rat brain. Herein we show that PR3 increased the inflammatory responses including the intracellular ROS and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in rat primary microglia. Conditioned media from PR3-treated microglia induced neuronal cell death in a concentration dependent manner. Furthermore, microinjected PR3 into the striatum of the rat brain induced microglial activation and neuronal cell death. Interestingly treatment with anti-PR3 monoclonal antibody and protease inhibitors ameliorated microglial activation induced by PR3 in primary microglia and striatum, which also prevented neuronal cell death in both conditions. The data presented here suggest that PR3 is a direct modulator of microglial activation and causes neuronal death through the augmentation of inflammatory responses. We suggest that PR3 could be a new modulator of neuroinflammation, and blocking PR3 would be a promising novel therapeutic target for neuroinflammatory disease such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease.
