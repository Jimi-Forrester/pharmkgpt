12875042|t|Use and misuse of alcohol among older women.
12875042|a|Older women may be especially at risk for alcohol problems because they are more likely than men to outlive their spouses and face other losses that may lead to loneliness and depression. Physiologically, women are also at greater risk for alcohol-related health problems as they age. Because of these risks, alcohol use recommendations for older women generally are lower than those set for both older men and younger women. Screening and brief intervention may be especially useful in minimizing alcohol problems in older women. Although brief intervention research with this population is limited, the findings are promising.
