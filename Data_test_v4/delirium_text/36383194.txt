36383194|a|OBJECTIVES: Informal carers play a critical role in supporting people with dementia. We conducted a scoping review and a qualitative study to inform the identification and development of carer-reported measures for a dementia clinical quality registry. METHODS: Phase 1-Scoping review: Searches to identify carer-reported health and well-being measures were conducted in three databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Embase). Data were extracted to record how the measures were administered, the domains of quality-of-life addressed and whether they had been used in a registry context. Phase 2-Qualitative study: Four focus groups were conducted with carers to examine the acceptability of selected measures and to identify outcomes that were important but missing from these measures. RESULTS: Phase 1: Ninety-nine carer measures were identified with the top four being the Zarit Burden Interview (n = 39), the Short-Form12/36 (n = 14), the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced scale and the Sense of Coherence scale (both n = 9). Modes of administration included face-to-face (n = 50), postal (n = 11), telephone (n = 8) and online (n = 5). No measure had been used in a registry context. Phase 2: Carers preferred brief measures that included both outcome and experience questions, reflected changes in carers' circumstances and included open-ended questions. CONCLUSIONS: Carer-reported measures for a dementia clinical quality registry need to include both outcome and experience questions to capture carers' perceptions of the process and outcomes of care and services. Existing carer-reported measures have not been used in a dementia registry context and adaption and further research are required.
