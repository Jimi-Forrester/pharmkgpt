34809994|a|Exacerbation of symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) during COVID-19 or new onset of the OCD symptoms resulting from COVID-19 infection is an understudied area of research. It is possible that increased proinflammatory immune status is associated with the onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and that targeted anti-inflammatory treatments for COVID-19 infection can mitigate the new onset of Obsessive-Compulsive (OC) spectrum symptoms. In this review, we cover OCD pathogenesis as related to COVID-19, summarize the impact of cytokines on behavior, and suggest that anti-cytokine treatments can help mitigate post-COVID-19 and new onset of the OC symptoms.
