39392439|t|Medication management during risk of dehydration: A qualitative study among elderly patients with impaired renal function and informal caregivers.
39392439|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with impaired renal function are at an increased risk of dehydration due to vomiting, diarrhoea or fever (so-called sick days). Temporary medication adjustment during sick days is necessary and current initiatives and information materials for patients are available. However, the knowledge, experiences and information needs of patients and informal caregivers about sick day guidance are unknown. AIM: To gain insight into the understanding of safe medication use during periods of dehydration risk in elderly patients with impaired renal function and their informal caregivers. DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative interview study with patients with impaired renal function and unrelated informal caregivers from three community pharmacies in the Netherlands. METHOD: The interviews were conducted by telephone or live by two researchers in November 2020-September 2021 and audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. The coding of transcripts was performed deductively and inductively in Nvivo 12, a thematic analysis was applied. RESULTS: In total 12 patients and 11 unrelated informal caregivers were included. Three main themes were derived from the interview guide and subthemes emerged from the transcripts. The included patients and informal caregivers had limited knowledge about medication management during sick days. In contrast to patients, informal caregivers seemed interested in a medication management protocol for sick days. CONCLUSION: Patients with impaired renal function and informal caregivers have little knowledge about and experience with dehydration and safe use of medication during sick days. General practitioners and pharmacists should involve the care network, including informal caregivers, when implementing sick day guidance.
