38427192|t|Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) in Alzheimer's Disease.
38427192|a|MRS is a noninvasive technique to measure different metabolites in the brain. Changes in the levels of certain metabolites can be used as surrogate markers for Alzheimer's disease. They can potentially be used for diagnosis, prediction of prognosis, or even assessing response to treatment.There are different techniques for MRS acquisitions including STimulated Echo Acquisition Mode (STEAM) and Point Resolved Spectroscopy (PRESS). In terms of localization, single or multi-voxel methods can be used. Based on current data: 1. NAA, marker of neuronal integrity and viability, reduces in AD with longitudinal changes over the time as the disease progresses. There are data claiming that reduction of NAA is associated with tau accumulation, early neurodegenerative processes, and cognitive decline. Therefore, it can be used as a stage biomarker for AD to assess the severity of the disease. With advancement of disease modifying therapies, there is a potential role for NAA in the future to be used as a marker of response to treatment. 2. mI, marker of glial cell proliferation and activation, is associated with AB pathology and has early changes in the course of the disease. The NAA/mI ratio can be predictive of AD development with high specificity and can be utilized in the clinical setting to stratify cases for further evaluation with PET for potential treatments. 3. The changes in the level of other metabolites such as Chol, Glu, Gln, and GABA are controversial because of the lack of standardization of MRS techniques, current technical limitations, and possible region specific changes. 4. Ultrahigh field MRS and more advanced techniques can overcome many of these limitations and enable us to measure more metabolites with higher accuracy. 5. Standardization of MRS techniques, validation of metabolites' changes against PET using PET-guided technique, and longitudinal follow-ups to investigate the temporal changes of the metabolites in relation to other biomarkers and cognition will be crucial to confirm the utility of MRS as a potential noninvasive biomarker for AD.
