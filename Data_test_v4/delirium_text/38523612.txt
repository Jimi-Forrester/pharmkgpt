38523612|a|Background: Patients with chronic pain suffer from psychological effects such as anxiety due to the pain itself. Pain can not only impair activities of daily living (ADL) and quality of life (QOL), but also impair cognitive function. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to estimate the cognitive function of chronic pain patients using a deep neural network (DNN) model that has already been implemented in society. We investigated the characteristics of patients presumed to have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and, at the same time, verified the relationship with the questionnaire commonly used in chronic pain research, which is administered by 43 university affiliated hospitals and medical institutions participating in the chronic pain research group of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan (assessment batteries). Method: The study included 114 outpatients from a multidisciplinary pain clinic, and we estimated their Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores based on age and basic blood test data (23 items). Furthermore, we classified the estimated MMSE scores of chronic pain patients into two groups based on a cutoff score of 27, which indicates MCI, and compared the blood data and assessment batteries. Additionally, we used a control group of 252 healthy adults aged 45 years or older who visited a dementia prevention outpatient clinic for comparison with the MMSE scores of chronic pain patients. Result: The MMSE scores in chronic pain patients were below the cutoff for MCI. When classified into two groups based on the estimated MMSE score of 27 points, WBC, RBC, Hb, Hct, PLT, UA, BUN, creatinine, Triglyceride, and gamma-GT were significantly higher in the blood data. In the MCI group, PDAS values were significantly lower. Furthermore, only in the non-MCI group, a significant correlation was found between the estimated MMSE value and BPI, PDAS, and Locomo. The estimated MMSE scores were significantly lower in chronic pain patients than in healthy adults (p = 0.04). Conclusion: Patients with chronic pain may exhibit cognitive impairment due to systemic metabolic disturbances. This suggests that chronic pain affects activities of daily living, resulting in systemic metabolic disorders.
