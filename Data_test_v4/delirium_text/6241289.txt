6241289|t|Alzheimer's disease and malnutrition: a new etiological hypothesis.
6241289|a|The author proposes an etiological hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease (malnutrition with or without malabsorption); this may explain clinical and biological phenomena which occur in this disease. A search through the literature revealed that all people suffering from Down's syndrome (and who all develop Alzheimer's disease from forty years of age) also suffer from malnutrition. This hypothesis may explain the anatomical and neurobiochemical perturbations and the inefficacy of choline. Consequent nutritional treatment of the disease is proposed.
