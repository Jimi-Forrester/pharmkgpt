24712137|a|Here, we show that brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a less-invasive method and that its findings are very significant. In the present aging society, the number of patients with dementia continues to increase. According to a recent survey by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, as of 2012, the number of patients with dementia in the country was approximately 3,050,000, and this number is estimated to rise, as 10% of the population is 65 years or older. It is estimated that the number of patients with dementia will increase to 3,450,000 in 2015, 4,100,000 in 2020, and 4,700,000 in 2025, and that, by 2025, patients with dementia will account for 12.8% of the elderly population. Many remediable conditions have been referred to as dementia in the past, and therefore, accurate diagnosis is important not only for the patient but also for the family. Additionally, in Japan, as for Alzheimer's disease, only medicines that can delay the progress are available. However, it is said that Alzheimer's disease can be prevented with the care of the family and appropriate nourishment, exercise, and sleep. Diagnosis of general dementia begins with an interview of the patient and the family. In addition to a clinical diagnosis, imaging studies are performed; however, an accurate early diagnosis is difficult. A more accurate diagnosis can be obtained by the detection of cerebrovascular lesions, brain tumors, and brain damage using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and additional evaluation of the brain blood flow using SPECT. SPECT evaluation is a grade B-C1 recommendation according to the Dementia Disease Treatment Guidelines 2010, primarily developed by the Japanese Society of Neurology. In SPECT examination, Neurolite (ECD), a radioactive agent that tends to accumulate in the cerebral tissues because of the cerebral blood flow, is injected into the elbow vein with the patient in the supine position, and images are taken using a SPECT camera for 15 to 20 minutes. No pre-treatment is required and the procedures are conducted without causing pain or imposing a forced body position on the patient. At a glance, this seems difficult, but software vendors should provide a product such that even non-experts can read the images.
