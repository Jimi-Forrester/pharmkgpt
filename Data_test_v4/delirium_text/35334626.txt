35334626|t|Thyroid Storm Superimposed on Gestational Hypertension: A Case Report and Review of Literature.
35334626|a|A thyroid storm is an extreme manifestation of thyrotoxicosis, and is life threatening without an early diagnosis. Pregnancy or childbirth may worsen maternal hyperthyroidism or induce the development of a thyroid storm. Gestational hypertension, a disorder defined as new-onset hypertension, develops after 20 weeks of gestation and shares symptoms with a thyroid storm. The diagnosis of a thyroid storm may be challenging in patients with gestational hypertension. To highlight the significance of early thyrotoxicosis-related gastrointestinal symptoms, we report a case of a 38-year-old woman with a twin pregnancy, who was diagnosed with gestational hypertension, and then developed a thyroid storm during the peripartum period. She complained of nausea and abdominal pain, followed by tachycardia, hypertension, and a disturbance of consciousness with desaturation. After emergency caesarean section, fever, diarrhea, and high-output heart failure, with pulmonary edema, were noted during the postoperative period in the intensive care unit. The diagnosis of a thyroid storm was confirmed using the Burch-Wartofsky point scale, which was 75 points. In this patient, the uncommon gastrointestinal symptoms, as initial manifestations of thyrotoxicosis, indicated the development of a thyroid storm. The distinguished presentation of thyrotoxicosis-induced cardiomyopathy and peripartum cardiomyopathy also helped in the differential diagnosis between a thyroid storm and gestational hypertension. Aggressive treatment for thyrotoxicosis should not be delayed because of a missed diagnosis.
