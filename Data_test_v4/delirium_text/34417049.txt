34417049|a|OBJECTIVE: We investigated the efficacy of the Delirium Team Approach program for delirium prevention after cardiovascular surgery. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 256 patients who underwent cardiac or thoracic vascular surgery between May 2017 and May 2020. We compared the outcomes before and after implementation of the Delirium Team Approach program in December 2018. The program included the following components: (a) educational sessions for the medical team regarding delirium and its management, (b) review of preprinted physician orders for insomnia and agitation, and (c) routine screening for delirium. We investigated the early outcomes and effects of the Delirium Team Approach program on postoperative delirium. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative delirium significantly decreased from 53.3% to 37.0% after implementation of the Delirium Team Approach program (P = .008). Although no intergroup differences were observed in the rates of stroke and reexploration for bleeding, the length of intensive care unit stay and the overall length of postoperative hospital stay were shorter in the postintervention group. Hospital costs, excluding surgery, and the cost during intensive care unit stay were lower in the postintervention group. Multivariable analysis showed that the Delirium Team Approach program was associated with a reduction in postoperative delirium (odds ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.67; P = .001). Other predictors of delirium included age, dementia, chronic kidney disease, and intubation time. After risk adjustment using propensity score matching, the rate of postoperative delirium was lower in the postintervention group. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the Delirium Team Approach program was associated with a lower incidence of postoperative delirium in patients who underwent cardiovascular surgery.
