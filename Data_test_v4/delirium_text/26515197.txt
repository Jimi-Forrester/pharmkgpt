26515197|t|Mechanisms of long-term cognitive dysfunction of sepsis: from blood-borne leukocytes to glial cells.
26515197|a|Several mechanisms are associated with brain dysfunction during sepsis; one of the most important are activation of microglia and astrocytes. Activation of glial cells induces changes in permeability of the blood-brain barrier, secretion of inflammatory cytokines, and these alterations could induce neuronal dysfunction. Furthermore, blood-borne leukocytes can also reach the brain and participate in inflammatory response. Mechanisms involved in sepsis-associated brain dysfunction were revised here, focusing in neuroinflammation and involvement of blood-borne leukocytes and glial cells in this process.
