39057026|t|Structural Variations of Prions and Prion-like Proteins Associated with Neurodegeneration.
39057026|a|Neurodegeneration is becoming one of the leading causes of death worldwide as the population expands and grows older. There is a growing desire to understand the mechanisms behind prion proteins as well as the prion-like proteins that make up neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Both amyloid-beta (Abeta) and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) proteins behave in ways similar to those of the infectious form of the prion protein, PrPSc, such as aggregating, seeding, and replicating under not yet fully understood mechanisms, thus the designation of prion-like. This review aims to highlight the shared mechanisms between prion-like proteins and prion proteins in the structural variations associated with aggregation and disease development. These mechanisms largely focus on the dysregulation of protein homeostasis, self-replication, and protein aggregation, and this knowledge could contribute to diagnoses and treatments for the given NDs.
