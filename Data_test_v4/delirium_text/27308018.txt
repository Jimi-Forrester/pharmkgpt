27308018|t|Crystal structure of (1S*,2R*)-7-benz-yloxy-2-methyl-3-tosyl-2,3,4,5-tetra-hydro-1H-3-benz-azepin-1-ol: elucidation of the relative configuration of potent allosteric GluN2B selective NMDA receptor antagonists.
27308018|a|In the title compound, C25H27NO4S, which crystallized as a racemate, the relative configuration of the adjacent OH and CH3 groups on the azepine ring is trans. The seven-membered azepin ring has a chair-like conformation. The planar aromatic rings of the benzyl and tosyl-ate moiety are inclined to the planar 3-benzazepine ring by 78.39 (15) and 77.03 (14) , respectively, and to each another by 13.82 (15) . In the crystal, mol-ecules are linked via O-H O and C-H O hydrogen bonds, forming double-stranded chains along the a-axis direction. The chains are linked via C-H pi inter-actions, forming a three-dimensional architecture.
