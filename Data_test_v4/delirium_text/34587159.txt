34587159|t|Association between care burden, depression and personality traits in Alzheimer's caregiver: A pilot study.
34587159|a|INTRODUCTION: In this study correlations between care burden, depression, and personality at intrapsychic level in caregivers of Alzheimer's disease patients were evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Caregivers: n.40. Tests: Social-schedule; CBI; BDI; SASB-Structural-Analysis of Social Behaviours- Form-A- intrapsychic behaviours (8 Cluster); ECOG. Patients:MMSE. Statistical analysis: Chi-squared test; Anova one way F test; Pearson's R coefficient. RESULTS: Correlations: CBI-total and NPI(p < .001); CBI-total-ECOG (p = .042); CBI-total-BDI(p< .001); CBI- total-SASB-Cl7(p = .014); SASB-CL8(p<0.000); BDI and SASB-Cl 2 (p = .018), SASB-Cl 3 (p = .004), SASB-Cl7(p < .000), SASB-CL8 (p < .000). High CBI is correlated with high depression, neuropsychiatry symptoms, low cognitive patient's functions. Caregivers have the following intrapsychic behaviors: poor self-care, poor ability to take care of themselves; they exercise control over themselves and do not consider and/or ignore their basic needs at emotional and physical levels. These intrapsychic behaviours are indicators of depression (SASB Model) and are correlated with high care burden-CBI and high depression-CDQ. DISCUSSION: Care burden is closely related to the depression and individual personality (intrapsychic experience) of the caregiver. This may reveal a source of strength and may suggest areas of multidimensional and psychotherapeutic interventions.
