8868277|a|The verbal and attentional components of working memory were examined in patients with Alzheimer's disease, normal elderlies, and young controls. Patients with Alzheimer's disease, showed a reduced span but were sensitive to word length. This is indicative of a functional rehearsal procedure. However, the effect of phonological similarity on immediate recall was smaller in patients with Alzheimer's disease and these patients showed a depressed performance in tasks of phonological analysis. There was also a significant decrement in a task that assessed the attentional component of working memory. Examination of individual patterns of performance showed that the phonological deficiency was severe in a subgroup of patients while the attentional deficit was more general.
