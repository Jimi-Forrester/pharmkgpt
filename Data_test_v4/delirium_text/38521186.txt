38521186|a|INTRODUCTION: Astrocytes are glial-type cells that protect neurons from toxic insults and support neuronal functions and metabolism in a healthy brain. Leveraging these physiological functions, transplantation of astrocytes or their derivatives has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative disorders. METHODS: To substantiate the clinical application of astrocyte-based therapy, we aimed to prepare human astrocytes with potent therapeutic capacities from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). To that end, we used ventral midbrain patterning during the differentiation of hPSCs into astrocytes, based on the roles of midbrain-specific factors in potentiating glial neurotrophic/anti-inflammatory activity. To assess the therapeutic effects of human midbrain-type astrocytes, we transplanted them into mouse models of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). RESULTS: Through a comprehensive series of in-vitro and in-vivo experiments, we were able to establish that the midbrain-type astrocytes exhibited the abilities to effectively combat oxidative stress, counter excitotoxic glutamate, and manage pathological protein aggregates. Our strategy for preparing midbrain-type astrocytes yielded promising results, demonstrating the strong therapeutic potential of these cells in various neurotoxic contexts. Particularly noteworthy is their efficacy in PD and AD-specific proteopathic conditions, in which the midbrain-type astrocytes outperformed forebrain-type astrocytes derived by the same organoid-based method. CONCLUSION: The enhanced functions of the midbrain-type astrocytes extended to their ability to release signaling molecules that inhibited neuronal deterioration and senescence while steering microglial cells away from a pro-inflammatory state. This success was evident in both in-vitro studies using human cells and in-vivo experiments conducted in mouse models of PD and AD. In the end, our human midbrain-type astrocytes demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in alleviating neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and the pathologies associated with the accumulation of alpha-synuclein and Amyloid beta proteins.
