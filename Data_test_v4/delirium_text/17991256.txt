17991256|t|EEG changes and serum anticholinergic activity measured in patients with delirium in the intensive care unit.
17991256|a|The aim of this study was to examine whether serum anticholinergic activity (SAA) is a reliable indicator of delirium in the ICU, and whether there is a significant correlation between SAA and quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) data in delirious patients. In a prospective cohort study, we assessed ICU patients diagnosed with delirium (n = 37). EEG measurements and blood analysis including SAA were performed 48 h following ICU admission. The presence of delirium was evaluated using the Confusion Assessment Method for critically ill patients in ICU (CAM-ICU). The SAA level was measured using a competitive radioreceptor binding assay for muscarinergic receptors and quantitative EEG was measured using the CATEEM system. We found that, under comparable conditions, patients in the delirium group showed a higher relative EEG theta power and a reduced alpha power (n = 17) than did the non-delirious patients (n = 20). No difference in measured SAA levels were seen; therefore, there was no correlation between SAA and EEG measurements in delirious patients. We conclude that, in contrast to the EEG, the SAA level cannot be proposed as a tool for diagnosing delirium in ICU patients.
