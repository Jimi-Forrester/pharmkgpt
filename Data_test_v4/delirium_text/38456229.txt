38456229|a|INTRODUCTION: In older people undergoing surgery, there is a lower tolerance for complications. This highlights the need for documented clinical practices on proper prevention, pre-screening and management of complications such as postoperative delirium (POD). Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines exist for delirium management; however, the management of delirium in clinical settings differs widely. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop an understanding of the knowledge, components of self-efficacy (confidence/competence), and clinical practice related to POD care among preoperative and recovery nurses across different types of geographical locations in Australia. DESIGN: A 27-item online survey was sent out to professional associations focused on perioperative care across Australia. The participants included practicing registered nurses specialising in perioperative care. The main outcome measures were Knowledge, confidence/competence and clinical practice relating to POD care in older patients. FINDINGS: Respondents were categorised into two groups-major cities and rural and remote. Mean age was 46.3 years for respondents in Australian major cities and 49.5 for the comparison group. There was a statistically significant difference between Australian major cities and 'rural and remote' in confidence in detecting hyperactive delirium, 25.2% versus 11.7% respectively as well as managing hyperactive delirium, 13.8% versus 1.7%, respectively. Similar results were also observed on hypoactive delirium. Respondents from both groups did not mirror the ideal situation in managing a hyperactive delirium. DISCUSSION: Results from this study are inconclusive and there is no clear-cut observation in clinical practice or knowledge between the two geographical categories in this study. CONCLUSION: The absence of a distinct strategy with POD prevention highlights the need for a uniform approach and consensus on POD prevention and management in older people. This can be achieved by creating more awareness and education through professional development related to POD.
