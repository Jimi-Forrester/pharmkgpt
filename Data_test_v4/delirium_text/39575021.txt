39575021|a|Background Diabetes mellitus is a chronic condition that can lead to significant neurodegenerative complications. The extracts of traditional medicinal plants such as Clitoria ternatea and Emblica officinalis have neuroprotective properties. This study investigates the neurohistopathological alterations in diabetic male Wistar rats treated with these extracts. Objective This study aimed to assess the neuroprotective potential of Clitoria ternatea and Emblica officinalis extracts in mitigating neurohistopathological alterations in streptozotocin-induced diabetic male Wistar rats Methods In this experimental investigation, 48 male Wistar rats, aged 8-12 weeks and weighing 200-250g, were randomly allocated into eight groups (n=6): control, diabetic model, metformin treatment, Clitoria ternatea extract treatment, Emblica officinalis extract treatment, diabetic model + Clitoria ternatea extract treatment, diabetic model + Emblica officinalis extract treatment, and diabetic model + combined extract treatment. Streptozotocin 40 mg/kg was used to induce diabetes. Treatments included 100 mg/kg metformin, 300 mg/kg Clitoria ternatea extract, and 250 mg/kg Emblica officinalis extract. After three weeks, blood glucose levels, body weight, and neurohistopathological parameters (neuronal degeneration, gliosis, and vacuolation) were evaluated. Results The diabetic rats had much higher blood sugar levels (320.4 +- 15.3 mg/dL) and lost a lot of weight (180.7 +- 9.5 g) compared to the control group, which had normal blood sugar levels (92.3 +- 4.8 mg/dL) and stable body weight (225.4 +- 12.1 g) (p < 0.001). Treatment with Clitoria ternatea extract reduced blood glucose to 160.3 +- 12.1 mg/dL, while Emblica officinalis extract lowered it to 155.4 +- 11.8 mg/dL. The combined treatment brought glucose levels closer to normal (110.5 +- 8.9 mg/dL). Similarly, both extracts mitigated weight loss, with the combined treatment maintaining body weight at 220.4 +- 12.0 g, close to the control group (p < 0.05). The study of diabetic rats that had not been treated showed severe neuronal degeneration (4.2+-0.4), gliosis (4.5+-0.5), and vacuolation (4.7+-0.5). Treatment groups showed marked reductions in these parameters, with the combined treatment producing the greatest neuroprotective effects, comparable to controls (p < 0.001). Conclusions Extracts from Clitoria ternatea and Emblica officinalis, particularly when combined, provide significant neuroprotective advantages in male Wistar diabetic rats, significantly lowering hyperglycemia and related neurohistopathological changes. These findings support the potential use of these extracts as complementary or alternative therapies in managing diabetic complications.
