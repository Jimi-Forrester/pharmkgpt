39769209|a|There is increasing interest in the potential therapeutic role of 5-HT (serotonin) in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, which are characterized by the progressive degeneration and death of nerve cells. 5-HT is a vital neurotransmitter that plays a central role in regulating mood, cognition, and various physiological processes in the body. Disruptions in the 5-HT system have been linked to several neurological and psychiatric disorders, making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Although the exact causes of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are not fully understood, researchers believe that regulating the 5-HT system could help alleviate symptoms and potentially slow the progression of these diseases. Here, we delve into the potential of harnessing 5-HT as a therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. It is important to note that the current clinical drugs targeting 5-HT are still limited in the treatment of these complex diseases. Therefore, further research and clinical trials are needed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of its clinical application.
