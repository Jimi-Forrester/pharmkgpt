34090844|a|The term "nutritional cognitive neuroscience" was recently established to define a research field focusing on the impact of nutrition on cognition and brain health across the life span. In this overview, we summarize the robust evidence on the role of carotenoids as micronutrients with different biological properties in persons with cognitive (pre)frailty. As neurodegenerative processes during aging occur in a continuum from brain aging to dementia, we propose the name "nutritional cognitive neuroscience of aging" to define research on the role of nutrition and micronutrients in cognitive frailty. Further studies are warranted which integrate carotenoid interventions in multidomain, personalized lifestyle strategies.
