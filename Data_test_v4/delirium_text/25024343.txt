25024343|a|BACKGROUND: The Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) based on a comprehensive geriatric assessment has been developed to predict mortality in hospitalized elderly patients. The Treviso Dementia (TREDEM) Study is an observational prospective cohort study of 1,364 outpatients evaluated at the Cognitive Impairment Center in Treviso, Italy from 2000 to January 2010. OBJECTIVE: To use the MPI in the TREDEM outpatient setting to assess the correlation of MPI with mortality and hospitalizations for acute cases that occurred after the date of assessment. METHODS: MPI was consecutively applied to the last 340 of 1,364 outpatients who were evaluated at the Center from 2008 to January 2010, after the first publication of MPI index in 2008. Participants' mortality was verified by linking the cohort with Registries of Municipalities, National Register of Revenue Authorities, and Nominal Register of Causes of Death. Data about hospitalizations for acute cases that occurred within 12 months after the date of assessment were obtained from all Italian hospitals. A Cox regression method was used to investigate the effect of MPI upon mortality and hospitalizations, also considering confounder factors such as age and gender. RESULTS: 114 men and 226 women, aged 52.1-99 years (mean age 80.4 years), were studied and had an MPI mean of 0.41. On 15 February 2013, 100 were deceased, and average hospitalizations for acute cases were 0.3, days 3.8. For MPI scores between 0 and 1, the increase in the probability of death was more than nine times (odds: 9.53 p = 0.0002) and of hospitalization was more than six times (odds: 6.50, p = 0.0079). CONCLUSION: MPI discloses the risk of death and of hospitalizations for acute cases in outpatients affected by cognitive impairment.
