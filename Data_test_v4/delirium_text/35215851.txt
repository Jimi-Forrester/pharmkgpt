35215851|a|Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) variant strains adversely affect the production of pigs globally. Vaccines derived from PEDV traditional strains impart less protection against the variant strains. Moreover, sequence diversity among different PEDV variant strains is also complicated. This necessitates developing alternative antiviral strategies for defending against PEDV. This study explored a natural product, Levistolide A (LA), to possess antiviral activity against PEDV. LA was found to suppress PEDV replication in a dose-dependent manner. And the inhibitory effect of LA against PEDV was maintained in the course of time. In terms of viral RNA and protein production, LA also showed a strong inhibitory effect. In addition, LA was indicated to inhibit PEDV from attaching to the cellular membrane or penetrating the cells. Further study revealed that LA can induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the corresponding inhibitor, NAC, was found to antagonize the effect of LA on inhibiting PEDV replication. This illustrated that the LA-induced ROS generation played an important role in its anti-PEDV activity. LA was also identified to stimulate ER stress, which is an important consequence of ROS production and was proven to be able to inhibit PEDV replication. To conclude, this study revealed that LA can inhibit PEDV replication via inducing ROS generation.
