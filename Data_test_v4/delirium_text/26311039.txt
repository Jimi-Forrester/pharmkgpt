26311039|a|BACKGROUND: Senile plaques consisting of amyloid-beta (Abeta) are the major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and have been the primary therapeutic target. Immunotherapies, which are designed to remove brain Abeta deposits, increased levels of soluble Abeta and accelerated brain atrophy in some clinical trials, suggesting that the solubilization of Abeta deposition might facilitate the formation of more toxic Abeta oligomers and enhance neurotoxicity. METHODS: The capacity of antibodies against different epitopes of Abeta to disaggregate preformed Abeta fibrils was investigated. The co-incubation of antibodies and Abeta fibrils was then tested for neurotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: After the incubation of preformed Abeta fibrils with the N-terminal antibody 6E10, the fibrils were decreased, while the oligomers, mostly dimers and trimers, were significantly increased. However, no such effects were observed for antibodies targeting the middle domain (4G8) and C-terminus of Abeta (8G7). The co-incubates of preformed Abeta fibrils with 6E10 were more neurotoxic, both in vitro and in vivo, than the co-incubates with 4G8 and 8G7. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the antibody targeting the N-terminus of Abeta promoted the transformation of Abeta from fibrils into oligomers and increased neurotoxicity. Immunotherapies should take into consideration the enhanced neurotoxicity associated with the solubilization of Abeta deposits by antibodies against the Nterminus of Abeta.
