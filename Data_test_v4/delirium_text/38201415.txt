38201415|t|The Genetic Landscape of Sleep Disorders in Parkinson's Disease.
38201415|a|Parknson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting 1% of people aged over 60. PD is characterized by a wide range of motor symptoms, however the clinical spectrum of PD covers a wide range of non-motor symptoms, as well. Sleep disorders are among the most common non-motor symptoms of PD, can occur at any stage of the disease and significantly affect quality of life. These include rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), restless legs syndrome (RLS), excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and circadian rhythm disturbances. One of the main challenges in PD research is identifying individuals during the prodromal phase of the disease. Combining genetic and prodromal data may aid the early identification of individuals susceptible to PD. This review highlights current data regarding the genetic component of sleep disorders in PD patients, focusing on genes that have currently been associated with this PD co-morbidity.
