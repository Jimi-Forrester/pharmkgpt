22468891|a|INTRODUCTION: In an attempt of altering the natural history of Alzheimer's disease (AD), several compounds have been developed with the aim of inhibiting gamma-secretase, the enzymatic complex generating beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides (Abeta(1 - 40) and Abeta(1 - 42)), from amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is believed to be involved in the pathophysiological cascade of AD. AREAS COVERED: This article briefly reviews the profile of gamma-secretase inhibitors that have reached the clinic. The paper reviews studies from the primary English literature on gamma-secretase inhibitors published before November 2011, searching through the PubMed database of NCBI by author and the following keywords: drugs targeting beta-amyloid, gamma-secretase inhibitors, dementia syndromes and Alzheimer's disease. EXPERT OPINION: Studies in both transgenic and non-transgenic animal models of AD have indicated that gamma-secretase inhibitors, administered by the oral route, are able to lower brain Abeta concentrations. However, scanty data are available on the effects of these compounds on brain Abeta deposition after prolonged administration. gamma-Secretase inhibitors may cause significant toxicity in experimental animals and in humans believed to be associated with the inhibition of the cleavage of Notch, a transmembrane receptor involved in regulating cell-fate decisions. Unfortunately, two large Phase III clinical trials of semagacestat in mild-to-moderate AD patients were prematurely interrupted because of the observation of a detrimental cognitive and functional effects of the drug, possibly due to its lack of selectivity on APP processing. New APP-selective gamma-secretase inhibitors are being developed with the hope of overcoming the previous setbacks.
