35689269|a|BACKGROUND: Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIE) is caused by perinatal asphyxia, which is associated with various confounding factors. Although studies on the pathogenesis and treatment of HIE have matured, sub-hypothermia is the only clinical treatment available for HIE. Previous evidence indicates that chlorogenic acid (CGA) exerts a potential neuroprotective effect on brain injury. However, the role of CGA on neonatal HI brain damage and the exact mechanism remains elusive. Here, we investigate the effects of CGA on HI models in vivo and in vitro and explore the underlying mechanism. METHODS: In the in vivo experiment, we ligated the left common carotid artery of 7-day-old rats and placed the rats in a hypoxic box for 2 h. We did not ligate the common carotid artery of the pups in the sham group since they did not have hypoxia. Brain atrophy and infarct size were evaluated by Nissl staining, HE staining and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride monohydrate (TTC) staining. Morris Water Maze test (MWM) was used to evaluate neurobehavioral disorders. Western-blotting and immunofluorescence were used to detect the cell signaling pathway. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content test, catalase (CAT) activity detection and Elisa Assay was used to detect levels of inflammation and oxidative stress. in vitro experiments were performed on isolated primary neurons. RESULT: In our study, pretreatment with CGA significantly decreased the infarct volume of neonatal rats after HI, alleviated brain edema, and improved tissue structure in vivo. Moreover, we used the Morris water maze to verify CGA's effects on enhancing the learning and cognitive ability and helping to maintain the long-term spatial memory after HI injury. However, Sirt1 inhibitor EX-527 partially reversed these therapeutic effects. CGA pretreatment inhibited neuronal apoptosis induced by HI by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. The findings suggest that CGA potentially activates Sirt1 to regulate the Nrf2-NF-kappaB signaling pathway by forming complexes thereby protecting primary neurons from oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) damage. Also, CGA treatment significantly suppresses HI-induced proliferation of glial. CONCLUSION: Collectively, this study uncovered the underlying mechanism of CGA on neonatal HI brain damage. CGA holds promise as an effective neuroprotective agent to promote neonatal brain recovery from HI-induced injury. Video Abstract.
