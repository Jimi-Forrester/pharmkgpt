39350994|a|Delirium, a complex neurocognitive syndrome, frequently emerges following surgery, presenting diverse manifestations and considerable obstacles, especially among the elderly. This editorial delves into the intricate phenomenon of postoperative delirium (POD), shedding light on a study that explores POD in elderly individuals undergoing abdominal malignancy surgery. The study examines pathophysiology and predictive determinants, offering valuable insights into this challenging clinical scenario. Employing the synthetic minority oversampling technique, a predictive model is developed, incorporating critical risk factors such as comorbidity index, anesthesia grade, and surgical duration. There is an urgent need for accurate risk factor identification to mitigate POD incidence. While specific to elderly patients with abdominal malignancies, the findings contribute significantly to understanding delirium pathophysiology and prediction. Further research is warranted to establish standardized predictive for enhanced generalizability.
