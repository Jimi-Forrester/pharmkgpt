31178498|t|Dyspnea and Wheezing as the Earliest Manifestations of Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome: The First Case Report.
31178498|a|A 64-year-old Japanese woman developed fatigue, dyspnea, and wheezing in July. Although she had been undergoing treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for six days, she was transferred to our hospital with delirium and diarrhea. On admission, she had an eschar of 3 mm in diameter on her anterior chest. Polymerase chain reaction of her blood and eschar specimens led to the diagnosis of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Chest computed tomography showed ground-glass opacities, suggesting noncardiogenic pulmonary edema or viral pneumonia. This is the first case report of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome beginning with dyspnea and wheezing.
