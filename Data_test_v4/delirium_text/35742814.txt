35742814|t|Biomarkers of Dementia with Lewy Bodies: Differential Diagnostic with Alzheimer's Disease.
35742814|a|Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is a common form of cognitive neurodegenerative disease. Only one third of patients are correctly diagnosed due to the clinical similarity mainly with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this review, we evaluate the interest of different biomarkers: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain MRI, FP-CIT SPECT, MIBG SPECT, PET by focusing more specifically on differential diagnosis between DLB and AD. FP-CIT SPECT is of high interest to discriminate DLB and AD, but not at the prodromal stage (i.e., MCI). MIBG SPECT with decreased cardiac sympathetic activity, perfusion SPECT with occipital hypoperfusion, FDG PET with occipital hypometabolism and cingulate island signs are of interest at the dementia stage but with a lower validity. Brain MRI has shown differences in group study with lower grey matter concentration of the Insula in prodromal DLB, but its interest in clinical routines is not demonstrated. Concerning CSF biomarkers, many studies have already examined the relevance of AD biomarkers but also alpha-synuclein assays in DLB, so we will focus as comprehensively as possible on other biomarkers (especially those that do not appear to be directly related to synucleinopathy) that may be of interest in the differential diagnosis between AD and DLB. Furthermore, we would like to highlight the growing interest in CSF synuclein RT-QuIC, which seems to be an excellent discrimination tool but its application in clinical routine remains to be demonstrated, given the non-automation of the process.
