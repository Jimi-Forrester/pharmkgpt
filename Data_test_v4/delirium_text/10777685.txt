10777685|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent neurodegenerative disorder in the aged population and is characterized by the deposition of the 40/42-residue amyloid beta protein (Abeta), a proteolytic fragment of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Recently, it has been shown that physiological doses of estradiol reduce the generation of endogenous Abeta in primary cortical neurons. Here we investigate the influence of estrogen in amyloidogenesis and sAPPalpha secretion in the CNS. By means of primary cortical neurons overexpressing humanized APP(695) bearing the Swedish mutation (hAPP(695sw)), we analyzed APP maturation in the absence or in the presence of estrogen. We show that estrogen at a 2 microM concentration increases the release of the neuroprotective sAPPalpha fragment but does not reduce the release of Abeta in primary neurons overexpressing the Swedish-mutated form of APP. Furthermore, neurons cocultured with astrocytic cells or grown with astrocytes conditioned media do not exhibit the estrogen-induced increase in sAPPalpha secretion. Altogether, our data indicate that astrocytes interfere with estrogen in the regulation of sAPPalpha secretion, probably via secreted factor(s).
