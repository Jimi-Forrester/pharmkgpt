39125680|a|Inflammatory processes in the brain can exert important neuroprotective functions. However, in neurological and psychiatric disorders, it is often detrimental due to chronic microglial over-activation and the dysregulation of cytokines and chemokines. Growing evidence indicates the emerging yet prominent pathophysiological role of neuroinflammation in the development and progression of these disorders. Despite recent advances, there is still a pressing need for effective therapies, and targeting neuroinflammation is a promising approach. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the anti-neuroinflammatory potential of a marketed and quantified proprietary herbal extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves called EGb 761 (10-500 microg/mL) in BV2 microglial cells stimulated by LPS (10 ng/mL). Our results demonstrate significant inhibition of LPS-induced expression and release of cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and chemokines C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CXCL2), CXCL10, c-c motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and CCL3 in BV2 microglial cells. The observed effects are possibly mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), p38 MAPK and ERK1/2, as well as the protein kinase C (PKC) and the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling cascades. The findings of this in vitro study highlight the anti-inflammatory properties of EGb 761 and its therapeutic potential, making it an emerging candidate for the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases and warranting further research in pre-clinical and clinical settings.
