30609781|a|Vitamin D is currently one of the hottest topics in research and clinics, as well as in everyday life. Over the past decades, scientists gathered overwhelming evidence indicating that the observed global vitamin D deficiency not only has a negative impact on human skeletal system, but also facilitates development and progression of multiple disease of civilization, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, autoimmune disease, and cancer. This Special Issue, entitled "Vitamin D and Human Health", summarizes recent advances in our understanding of pleiotropic activity of vitamin D in the form of eight comprehensive reviews. Furthermore, eight research papers provide new insight into vitamin D research and highlight new directions.
