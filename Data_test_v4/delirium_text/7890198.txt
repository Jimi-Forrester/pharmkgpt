7890198|a|Compared to whites, minorities have similar rates of dementia but are less likely to use services. Native language videos and brochures that incorporated culturally specific perceptions of dementia, caregiving, and help-seeking for seven Asian and Pacific Islander American (APIA) groups were developed and tested. Findings suggested that these tools were culturally appropriate and, when used in combination with discussion, helped increase awareness of Alzheimer's disease and sources of help.
