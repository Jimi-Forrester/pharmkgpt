30257688|t|Early diaphragmatic plication after cardiac surgery: a case report in an obese patient.
30257688|a|BACKGROUND: Diaphragmatic plication to help ventilation weaning of an adult obese patient after cardiac surgery is very uncommon. Diaphragm paralysis is usually treated with conservative measures and ventilator support, after which surgical management is considered after months of medical monitoring. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a morbidly obese patient to whom ventilation weaning was unsuccessful following coronary artery bypass graft operation with mitral valve replacement. A de novo right hemidiaphragm elevation was seen on the chest X-ray. Diaphragmatic plication was performed promptly to treat severe respiratory insufficiency and generated favorable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Early diaphragmatic plication could be considered in the postoperative period of cardiothoracic surgery to facilitate management and ventilation weaning in the context of de novo diaphragm paralysis.
