24720730|a|Fibrillar amyloid-beta (Abeta) is the major constituent of senile plaques in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta is a short peptide generated from amyloid precursor protein with two main isoforms, Abeta40 and Abeta42, with the latter having two additional hydrophobic residues at the C-terminus. The two isoforms have distinct characteristics, in which Abeta42 plays a more pathogenic role. Some early-onset familial AD cases possess an elevated Abeta42/Abeta40 level, and biochemical studies show the two species interact with each other. Therefore, understanding structural conversion in the aggregation of mixed Abeta isoforms is essential for elucidating AD pathogenesis. Here, we systematically examined the differences between Abeta42, Abeta40 and various Abeta42/Abeta40 mixtures by monitoring the fibrillization kinetics, epitope changes, assembly, morphology and induced cytotoxicity. We found that the minor Abeta species in different mixing ratios modulated the major aggregation pathway. Size exclusion chromatography, circular dichroism spectroscopy and photo-crosslinking assay showed that soluble Abeta42 oligomers were stabilized after Abeta40 addition, and the equimolar Abeta42/Abeta40 mixture rapidly formed spherical oligomers. These oligomers were the most toxic among those examined as evidenced by neurite degeneration and neuronal toxicity. However, the oligomers were not responsible for intracellular calcium elevation. Overall, our results demonstrated that differently mixed Abeta species repartitioned oligomer intermediates on the major aggregation pathway. Furthermore, the equimolar mixture rapidly formed structurally stable and the most toxic oligomers. These results provided information on the potential pathological mechanisms underlying the elevated Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio in familial AD patients and in the local environment of sporadic AD brains.
