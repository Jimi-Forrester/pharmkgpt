37269680|t|Multi-modal cross-attention network for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis with multi-modality data.
37269680|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, the most common cause of dementia, so the accurate diagnosis of AD and its prodromal stage mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is significant. Recent studies have demonstrated that multiple neuroimaging and biological measures contain complementary information for diagnosis. Many existing multi-modal models based on deep learning simply concatenate each modality's features despite substantial differences in representation spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal cross-attention AD diagnosis (MCAD) framework to learn the interaction between modalities for better playing their complementary roles for AD diagnosis with multi-modal data including structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Specifically, the imaging and non-imaging representations are learned by the image encoder based on cascaded dilated convolutions and CSF encoder, respectively. Then, a multi-modal interaction module is introduced, which takes advantage of cross-modal attention to integrate imaging and non-imaging information and reinforce relationships between these modalities. Moreover, an extensive objective function is designed to reduce the discrepancy between modalities for effectively fusing the features of multi-modal data, which could further improve the diagnosis performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method on the ADNI dataset, and the extensive experiments demonstrate that our MCAD achieves superior performance for multiple AD-related classification tasks, compared to several competing methods. Also, we investigate the importance of cross-attention and the contribution of each modality to the diagnostics performance. The experimental results demonstrate that combining multi-modality data via cross-attention is helpful for accurate AD diagnosis.
