15239987|a|The objective of this study was to compare elective with emergent surgery in patients over the age of 90 years. We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients over 90 years of age who underwent alimentary tract surgery between 1994 and 2002 at a community teaching hospital. Of 100 patients (mean age 92 years; range 90 to 98 years), 82 were women and 18 were men. Seventy-three percent were admitted from private homes or assisted-living facilities, and 27% came from a skilled-nursing facility (SNF). Major comorbid conditions existed in 93%. Procedures included right hemicolectomy (22%), adhesiolysis and/or small bowel resection (19%), cholecystectomy (14%), left-sided or sigmoid colectomy (11%), and perineal proctectomy (8%). Overall morbidity and mortality were 36% and 15%, respectively. Postoperative complications included respiratory failure and pneumonia (11%), arrhythmias (9%), delirium (7%), congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction (6%), and urinary complications (4%). Twenty-eight percent of the operations were elective, and 72% were emergent. Morbidity and mortality were higher in the emergent group (41% and 19%, respectively) than in the elective group (26% and 4%, respectively; P=0.04), especially for patients with an emergent surgical problem who came from a nursing home (22%). Average length of stay was 12 +/- 10 days (range 2 to 69 days) with little difference between elective and emergent cases. Sixty-four percent of patients were discharged to skilled-nursing facilities. Alimentary tract surgery can be performed safely in nonagenarians, and they should not be denied surgical care solely because of age.
