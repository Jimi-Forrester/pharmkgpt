12974172|a|Stroke remains the third leading cause of mortality in developed countries despite declining tendency over the past decades. As the leading cause of disability and second cause of dementia, primary prevention should be the main way to fight the disease, since therapy is not efficient enough. Several observations pointed to estrogen as a protective agent that may reduce stroke risk, however, studies have shown conflicting data. There is no strong evidence that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases stroke risk. Several studies have shown that HRT may reduce the risk of fatal stroke. Conflicting results have been found for Alzheimer's disease and HRT as well. An association between higher serum concentration of estradiol and decreased risk of cognitive decline has been found in some studies, supporting the hypothesis that estrogen concentration may play a significant role in brain protection. Having in mind results of recent randomized trials, it is suggested that HRT should not be recommended on general basis for the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases or for primary prevention of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Osteoporosis, cognitive decline and climacteric symptoms that are likely to impact on quality of life, speak in favor for recommendation of HRT use. On the other side, family history of breast carcinoma, mastopathy, thromboembolism, in certain cases gallbladder disease, will discourage the commencement of HRT. Respecting the patient's preferences and having benefits and risks in mind as well as science advisory statements, individual counseling regarding HRT should be the leading concept in the healthcare of postmenopausal women.
