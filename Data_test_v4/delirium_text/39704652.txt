39704652|t|Anti-amyloid treatments for Alzheimer's disease: A study on physicians' perspectives.
39704652|a|Advances in amyloid targeting therapies (ATT) for Alzheimer's disease have introduced new options, necessitating an understanding of physicians' perspectives as these therapies move from trials to practice. A survey of Israeli specialists found that 84% were familiar with new ATT, but 60% raised doubts about their ability to significantly impact disease progression. Neurologists were more likely to recommend these treatments, but concerns included treatment costs and limited real-world experience. The decision to refer patients was influenced by patient age, financial status, and diagnostic test availability. Strategies to enhance physician education and improve patient access to ATT are suggested.
