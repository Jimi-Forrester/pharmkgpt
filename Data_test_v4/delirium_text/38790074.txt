38790074|t|The neuropathological landscape of small vessel disease and Lewy pathology in a cohort of Hispanic and non-Hispanic White decedents with Alzheimer disease.
38790074|a|Cerebrovascular and alpha-synuclein pathologies are frequently observed alongside Alzheimer disease (AD). The heterogeneity of AD necessitates comprehensive approaches to postmortem studies, including the representation of historically underrepresented ethnic groups. In this cohort study, we evaluated small vessel disease pathologies and alpha-synuclein deposits among Hispanic decedents (HD, n = 92) and non-Hispanic White decedents (NHWD, n = 184) from three Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers: Columbia University, University of California San Diego, and University of California Davis. The study included cases with a pathological diagnosis of Intermediate/High AD based on the National Institute on Aging- Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) and/or NIA-Reagan criteria. A 2:1 random comparison sample of NHWD was frequency-balanced and matched with HD by age and sex. An expert blinded to demographics and center origin evaluated arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and Lewy bodies/Lewy neurites (LBs/LNs) with a semi-quantitative approach using established criteria. There were many similarities and a few differences among groups. HD showed more severe Vonsattel grading of CAA in the cerebellum (p = 0.04), higher CAA density in the posterior hippocampus and cerebellum (ps = 0.01), and increased LBs/LNs density in the frontal (p = 0.01) and temporal cortices (p = 0.03), as determined by Wilcoxon's test. Ordinal logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, and center confirmed these findings except for LBs/LNs in the temporal cortex. Results indicate HD with AD exhibit greater CAA and alpha-synuclein burdens in select neuroanatomic regions when compared to age- and sex-matched NHWD with AD. These findings aid in the generalizability of concurrent arteriolosclerosis, CAA, and LBs/LNs topography and severity within the setting of pathologically confirmed AD, particularly in persons of Hispanic descent, showing many similarities and a few differences to those of NHW descent and providing insights into precision medicine approaches.
