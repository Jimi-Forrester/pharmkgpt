39411415|a|OBJECTIVE: A protocol was developed for neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) delirium: Step 1, gabapentin for pain or melatonin for sleep; Step 2, add on other Step 1 agent; Step 3, antipsychotics. The purpose of this study was to describe the utility and dosing of gabapentin for NICU delirium. METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of NICU patients from January 1, 2021-December 31, 2022 who received >1 dose of gabapentin based on the delirium protocol. Data collection included demographics, gabapentin regimen, and concomitant sedatives and analgesics. The primary objective was to identify the number of patients receiving gabapentin for Step 1 or Step 2. Secondary objectives included identifying the number of patients requiring antipsychotics (Step 3), the gabapentin regimen, comparison of Echelle de Douleur et d'Inconfort du Nouveau-ne (EDIN), Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD), and Withdrawal Assessment Tool-1 (WAT-1) scores 72 hours pre- and post-gabapentin initiation, and comparison of opioids, clonidine, and melatonin 24 hours pre- and 72 hours post-gabapentin initiation. Wilcoxon signed rank tests were employed with significance defined at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were studied. The majority (n = 22; 75.9%) received gabapentin for Step 1; no patients required Step 3. The median initial dose was 14.4 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours. Twelve (41.4%) required increase to a median of 16.9 mg/kg/day. A significant decrease in EDIN and WAT-1 scores was noted, but there was no change in CAPD scores or opioid, clonidine, or melatonin doses pre- versus post-gabapentin. CONCLUSION: The majority received gabapentin at a median dose of 14 mg/kg/day as Step 1 for delirium. Gabapentin was associated with a significant decrease in pain and withdrawal scores.
