32460794|a|BACKGROUND: Circulatory iron is a hazardous biometal. Therefore, iron is transported in a redox-safe state by a serum glycoprotein - transferrin (TF). Different organs acquire iron from the systemic circulation through a tightly regulated mechanism at the blood-tissue interface which involves receptor-mediated internalization of TF. Thus, abnormal TF trafficking may lead to iron dyshomeostasis associated with several diseases including neurodegeneration. Iron -induced toxicity can cause neuronal damage to iron-sensitive brain regions. Recently, it was discovered that CAMKK2, a calcium (Ca2+)/calmodulin-activated kinase, controls receptor-mediated TF trafficking in mouse tissues, specifically in the brain. The biological function of CAMKK2 is mediated through multiple downstream effectors. Both CAMKK2 and one of its downstream kinase, CAMK4, exhibit overlapping expression in mouse brain. The role of CAMK4 in vesicular transport has been reported and loss of CAMKK2 or CAMK4 leads to cognitive defects in mouse. Therefore, it was hypothesized that CAMKK2-CAMK4 signaling regulates receptor-mediated TF trafficking and iron homeostasis which may be responsible for the neuronal malfunction observed in CAMKK2- or CAMK4-deficient mice. METHODS: CAMK4-/- mouse was used to study tissue-specific turnover of TF, TF-receptor (TFRC) and iron. CRISPR/Cas9-based CAMKK2 and/or CAMK4 deleted human embryonic kidney-derived HEK293 cell clones were used to study the molecular defects in receptor-mediated TF trafficking. Further, a "zero functional G protein" condition in HEK293 cell was exploited to study CAMKK2-CAMK4 signaling-mediated regulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis which was linked to calcium signaling during TF trafficking. RESULTS: Loss of CAMK4 leads to abnormal post-translational modifications (PTMs) and turnover of TF in mouse cerebellum and liver which was associated with iron dyshomeostasis in these tissues. The HEK293 cell-based study revealed that the absence of CAMKK2-CAMK4 signaling altered intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and lead to abnormal calcium signaling during TF trafficking. Also, CAMKK2-CAMK4 signaling deficiency affected the molecular interaction of TF and TF-receptor-associated protein complexes which indicated a potential failure in the recruitment of interacting proteins due to differential PTMs in TF. CONCLUSION: Overall, this study established a novel mechanistic link between intracellular Ca2+ level, receptor-mediated TF trafficking, and iron homeostasis, all regulated by CAMKK2-CAMK4 signaling.
