Studies have shown that the second to fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) is affected by the prenatal testosterone and estrogen levels and can predict predisposition to disease. In addition, decreased muscle strength in people with Parkinson's has been repeatedly reported. Hand grip strength (HGS) is a suitable measure to evaluate the musculoskeletal system among the elderly and it is considered as an indicator of the overall strength of the body. This study aimed at investigating the relationship between Parkinson's disease and HGS and 2D:4D ratio. METHODS: In this study 117 elderly men with Parkinson disease (mean age of 61.66 +- 11.28 years) and 156 healthy control subjects (mean age of 61.86 +- 6.29 years) participated. After determining the level of disability of Parkinson patients by a neurologist (level of disability in the range of 1-4), anthropometric indices (height, weight, length of the second and fourth fingers) and maximum HGS were measured. RESULTS: Although 2D:4D ratios (right and left hand) of male patients with Parkinson's disease were higher than those of healthy males, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.12, P = 0.40; respectively). Conversely, HGS for the right and left hands of Parkinson patients were significantly lower than those of healthy males (P = 0.02, P = 0.03; respectively). The results showed a significant negative relationship between Parkinson disease and the right and left HGS (R = -0.16, P = 0.005; R = -0.17, P = 0.003; respectively). Parkinson disease had no significant relationship with 2D:4D of the right hand, left hand, mean finger ratio and DR-L 2D:4D (P > 0.05). The regression results showed that the right and left HGS were not able to predict Parkinson disease (P = 0.25, P = 0.16; respectively). CONCLUSION: We concluded that HGS was negatively associated with the Parkinson disease, but conversely, 2D:4D may not be a valuable biomarker of elevated risk of Parkinson in elderly males.
