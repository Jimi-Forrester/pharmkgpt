38002553|t|Alzheimer's Disease CSF Biomarkers as Possible Indicators of Tap-Test Response in Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus.
38002553|a|The aim of the present study is the evaluation of established Alzheimer's disease (AD) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in patients with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), both individually and as a total profile, and the investigation of their use as potential predictors of Tap-test responsiveness. Fifty-three patients with iNPH participated in the study. Abeta42, Abeta40, total Tau and phospho-Tau proteins were measured in duplicate with double-sandwich ELISA assays. Clinical evaluation involved a 10 m timed walk test before an evacuative lumbar puncture (LP) and every 24 h for three consecutive days afterwards. Neuropsychological assessment involved a mini-mental state examination, frontal assessment battery, 5-word test and CLOX drawing test 1 and 2, which were also performed before and 48 h after LP. Response in the Tap-test was defined as a 20% improvement in gait and/or a 10% improvement in neuropsychological tests. The Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio was found to be significantly higher in Tap-test responders than non-responders. Total Tau and phospho-Tau CSF levels also differed significantly between these two groups, with Tap-test responders presenting with lower levels compared to non-responders. Regarding the AD CSF biomarker profile (decreased amyloid and increased Tau proteins levels), patients with a non-AD profile were more likely to have a positive response in the Tap-test than patients with an AD profile.
