39450046|a|Background: Encephalitis associated with antibodies against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) results in a distinctive neuro-psychiatric syndrome. It has been reported that the serum phenylalanine-tyrosine (Phe/Tyr) ratio increases during infection. However, the connection between phenylalanine-tyrosine metabolism and psychiatric symptoms remains unclear. Methods: We enrolled 24 individuals with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and 18 individuals with non-inflammatory neurological diseases (OND). Chromatography was used to measure serum levels of phenylalanine and tyrosine. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) TNF-alpha levels were obtained from the clinical database. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score were recorded during the acute phase. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to assess prediction efficacy. Results: In NMDAR patients, levels of serum Phe and the ratio of serum Phe/Tyr were higher compared to OND patients. The serum Phe/Tyr ratio was also elevated in NMDAR patients with psychiatric syndrome. Furthermore, serum Phe and Tyr levels were correlated with inflammatory indexes. Conclusion: The serum Phe/Tyr ratio is elevated in NMDAR patients with psychiatric syndrome and is associated with severity. Therefore, the serum Phe/Tyr ratio may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker.
