17631544|a|Structural MRI and functional imaging by SPECT as well as 18F-FDG PET are widely used in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Metabolic and perfusion reductions in the parietotemporal association cortex are recognized as a diagnostic pattern for AD. Outstanding progress in the diagnostic accuracy of these modalities has been achieved with statistical analysis on a voxel-by-voxel basis after anatomic standardization of individual scans to a standardized brain volume template instead of visual inspection or a volume-of-interest technique. In a very early stage of AD, this statistical approach revealed losses of gray matter in the entorhinal and hippocampal areas and hypometabolism or hypoperfusion in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus. This statistical approach also offers a prediction of the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. The presence of hypometabolism or hypoperfusion in parietal association areas and entorhinal atrophy at the MCI stage have been reported to predict a rapid conversion to AD. A recent advance in voxel-based statistical analysis has markedly enhanced the value of brain perfusion SPECT in diagnosing early AD at the stage of MCI.
