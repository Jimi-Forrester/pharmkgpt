29763451|a|BACKGROUND: Both amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and schizophrenia, in particular deficit schizophrenia, are accompanied by cognitive impairments. The aim of the present study was to examine the cognitive differences between aMCI and (non)deficit schizophrenia. METHODS: Towards this end we recruited 60 participants with aMCI, 40 with deficit and 40 with nondeficit schizophrenia and 103 normal volunteers. Cognitive measures were assessed with the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease (CERAD) using the Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), Boston Naming Test (BNT), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Word list memory (WLM), Word list recall (WLRecall) and Word list recognition (WLRecognition). Data were analyzed using multivariate analyses and machine learning techniques. RESULTS: BNT scores were significantly lower in aMCI as compared with nondeficit schizophrenia. Patients with deficit schizophrenia had significantly lower MMSE, WLM, WL True Recall and WL Recognition than aMCI patients, while WL False Recall was significantly higher in deficit schizophrenia than in aMCI. Neural network importance charts show that deficit and nondeficit schizophrenia are best separated from aMCI using total BNT score, while WLM and WL false Recall follow at a distance. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with schizophrenia and aMCI have a significantly different neurocognitive profile. Memory impairments, especially in episodic memory, are significantly worse in younger patients with deficit schizophrenia as compared with elderly patients with aMCI, while the latter show more dysnomia than patients with schizophrenia.
