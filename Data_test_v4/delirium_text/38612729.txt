This research investigates the association of neuropsychiatric symptoms, evaluated via the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (Amyloid-beta42, P-tau, T-tau) across a spectrum of cognitive states to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment approaches. Drawing from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Set Version 3, comprising 977 individuals with normal cognition, 270 with MCI, and 649 with dementia. To assess neuropsychiatric symptoms, we employed the NPI to understand the behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with each cognitive category. For the analysis of CSF biomarkers, we measured levels of Amyloid-beta42, P-tau, and T-tau using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Luminex multiplex xMAP assay protocols. These biomarkers are critical in understanding the pathophysiological underpinnings of Alzheimer's disease and its progression, with specific patterns indicative of disease stage and severity. This study cohort consists of 1896 participants, which is composed of 977 individuals with normal cognition, 270 with MCI, and 649 with dementia. Dementia is characterized by significantly higher NPI scores, which are largely reflective of mood-related symptoms (p < 0.001). In terms of biomarkers, normal cognition shows median Amyloid-beta at 656.0 pg/mL, MCI at 300.6 pg/mL, and dementia at 298.8 pg/mL (p < 0.001). Median P-tau levels are 36.00 pg/mL in normal cognition, 49.12 pg/mL in MCI, and 58.29 pg/mL in dementia (p < 0.001). Median T-tau levels are 241.0 pg/mL in normal cognition, 140.6 pg/mL in MCI, and 298.3 pg/mL in dementia (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the T-tau/Abeta-42 ratio increases progressively from 0.058 in the normal cognition group to 0.144 in the MCI group, and to 0.209 in the dementia group (p < 0.001). Similarly, the P-tau/Abeta-42 ratio also escalates from 0.305 in individuals with normal cognition to 0.560 in MCI, and to 0.941 in dementia (p < 0.001). The notable disparities in NPI and CSF biomarkers among normal, MCI and Alzheimer's patients underscore their diagnostic potential. Their combined assessment could greatly improve early detection and precise diagnosis of MCI and dementia, facilitating more effective and timely treatment strategies.
