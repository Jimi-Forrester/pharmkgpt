27789271|a|Gaucher disease (GD), the most common lysosomal storage disease, is caused by mutations in GBA1 encoding of beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). Recently it was reported that progranulin (PGRN) insufficiency and deficiency associated with GD in human and mice, respectively. However the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we report that PGRN binds directly to GCase and its deficiency results in aggregation of GCase and its receptor LIMP2. Mass spectrometry approaches identified HSP70 as a GCase/LIMP2 complex-associated protein upon stress, with PGRN as an indispensable adaptor. Additionally, 98 amino acids of C-terminal PGRN, referred to as Pcgin, are required and sufficient for the binding to GCase and HSP70. Pcgin effectively ameliorates the disease phenotype in GD patient fibroblasts and animal models. These findings not only demonstrate that PGRN is a co-chaperone of HSP70 and plays an important role in GCase lysosomal localization, but may also provide new therapeutic interventions for lysosomal storage diseases, in particular GD.
