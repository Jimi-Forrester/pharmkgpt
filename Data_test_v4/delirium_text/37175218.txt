37175218|t|Evaluation of Biological Activity of New 1,2,4-Triazole Derivatives Containing Propionic Acid Moiety.
37175218|a|To this day, the quest to find new drugs is still a challenge due to the growing demands of patients suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases and the need for the individualization of therapy. The aim of this research was to synthesize new 1,2,4-triazole derivatives containing propanoic acid moiety and to investigate their anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and anthelmintic activity. Compounds 3a-3g were obtained in reactions of amidrazones 1a-1g with succinic anhydride. Several analyses of proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR, 13C NMR, respectively), as well as high-resolution mass spectra (HRMS), confirmed the structures of 1,2,4-triazole derivatives 3a-3g. Toxicity, antiproliferative activity and influence on cytokine release (TNF-alpha: Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, IL-6: Interleukin-6, IFN-gamma: Interferon-gamma, and IL-10: Interleukin-10) of the compounds 3a-3g were evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells culture. Moreover, mitogen-stimulated cell culture was used for biological activity tests. The antimicrobial and anthelmintic activity of derivatives 3a-3g were studied against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains and Rhabditis sp. culture. Despite the lack of toxicity, compounds 3a-3g significantly reduced the level of TNF-alpha. Derivatives 3a, 3c and 3e also decreased the release of IFN-gamma. Taking all of the results into consideration, compounds 3a, 3c and 3e show the most beneficial anti-inflammatory effects.
