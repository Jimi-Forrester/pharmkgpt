30103329|t|Endocytosis and Transcytosis of Amyloid-beta Peptides by Astrocytes: A Possible Mechanism for Amyloid-beta Clearance in Alzheimer's Disease.
30103329|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, Abeta40, Abeta42, and recently Abeta25 - 35, have been directly implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously shown that all three peptides decrease neuronal viability, but Abeta40 also promotes synaptic disassembling. In this work, we have studied the effects of these peptides on astrocytes in primary culture and found that the three Abeta peptides were internalized by astrocytes and significantly decreased astrocyte viability, while increasing ROS production. Abeta peptide internalization is temperature-dependent, a fact that supports the idea that Abeta peptides are actively endocytosed by astrocytes. However, inhibiting caveolae formation by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin or by silencing caveolin-1 with RNA interference did not prevent Abeta endocytosis, which suggests that Abeta peptides do not use caveolae to enter astrocytes. Conversely, inhibition of clathrin-coated vesicle formation by chlorpromazine or by silencing clathrin with RNA interference significantly decreased Abeta internalization and partially reverted the decrease of astrocyte viability caused by the presence of Abeta. These results suggest that Abeta is endocytosed by clathrin-coated vesicles in astrocytes. Abeta-loaded astrocytes, when co-incubated with non-treated astrocytes in separate wells but with the same incubation medium, promoted cell death in non-treated astrocytes; a fact that was associated with the presence of Abeta inside previously unloaded astrocytes. This phenomenon was inhibited by the presence of chlorpromazine in the co-incubation medium. These results suggest that astrocyte may perform Abeta transcytosis, a process that could play a role in the clearance of Abeta peptides from the brain to cerebrospinal fluid.
