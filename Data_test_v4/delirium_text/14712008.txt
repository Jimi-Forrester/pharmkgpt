14712008|t|Identifying and treating reversible causes of urinary incontinence.
14712008|a|Urinary incontinence can be a symptom of a variety of reversible conditions. Common and reversible causes of urinary incontinence include polyuria, exposure to irritants (including concentrated urine), infection, urinary retention, use of pharmaceuticals, stool impaction or constipation, atrophic urethritis or vaginitis, restricted mobility or dexterity, psychological conditions, and delirium or acute confused state. Healthcare professionals can use existing assessment strategies, tools, and parameters to guide decisions and treatment options to manage these conditions. First-line assessment tools are reviewed, including the use of a voiding and bowel diary, simple dipstick urinalysis, catheterization for post-void residual, the Folstein Mini Mental Status evaluation, and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Guidelines for estimating normal ranges of urine output, the influence of irritants, the risk of incontinence caused by stool impaction, and urinary retention are discussed. Primary care providers are well positioned to rule out or treat many of the reversible causes of urinary incontinence using simple assessment tools and pragmatic guidelines.
