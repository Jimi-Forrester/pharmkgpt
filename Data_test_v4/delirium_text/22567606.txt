22567606|t|Refractory delirium tremens: a case report and brief review.
22567606|a|Delirium tremens is a common presentation in tertiary care hospitals. Severe and/or refractory delirium tremens is not as common, is potentially lethal, and requires intensive management. Usually delirium tremens responds to management with standard doses of benzodiazepines. Limited literature is available, however, for the management of refractory delirium tremens. We describe a case of refractory delirium tremens in which the patient was successfully managed with a combination of high doses of lorazapam, midazolam, and phenytoin.
