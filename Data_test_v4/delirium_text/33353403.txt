33353403|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine whether demographic, dementia-related, and control-related variables predict preparation for future care needs (PFCN) in a sample of middle-aged and older adults. PFCN is defined in this study as a self-perceived sense of preparedness for one's own future care needs, including general awareness of future care needs, gathering relevant information, decision-making about care preferences, concrete planning, and non-avoidance of care planning. METHODS: Participants (N = 122; age 40 to 88 years: M = 65.83, SD = 9.80) completed self-report measures in an in-person study. Hierarchical multiple regression was calculated to predict PFCN. RESULTS: Being female, having more positive dementia attitudes, higher attribution to powerful others for health condition(s), and more completed end-of-life (EOL) planning significantly predicted greater PFCN. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate a positive relationship between objective (completed EOL planning items) and subjective (PFCN) components of planning, thus highlighting the importance of taking concrete steps in EOL planning to yield greater feelings of preparedness, which has been associated with positive psychological outcomes.
