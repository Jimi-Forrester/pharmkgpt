36232547|t|Pharmacokinetics of Myo-Inositol in a Wistar Rat Animal Model.
36232547|a|Myo-inositol is the most popular inositol in living organisms, where it is present as a sugar alcohol, in a free form, and can also be described as a lipid. The aim of this study was to check the concentration change of a myo-inositol solution from the time of oral administration and over a 48 h period in Wistar-type rats. All rats received 2 g/kg of inositol as a solution in distilled water by oral gavage. Estimated parameters were based on the serum concentration of myo-inositol observed in nine individual rats with regard to time. Observations were described as a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first-order absorption and zero-order endogenous input of checked inositol. The highest myo-inositol concentration was observed in the first hour after oral administration in the serum of all tested rats. Then, the concentration began decreasing immediately after the maximal peak. The inositol concentration continued to decrease, but after 24 h its level was still higher than before the administration. The plasma profile of the myo-inositol concentration showed a rapid decline over time, possibly due to the metabolism of this compound.
