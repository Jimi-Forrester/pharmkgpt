37300249|t|Deciphering the Influence of Estradiol and Estrogen Receptors on Cognitive Function: A Bibliometric Analysis and Emerging Research Trends.
37300249|a|BACKGROUND The cognitive impact of estradiol (E2), a sex steroid hormone, particularly its unique characteristics mediated through different estrogen receptors (ERs), is garnering research interest to optimize estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) and mitigate adverse effects. However, a systematic bibliometric investigation elucidating the connection between E2/ERs and cognition is lacking. This study examines 3502 Web of Science Core Collection publications using CiteSpace to unveil trends in this research field. MATERIAL AND METHODS The primary goal was to analyze highly co-cited articles characterized by extensive citation, centrality, Sigma index, and burst strength. We identified six research themes and directions from ten distinct, highly credible clusters (Q=0.8266; S=0.978), established by frequently employed keywords. Secondly, we sought to highlight the most contributing countries, institutions, and authors in this domain. RESULTS The study unveiled that the 'critical age window period' hypothesis of ERT, hippocampus-derived E2, the mediating role of GPER, and crosstalk among ERs are the current hotspots in this field. Future research is likely to explore the links between E2/ERs and the hippocampus, various memory types, sex specificity, and receptor specificity. The United States and the University of Wisconsin have the most publications, while Scotland and Stanford University have the highest centrality. The most influential authors are Woolley CS, Frick KM, Tuscher JJ, and Espeland MA. CONCLUSIONS These findings inform prospective research directions and hint at potential E2 targets for cognitive enhancement.
