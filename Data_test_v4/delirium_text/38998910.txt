38998910|a|An efficient and practical organocatalyzed asymmetric Mannich/cyclization tandem reaction strategy of 2-benzothiazolimines and 2-isothiocyanato-1-indanones was developed, and novel spirocyclic compounds containing benzothiazolimine and indanone scaffolds were obtained. This chiral thiourea-catalyzed Mannich/cyclization tandem reaction offers chiral spirocyclic compounds with continuous tertiary and quaternary stereocenters in good to high yields (up to 90%) with excellent diastereoselectivities (up to >20:1 dr) and enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee) at -18  C. Additionally, the scaled-up synthesis was also performed with retained yield and stereoselectivity, and a reaction mechanism was also proposed.
