17032605|t|[Depression and the risk of Alzheimer's disease].
17032605|a|A population based cohort study consisting of 3346 participants aged 65-84 years was examined at baseline (1992-94) and after two and five years. The purpose was to examine whether a history of depression increased the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). History of depression was based on self-report and AD was diagnosed according to NINCDS-ADRDA. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR (95% confidence interval)). Subjects with a history of depression had an increased risk of AD: Baseline (OR = 1,7 (1,0-2,7)); after two years (1,9 (1,0-3,3)); after five years (1,6 (0,9-2,7)).
