37734998|a|The ubiquitin proteasome system maintains protein homeostasis by regulating the breakdown of misfolded proteins, thereby preventing misfolded protein aggregates. The efficient elimination is vital for preventing damage to the cell by misfolded proteins, known as proteotoxic stress. Proteotoxic stress can lead to the collapse of protein homeostasis and can alter the function of the ubiquitin proteasome system. Conversely, impairment of the ubiquitin proteasome system can also cause proteotoxic stress and disrupt protein homeostasis. This review examines two impacts of proteotoxic stress, 1) disruptions to ubiquitin homeostasis (ubiquitin stress) and 2) disruptions to proteasome homeostasis (proteasome stress). Here, we provide a mechanistic description of the relationship between proteotoxic stress and the ubiquitin proteasome system. This relationship is illustrated by findings from several protein misfolding diseases, mainly neurodegenerative diseases, as well as from basic biology discoveries from yeast to mammals. In addition, we explore the importance of the ubiquitin proteasome system in endoplasmic reticulum quality control, and how proteotoxic stress at this organelle is alleviated. Finally, we highlight how cells utilize the ubiquitin proteasome system to adapt to proteotoxic stress and how the ubiquitin proteasome system can be genetically and pharmacologically manipulated to maintain protein homeostasis.
