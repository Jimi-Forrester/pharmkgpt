38277554|a|Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare and highly aggressive endocrine malignancy. Although surgery can cure localized disease, but the majority of patients experience recurrence of ACC. The 5-year survival rate of patients with metastatic ACC is <15%, and the prognosis is poor. Therefore, it is urgent to explore the potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for ACC. Recently, it has been proved that non-coding RNA (ncRNAs) is widely involved in pathological and physiological processes, including tumorigenesis and development. Aberrantly expressed ncRNAs have been found to be involved in the pathogenesis of ACC. Here, we summarized the expression patterns and the molecular mechanism of the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) in ACC development. To explore the clinical value of ncRNAs as noninvasive biomarkers of ACC, we also displayed the relationship between the expression level of ncRNAs and the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with ACC.
