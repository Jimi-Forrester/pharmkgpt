10689697|t|[An autopsy case of bilateral carotid artery occlusion with repetitive epilepsy and brain atrophy in a senile patient].
10689697|a|A 67-year-old man was referred to us for tonic-clonic convulsions. A review of his history revealed that he had been hospitalized for loss of consciousness, hypotension, and suspected apoplexy at age 67. He had experienced prior tonic-clonic convulsions at age 72 and age 74. He had malaria and tuberculosis in his history but had been otherwise generally well. Physical examination was normal, and his blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg. Laboratory findings were normal except alcalinephosphatase (292 U/l) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase(60 U/l). Neurological examination showed alert consciousness, mild upper gaze palsy, slight right-side hemiparesis and left Babinski signs was present. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed no abnormality, but cerebral angiography revealed bilateral carotid artery occlusion. There were abundant leptomeningeal anastomoses, and the posterior communicating artery was supplied by the left vertebral artery. Electroencephalography showed a spike wave in the temporal lobe and rebuild-up phenomenon in the right hemisphere. Brain atrophy in the anterior and temporal lobes progressed, and the patient experienced gradual disorientation, delirium and hypobulia. He was eventually bedridden. He also demonstrated repetitive tonic-clonic convulsions. After one convulsion, he remained unconscious and died of pneumonia. Autopsy revealed thickening of the intima and internal elastic lamina in the occluded internal carotid artery. The anterior and middle cerebral arteries showed the same pathological changes. Multiple small infarctions restricted to grey matter were present in the cerebral cortex and may have caused the progressive brain atrophy. There was no myelin pallor in the white matter of the cerebrum. Atherosclerotic changes, senile plaque, and neurofibrillary tangles were seen but were within normal limits. These pathological findings were strongly suggestive of moyamoya disease.
