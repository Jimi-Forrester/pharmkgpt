19880914|t|Second-generation antipsychotic long-acting injections: systematic review.
19880914|a|BACKGROUND: Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) represent an advance in the long-term management of schizophrenia. AIMS: To review the available evidence concerning SGA long-acting injections (LAIs). METHOD: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed. RESULTS: Risperidone long-acting injection was the first licensed SGA-LAI compound and is effective in the long-term management of schizophrenia, with a safety profile similar to that of oral risperidone. Olanzapine pamoate has recently been approved in Europe. In terms of efficacy, at injection intervals of up to 4 weeks it appears comparable to oral olanzapine, although the potential for ;post-injection syndrome' (delirium) calls for additional safety considerations. Paliperidone palmitate is currently under review with the licensing authorities. It also affords the potential advantage of monthly dosing. CONCLUSIONS: More long-term comparisons of SGA-LAIs with oral SGAs as well as with first-generation antipsychotic LAIs are needed. These studies should include cost-effectiveness data.
