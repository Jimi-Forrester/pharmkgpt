38053452|a|INTRODUCTION: This study examines how receiving a dementia diagnosis influences social relationships by race and ethnicity. METHODS: Using data from the Health and Retirement Study (10 waves; 7,159 observations) of adults 70 years and older predicted to have dementia using Gianattasio-Power scores (91% accuracy), this study assessed changes in social support, engagement, and networks after a dementia diagnosis. We utilized quasi-experimental methods to estimate treatment effects and subgroup analyses by race/ethnicity. RESULTS: A diagnostic label significantly increased the likelihood of gaining social support but reduced social engagement and one measure of social networks. With some exceptions, the results were similar by race and ethnicity. DISCUSSION: Results suggest that among older adults with assumed dementia, being diagnosed by a doctor may influence social relationships in both support-seeking and socially withdrawn ways. This suggests that discussing services and supports at the time of diagnosis is important for healthcare professionals.
