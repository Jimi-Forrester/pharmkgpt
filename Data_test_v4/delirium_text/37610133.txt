37610133|a|Canavan disease (CD) is a recessively inherited pediatric leukodystrophy resulting from inactivating mutations to the oligodendroglial enzyme aspartoacylase (ASPA). ASPA is responsible for hydrolyzing the amino acid derivative N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA), and without it, brain NAA concentrations increase by 50% or more. Infants and children with CD present with progressive cognitive and motor delays, cytotoxic edema, astroglial vacuolation, and prominent spongiform brain degeneration. ASPA-deficient CD mice (Aspanur7/nur7 ) present similarly with elevated NAA, widespread astroglial dysfunction, ataxia, and Purkinje cell (PC) dendritic atrophy. Bergmann glia (BG), radial astrocytes essential for cerebellar development, are intimately intertwined with PCs, where they regulate synapse stability, functionality, and plasticity. BG damage is common to many neurodegenerative conditions and frequently associated with PC dysfunction and ataxia. Here, we report that, in CD mice, BG exhibit significant morphological alterations, decreased structural associations with PCs, loss of synaptic support proteins, and altered calcium dynamics. We also find that BG dysfunction predates cerebellar vacuolation and PC damage in CD mice. Previously, we developed an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy targeting Nat8l (N-acetyltransferase-8-like, "Nat8l ASO") that inhibits the production of NAA and reverses ataxia and PC atrophy in CD mice. Here, we show that Nat8l ASO administration in adult CD mice also leads to BG repair. Furthermore, blocking astroglial uptake of NAA is neuroprotective in astroglia-neuron cocultures exposed to elevated NAA. Our findings suggest that restoration of BG structural and functional integrity could be a mechanism for PC regeneration and improved motor function.
