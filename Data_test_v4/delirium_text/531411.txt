531411|a|Eight patients with Alzheimer's disease presenting whith memory difficulties and no significant intellectual deterioration were treated with 9 grams daily. Choline base orally for 3 weeks. Quantitative testing, which evaluate memory capabilities such as learning and recall after delays of 1 hour and 24 hours, were used before and after the administration of Choline. The results of a global statistical analysis did not show any significant difference in the performances obtained before and after choline. However, in two patients, recall performance improvement was confirmed clinically. Most likely, these two patients were suffering from an mild foorm of Alzheimer's disease.
