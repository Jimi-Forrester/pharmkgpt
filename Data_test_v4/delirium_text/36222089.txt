36222089|a|The accumulation and deposits of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide are an important pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The development of multifunctional agents that can effectively clear Abeta aggregates is one of the potential strategies to treat AD. Herein, aptamer conjugated polydopamine-coated gold nanoparticles (Au@PDA-Apt NPs) for targeting Abeta1-40 peptides were designed. Au@PDA-Apt NPs exhibited a strong capability to inhibit Abeta1-40 monomer fibrillization and disaggregate mature Abeta1-40 fibrils. In addition, Au@PDA-Apt NPs could effectively alleviate Abeta1-40-triggered cytotoxicity. Importantly, AFM quantitative nanomechanical measurements indicated that Au@PDA-Apt NPs could prevent cell membrane damage and decrease of cell mechanical properties caused by Abeta1-40 aggregation. Taken together, this study provided a new dual-action nanoplatform for Abeta-targeted AD therapy.
