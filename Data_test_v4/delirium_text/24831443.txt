24831443|a|BACKGROUND: Geriatric education is essential to ensure the competency of residents caring for the aging population. This study assesses and correlates resident and faculty perceptions of resident geriatric-related competencies to clinical care. METHODS: A survey was sent to 40 general surgery residents and 57 faculty members. Five clinical care markers were identified for chart audit. A retrospective chart audit was performed of 22 injured elderly patients. RESULTS: Among the respondents, 30 of 40 (75%) residents and 22 of 57 (39%) faculty completed the survey. Residents rated their competency higher than faculty on all competency-related questions (p = 0.0002). The following 4 questions had a mean faculty rating below acceptable: screening guidelines, delirium management, contraindicated medications, and medication adjustments. On chart review: code status was documented in 7 of 22 (32%) patients and goals of care in 1 of 22 (5%) patients. Pain control included rib block or epidural in 14 of 22 (64%) patients. Contraindicated medications were prescribed in 13 of 22 (59%) patients. CONCLUSION: A competency-based needs assessment of geriatric training in a general surgery residency has identified educational "gaps." This needs assessment supports implementation of geriatric education initiatives in our general surgery program.
