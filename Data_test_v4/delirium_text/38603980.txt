38603980|a|BACKGROUND: There is limited information on the mixture effect and weights of light physical activity (LPA), moderate physical activity (MPA), and vigorous physical activity (VPA) on dementia risk. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted based on the UK Biobank dataset. We included participants aged at least 45 years old without dementia at baseline between 2006-2010. The weighted quantile sum regression was used to explore the mixture effect and weights of three types of physical activity on dementia risk. RESULTS: This study includes 354,123 participants, with a mean baseline age of 58.0-year-old and 52.4 % of female participants. During a median follow-up time of 12.5 years, 5,136 cases of dementia were observed. The mixture effect of LPA, MPA, and VPA on dementia was statistically significant (beta: -0.0924, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI): (-0.1402, -0.0446), P < 0.001), with VPA (weight: 0.7922) contributing most to a lower dementia risk, followed by MPA (0.1939). For Alzheimer's disease, MPA contributed the most (0.8555); for vascular dementia, VPA contributed the most (0.6271). CONCLUSION: For Alzheimer's disease, MPA was identified as the most influential factor, while VPA stood out as the most impactful for vascular dementia.
