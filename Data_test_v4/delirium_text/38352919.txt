38352919|a|Key Clinical Message: COVID-19 psychosis is a potential long-term sequela of COVID-19. Vulnerable populations, such as individuals with sickle cell disease, are at high risk for psychosis. Given the limited number of cases, more investigations in the etiopathology and management of this new disease is needed. Abstract: We report a case of a 15-year-old female with a past medical history of depression who developed psychosis post-SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19). After an initial moderate COVID-19 infection, the patient appeared to recover and was discharged home. Four weeks later, she presented with symptoms of psychosis and symptoms of cognitive impairment. Imaging studies did not show any evidence of stroke and toxicology studies were negative. She was treated with antipsychotics and required inpatient neuropsychiatric rehabilitation. Acute psychotic syndrome resolved after 3 weeks, antipsychotics were weaned, and an antidepressant was initiated. Mild cognitive impairment with significant memory loss persisted for about 1 year. Thereafter, she returned to her baseline but remains on an antidepressant. Some studies have previously reported the occurrence of psychosis in individuals with COVID-19. This report is the first outline of severe prolonged post-COVID-19 psychosis in a child with sickle cell disease. Given the neurologic vulnerability of children with sickle cell disease, these individuals should be monitored for neuropsychiatric symptoms post COVID-19.
