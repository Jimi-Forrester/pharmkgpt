36454239|t|Social Stressors and Health Among Older Transgender and Gender Diverse Veterans.
36454239|a|Purpose: Health disparities in transgender and gender diverse (TGD) veterans compared with cisgender veterans have been documented. However, there is a paucity of literature focused on older TGD veterans. We assessed health conditions and social stressors in older TGD veterans compared with matched cisgender veterans. Methods: Using gender identity disorder diagnosis codes, we identified 1244 TGD veterans (65+ years of age) receiving care in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) from 2006 to 2018. These TGD veterans were then matched to 3732 cisgender veterans based on age, VHA site, and date of care in VHA. Results: In adjusted models, TGD veterans compared with cisgender veterans were less likely to have alcohol use disorder (adjusted odds ratio [AOR; 95% confidence interval]: [0.70; 0.58-0.85]), drug use disorder (0.59; 0.47-0.74), tobacco use (0.75; 0.65-0.86), and anxiety (0.74; 0.62-0.90). However, compared with cisgender veterans, TGD veterans were more likely to experience depression (1.63; 1.39-1.93), Alzheimer's disease (8.95; 4.25-18.83), cancer (1.83; 1.56-2.14), violence (1.82; 1.14-2.91), social/familial problems (2.45; 1.99-3.02), lack of access to care/transportation (2.23; 1.48-3.37), and military sexual trauma (2.59; 1.93-3.46). Furthermore, compared with cisgender veterans, TGD veterans were more likely to have documentation of a higher count of social stressors: 1 or more stressors (1.64; 1.38-1.95) and 2 or more stressors (1.22; 1.01-1.49). Conclusion: Despite significant disparities in social stressors and health conditions compared with cisgender veterans, TGD veterans had a lower likelihood of substance use and anxiety. Interventions are needed to mitigate social stressors and improve health among the older TGD veteran population.
