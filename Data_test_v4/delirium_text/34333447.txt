34333447|t|Artificial intelligence predicts delirium following cardiac surgery: A case study.
34333447|a|Delirium is a highly relevant complication of surgical interventions. Current research indicates that despite increased awareness for delirium, it is often overlooked. We implemented an AI-based tool to monitor delirium in cardiac surgery patients in our specialist clinic. This appears to be a promising approach to improve detection of delirium, especially for underrecognized forms and in peripheral wards without intensive screening. We present a case in which the AI identified delirium, confirmed by our routine screening and specialist evaluation.
