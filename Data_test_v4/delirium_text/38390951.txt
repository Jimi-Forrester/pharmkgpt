38390951|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: While electroencephalogram (EEG)-based depth of anesthesia monitors have been in use clinically for decades, there is still a major debate concerning their efficacy for detecting awareness under anesthesia (AUA). Further utilization of these monitors has also been discussed vividly, for example, reduction of postoperative delirium (POD).It seems that with regard to reducing AUA and POD, these monitors might be applicable, under specific anesthetic protocols. But in other settings, such monitoring might be less contributive and may have a 'built-it glass ceiling'.Recent advances in other venues of electrophysiological monitoring might have a strong theoretical rationale, and early supporting results, to offer a breakthrough out of this metaphorical glass ceiling. The purpose of this review is to present this possibility. RECENT FINDINGS: Following previous findings, it might be concluded that for some anesthesia protocols, the prevailing depth of anesthesia monitors may prevent incidences of AUA and POD. However, in other settings, which may involve other anesthesia protocols, or specifically for POD - other perioperative causes, they may not. Attention-related processes measured by easy-to-use real-time electrophysiological markers are becoming feasible, also under anesthesia, and might be applicable for more comprehensive prevention of AUA, POD and possibly other perioperative complications. SUMMARY: Attention-related monitoring might have a strong theoretical basis for the prevention of AUA, POD, and potentially other distressing postoperative outcomes, such as stroke and postoperative neurocognitive disorder. There seems to be already some initial supporting evidence in this regard.
