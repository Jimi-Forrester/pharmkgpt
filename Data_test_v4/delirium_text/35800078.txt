35800078|t|40 Hz Blue LED Relieves the Gamma Oscillations Changes Caused by Traumatic Brain Injury in Rat.
35800078|a|Background: Photobiomodulation (PBM) using low-level light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can be rapidly applied to various neurological disorders safely and non-invasively. Materials and Methods: Forty-eight rats were involved in this study. The traumatic brain injury (TBI) model of rat was set up by a controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury. An 8-channel cortex electrode EEG was fixed to two hemispheres, and gamma oscillations were extracted according to each electrode. A 40 hz blue LED stimulation was set at four points of the frontal and parietal regions for 60 s each, six times per day for 1 week. Modified Neurologic Severity Scores (mNSS) were used to evaluate the level of neurological function. Results: In the right-side TBI model, the gamma oscillation decreased in electrodes Fp2, T4, C4, and O2; but significantly increased after 1 week of 40 hz Blue LED intervention. In the left-side TBI model, the gamma oscillation decreased in electrodes Fp1, T3, C3, and O1; and similarly increased after 1 week of 40 hz Blue LED intervention. Both left and right side TBI rats performed significantly better in mNSS after 40 hz Blue LED intervention. Conclusion: TBI causes the decrease of gamma oscillations on the injured side of the brain of rats. The 40 hz Blue LED therapy could relieve the gamma oscillation changes caused by TBI and improve the prognosis of TBI.
