38910940|t|Caring for Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease: A Spotlight on Hispanic Caregivers.
38910940|a| A caregiver is a constantly evolving role that an individual most likely undertakes at some point in their lifetime. With discoveries and research in increasing life expectancy, the prevalence of neurological-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia, is certainly likely to require more caregivers. The demand for AD caregivers is escalating as the prevalence of the disease continues to rise. The projected rise in AD within the Hispanic population in the United States over the next few decades is expected to be the most significant among all ethnic groups. The Hispanic population faces unique dementia risks due to cultural factors like language barriers, lower education, and limited healthcare access. Higher rates of conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease further elevate dementia risk. Family dynamics and caregiving responsibilities also differ, affecting dementia management within Hispanic households. Addressing these distinct challenges requires culturally sensitive approaches to diagnosis, treatment, and support for Hispanic individuals and their family's facing dementia. With AD and other dementia becoming more prevalent, this article will attempt to expand upon the status of caregivers concerning their economic, health, and cultural statuses. We will attempt to focus on the Hispanic caregivers that live in Texas and more specifically, West Texas due to the lack of current literature that applies to this area of Texas. Lastly, we discuss the ramifications of a multitude of factors that affect caregivers in Texas and attempt to provide tools that can be readily available for Hispanics and others alike.
