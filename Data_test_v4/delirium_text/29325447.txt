The study objective was to examine associations of brain amyloid beta and longitudinal measures of depression and depressive symptom clusters in a cognitively normal sample of older adults. METHOD: A total of 270 community-dwelling, cognitively normal elderly individuals underwent baseline Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) measures of cortical aggregate amyloid beta and annual assessments with the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). The authors evaluated continuous PiB binding as a predictor of GDS score or GDS cluster, calculated as total scores and mean scores for three GDS item clusters (apathy-anhedonia, dysphoria, and anxiety-concentration), across time (1-5 years; mean=3.8 years) in separate mixed-effects models with backward elimination. Initial predictors included PiB binding, age, sex, Hollingshead score, American National Adult Reading Test (AMNART) score, apolipoprotein E epsilon4 status, depression history, and their interactions with time. RESULTS: Higher PiB binding predicted accelerated rates of increase in GDS score over time, adjusting for depression history. Higher PiB binding also predicted steeper rates of increase for anxiety-concentration scores, adjusting for depression history and the AMNART score-by-time interaction. In a post hoc model estimating anxiety scores without concentration disturbance items, the PiB binding-by-time interaction remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: Higher amyloid beta burden was associated with increasing anxious-depressive symptoms over time in cognitively normal older individuals. Prior depression history was related to higher but not worsening symptom ratings. These results suggest a direct or indirect association of elevated amyloid beta levels with worsening anxious-depressive symptoms and support the hypothesis that emerging neuropsychiatric symptoms represent an early manifestation of preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
