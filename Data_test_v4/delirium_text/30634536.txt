30634536|a|The ongoing growth of the international occurrence of depression and its ability to co-occur with other serious medical disorders, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease, is a current public health problem. Inhibitor of DNA-Binding/Differentiation (ID) proteins are part of a group of transcriptional factors that have shown involvement in neurocognitive disorders and, therefore, may have influence on depressive disorders. Previously, it has been established that exposure to environmental estrogenic endocrine disruptors (EEDs), such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and bisphenol A (BPA), have played an important role in the modulation of depressive disorders. Hence, based on many studies, we consider the impact of these environmental pollutants on the group of ID proteins and how they impact depressive outcomes. Improved knowledge of how ID proteins interact with depressive disorders, through EED exposure, will contribute essential evidence that can further benefit our public health community with innovative knowledge to prevent these types of mental illnesses.
