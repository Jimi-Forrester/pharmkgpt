39113115|a|Cognitive decline covers a broad spectrum of disorders, not only resulting from brain diseases but also from systemic diseases, which seriously influence the quality of life and life expectancy of patients. As a highly selective anatomical and functional interface between the brain and systemic circulation, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a pivotal role in maintaining brain homeostasis and normal function. The pathogenesis underlying cognitive decline may vary, nevertheless, accumulating evidences support the role of BBB disruption as the most prevalent contributing factor. This may mainly be attributed to inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, cell senescence, oxidative/nitrosative stress and excitotoxicity. However, direct evidence showing that BBB disruption causes cognitive decline is scarce, and interestingly, manipulation of the BBB opening alone may exert beneficial or detrimental neurological effects. A broad overview of the present literature shows a close relationship between BBB disruption and cognitive decline, the risk factors of BBB disruption, as well as the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying BBB disruption. Additionally, we discussed the possible causes leading to cognitive decline by BBB disruption and potential therapeutic strategies to prevent BBB disruption or enhance BBB repair. This review aims to foster more investigations on early diagnosis, effective therapeutics, and rapid restoration against BBB disruption, which would yield better cognitive outcomes in patients with dysregulated BBB function, although their causative relationship has not yet been completely established.
