32992335|t|Ultrasound-Guided Local Anesthetic Nerve Blocks in a Forehead Flap Reconstructive Maxillofacial Procedure.
32992335|a|Head and neck reconstructive surgery involving tissue flaps is often complex requiring the development of an individualized anesthetic plan. The following case report describes the anesthetic management of an 87-year-old man considered at high risk for postoperative delirium due to advanced age and blindness undergoing general anesthesia for resection of squamous cell carcinoma of the right side of the nose and reconstructive surgery with a scalping forehead flap. Ultrasound-guided local anesthetic maxillary and supraorbital nerve blocks were successfully used perioperatively to reduce the need for alternative analgesics associated with higher risks of complications such as postoperative nausea, vomiting, and delirium.
