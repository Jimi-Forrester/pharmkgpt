37793659|t|LATE-NC in Alzheimer's disease: Molecular aspects and synergies.
37793659|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is classically characterized by senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). However, multiple copathologies can be observed in the AD brain and contribute to the development of cognitive decline. Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathological changes (LATE-NC) accumulates in the majority of AD cases and leads to more severe cognitive decline compared with AD pathology alone. In this review, we focus on the synergistic relationship between LATE-NC and tau in AD, highlighting the aggravating role of TDP-43 aggregates on tau pathogenesis and its impact on the clinical picture and therapeutic strategies. Additionally, we discuss to what extent the molecular patterns of LATE-NC in AD differ from frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP) neuropathological changes. Thus, we highlight the importance of tau and TDP-43 synergies for subtyping AD patients, which may respond differently to therapeutic interventions depending on the presence of comorbid LATE-NC.
