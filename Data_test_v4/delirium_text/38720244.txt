38720244|t|Listeria brain abscess: a therapeutically challenging rare presentation of listeriosis.
38720244|a|We report a very rare case of Listeria multiple brain abscesses manifested as delirium, which represented diagnostic and therapeutic challenges overcome only by the close cooperation between Infectious Diseases and Neuroradiology, without which a satisfactory outcome would not be achieved.An elderly man presented with confusion and drowsiness with a background of type-II diabetes mellitus. Although computed tomography of the brain only showed frontal lobe oedema, contrast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed numerous irregular rim-enhancing lesions containing central diffusion restriction, suggesting multiple pyogenic cerebral abscesses of unclear aetiology. Thereafter, Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from blood cultures, suggesting this as the causative organism. Deemed unsuitable for neurosurgical drainage, the patient received medical management with a protracted course of antibiotics. This case was extremely challenging, due to 1) the impossibility of source control, 2) the small number of effective antibiotics available to treat this condition, and 3) the inevitable antibiotic side-effects, derived from long-term exposure. A successful outcome was only possible thanks to strict close multidisciplinary follow up, requiring frequent MR imaging and a judicious antibiotic choice, including monitoring of their side-effects. Due to the rarity of this condition, there is lack of guidance on its management, hence the importance of multidisciplinary involvement with very close imaging and antibiotic monitoring.
