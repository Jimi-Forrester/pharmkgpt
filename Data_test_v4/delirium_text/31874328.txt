31874328|a|INTRODUCTION: Beta-amyloid is considered to be a pathophysiological marker in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Soluble amyloid precursor proteins (sAPPs) -alpha (sAPPalpha) and -beta (sAPPbeta), which are the byproducts of non-amyloidogenic and amyloidogenic process of APP, respectively, have been repeatedly observed in the cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) of AD patients. The present study focused on the determination of sAPP levels in peripheral blood. METHODS: The plasma protein levels of sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta were measured with ELISA. Plasma from 52 AD patients, 98 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and 114 cognitively normal controls were compared. RESULTS: The plasma level of sAPPbeta was significantly increased in AD patients than in cognitively healthy controls. However, no significant change in plasma sAPPalpha was observed among the three groups. Furthermore, the plasma sAPPbeta levels significantly correlated with cognitive assessment scales, such as clinical dementia rating (CDR), and mini-mental status examination (MMSE). Interestingly, sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta had a positive correlation with each other in blood plasma, similar to previous studies on CSF sAPP. This correlation was stronger in the MCI and AD groups than in the cognitively healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that individuals with elevated plasma sAPPbeta levels are at an increased risk of AD; elevation in these levels may reflect the progression of disease.
