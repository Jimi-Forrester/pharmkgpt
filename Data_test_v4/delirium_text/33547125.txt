33547125|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a condition characterised by accumulation of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in the wall of cerebral blood vessels which increases the risk of intracranial haemorrhage and contributes to cognitive impairment. We describe the case of a man around the age of 70 with 'probable' CAA according to the modified Boston criteria and severe depression whose depression was treated successfully with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). To the best of our knowledge, there are no earlier published reports of ECT in a patient with CAA. We briefly discuss possible safety measures for these patients, the impact of ECT on cognition in CAA and a possible influence of ECT on Abeta clearance.
