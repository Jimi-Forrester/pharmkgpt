29886530|t|Purification and Characterization of Low-n Tau Oligomers.
29886530|a|Deposition of Tau aggregates in patient's brains is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases collectively called Tauopathies. One of the most studied Tauopathies is Alzheimer disease (AD) in which Tau protein aggregates into filaments and coalesces into neurofibrillary tangles. The distribution of Tau filaments is a reliable indicator of the clinical stages of AD (Braak stages), but intermediate oligomeric assemblies of Tau are considered to be more directly toxic to neurons than late stage filaments. Studying the elusive role of Tau oligomers has been difficult because of their dynamic nature and paucity of methods to purify them in vitro. In this chapter, we describe methods to purify Tau oligomers to near homogeneity and to characterize them by hydrophobic interaction chromatography and biophysical methods such as fluorescence spectrophotometry, dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopy, and others. Functional characterization includes the assessment of synapses and toxicity assays which show that oligomers can damage synapses locally but show little toxicity to neurons globally.
