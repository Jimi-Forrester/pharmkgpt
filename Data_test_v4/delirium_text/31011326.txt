31011326|t|Citalopram Improves Obsessive-Compulsive Crossword Puzzling in Frontotemporal Dementia.
31011326|a|Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is characterized by severe changes in personality/behavior. Recent studies have provided evidence that a decrease in serotonin receptors and neuronal loss in the raphe nuclei play a role in the bvFTD pathology. Serotonergic antidepressants have been reported to diminish behavioral disturbances in bvFTD, particularly repetitive behaviors, disinhibition, apathy, sexually inappropriate behaviors, and hyperorality. Here, we present the case of an 80-year-old Caucasian male patient with clinically and biomarker supported bvFTD ("probable" bvFTD; disease-specific alterations in 18F-fluorodesoxyglucose positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging). The patient exhibited behavioral disinhibition, apathy, a loss of empathy, perseverative behavior during testing, hyperorality, changes in diet, and executive deficits in neuropsychological testing. Remarkably, he failed in solving crosswords by systematically filling in the blanks by letters in alphabetical order (A, B, C, D, etc.), indicating obsessive-compulsive behavior. One year later, the patient visited the clinic again for a follow-up investigation. He had taken 20 mg of citalopram per day for 1 consecutive year. Remarkably, he had regained the ability to fill in crossword puzzles correctly, although the neuropsychiatric inventory showed overall only small improvement in behavioral impairment. A regimen of 20 mg citalopram per day over the course of 1 year led to a specific improvement in one of the bvFTD core symptoms, obsessive-compulsive behavior, most pronounced in solving crossword puzzles. This case contributes to the understanding of the neuropharmacological correlates of bvFTD and supports the treatment of bvFTD's behavioral symptoms with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
