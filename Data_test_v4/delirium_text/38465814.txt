38465814|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a progressive disease characterized by the deposition of beta-amyloid in the walls of blood vessels in the brain, which leads to their damage and disruption of normal blood flow. Morphologically, CAA is characterized by both isolated lesions (microhemorrhages with the appearance of cortical superficial siderosis, lacunar infarctions) and widespread changes (hyperintensity of the deep and periventricular white matter, expansion of the perivascular spaces) of cortical and subcortical localization. CAA is considered a major cause of cognitive impairment and intracerebral microbleeds, especially in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The review presents modern ideas about the etiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations of CAA, and also outlines the provisions of the Boston principles of CAA, revised in 2022. Understanding the features of pathogenetic methods of CAA is crucial for adjusting the accuracy of diagnosis and developing treatment methods to preserve and prolong cognitive health.
