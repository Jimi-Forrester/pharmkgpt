37372692|t|Mental Health Issues as a Consequence of the Pandemic: Group Psycho-Educational Intervention to Support Patients Recovered from COVID-19 Infection.
37372692|a|Common psycho-physical symptoms have emerged in patients who were previously recovered for COVID-19 infection, including traumatic experience and enduring emotional disturbances. A group psycho-educational intervention of seven weekly sessions and a follow-up after three months was proposed to all Italian-speaking patients formally discharged from a public hospital in northern Italy and physically recovered from infection. Eighteen patients were recruited and divided into four age-homogenous groups, each led by two facilitators (psychologists and psychotherapists). The group sessions followed a structured format with thematic modules, including main topics, tasks, and homework assignments. Data were collected through recordings and verbatim transcripts. The objectives of the study were twofold: (1) to analyze the emerging themes and gain insight into the significant aspects of the participants' lived experience of COVID-19, and (2) to examine changes in how participants approached these themes throughout the intervention process. Semantic-pragmatic text analyses, specifically thematic analysis of elementary context and correspondence analysis, were conducted using T-LAB software. Linguistic analysis revealed a congruence between the intervention's objectives and the participants' experiences. The study highlighted an evolution in the narratives, as participants transitioned from a passive and concrete perspective on the disease to a more comprehensive cognitive and emotional elaboration of their personal illness stories. These findings hold potential relevance for healthcare services and professionals working in this field.
