38932397|t|Factors Related to Caregivers' Intention to Vaccinate Their Elderly Family Members with Major Neurocognitive Disorders against COVID-19.
38932397|a|Vaccination helps reduce the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection in elderly individuals with major neurocognitive disorders (MNDs). However, some caregivers are hesitant to have their elderly family members with MNDs vaccinated against COVID-19. This study explored the factors influencing caregivers' intentions to vaccinate elderly family members with MNDs against COVID-19. A total of 232 caregivers of elderly family members with MNDs participated in this study. In this survey, data regarding COVID-19 vaccination acceptance, fear, side effects, family members' attitudes toward vaccination, mental health status, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and cognitive impairments were collected from the elderly participants with MNDs. The associations between these variables and the caregivers' intention to vaccinate their elderly family members with MNDs against COVID-19 were examined using a multivariable linear regression analysis model. The results revealed that caregivers' perceived familial support for vaccination, the perceived value of vaccination, and autonomy to vaccinate elder family members were positively correlated with caregivers' intention to vaccinate elderly family members with MNDs, whereas elderly family members' age was negatively correlated with caregiver intentions. This study demonstrated that caregiver factors (perceived familial support, value of vaccination, and autonomy) and elderly family members' age were correlated with caregiver intention. These factors should be considered in developing interventions to enhance caregivers' intentions to vaccinate their elderly family members with MNDs against COVID-19.
