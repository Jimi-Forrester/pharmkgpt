10439444|t|A presenilin-1 Thr116Asn substitution in a family with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
10439444|a|Mutation in the presenilin-1 (PS-1) gene at chromosome 14q24.3 is the most common cause of autosomal dominant early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Here, we report a novel missense mutation in the presenilin-1 gene found in a three-generation Danish family with autopsy-verified early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Two affected first-degree relatives in two generations were found to be heterozygous for a cytosine to adenine transversion at the second position of codon 116, which changes the amino acid at that position from threonine to asparagine. This conservative amino acid substitution occurs in an evolutionary highly conserved region of the PS-1 protein and is associated with onset of the disease between age 35 and 41 years and 4-8 years' duration of the disease. Analysis of amyloid beta-protein (A beta) deposition in brain specimens from one affected family member showed predominance of A beta 42(43). Onset and progression of the disease were very similar in two sibs homozygous for the epsilon 3 allele and the epsilon 4 allele, respectively, of the polymorphic apolipoprotein E locus. The lack of effect of the high risk epsilon 4/epsilon 4 genotype on the disease in this family corroborates and extends previous observations that the presence of one copy of the epsilon 4 allele does not modulate PS-1 associated Alzheimer's disease.
