34763262|a|The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has resulted in millions of worldwide deaths. When the SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged from Wuhan, China in December 2019, reports of patients with COVID-19 revealed that hospitalized patients had acute changes in mental status, cognition, and encephalopathy. Neurologic complications can be a consequence from overall severity of the systemic infection, direct viral invasion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the central nervous system, and possible immune mediated mechanisms. We will examine the landscape regarding this topic in this review in addition to current understandings of COVID-19 and hemostasis, treatment, and prevention, as well as vaccination.
