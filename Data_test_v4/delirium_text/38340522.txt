38340522|a|INTRODUCTION: Markers of hemostasis such as procoagulant factors and peak thrombin generation are associated with cardiovascular outcomes, but their associations with dementia risk are unclear. We aimed to evaluate prospective associations of selected procoagulant factors and peak thrombin generation with dementia risk. METHODS: We measured levels of 7 hemostatic factors (fibrinogen, factor VII coagulant activity [FVIIc], activated factor VII [FVIIa], factor VIIa-antithrombin [FVIIa-AT], factor XI antigen [FXI], peak thrombin generation, and platelet count) among participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study, a cohort of older adults free of dementia in 1992/1993 (n = 3185). Dementia was adjudicated and classified by DSM-IV criteria through 1998/1999. Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for any dementia associated with 1-standard deviation (SD) differences, adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors and APOE genotype. Secondary analyses separately evaluated the risk of vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and mixed dementia. RESULTS: At baseline, participants had a median age of 73 years. Over 5.4 years of follow-up, we identified 448 dementia cases. There was no evidence of linear associations between levels of these hemostatic factors with any dementia risk (HRs per 1-SD difference ranged from 1.0 to 1.1; 95 % confidence intervals included 1.0). Results of secondary analyses by dementia subtype were similar. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study, there was no strong evidence of linear associations between levels of fibrinogen, FVIIc, FVIIa, FVIIa-AT, FXI, peak thrombin generation, or platelet count with dementia risk. Despite their associations with cardiovascular disease, higher levels of these biomarkers measured among older adults may not reflect dementia risk.
