35753355|a|Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe disease of unknown pathogenesis that will affect ~10% of people during their lifetime. Therapy for MDD requires prolonged treatment and often fails, predicating a need for novel treatment strategies. Here, we report increased ceramide levels in the blood plasma of MDD patients and in murine stress-induced models of MDD. These blood plasma ceramide levels correlated with the severity of MDD in human patients and were independent of age, sex, or body mass index. In addition, intravenous injection of anti-ceramide antibodies or neutral ceramidase rapidly abrogated stress-induced MDD, and intravenous injection of blood plasma from mice with MDD induced depression-like behavior in untreated mice, which was abrogated by ex vivo preincubation of the plasma with anti-ceramide antibodies or ceramidase. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that ceramide accumulated in endothelial cells of the hippocampus of stressed mice, evidenced by the quantitative measurement of ceramide in purified hippocampus endothelial cells. We found ceramide inhibited the activity of phospholipase D (PLD) in endothelial cells in vitro and in the hippocampus in vivo and thereby decreased phosphatidic acid in the hippocampus. Finally, we show intravenous injection of PLD or phosphatidic acid abrogated MDD, indicating the significance of this pathway in MDD pathogenesis. Our data indicate that ceramide controls PLD activity and phosphatidic acid formation in hippocampal endothelial cells and thereby mediates MDD. We propose that neutralization of plasma ceramide could represent a rapid-acting targeted treatment for MDD.
