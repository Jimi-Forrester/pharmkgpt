39223433|t|The impact of mosaic loss of the Y chromosome (mLOY) in men of advanced age.
39223433|a|The Y chromosome has long been considered to be a "genetic wasteland" harboring only few genes essentially involved in male sex development and spermatogenesis. However, the discovery of mosaic loss of the Y chromosome (mLOY) in older men has led to revisiting of the potential impact of the Y chromosome on health and the pathophysiological processes of multiple diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease. Hence, developing more sensitive techniques for the detection of mLOY has become an emergent concern. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of the literature regarding mLOY. Additionally, we discuss the emerging discoveries concerning mLOY as well as the underlying mechanisms promoting disease in men of advanced age.
