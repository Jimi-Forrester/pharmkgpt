34433707|a|Microglial activation and neuroinflammation induced by amyloid beta (Abeta) play pivotal roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) is one of the major active compounds of the traditional Chinese medicine Astmgali Radix. It has been reported that AS-IV could protect against Abeta-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment, but the underlying mechanisms need to be further clarified. In this study, the therapeutic effects of AS-IV were investigated in an oligomeric Abeta (oAbeta) induced AD mice model. The effects of AS-IV on microglial activation, neuronal damage and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase expression were further studied. Different doses of AS-IV were administered intragastrically once a day after intracerebroventricularly oAbeta injection. Results of behavioral experiments including novel object recognition (NOR) test and Morris water maze (MWM) test revealed that AS-IV administration could significantly ameliorate oAbeta-induced cognitive impairment in a dose dependent manner. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results showed that increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-6 in hippocampal tissues induced by oAbeta injection were remarkably inhibited after AS-IV treatment. OAbeta induced microglial activation and neuronal damage was significantly suppressed in AS-IV-treated mice brain, observed in immunohistochemistry results. Furthermore, oAbeta upregulated protein expression of NADPH oxidase subunits gp91phox, p47phox, p22phox and p67phox were remarkably reduced by AS-IV in Western blotting assay. These results revealed that AS-IV could ameliorate oAbeta-induced cognitive impairment, neuroinflammation and neuronal damage, which were possibly mediated by inhibition of microglial activation and down-regulation of NADPH oxidase protein expression. Our findings provide new insights of AS-IV for the treatment of neuroinflammation related diseases such as AD.
