33435925|a|BACKGROUND: Artificial nutrition and hydration do not prolong survival or improve clinical symptoms of terminally ill cancer patients. Nonetheless, little is known about the effect of artificial hydration (AH) alone on patients' survival, symptoms or quality of dying. This study explored the relationship between AH and survival, symptoms and quality of dying among terminally ill cancer patients. METHODS: A pilot prospective, observational study was conducted in the palliative care units of three tertiary hospitals in Taiwan between October 2016 and December 2017. A total of 100 patients were included and classified into the hydration and non-hydration group using 400 mL of fluid per day as the cut-off point. The quality of dying was measured by the Good Death Scale (GDS). Multivariate analyses using Cox's proportional hazards model were used to assess the survival status of patients, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for within-group analyses and the Mann-Whitney U test for between-groups analyses to evaluate changes in symptoms between day 0 and 7 in both groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the predictors of a good death. RESULTS: There were no differences in survival (p = 0.337) or symptom improvement between the hydration and non-hydration group, however, patients with AH had higher GDS scores. CONCLUSIONS: AH did not prolong survival nor significantly improve dehydration symptoms of terminally ill cancer patients but it may influence the quality of dying. Communication with patients and their families on the effect of AH may help them better prepared for the end-of-life experience.
