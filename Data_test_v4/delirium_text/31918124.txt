31918124|a|OBJECTIVE: Spontaneous K-complexes (SKCs), a hallmark of stage 2 sleep, have been reported to decrease in density in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, few former studies have explored the alterations in SKC characteristics in the pre-clinical phase of AD-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). The aim of our prospective cohort study was to investigate the changing trend in SKC characteristics during the progression of aMCI. METHODS: SKC density, amplitude and duration were measured in aMCI subjects and normal controls (NC) at two-year follow-up assessments by polysomnography (PSG). In sum, 22 NCs, 25 stable aMCI (sMCI) subjects and 20 progressive aMCI (pMCI) subjects finished the four follow-up PSG assessments, and their data were used for analysis. RESULTS: SKC density and amplitude, but not duration, decreased during the follow-up assessments in both NCs and aMCI subjects, but the rate of decrease of these parameters was greater in aMCI subjects. With the progression of aMCI, significant differences in SKC density and amplitude among the three groups were observed, whereas SKC density showed no difference at the early stage of aMCI. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve results demonstrated that SKC density and amplitude could distinguish aMCI subjects from NCs with high specificity and sensitivity. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that SKCs decrease with ageing and the progression of aMCI, and SKC characteristics may be potential biomarkers for diagnosing aMCI.
