37822218|t|All-cause readmission rate and risk factors of 30- and 90-day after discharge in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
37822218|a|BACKGROUND: The readmission rate following hospitalization for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is surprisingly high, and frequent readmissions represent a higher risk of mortality and a heavy economic burden. However, information on all-cause readmissions in patients with COPD is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically summarize all-cause COPD readmission rates within 30 and 90 days after discharge and their underlying risk factors. METHODS: Eight electronic databases were searched to identify relevant observational studies about COPD readmission from inception to 1 August 2022. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for methodological quality assessment. We adopt a random effects model or a fixed effects model to estimate pooled all-cause COPD readmission rates and potential risk factors. RESULTS: A total of 28 studies were included, of which 27 and 8 studies summarized 30- and 90-day all-cause readmissions, respectively. The pooled all-cause COPD readmission rates within 30 and 90 days were 18% and 31%, respectively. The World Health Organization region was initially considered to be the source of heterogeneity. We identified alcohol use, discharge destination, two or more hospitalizations in the previous year, and comorbidities such as heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, anemia, cancer, or tumor as potential risk factors for all-cause readmission, whereas female and obesity were protective factors. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD had a high all-cause readmission rate, and we also identified some potential risk factors. Therefore, it is urgent to strengthen early follow-up and targeted interventions, and adjust or avoid risk factors after discharge, so as to reduce the major health economic burden caused by frequent readmissions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This systematic review and meta-analysis protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (no. CRD42022369894).
