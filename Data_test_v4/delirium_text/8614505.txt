8614505|t|d-Cycloserine enhances implicit memory in Alzheimer patients.
8614505|a|We tested the ability of d-cycloserine, a partial glycine agonist acting at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex, to improve implicit memory in Alzheimer patients in a parallel-group, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. One-hundred eight patients with probable Alzheimer's disease of mild to moderate severity received d-cycloserine (5, 15, or 50 mg) or placebo twice daily for 10 weeks. We then evaluated their ability to identify perceptually degraded words, some of which were repeated over multiple trials across 3 days. Implicit memory performance of words repeated across trials was significantly enhanced for the patients who received 15 mg d-cycloserine compared with those who received placebo. These findings support development of NMDA receptor-mediated glutamatergic interventions for the treatment of Alzheimer-related memory disorders.
