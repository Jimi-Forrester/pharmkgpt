15703796|t|Substituted thiazolamide coupled to a redox delivery system: a new gamma-secretase inhibitor with enhanced pharmacokinetic profile.
15703796|a|Inhibition of gamma-secretase, one of the enzymes responsible for the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to produce pathogenic A beta peptides, is an attractive approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We have designed a new gamma-secretase thiazolamide inhibitor bearing a dihydronicotinoyl moiety as Redox Delivery System which allows specific delivery of the drug to the brain. Through, on the one hand, A beta peptide production measurements by specific in vitro assays (gamma-secretase Cell Free assay and Cell Based assay on HEK 293 APP transfected cells) and, on the other hand, pharmacokinetic studies on animal models, the new inhibitor shows a good pharmacokinetic profile as well as a potent gamma-secretase inhibitory activity in vitro. From the obtained results, it is expected that drug will be mainly delivered to the CNS with low diffusion in the peripheral tissues. Consequently the side effects of this gamma-secretase inhibitor on the immune cells could be reduced.
