31720986|t|Keto microbiota: A powerful contributor to host disease recovery.
31720986|a|Gut microbiota (GM) is a key contributor to host metabolism and physiology. Data generated on comparing diseased and healthy subjects have reported changes in the GM profile between both health states, suggesting certain bacterial composition could be involved in pathogenesis. Moreover, studies reported that reshaping of GM could contribute actively to disease recovery. Interestingly, ketogenic diets (KD) have emerged recently as new economic dietotherapeutic strategy to combat a myriad of diseases (refractory epilepsy, obesity, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases...). KD, understood in a broad sense, refers to whatever dietetic approximation, which causes physiological ketosis. Therefore, high fat-low carbs diets, fasting periods or caloric restriction constitute different strategies to produce an increase of main ketones bodies, acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, in blood. Involved biological mechanisms in ketotherapeutic effects are still to be unravelled. However, it has been pointed out that GM remodelling by KD, from now on "keto microbiota", may play a crucial role in patient response to KD treatment. In fact, germ-free animals were resistant to ketotherapeutic effects; reinforcing keto microbiota may be a powerful contributor to host disease recovery. In this review, we will comment the influence of gut microbiota on host, as well as, therapeutic potential of ketogenic diets and keto microbiota to restore health status. Current progress and limitations will be argued too. In spite of few studies have defined applicability and mechanisms of KD, in the light of results, keto microbiota might be a new useful therapeutic agent.
