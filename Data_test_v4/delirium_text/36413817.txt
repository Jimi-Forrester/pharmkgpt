36413817|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: With the aging of the global population becoming severe, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become one of the world's most common senile diseases. Many studies have suggested that the brain's left-right asymmetry is one of the possible diagnostic landmarks for AD. However, most published approaches to classification problems may not adequately explore the asymmetry between the left and right hemispheres. At the same time, the relationship between asymmetry traits and other classifier features remains understudied. METHODS: In this paper, we proposed an asymmetry enhanced attention network (ASEAN) for AD diagnosis that effectively combines the anatomical asymmetry characteristics of the brain to enhance the accuracy and stability of classification tasks. First, we proposed a multi-scale asymmetry feature extraction module (MSAF) that can extract the asymmetry features of the brain from various scales. Second, we proposed an asymmetry refinement module (ARM) that considers the dependency between feature maps to suppress the irrelevant regions of the asymmetric feature maps. In addition, a parameter-free attention module was introduced to infer 4D attention weights and improve the network's representation capability. RESULTS: The proposed method achieved performance improvements on two databases: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL). For the classification tasks on ADNI, the proposed method achieves 92.1% accuracy, 96.2% sensitivity, and 91.3% specificity on the AD vs. CN (Cognitively Normal) task. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method could achieve comparable results. CONCLUSION: The proposed model can extract long-range left-right brain similarity as complementary information and improve the model's diagnostic performance. A large number of experiments also support the model's validity. At the same time, this work provides a valuable reference for other neurological diseases, particularly those that exhibit left-right brain asymmetry during development.
