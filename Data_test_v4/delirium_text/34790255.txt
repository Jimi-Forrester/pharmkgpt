METHODS: This study included 42 healthy people (control group) and 66 patients with AD (AD group). The hippocampus volume, temporal sulcus spacing, left-right brain diameter, brain lobe volume, hippocampal height, temporal horn width, lateral fissure width, and degree of leukoaraiosis were all measured using an MRI scan. After diagnosis, the satisfaction of patients in both arms was investigated and the satisfaction degree was recorded. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the left and right hippocampal volumes and hippocampal height of AD patients were smaller, while the temporal sulcus spacing, temporal horn width, lateral fissure width, and left-right brain diameter were remarkably higher. A statistical difference was present in the degree of leukoaraiosis between the two arms. The frontal and temporal lobe volumes of AD patients were notably lower while the volumes of parietal and occipital lobes were similar, versus the control group. The total satisfaction was 83.33% in the control group and 86.36% in the AD group, with no statistical difference between the two arms. CONCLUSIONS: MRI can effectively mine the brain information of AD patients with a high patient satisfaction, which has potential value in clinical application.
