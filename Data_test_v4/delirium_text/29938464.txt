29938464|t|Factors Predictive of Quality of Life among Breast Cancer Patients
29938464|a|Background: Due to progress in medical care, the number of survivors from cancer has increased significantlyduring recent years and this raises the question of the quality of life (QoL), especially of the many women treatedfor a breast cancer. This paper focuses on correlations of QoL with anxiety and depression on the one hand and withsocio demographic, anatomo-clinical and therapeutic parameters on the other. Methods: In this cross-sectional study,seventy patients were enrolled and filled in two auto-questionnaires, both in validated Arabic versions: The SF-36 forassessment of QoL and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD-S) for evaluation of anxiety and depression.The statistical approaches used to determine predictive factors were bivariate correlations to determine relationshipsbetween quantitative variables, and T-tests and one-way Anova to analyze links between qualitative and quantitativevariables. Results: The QoL of patients was altered with an SF-36 mean total score of 54.0 +- 22.7, and the alterationaffects the different aspects. The mean scores for anxiety and depression in patients were 6.91 +- 4.72 and 6.24 +- 3.88,respectively. The results of this study suggested an association between the QoL and chemotherapy (p= 0.014) and itsadverse effects (p=0.01), as well as anxiety (p= 0.0001) and depressive symptoms (p= 0.0001). Socio-demographicfactors, the stage of the cancer, and surgery, radiotherapy or hormone therapy did not appear to have significanteffects. Conclusion: The management of breast cancer patients needs a collaborative approach between oncologists,gynecologists, psychologist and psychiatrists.
