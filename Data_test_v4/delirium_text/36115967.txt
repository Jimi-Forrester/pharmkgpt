36115967|a|Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is a channel protein that plays a fundamental role in glymphatic system, a newly described pathway for fluid exchange in the central nervous system, as well as a central figure in a fascinating new theory for the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In this study, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of AQP4, amyloid-beta, total tau and P-tau were determined in 103 CSF samples from patients affected by neurodegenerative dementias (AD and FTD) or psychiatric diseases and 21 controls. Significantly higher levels of AQP4 were found in AD and FTD patients compared to subjects not affected by neurodegenerative diseases, and a significant, positive correlation between AQP4 and total tau levels was found. This evidence may pave the way for future studies focused on the role of this channel protein in the clinical assessment of the glymphatic function and degree of neurodegeneration.
