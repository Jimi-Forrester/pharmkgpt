38587636|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and intensity of grasp reflexes and to examine changes in these reflexes after shunt surgery in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). METHODS: We enrolled 147 patients with probable iNPH. A standard procedure was used to determine the presence of grasp reflexes, and the intensity of these reflexes was assessed using a four-category classification. Clinical rating scales and their correlation with grasp reflexes were also evaluated. Grasp reflexes were reassessed in 72 patients 1 year after surgery. RESULTS: We found that approximately 50.3% of patients with iNPH exhibited a positive grasp reflex. Among these patients, 69% exhibited bilateral positivity, while the remaining patients showed unilateral positivity. Furthermore, the intensity of the grasp reflex was significantly correlated with the severity of gait and with cognitive, urinary, motor, and behavioural symptoms. Surgical interventions led to a reduction (41.7%) or maintenance (30.6%) of the reflex intensity in 72.3% of iNPH patients. The changes in reflex intensity showed significant positive correlations with changes in the number of steps of the Timed Up and Go test and Trail Making Test-A scores but not with changes in total scores on the iNPH Grading Scale. CONCLUSION: This retrospective study identified grasp reflexes as a highly prevalent phenomenon in patients with iNPH. These reflexes can assist in evaluating the severity of various symptoms, including cognitive, gait, urinary, motor and emotional symptoms.
