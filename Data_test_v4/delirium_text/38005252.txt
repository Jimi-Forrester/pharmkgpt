38005252|t|Evaluating Phytochemical Profiles, Cytotoxicity, Antiviral Activity, Antioxidant Potential, and Enzyme Inhibition of Vepris boiviniana Extracts.
38005252|a|In the present study, we performed comprehensive LC-MS chemical profiling and biological tests of Vepris boiviniana leaves and stem bark extracts of different polarities. In total, 60 bioactive compounds were tentatively identified in all extracts. The 80% ethanolic stem bark extract exhibited the highest activity in the ABTS assay, equal to 551.82 mg TE/g. The infusion extract of stem bark consistently demonstrated elevated antioxidant activity in all assays, with values ranging from 137.39 mg TE/g to 218.46 mg TE/g. Regarding the enzyme inhibitory assay, aqueous extracts from both bark and leaves exhibited substantial inhibition of AChE, with EC50 values of 2.41 mg GALAE/g and 2.25 mg GALAE/g, respectively. The 80% ethanolic leaf extract exhibited the lowest cytotoxicity in VERO cells (CC50: 613.27 microg/mL) and demonstrated selective cytotoxicity against cancer cells, particularly against H1HeLa cells, indicating potential therapeutic specificity. The 80% ethanolic bark extract exhibited elevated toxicity in VERO cells but had reduced anticancer selectivity. The n-hexane extracts, notably the leaves' n-hexane extract, displayed the highest toxicity towards non-cancerous cells with selectivity towards H1HeLa and RKO cells. In viral load assessment, all extracts reduced HHV-1 load by 0.14-0.54 log and HRV-14 viral load by 0.13-0.72 log, indicating limited antiviral activity. In conclusion, our research underscores the diverse bioactive properties of Vepris boiviniana extracts, exhibiting potent antioxidant, enzyme inhibitory, and cytotoxicity potential against cancer cells.
