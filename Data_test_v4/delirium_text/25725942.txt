25725942|a|Aging in the immune system results in tendency to proinflammatory responses. Intradermal DNA immunization showed Th2 polarized noninflammatory immune responses. We tested here 18-month-old mice which were immunized with Abeta42 peptide, DNA Abeta42 trimer, or 2 different prime boost protocols identical to previous experiments. High Abeta42 antibody levels were found in aged mice which had received peptide immunizations (900 mug/mL plasma), and in mice which had received peptide prime and DNA boost immunizations (500 mug/mL), compared with antibodies in DNA Abeta42 immunized mice with 50 mug/mL. Although we found T-cell proliferation and inflammatory cytokines in mice which had received peptide or prime boost immunization, these were not found in DNA-immunized mice. The results are concordant with proinflammatory responses because of immunosenescence and contraindicate the use of Abeta42 peptide immunizations or prime boost immunization protocols for the use in elderly Alzheimer's disease patients. DNA Abeta42 immunization only on the other hand does lead to effective levels of antibodies without inflammatory cytokine or T-cell responses in the aged animal model tested.
