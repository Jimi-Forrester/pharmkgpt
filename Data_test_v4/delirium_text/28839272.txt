28839272|a|Endothelial cells (EC) are involved in regulating several aspects of lipid metabolism, with recent research revealing the clinicopathological significance of interactions between EC and lipids. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) have various possible medical uses, so understanding the metabolism of these cells is important. In this study, endothelial phenotype cells generated from human iPSC formed cell networks in co-culture with fibroblasts. Changes of plasmalogen lipids and sphingomyelins in endothelial phenotype cells generated from human iPSC were investigated by reverse-phase ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis. The levels of plasmalogen phosphatidylethanolamines (38:5) and (38:4) increased during differentiation of EC, while sphingomyelin levels decreased transiently. These changes of plasmalogen lipids and sphingomyelins may have physiological significance for EC and could be used as markers of differentiation.
