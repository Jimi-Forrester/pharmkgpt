38918327|t|Mechanistic insights on TLR-4 mediated inflammatory pathway in neurodegenerative diseases.
38918327|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) pose a significant issue in healthcare, needing a thorough knowledge of their complex molecular mechanisms. A diverse set of cell signaling mediators and their interactions play critical roles in neuroinflammation. The release of pro-inflammatory mediators in response to neural dysfunction is detrimental to normal cell survival. Moreover, the important role of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in the central nervous system through Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation has been well established. Therefore, through a comprehensive review of current research and experimentation, this investigation elucidates the interactions between novel pharmacological agents (TLR-4/NF-kappaB inhibitors) and neurodegeneration encompassing Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and stroke. Insights garnered from this exploration underscore the potential of TLR-4 as a therapeutic target. Through the revelation of these insights, our aim is to establish a foundation for the development of enhanced and focused therapeutic approaches in the continuous endeavor to combat neurodegeneration. This review thus serves as a roadmap, guiding future research endeavors toward innovative strategies for combatting the complex interplay between TLR-4 signaling and NDDs.
