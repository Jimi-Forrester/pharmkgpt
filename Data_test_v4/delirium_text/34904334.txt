34904334|t|Is delirium associated with negative outcomes in older patients with hip fracture: analysis of the 4904 patients 2017-2018 from the Australian and New Zealand hip fracture registry.
34904334|a|AIM: To determine associations between delirium and health outcomes using the Australia and New Zealand population-based hip fracture patient registry (ANZHFR). METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from the ANZHFR among hip-fracture surgery patients admitted to and discharged from hospital between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2018. RESULTS: Of the 4904 patients with complete data and included in the analysis, 1789 (36.5%) experienced delirium during their hospital stay. Patients with delirium also had a higher rate of in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR = 1.76; 95% CI = 1.24, 2.49; P < 0.001), a higher rate of long-term mortality (adjusted HR = 1.30; 95% CI = 1.15, 1.48; P < 0.001) and a higher odds of discharge to an aged care facility (adjusted OR = 1.24; 95% CI = 1.04, 1.48; P = 0.019). CONCLUSION: A high rate of postoperative delirium exists among Australian and New Zealand hip fracture patients. Rates of hospital mortality, length of hospital stay and discharge to residential aged care are considerably worse in these patients.
