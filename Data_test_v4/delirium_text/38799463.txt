38799463|t|Lipidome is a valuable tool for the severity prediction of coronavirus disease 2019.
38799463|a|Objective: To describe the lipid metabolic profile of different patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and contribute new evidence on the progression and severity prediction of COVID-19. Methods: This case-control study was conducted in Peking University Third Hospital, China. The laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients aged >=18 years old and diagnosed as pneumonia from December 2022 to January 2023 were included. Serum lipids were detected. The discrimination ability was calculated with the area under the curve (AUC). A random forest (RF) model was conducted to determine the significance of different lipids. Results: Totally, 44 COVID-19 patients were enrolled with 16 mild and 28 severe patients. The top 5 super classes were triacylglycerols (TAG, 55.9%), phosphatidylethanolamines (PE, 10.9%), phosphatidylcholines (PC, 6.8%), diacylglycerols (DAG, 5.9%) and free fatty acids (FFA, 3.6%) among the 778 detected lipids from the serum of COVID-19 patients. Certain lipids, especially lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), turned to have significant correlations with certain immune/cytokine indexes. Reduced level of LPC 20:0 was observed in severe patients particularly in acute stage. The AUC of LPC 20:0 reached 0.940 in discriminating mild and severe patients and 0.807 in discriminating acute and recovery stages in the severe patients. The results of RF models also suggested the significance of LPCs in predicting the severity and progression of COVID-19. Conclusion: Lipids probably have the potential to differentiate and forecast the severity, progression, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients, with implications for immune/inflammatory responses. LPC 20:0 might be a potential target in predicting the progression and outcome and the treatment of COVID-19.
