1494241|a|To investigate whether cellular DNA synthesis in lymphocytes can be induced by carbachol, we studied the effect of carbachol in cultures of peripheral lymphocytes. Three age groups of healthy female adults were examined: 40-49 (N = 10), 51-59 (N = 8), and 61-69 years old (N = 8). Moreover, we studied lymphocytes from 14 female patients (47-69 years old) with probable Alzheimer's disease. Lymphocytes were incubated for 72 hrs at 37 degrees C, with or without 5 mM carbachol. The effects of carbachol on the initiation of DNA synthesis in lymphocytes were determined by 24 hr-pulse-labeling with [3H]-thymidine ([3H]-dT). Stimulation indexes (S.I.) were defined as the ratios of DNA synthesis induced with or without carbachol. In 37 out of 40 subjects, carbachol elicited an increase in [3H]-dT incorporation. Furthermore, carbachol induction of DNA synthesis was blocked by muscarinic antagonist, atropine. These data show that carbachol induces DNA synthesis in peripheral lymphocytes are well as the central nervous system, indicating that the proliferation is mediated by the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. For healthy controls (age range 40-69 years old, N = 26), a negative correlation (r = -0.505, p < 0.01) was found between age and S.I. The regression equation was: Y = -0.575X + 142.1 where, X and Y designate the age of individuals and S.I., respectively. However, there were significant differences (p < 0.05) with S.I. between age groups 40-49 and 61-69 years old. For patients with Alzheimer's disease, no correlation was obtained between age and S.I.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
