39731934|a|Constipation is common among older adults and significantly impacts their quality of life (QoL). Prior studies have extensively detailed constipation, but conceptualization of constipation as a geriatric syndrome is lacking. In this review, we provide an overview of constipation in the geriatric population and conceptualize constipation as a geriatric syndrome given its high prevalence, under-recognized status, and association with poor QoL and adverse outcomes among older adults. The conceptualization of constipation as a geriatric syndrome, as with frailty and delirium, highlights its importance and need for a multi-faceted approach. Future research is needed to 1) better define constipation, 2) explore the multifactorial nature of constipation in older adults and relationship with other geriatric syndromes, 3) include more older adults in pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for constipation, and 4) curate multidisciplinary care models. Appreciating constipation as a geriatric syndrome will yield tailored management strategies, ensure timely intervention, and avoid adverse outcomes.
