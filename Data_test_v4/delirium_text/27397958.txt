27397958|a|BACKGROUND: Cycloplegic refraction is important in assessing children with hypermetropia. Atropine, though the gold standard cycloplegic agent for refraction in children, has a long duration of action and more severe side effects compared to short-acting cycloplegic agents. The aim of the study was to compare the cycloplegic effect of atropine with cyclopentolate and tropicamide combination in children with hypermetropia. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a crossover interventional study in children with hypermetropia. Cycloplegic refraction using two separate regimens of cycloplegic drugs was done on all subjects. Data were analyzed using the statistical software SPSS version 22.0. The mean spherical equivalent values of regimen 1 (atropine 1%) and regimen 2 (cyclopentolate 1% and tropicamide 1%) were presented as mean and standard deviation. A P <= 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-six eyes of 63 subjects aged 5-12 years were examined. The mean spherical equivalent values for regimen 1 and regimen 2 for the right eyes were 4.73 +- 2.1 DS and 4.54 +- 1.9 DS, respectively (P = 0.59). The mean spherical equivalent values for regimens 1 and 2 for the left eyes were 4.74 +- 2.0 DS and 4.54 +- 1.8 DS, respectively (P = 0.56). CONCLUSION: The combination of 1% cyclopentolate and 1% tropicamide could be a useful alternative to atropine 1% for cycloplegic refraction in children with hypermetropia.
