27934893|t|Structural and fluctuational difference between two ends of Abeta amyloid fibril: MD simulations predict only one end has open conformations.
27934893|a|Abeta amyloid fibrils, which are related to Alzheimer's disease, have a cross-beta structure consisting of two beta-sheets: beta1 and beta2. The Abeta peptides are thought to be serially arranged in the same molecular conformation along the fibril axis. However, to understand the amyloid extension mechanism, we must understand the amyloid fibril structure and fluctuation at the fibril end, which has not been revealed to date. Here, we reveal these features by all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Abeta42 and Abeta40 fibrils in explicit water. The structure and fluctuation were observed to differ between the two ends. At the even end, the Abeta peptide always took a closed form wherein beta1 and beta2 were closely spaced. The Abeta peptide fluctuated more at the odd end and took an open form wherein the two beta-sheets were well separated. The differences are attributed to the stronger beta-sheet formation by the beta1 exposed at the even end than the beta2 exposed at the odd end. Along with the small fluctuations at the even end, these results explain why the fibril extends from one end only, as observed in experiments. Our MD results agree well with recent observations by high-speed atomic force microscopy.
