24579665|a|The combination of stable isotope labeling of amino acids in mammals (SILAM) and laser capture microdissection (LCM) for selective proteomic analysis of the targeted tissues holds tremendous potential for refined characterization of proteome changes within complex tissues such as the brain. The authors have applied this approach to measure changes in relative protein abundance in ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the rat brain that correlate to pharmacological perturbations. Enriched (13)C6(15)N2-lysine was introduced in vivo via diet. These animals were sacrificed during the middle of the 12-hour light period to extract isotopically "heavy" proteins, which were then used as a reference for extracts from dosed, unlabeled rats. Animals were administered an orexin peptide (Ox-B), an orexin receptor antagonist (ORA), or a mixture of both (Ox-B + ORA). All samples were obtained at same phase of the sleep cycle. Labeled-pair identification and differential quantitation provided protein identification and expression ratio data. Five proteins were found to exhibit decreased relative abundance after administration of an ORA, including alpha-synuclein and rat myelin basic protein. Conversely, six proteins showed increased relative abundance upon antagonist treatment, including 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase.
