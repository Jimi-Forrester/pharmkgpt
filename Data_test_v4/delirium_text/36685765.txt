36685765|t|Potential role of IGF-1/GLP-1 signaling activation in intracerebral hemorrhage.
36685765|a|IGF-1 and GLP-1 receptors are essential in all tissues, facilitating defense by upregulating anabolic processes. They are abundantly distributed throughout the central nervous system, promoting neuronal proliferation, survival, and differentiation. IGF-1/GLP-1 is a growth factor that stimulates neurons' development, reorganization, myelination, and survival. In primary and secondary brain injury, the IGF-1/GLP-1 receptors are impaired, resulting in further neuro complications such as cerebral tissue degradation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and atrophy. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a severe condition caused by a stroke for which there is currently no effective treatment. While some pre-clinical studies and medications are being developed as symptomatic therapies in clinical trials, there are specific pharmacological implications for improving post-operative conditions in patients with intensive treatment. Identifying the underlying molecular process and recognizing the worsening situation can assist researchers in developing effective therapeutic solutions to prevent post-hemorrhagic symptoms and the associated neural dysfunctions. As a result, in the current review, we have addressed the manifestations of the disease that are aggravated by the downregulation of IGF-1 and GLP-1 receptors, which can lead to ICH or other neurodegenerative disorders. Our review summarizes that IGF-1/GLP-1 activators may be useful for treating ICH and its related neurodegeneration.
