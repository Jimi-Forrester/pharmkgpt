33815886|t|Management of Very Old Patients in Intensive Care Units.
33815886|a|The global population is aging and the demand for critical care wards increasing. Aging is associated not only with physiological and cognitive vulnerability, but also with a decline in organ function. A new topic in geriatric care is how to appropriately use critical care resources and provide the best treatment plan for very old patients (VOPs). Our special geriatric intensive care unit has admitted nearly 500 VOPs. In this review, we share our VOP treatment strategy and summarize the key points as "ABCCDEFGHI bundles." The aim is to help intensivists to provide more comprehensive therapy for VOPs in intensive care units.
