37051093|a|Older adults with multimorbidities have the highest rate of emergency department (ED) usage. These patients are typically on numerous medications, may have underlying dementia, and often present with falls and delirium. Identifying these high-risk older adults for possible intervention is challenging in the ED setting since available screening methods are manual and resource-intensive. The objective is to study the electronic medical record (EMR) use for identifying high-risk older adults in ED. This feasibility study is conducted in an academic ED with 67 000 total and 24% geriatric (age >= 65 years) annual visits, American College of Emergency Physician (ACEP) accredited Level 1 Geriatric Emergency Department with an ED-based geriatric consultation program by incorporating criteria from existing manual geriatric screening instruments and the 4M framework into an automated EMR screen to identify high-risk geriatric patients. ED providers are then alerted by an EMR Best Practice Alert (BPA) if high-risk status is identified. Initial development and impact on geriatric ED consults are reported. During the study period, 7450 patient encounters occurred; 1836 (24.6%) encounters involved patients who were 65 years or older. A total of 1398 (76.1%) high-risk ED encounters resulted in BPA alerts using the EMR automated screen. BPA alerts resulted in 82 (5.9%) geriatric evaluations. We conclude that using the EMR to automate screening for older adults for high-risk geriatric conditions in the ED is feasible. An automated EMR screen with a BPA to ED providers identified a well-defined cohort of older patients appropriate for further ED geriatric evaluation.
