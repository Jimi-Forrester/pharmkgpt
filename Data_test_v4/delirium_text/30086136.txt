30086136|a|The pathogenesis of delirium in critically ill patients is multifactorial. How hypotension and hypoxemia affect brain function and whether they can promote delirium remains unclear. A high cumulative positive fluid balance may also have a negative effect on brain function and promote delirium. We hypothesized that delirium would be more likely to develop in patients with low systemic arterial pressure, hypoxemia and a higher positive fluid balance, and investigated these associations in a prospective observational cohort study in patients with shock. After initial resuscitation, episodes of hypotension, defined as a mean arterial pressure (MAP) <65 mmHg or diastolic pressure <60 mmHg, and hypoxemia, defined as peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) <90% for more than one minute or any arterial oxygen concentration (PaO2) <90 mmHg, were recorded during the first 5 days of the ICU stay. Fluid balance was evaluated daily and the 5-day cumulative fluid balance recorded. Delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU. A total of 252 patients were admitted with shock during the study period; 185 (73%) developed delirium. Patients who developed delirium also had more episodes of hypotension with a low MAP (p = 0.013) or diastolic pressure (p = 0.018) during the first five days of the ICU stay than those who did not. Patients with a higher cumulative fluid balance during the same period were also more likely to develop delirium (p = 0.01); there was no significant difference in the occurrence of hypoxemia between groups. Joint modeling, combining a linear-mixed model and an adjusted Cox survival model showed that low diastolic pressure (alpha effect = -0.058+-0.0013, p = 0.043) and a positive cumulative fluid balance (alpha effect = 0.04+-0.003, p = 0.021) were independently associated with delirium. In conclusion, low diastolic pressure and a cumulative positive fluid balance but not hypoxemia were independently associated with development of delirium in patients with shock.
