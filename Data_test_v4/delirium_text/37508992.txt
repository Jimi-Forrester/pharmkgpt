37508992|t|A Multimodal Approach for Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of Primary Progressive Aphasia (MAINSTREAM): A Study Protocol.
37508992|a|Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) is a syndrome due to different neurodegenerative disorders selectively disrupting language functions. PPA specialist care is underdeveloped. There are very few specialists (neurologists, psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, and speech therapists) and few hospital- or community-based services dedicated to the diagnosis and continuing care of people with PPA. Currently, healthcare systems struggle to provide adequate coverage of care that is too often fragmented, uncoordinated, and unresponsive to the needs of people with PPA and their families. Recently, attention has been gained by non-invasive brain stimulation techniques that allow a personalized treatment approach, such as transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). The MAINSTREAM trial looks forward to introducing and evaluating therapeutic innovations such as tDCS coupled with language therapy in rehabilitation settings. A Multimodal Approach for Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of Primary Progressive Aphasia, MAINSTREAM (ID: 3430931) was registered in the clinicaltrials.gov database (identifier: NCT05730023) on 15 February 2023.
