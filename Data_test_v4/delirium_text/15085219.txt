15085219|a|BACKGROUND: In the past decade neuropsychiatric symptoms are not recognized until moderate and late stages of Alzheimer Disease (AD). OBJECTIVES: To identify the neuropsychiatric symptoms in different stage of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 72 patients with probable AD (NINCDS ADRDA criteria) and 19 control subjects underwent an extensive neurologic, neuropsychologic, and neuropsychiatric evaluation including the brief questionnaire form of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-Q). RESULTS: 87,5% developed neuropsychiatric symptoms, being apathy and irritability the most frequent. In those with CDR 0,5 such findings were already present in 66,6%. Patients with mild dementia (MMSE 21-30) showed more affective symptoms, those with moderate (MMSE 11-20) more psychotic symptoms and patients with severe impairment (MMSE 0-11) showed more expression of frontal deterioration. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are frequent manifestations of AD, and must be recognized and treated properly even in the early stages of the disease because they contribute to caregiver burden and often precipitate institutionalization in nursing home.
