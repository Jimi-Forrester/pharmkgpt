38681363|t|Intensive Care Unit (ICU)-Related Post-traumatic Stress Disorder: A Literature Review.
38681363|a|An intensive care unit (ICU) is a challenging environment characterized by frequent incidences of stressors and traumatic situations. Therefore, both patients and caregivers are at high risk of developing psychological disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. ICU-related PTSD is a significant concern that remains under-recognized. This literature review examines the current state of knowledge regarding ICU-related PTSD, including its prevalence, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and potential interventions. Key findings suggest that a considerable proportion of ICU survivors develop PTSD symptoms, which can significantly impact their quality of life and recovery. The most common predictors investigated for PTSD in ICU survivors are age, gender, pre-illness psychopathy, length of stay in the ICU, delirium, and sedative agents. The treatment and prevention strategies of ICU-related PTSD include psychological therapies and pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. Psychological interventions, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy, have shown promise in mitigating PTSD symptoms in ICU survivors. However, further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying ICU-related PTSD and to develop targeted interventions to prevent and manage this debilitating condition.
