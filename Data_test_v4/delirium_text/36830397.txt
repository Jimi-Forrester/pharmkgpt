36830397|t|An Overview of Exertional Heat Illness in Thoroughbred Racehorses: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Treatment Rationale.
36830397|a|Exertional heat illness (EHI) is a complex medical disease. The thoroughbred (TB) racehorse is at considerable risk because of the intensity of its exercise activity and its high rate of metabolic heat production. The pathophysiology of EHI can combine aspects of both the heat toxicity pathway and the heat sepsis or endotoxemic pathway. Treatment regimes depend upon the detection of earliest clinical signs, rapid assessment, aggressive cooling and judicious use of ancillary medications. Ice-cold water provides the most rapid cooling, consistent with the need to lower core body temperature before tissue damage occurs. Research into EHI/HS by inducing the condition experimentally is ethically unjustifiable. Consequently, leading researchers in the human field have conceded that "most of our knowledge has been gained from anecdotal incidents, gathered from military personnel and athletes who have collapsed during or following physical activity, and that retrospective and case studies have provided important evidence regarding recognition and treatment of EHI". The authors' review into EHI shares that perspective, and the recommendations made herein are based on observations of heat-affected racehorses at the racetrack and their response, or lack of response, to treatment. From 2014 to 2018, 73 race meetings were attended, and of the 4809 individual starters, signs of EHI were recorded in 457. That observational study formed the basis for a series of articles which have been published under the title, 'EHI in Thoroughbred racehorses in eastern Australia', and forms the background for this review.
