29193248|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM: This study investigated the prognostic impact of muscle volume loss (MVL) and muscle function decline in patients undergoing resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: This study enrolled 171 naive HCC patients treated with resection from 2007 to 2015, after excluding those lacking spirometry or computed tomography findings, who had received non-curative treatments, or with restrictive or obstructive lung disorders. The median peak expiratory flow rate (%PEF) was set as the cut-off value for muscle function decline, and MVL was diagnosed using a previously reported value. Clinical backgrounds and prognosis were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Overall survival rate was lower in the MVL (n = 35) as compared with the non-MVL (n = 136) group (1/3/5-year overall survival rate = 88.2%/81.6%/55.6% vs 91.0%/81.5%/74.8%, respectively; P = 0.0083), while there were no differences regarding hepatic function or tumor burden between the groups. Child-Pugh class B (hazard ratio [HR] 3.510, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.558-7.926, P = 0.0025), beyond Milan criteria (HR 1.866, 95%CI: 1.024-3.403, P = 0.042), and presence of MVL (HR 1.896, 95%CI: 1.052-3.416, P = 0.033) were significant prognostic factors. The decreased %PEF group (n = 84) showed a higher rate of postoperative delirium than the others (n = 87) (27.4% vs 11.5%, P = 0.0088). The cut-off values for %PEF and age for postoperative delirium were 63.3% (area under receiver operating characteristic [AUROC] 0.697) and 73 years old (AUROC 0.734), respectively. Delirium was observed in 50.0% (14/28) of patients with both factors, 23.8% (15/63) of those with 1 factor, and 5.0% (4/80) of those without either factor. CONCLUSION: Muscle volume loss is an independent prognostic factor in HCC patients treated with surgical resection, while advanced age and decreased muscle function might indicate high risk for postoperative delirium.
