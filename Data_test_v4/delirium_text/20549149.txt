20549149|a|INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: There is little information available regarding the course of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in a general hospital. The aim of this study was to analyse the timing of the most important clinical features attributed to alcohol withdrawal, as well as their prognostic implications. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A cohort study of patients with a diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal syndrome was carried out at the Xeral Hospital in Lugo (Spain) between 1987 and 2003, in accordance with DSM IV-TR criteria. Data on clinical characteristics and course were collected, with special attention to the timing of significant events. RESULTS: A total of 539 episodes were studied in 436 patients: 156 cases of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and 383 of alcohol withdrawal delirium. Mean time of abstinence until the diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal syndrome was 54 hours (D.T. = 31.1). Seizures occurred at 35 hours (D.T. = 23.3) after abstinence. The alcohol withdrawal syndrome lasted for 46.4 hours (D.T. = 23.1) after diagnosis. In cases in which delirium tremens developed, this occurred at 46.4 hours (D.T. = 23.1), and lasted 73.9 hours (D.T. = 41.5). Patients needing intensive care were admitted to the ICU 40.8 hours (D.T. = 60) after the diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The clinical features of alcohol withdrawal syndrome tended to be more prolonged in patients admitted with a medical or surgical diagnosis other than withdrawal syndrome than in those admitted because of withdrawal syndrome itself. CONCLUSIONS: The natural history of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in a general hospital setting and the timings of its principal events follow a clearly recognizable pattern. This knowledge can help to provide better assessment in relation to the monitoring and treatment of these patients.
