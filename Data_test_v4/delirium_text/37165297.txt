37165297|a|Neuroprotection is one of the important protection methods against neuronal cells and tissue damage caused by neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and multiple sclerosis. Various bioactive compounds produced by medicinal plants can potentially treat central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Apart from these resources, endophytes also produce diverse secondary metabolites capable of protecting the CNS. The bioactive compounds produced by endophytes play essential roles in enhancing the growth factors, antioxidant defence functions, diminishing neuroinflammatory, and apoptotic pathways. The efficacy of compounds produced by endophytic fungi was also evaluated by enzymes, cell lines, and in vivo models. Acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibition is frequently used to assess in vitro neuroprotective activity along with cytotoxicity-induced neuronal cell lines. Some of drugs, such as tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and other compounds, are generally used as reference standards. Furthermore, clinical trials are required to confirm the role of these natural compounds in neuroprotection efficacy and evaluate their safety profile. This review illustrates the production of various bioactive compounds produced by endophytic fungi and their role in preventing neurodegeneration.
