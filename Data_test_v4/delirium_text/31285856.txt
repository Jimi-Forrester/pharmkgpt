31285856|a|Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by disruption of protein folding activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), which while generally pro-survival in effect can also induce cell death under severe ER stress. 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC), which is enzymatically produced in the ER of neurons, plays an important role in maintaining brain cholesterol homeostasis but also shows neurotoxicity when subjected to esterification by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) in the ER. In this study, we demonstrated that the accumulation of 24S-OHC esters in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells evoked the UPR with substantially no pro-survival adaptive response but with significant activation of pro-death UPR signaling via regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD). We further found that accumulation of 24S-OHC esters caused disruption of ER membrane integrity and release of ER luminal proteins into cytosol. We also found that de novo synthesis of global proteins was robustly suppressed in 24S-OHC-treated cells. Collectively, these results show that ER dysfunction and the accompanying RIDD-mediated pro-death UPR signaling and global protein synthesis inhibition are responsible for 24S-OHC ester-induced unconventional cell death.
