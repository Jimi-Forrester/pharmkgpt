37393507|t|Cardiovascular Risk Management for All Older Patients?
37393507|a|Current guidelines on cardiovascular risk management are extrapolated to all older adults. It is, however, highly debatable whether recommendations also apply for patients with dementia since previous studies have not included this specific population. Time to benefit as well as higher risk of adverse events play a crucial role in the decision process of prescribing or deprescribing. Regular monitoring is needed in older patients with dementia, in order to make individual-based treatment strategies. Cardiovascular risk management in older patients with dementia should focus on quality of life, preventing cognitive and functional deterioration, and maintaining independence.
