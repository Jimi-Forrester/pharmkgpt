26587408|t|A Survey on the Effect of Oral Gabapentin on Hemodynamic Changes During Direct Laryngoscopy and Tracheal Intubation and Intraoperative Bleeding in Patients Undergoing Septorhinoplasty.
26587408|a|BACKGROUND: In patients undergoing septorhinoplasty, control of bleeding and hemodynamic variables is of great importance and laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation could be followed by a specific and transient increase in systemic blood pressure and heart rate. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the effects of oral gabapentin on hemodynamic changes, during direct laryngoscopy, and the amount of bleeding in the patients undergoing septorhinoplasty. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a double-blind clinical trial, 103 patients (American society of anesthesiologists class I, II) aged 18 - 45 years old, who were septorhinoplasty candidates, were randomly assigned into two groups, a 900 mg gabapentin group and placebo, in Amir-Al-Momenin academic hospital. The drug was prescribed to the patients orally, 2 hours before the operation. Anesthetic technique was similar for all the patients. Heart rate (HR), systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), oxygen saturation percentage of arterial blood (SaO2), before induction of anesthesia, 3, 5, 10, and 15 minutes after the intubation and tracheal extubation, and the amount of bleeding during operation were measured. Statistical analysis was performed with the SPSS (v. 16) software. RESULTS: Variations in the HR, DBP and SaO2, in the specified time intervals, did not show any statistically significant difference, although variations in SBP were statistically significant (higher in gabapentin group). Regarding the average amount of bleeding volume, although there was a lower amount of bleeding in the gabapentin group, the difference was not statistically significant. Also, regarding the pain, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of visual analog scale (VAS) average and the received analgesic. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that premedication with 900 mg gabapentin did not affect the hemodynamic changes induced by laryngoscopy and the amount of bleeding. However, the decreased amount of bleeding was observed in the gabapentin group.
