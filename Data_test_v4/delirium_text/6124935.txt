6124935|t|[Clinical trial of bromazepam in psychiatric hospital practice (author's transl)].
6124935|a|An open trial of bromazepam (Lexomil) was conducted in 35 patients (23 men and 12 women, aged from 18 to 76 years) admitted to a psychiatry unit for various, usually old-standing, conditions associated with major anxiety. The mean effective dosage was 18 mg/day. The effectiveness of the drug administered alone was assessed in 25 patients at the end of the second week of treatment, using the Hamilton and Pull-Guelfi scales. A satisfactory response was obtained in 81% of the cases. Reactional anxiety in alcoholic and neurotic patients was found to constitute the best indication for  bromazepam, the value of which during weaning from alcohol in patients admitted with threatening delirium tremens must be stressed. Bromazepam was well tolerated in 83% of the patients; side-effects (daytime somnolence and fatigue) were rare. The drug proved a potent and quick-acting tranquillizer and often resulted in a shorter stay in hospital.
