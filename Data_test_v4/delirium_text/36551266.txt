36551266|t|Deep-Learning Algorithm and Concomitant Biomarker Identification for NSCLC Prediction Using Multi-Omics Data Integration.
36551266|a|Early diagnosis of lung cancer to increase the survival rate, which is currently at a low range of mid-30%, remains a critical need. Despite this, multi-omics data have rarely been applied to non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) diagnosis. We developed a multi-omics data-affinitive artificial intelligence algorithm based on the graph convolutional network that integrates mRNA expression, DNA methylation, and DNA sequencing data. This NSCLC prediction model achieved a 93.7% macro F1-score, indicating that values for false positives and negatives were substantially low, which is desirable for accurate classification. Gene ontology enrichment and pathway analysis of features revealed that two major subtypes of NSCLC, lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma, have both specific and common GO biological processes. Numerous biomarkers (i.e., microRNA, long non-coding RNA, differentially methylated regions) were newly identified, whereas some biomarkers were consistent with previous findings in NSCLC (e.g., SPRR1B). Thus, using multi-omics data integration, we developed a promising cancer prediction algorithm.
