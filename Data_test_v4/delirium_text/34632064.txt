34632064|t|Medical sequels of COVID-19.
34632064|a|COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the world population, with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. While the evidence to date has attempted to describe clinical feature of acute illness, recent reports have also begun to describe persistent symptoms that extend beyond the initial period of illness. Adverse outcomes, in addition to respiratory, have been found to occur at different levels: cardiovascular, neurological, or immunological; skin, gastrointestinal or renal manifestations. The detrimental effect on mental health has also been described, not only in COVID-19 patients. The burden of disease secondary to this pandemic is likely to be enormous and not limited to acute disease alone, thus epidemiological studies are needed to further investigate the long-term impact of this disease. This review summarizes the current evidence on short-term effects and describes the possible long-term sequelae of COVID-19.
