36895956|a|Adult diffuse gliomas are among the most difficult brain disorders to treat in part due to a lack of clarity regarding the anatomical origins and mechanisms of migration of the tumours. While the importance of studying networks of glioma spread has been recognized for at least 80 years, the ability to carry out such investigations in humans has emerged only recently. Here, we comprehensively review the fields of brain network mapping and glioma biology to provide a primer for investigators interested in merging these areas of inquiry for the purposes of translational research. Specifically, we trace the historical development of ideas in both brain network mapping and glioma biology, highlighting studies that explore clinical applications of network neuroscience, cells-of-origin of diffuse glioma and glioma-neuronal interactions. We discuss recent research that has merged neuro-oncology and network neuroscience, finding that the spatial distribution patterns of gliomas follow intrinsic functional and structural brain networks. Ultimately, we call for more contributions from network neuroimaging to realize the translational potential of cancer neuroscience.
