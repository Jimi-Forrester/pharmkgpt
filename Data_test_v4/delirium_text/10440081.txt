10440081|a|A patient with severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) presented with a severe impairment in naming nouns but selective sparing of the naming of verbs. Her impairment in naming nouns was presented across a wide range of categories investigated. To our knowledge, this is the first case documenting the selective preservation of verb naming in a patient with AD. The implications for the notion of an intrinsic vulnerability of verb naming in AD and for the current knowledge of anatomical correlates of noun/verb processing are discussed.
