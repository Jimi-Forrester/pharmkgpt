35387413|t|ABCA7 rs3764650 Polymorphism is Associated with Delayed Neurocognitive Recovery.
35387413|a|Background: Several studies have shown that ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7) gene variation is associated with cognitive impairment. This study was aimed to investigate the relationship between ABCA7 rs3764650 polymorphism and perioperative neurocognitive disorder (pNCD). Methods: A total of 132 elderly patients aged 65 and over who underwent elective non-cardiac surgery were enrolled in the study, while 28 healthy volunteers matching age and sex were recruited as the control group. A battery of neuropsychological tests was conducted 1 day before, 7 days, and 3 months after surgeries. Delayed neurocognitive recovery (dNCR) and postoperative mild or major neurocognitive disorder (POCD) were determined using the Z value method. The venous blood sample of the surgical patients was taken before the operation. Genotyping of rs3764650 was performed using polymerase chain reaction amplification and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Results: The incidences of dNCR and POCD were 29.7% and 16.8% at 7 days and 3 months after surgery, respectively. The G allele frequency and GG frequency of dNCR patients were significantly higher than that of non-dNCR patients (43.3% vs 28.2%, P=0.035; 23.3% vs 4.2%, P=0.013, respectively) at 7 days following surgery. No significant differences in ABCA7 alleles between POCD and non-POCD patients were observed 3 months postoperatively. Conclusion: ABCA7 rs3764650 gene polymorphism is associated with dNCR and GG genotype might be a predisposing factor for postoperative cognitive impairment in Chinese Han elderly populations.
