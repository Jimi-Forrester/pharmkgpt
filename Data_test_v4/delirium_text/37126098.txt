37126098|t|Postoperative delirium after intracranial neurosurgery: A prospective cohort study from a developing nation.
37126098|a|INTRODUCTION: Post-operative delirium (POD) is a major complication after anesthesia and surgery with an incidence varying from 5 to 50%. The incidence of POD after intracranial surgery is likely to be higher due to the pre-existing brain pathology and direct handling of the brain during neurosurgery. The primary objective of this study was to assess the incidence of POD after intracranial neurosurgery and our secondary objective was to identify the potential risk factors for its occurrence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted after the institutional ethics committee approval between october 2020 and march 2021. We included patients of either gender aged >= 18 years and undergoing elective intracranial neurosurgery. Exclusion criteria included patients aged below 18 years, undergoing emergency neurosurgery, patients with impaired consciousness and patients with psychiatric comorbidities or those taking psychotropic medications. We planned to exclude patients from analysis who were transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) or if they were not extubated after surgery. Our study outcome was development of POD as assessed by confusion assessment method (CAM). RESULTS: The overall incidence of POD during the three postoperative days was 19.2% (n=60/313). The incidence of POD on days 1, 2, and 3 were 19.2% (n=60/313), 17.2% (n=50/291), and 16.3% (n=39/239). Preoperative delirium and hyperactive Emergence Delirium were found to be the significant predictors of POD. CONCLUSION: Every one in five patients undergoing intracranial neurosurgery is vulnerable for the development of POD within first three days after surgery. The incidence of occurrence of POD is time-sensitive and is decremental.
