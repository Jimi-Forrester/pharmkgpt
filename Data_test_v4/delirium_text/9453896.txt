9453896|a|From 1994 to March 1997, 12 patients with 15 drug-related abscesses of the groin were treated at the Surgical Department of Lubeck Medical University. Besides laboratory, serological and microbiological examinations, the standard diagnostic investigation consisted of sonography or duplex sonography. If indicated, the diagnosis was extended to include, for example, clarification of the retroperitoneum by CT. The most common accompanying disease was deep femoral vein thrombosis. Substitution was planned individually. After surgical debridement and perioperative administration of a beta-lactam-protected acylaminopenicillin, open wound treatment was successfully carried out in 13 cases; secondary closure was performed four times in cases of good compliance. One abscess led to necrotising of the femoral artery; saphenous vein was interposed because of erosion bleeding and formation of aneurysm. In a second case, the bifurcation was reconstructed with saphenous vein after external resection of an infected false aneurysm and early occlusion. Both defects were covered by rotation of sartorius muscle and mesh graft. On the basis of the treatment concept, a rapid and successful intervention was possible; complications such as sepsis, amputation or withdrawal delirium did not occur. Resistance against the antibiotic was not observed. In the case of infected aneurysm, we prefer the autogenous saphenous vein graft followed by rotation of sartorius muscle and mesh graft. Ligation or excision leads to high rates of claudication or amputation; extended reconstructions are threatened by insufficient compliance of the patients; the use of synthetic grafts is endangered by further bacteraemia or infections.
