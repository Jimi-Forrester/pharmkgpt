38707045|t|Hyponatremia With Anticonvulsant Medications: A Narrative Review.
38707045|a|Hyponatremia is an adverse effect of many antiseizure medications (ASMs). It occurs with interference with the normal balance of electrolytes within the body. Various risk factors associated with the development of hyponatremia in patients taking these medications include age, gender, dosage, and combinations with other drugs. ASMs such as carbamazepine (CBZ), oxcarbazepine (OXC), and valproic acid have a higher risk of hyponatremia. Hyponatremia induced by an antiseizure medication can occur through various mechanisms depending on the drug's specific mechanism of action. Hyponatremia can be a potentially fatal side effect. Patients taking these medications need to be monitored closely for the signs and symptoms of hyponatremia. Acute hyponatremia, defined as developing in <48 hours, is more likely to show symptoms than chronic hyponatremia. Signs of acute hyponatremia include delirium, seizures, decerebrate posturing, and cerebral edema with uncal herniation. Chronic hyponatremia, defined as developing in >48 hours, can cause lethargy, dizziness, weakness, headache, nausea, and confusion. Hyponatremia is associated with longer hospital stays and increased mortality. Treatment varies based on the degree of severity of hyponatremia. Choosing a treatment option should include consideration of the drug causing the electrolyte disturbance, the patient's risk factor profile, and the severity of symptoms as they present in the individual patient. Healthcare providers should be aware of hyponatremia as a potential side effect of ASMs, the signs and symptoms of hyponatremia, the different treatment options available, and the potential complications associated with rapid correction of hyponatremia.
