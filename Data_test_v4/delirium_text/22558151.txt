22558151|t|The influence of spin-labeled fluorene compounds on the assembly and toxicity of the abeta peptide.
22558151|a|BACKGROUND: The deposition and oligomerization of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta peptide arises from cleavage of the membrane-associated domain of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta and gamma secretases. Several lines of evidence point to the soluble Abeta oligomer (AbetaO) as the primary neurotoxic species in the etiology of AD. Recently, we have demonstrated that a class of fluorene molecules specifically disrupts the AbetaO species. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To achieve a better understanding of the mechanism of action of this disruptive ability, we extend the application of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of site-directed spin labels in the Abeta peptide to investigate the binding and influence of fluorene compounds on AbetaO structure and dynamics. In addition, we have synthesized a spin-labeled fluorene (SLF) containing a pyrroline nitroxide group that provides both increased cell protection against AbetaO toxicity and a route to directly observe the binding of the fluorene to the AbetaO assembly. We also evaluate the ability of fluorenes to target multiple pathological processes involved in the neurodegenerative cascade, such as their ability to block AbetaO toxicity, scavenge free radicals and diminish the formation of intracellular AbetaO species. CONCLUSIONS: Fluorene modified with pyrroline nitroxide may be especially useful in counteracting Abeta peptide toxicity, because they possess both antioxidant properties and the ability to disrupt AbetaO species.
