Understanding lncRNA-protein interactions (LPIs) is vital for elucidating basic cellular processes, human diseases, viral replication, transcription, and plant pathogen resistance. Despite the development of several LPI calculation methods, predicting LPI remains challenging, with the selection of variables and deep learning structure being the focus of LPI research. METHODS: We propose a deep learning framework called AR-LPI, which extracts sequence and secondary structure features of proteins and lncRNAs. The framework utilizes an auto-encoder for feature extraction and employs SE-ResNet for prediction. Additionally, we apply transfer learning to the deep neural network SE-ResNet for predicting small-sample datasets. RESULTS: Through comprehensive experimental comparison, we demonstrate that the AR-LPI ar-chitecture performs better in LPI prediction. Specifically, the accuracy of AR-LPI increases by 2.86% to 94.52%, while the F-value of AR-LPI increases by 2.71% to 94.73%. CONCLUSION: Our experimental results show that the overall performance of AR-LPI is better than that of other LPI prediction tools.
