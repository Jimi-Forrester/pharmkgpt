33966489|t|Memory care approaches to better leverage capacity of dementia specialists: a narrative synthesis.
33966489|a|Prior research suggests that a scarcity of dementia specialists could hamper access to disease-modifying Alzheimer's treatments. We describe alternative approaches on how to leverage specialist time for memory care in this narrative synthesis based on 17 semi-structured interviews and a targeted literature review on memory care approaches that leverage specialist time. We identified four types of approaches: community primary care practices empowered with better tools and training; primary care memory clinics; specialty memory clinics and; specialty memory centers. Several approaches to use specialist time efficiently have been implemented and some but not all evaluated. The optimal approach may depend on the local context.
