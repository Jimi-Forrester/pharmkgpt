35736088|t|Biological Synthesis of Low Cytotoxicity Silver Nanoparticles (AgNPs) by the Fungus Chaetomium thermophilum-Sustainable Nanotechnology.
35736088|a|Fungal biotechnology research has rapidly increased as a result of the growing awareness of sustainable development and the pressing need to explore eco-friendly options. In the nanotechnology field, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are currently being studied for application in cancer therapy, tumour detection, drug delivery, and elsewhere. Therefore, synthesising nanoparticles (NPs) with low toxicity has become essential in the biomedical area. The fungus Chaetomium thermophilum (C. thermophilum) was here investigated-to the best of our knowledge, for the first time-for application in the production of AgNPs. Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) images demonstrated a spherical AgNP shape, with an average size of 8.93 nm. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) confirmed the presence of elemental silver. A neutral red uptake (NRU) test evaluated the cytotoxicity of the AgNPs at different inhibitory concentrations (ICs). A half-maximal concentration (IC50 = 119.69 microg/mL) was used to predict a half-maximal lethal dose (LD50 = 624.31 mg/kg), indicating a Global Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) acute toxicity estimate (ATE) classification category of 4. The fungus extract showed a non-toxic profile at the IC tested. Additionally, the interaction between the AgNPs and the Balb/c 3T3 NIH cells at an ultrastructural level resulted in preserved cells structures at non-toxic concentrations (IC20 = 91.77 microg/mL), demonstrating their potential as sustainable substitutes for physical and chemically made AgNPs. Nonetheless, at the IC50, the cytoplasm of the cells was damaged and mitochondrial morphological alteration was evident. This fact highlights the fact that dose-dependent phenomena are involved, as well as emphasising the importance of investigating NPs' effects on mitochondria, as disruption to this organelle can impact health.
