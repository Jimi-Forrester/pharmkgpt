34069993|t|Reviewing Evidence for the Relationship of EEG Abnormalities and RTT Phenotype Paralleled by Insights from Animal Studies.
34069993|a|Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder that is usually caused by mutations of the MECP2 gene. Patients with RTT suffer from severe deficits in motor, perceptual and cognitive domains. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has provided useful information to clinicians and scientists, from the very first descriptions of RTT, and yet no reliable neurophysiological biomarkers related to the pathophysiology of the disorder or symptom severity have been identified to date. To identify consistently observed and potentially informative EEG characteristics of RTT pathophysiology, and ascertain areas most worthy of further systematic investigation, here we review the literature for EEG abnormalities reported in patients with RTT and in its disease models. While pointing to some promising potential EEG biomarkers of RTT, our review identify areas of need to realize the potential of EEG including (1) quantitative investigation of promising clinical-EEG observations in RTT, e.g., shift of mu rhythm frequency and EEG during sleep; (2) closer alignment of approaches between patients with RTT and its animal models to strengthen the translational significance of the work (e.g., EEG measurements and behavioral states); (3) establishment of large-scale consortium research, to provide adequate Ns to investigate age and genotype effects.
