38317082|a|BACKGROUND: The contribution of the central nervous system to sepsis pathobiology is incompletely understood. In previous studies, administration of endotoxin to mice decreased activity of the vagus anti-inflammatory reflex. Treatment with the centrally-acting M1 muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (M1AChR) attenuated this endotoxin-mediated change. We hypothesize that decreased M1AChR-mediated activity contributes to inflammation following cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), a mouse model of sepsis. METHODS: In male C57Bl/6 mice, we quantified basal forebrain cholinergic activity (immunostaining), hippocampal neuronal activity, serum cytokine/chemokine levels (ELISA) and splenic cell subtypes (flow cytometry) at baseline, following CLP and following CLP in mice also treated with the M1AChR agonist xanomeline. RESULTS: At 48 h. post-CLP, activity in basal forebrain cells expressing choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) was half of that observed at baseline. Lower activity was also noted in the hippocampus, which contains projections from ChAT-expressing basal forebrain neurons. Serum levels of TNFalpha, IL-1beta, MIP-1alpha, IL-6, KC and G-CSF were higher post-CLP than at baseline. Post-CLP numbers of splenic macrophages and inflammatory monocytes, TNFalpha+ and ILbeta+ neutrophils and ILbeta+ monocytes were higher than baseline while numbers of central Dendritic Cells (cDCs), CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were lower. When, following CLP, mice were treated with xanomeline activity in basal forebrain ChAT-expressing neurons and in the hippocampus was significantly higher than in untreated animals. Post-CLP serum concentrations of TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and MIP-1alpha, but not of IL-6, KC and G-CSF, were significantly lower in xanomeline-treated mice than in untreated mice. Post-CLP numbers of splenic neutrophils, macrophages, inflammatory monocytes and TNFalpha+ neutrophils also were lower in xanomeline-treated mice than in untreated animals. Percentages of IL-1beta+ neutrophils, IL-1beta+ monocytes, cDCs, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were similar in xanomeline-treated and untreated post-CLP mice. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that M1AChR-mediated responses modulate CLP-induced alterations in serum levels of some, but not all, cytokines/chemokines and affected splenic immune response phenotypes.
