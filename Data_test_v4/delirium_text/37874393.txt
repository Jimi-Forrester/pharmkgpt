37874393|a|There are currently insufficient anthelmintic medications available for the treatment of toxocariasis. For instance, Albendazole (ABZ) is the preferred medication, but its effectiveness against tissue-dwelling parasites is limited. In addition, Metformin (MTF) is a widely used oral antidiabetic medication that is considered to be safe for treatment. This study aimed to investigate any potential effects of MTF, alone or in combination with ABZ, on mice infections caused by Toxocara canis (T. canis). The efficacy of the treatment was assessed in the acute and chronic phases of the infection by larval recovery and histopathological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical studies. The results showed that combined therapy significantly reduced larval counts in the liver, brain, and muscles and ameliorated hepatic and brain pathology. It reduced oxidative stress and TGF-beta mRNA expression and increased FGF21 levels in the liver. It decreased TNF-alpha levels and MMP-9 expression in the brain. In addition, it increased serum levels of IL-12 and IFN-gamma and decreased serum levels of IL-4 and IL-10. In the acute and chronic phases of the infection, the combined treatment was more effective than ABZ alone. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential role of MTF as an adjuvant in the treatment of experimental T. canis infection when administered with ABZ.
