38338968|a|The primary neuronal and astrocyte culture described here is from the stress-hyperreactive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) More Immobile (WMI) rat with premature aging-related memory deficit, and its nearly isogenic control, the Less Immobile (WLI) strain. Primary WMI hippocampal neurons and cortical astrocytes are significantly more sensitive to oxidative stress (OS) generated by administration of H2O2 compared to WLI cells as measured by the trypan blue cell viability assay. Intrinsic genetic vulnerability is also suggested by the decreased gene expression in WMI neurons of catalase (Cat), and in WMI cortical astrocytes of insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2), synuclein gamma (Sncg) and glutathione peroxidase 2 (Gpx2) compared to WLI. The expressions of several mitochondrial genes are dramatically increased in response to H2O2 treatment in WLI, but not in WMI cortical astrocytes. We propose that the vulnerability of WMI neurons to OS is due to the genetic differences between the WLI and WMI. Furthermore, the upregulation of mitochondrial genes may be a compensatory response to the generation of free radicals by OS in the WLIs, and this mechanism is disturbed in the WMIs. Thus, this pilot study suggests intrinsic vulnerabilities in the WMI hippocampal neurons and cortical astrocytes, and affirm the efficacy of this bimodal in vitro screening system for finding novel drug targets to prevent oxidative damage in illnesses.
