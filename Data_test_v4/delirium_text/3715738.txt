3715738|t|[Schizophrenia syndromes caused by infection].
3715738|a|Out of 908 patients with sepsis treated at the Republican Antisepsis Center, 19 presented with different schizophrenia syndromes (2 with acute delirium, 3 with encephalic manifestations, 3 with the amentive-catatonic form, the remainder with the amentive-depressive form). In 6 patients, psychic disorders preceded fever, in 3 patients, both conditions occurred simultaneously, and 9 developed psychosis in the presence of fever. In all the patients, with the exception of one, the diagnosis of sepsis was supported by repeated isolation of hecocultures of S. epidermidis (14 cases) and S. aureus (4 cases). The patients received antisepsis treatment. Two patients died and the rest 17 patients were cured of sepsis. The schizophrenic syndrome disappeared. No relapses were recorded with the exception of one female patient, in whom both sepsis and psychic disorders recurred. Later on, however, she also recovered.
