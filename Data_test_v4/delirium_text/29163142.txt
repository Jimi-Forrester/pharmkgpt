29163142|t|Low Serum Phosphorus Correlates with Cerebral Abeta Deposition in Cognitively Impaired Subjects: Results from the KBASE Study.
29163142|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by progressive cognitive decline, is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the elderly. Cerebral beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition is the major pathological hallmark of AD. Recent studies also have shown that the serum level of phosphorus correlates to the risk of incident dementia. To date, the linkage between cerebral Abeta deposition and the serum phosphorus level remains unknown. In this study, we analyzed the levels of serum phosphorus in 109 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 73 AD dementia (ADD) subjects. All subjects underwent Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) imaging to measure cerebral Abeta deposition. The results with Abeta deposition was compared with the serum levels of phosphorus. The subjects with cerebral Abeta deposition showed lower levels of serum phosphorus than those without Abeta deposition. Furthermore, multiple regression analyses showed that a low level of serum phosphorus correlated with cerebral Abeta deposition, even when age, sex, apolipoprotein E epsilon4 genotype, and MMSE z-score were controlled for. Serum levels of other ions, including calcium, iron, zinc, and copper, showed no such correlation. In conclusion, our results suggest that the serum level of phosphorus may be used as an easily accessible blood biomarker for cerebral Abeta deposition in a cognitively impaired population.
