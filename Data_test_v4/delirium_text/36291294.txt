36291294|t|Cardiorespiratory Fitness as a Moderator of Sleep-Related Associations with Hippocampal Volume and Cognition.
36291294|a|The objective of this study was to understand the associations of sleep and cardiorespiratory fitness with hippocampal volume and global cognition among older adults (n = 30, age = 65.8 years, female = 73.3%). Wrist actigraphy provided objective measures of nighttime sleep including sleep duration, average wake bout length (WBL; sleep disturbance), and wake-to-sleep transition probability (WTSP; sleep consolidation). Cardiorespiratory fitness was quantified via cycle exercise using a modified heart rate recovery approach. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine hippocampal volume and the Mini-Mental State Examination was used to assess global cognition. Fitness moderated associations of sleep with hippocampal volume and cognitive performance, whereby the association of WBL-an index of poor sleep-with hippocampal atrophy was stronger among less-fit individuals, and the association of sleep duration with cognitive performance was stronger among more-fit individuals. Across the fitness levels, a longer WBL was associated with lower cognitive performance, and a higher WTSP-an index of more consolidated sleep-was associated with greater hippocampal volume. Sleep and fitness were unrelated to the volume of an amygdala control region, suggesting a degree of neuroanatomical specificity. In conclusion, higher cardiorespiratory fitness may attenuate sleep disturbance-related hippocampal atrophy and magnify the cognitive benefits of good sleep. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.
