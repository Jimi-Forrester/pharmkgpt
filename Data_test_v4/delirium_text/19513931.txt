19513931|a|The purpose of this project was to assess the effects of spaced-retrieval training (SRT) on learning of new and previously known associations by individuals with dementia in two treatment conditions: one in which the recall intervals were filled with activities unrelated to the information being learned (unrelated condition) and one in which the intervals were filled with related activities (related condition). Thirty-two individuals with mild to moderate dementia (30 with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease; two with vascular dementia) participated in the study. On average, participants learned the associations in fewer than four sessions and retained the information for variable amounts of time, up to 6 weeks. Previously known associations were learned significantly faster than new associations. The modified SRT format, in which the within-session recall intervals were filled with information related to the target association, did not result in faster learning or longer retention of learned associations. Participants learned previously known associations in the standard SRT format (with unrelated information in the recall intervals) significantly faster than new associations taught in the modified SRT condition. Cognitive impairment, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination, was significantly correlated with time to learn new associations, but did not explain a large proportion of the variance in new learning. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.
