37296571|t|Astrocytes: Dissecting Their Diverse Roles in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Dementia.
37296571|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are fatal neurodegenerative disorders often co-occurring in the same patient, a feature that suggests a common origin of the two diseases. Consistently, pathological inclusions of the same proteins as well as mutations in the same genes can be identified in both ALS/FTD. Although many studies have described several disrupted pathways within neurons, glial cells are also regarded as crucial pathogenetic contributors in ALS/FTD. Here, we focus our attention on astrocytes, a heterogenous population of glial cells that perform several functions for optimal central nervous system homeostasis. Firstly, we discuss how post-mortem material from ALS/FTD patients supports astrocyte dysfunction around three pillars: neuroinflammation, abnormal protein aggregation, and atrophy/degeneration. Furthermore, we summarize current attempts at monitoring astrocyte functions in living patients using either novel imaging strategies or soluble biomarkers. We then address how astrocyte pathology is recapitulated in animal and cellular models of ALS/FTD and how we used these models both to understand the molecular mechanisms driving glial dysfunction and as platforms for pre-clinical testing of therapeutics. Finally, we present the current clinical trials for ALS/FTD, restricting our discussion to treatments that modulate astrocyte functions, directly or indirectly.
