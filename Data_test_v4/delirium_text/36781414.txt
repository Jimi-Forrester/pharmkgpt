36781414|a|OBJECTIVE: Stroke can cause cognitive impairment, which can lead to challenges returning to day-to-day activities. Knowing what factors are associated with cognitive impairment post-stroke can be useful for predicting outcomes and guiding rehabilitation. One such factor is gender: previous studies are inconclusive as to whether gender influences cognitive outcomes post-stroke. Accounting for key variables, we examined whether there are gender differences in cognitive outcomes after stroke. METHOD: We analyzed data from neuropsychological assessments of 237 individuals tested in the chronic epoch (>= 3 months) following ischemic stroke. Using ANCOVA and linear mixed modeling, we examined gender as a predictor of cognition as measured by general cognitive ability (g), Full-Scale IQ, and 18 cognitive tests, controlling for age at stroke onset, education, premorbid intelligence, and lesion volume. RESULTS: There were no significant gender differences in overall cognitive outcomes as measured by g (p = .887) or Full-Scale IQ (p = .801). There were some significant gender differences on specific cognitive tests, with women outperforming men on scores from the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (ps < .01) and men outperforming women on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Arithmetic and Information subtests (ps < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that men and women have similar overall cognitive outcomes after stroke, when demographic and lesion factors are accounted for. Although men and women differed in their performance on some individual cognitive tests, neither gender performed systematically better or worse. However, for learning, working memory, and verbal knowledge/comprehension, gender may be an important predictor of outcome post-stroke.
