36531644|a|In the present study, we have done a comparative study on the efficacy of some currently used repurposed drugs: Oseltamivir (O), Favipiravir (F) and Hydroxychloroquine (H) in individual and in their combinational mode against CoV-2 infections. The ADME analysis has helped us to identify the inhibitory possibility of the tested drugs towards receptor 3CLpro protein of SARS-CoV-2. Various thermodynamical parameters obtained from Molecular Docking, Molecular dynamics (MD) and MMPBSA simulations like binding affinity, potential energy (Epot), RMSD, RMSF, SASA energy, interaction energies, Gibbs free energy (DeltaGbind) etc. also helped us to verify the effectivity of mentioned drugs against CoV-2 protease.
