30315550|a|Alzheimer's disease, a type of dementia, affects memory, behavior, and cognitive processes in affected individuals. It is one of the prominent diseases, accounting for 60-80% of dementia cases and affecting a significant population of persons over the age of 65 years. While rare, Alzheimer's disease (AD) may affect the younger population as well. With such a widespread number of persons affected with AD, scientists have undertaken the initiative to develop a cure for this devastating disease; however, it has been deemed quite challenging. A dysfunctional blood-brain barrier, with impaired ability to clear amyloid-beta from the brain, has been directly linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease. The blood-brain barrier restricts the flow of many substances into and out of the brain and serves as a selective and protective barrier to the brain. A proper functioning blood-brain barrier contributes to the maintenance and integrity of the brain. In turn, different systems and mechanisms within the blood-brain barrier are set in place to facilitate mediated passage of materials and substances between the brain and the bloodstream. In relation to AD, the mediation of amyloid-beta clearance is of great importance in maintaining the blood-brain barrier's integrity.
