39428255|t|Factors Affecting Delirium Care Core Competency Among Nurses: A Descriptive Correlational Study.
39428255|a|Nurses require optimal competency to deliver safe and high-quality care to patients with delirium. However, the factors influencing delirium care core competency remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the factors influencing core competency in delirium care among nurses. This study was conducted as a descriptive correlational study following the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines. A convenience sample of 202 Korean nurses from 15 hospitals completed a structured, web-based, self-administered questionnaire. The survey covered general characteristics, delirium care knowledge, moral sensitivity, barriers to delirium care, and core competency in delirium care. Multiple regression analysis identified the factors affecting core competency in delirium care. Results showed that barriers to delirium care, moral sensitivity, academic qualifications, and clinical ladder level were significant factors, accounting for 18.1% of the variance in delirium care core competency. To improve delirium care among nurses, using individual, team, and organizational approaches to address perceived barriers and moral sensitivity is crucial. Competency-based training programs and administrative support are crucial for enhancing the competency of nurses who are novices and those with associate degrees.
