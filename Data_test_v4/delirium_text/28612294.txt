28612294|t|The Potential Role of BMAA in Neurodegeneration.
28612294|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are a major public health issue throughout the world with devastating effects on patients and families. Sporadic forms of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are generally thought to develop as a consequence of genetic susceptibility and environmental influences. A number of environmental triggers have been identified in association with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. We discuss the role of beta-methylamino-L-alanine in the development of neurodegeneration and the potential importance of this neurotoxin as a risk for neurodegeneration.
