38083439|t|Predictive Modeling Of Alzheimer's Disease Prognosis Using Anatomical & Diffusion MRI.
38083439|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between healthy aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects around 50 million people worldwide. As new AD treatments begin to be developed, one key goal of AD research is to predict which individuals with MCI are most likely to progress to AD over a given interval (such as 2 years); if successful, these individuals could be preferentially enrolled in drug trials that aim to slow AD progression. Here we benchmarked a range of MCI-to-AD predictive models including linear regressions, support vector machines, and random forests, using predictors from anatomical and diffusion-weighted brain MRI, age, sex, APOE genotype and standardized clinical scores. In evaluations on 2,448 subjects (1,132 MCI, 883 healthy controls, 433 with dementia) from the ADNI study, models including PCA-compacted features achieved a balanced accuracy of 75.3% (using cortical features) and 89.7% using diffusion MRI measures on test set, suggesting the added prognostic value of microstructural metrics obtainable with diffusion MRI.
