28875553|a|Nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptors (nAChR's) have been implicated in several brain disorders, including addiction, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Here we report in vitro selectivity and functional properties, toxicity in rats, in vivo evaluation in humans, and comparison across species of [18 F]Nifene, a fast acting PET imaging agent for alpha4beta2* nAChRs. Nifene had subnanomolar affinities for halpha2beta2 (0.34 nM), halpha3beta2 (0.80 nM) and halpha4beta2 (0.83 nM) nAChR but weaker (27-219 nM) for hbeta4 nAChR subtypes and 169 nM for halpha7 nAChR. In functional assays, Nifene (100 muM) exhibited 14% agonist and >50% antagonist characteristics. In 14-day acute toxicity in rats, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) were estimated to exceed 40 mug/kg/day (278 mug/m2 /day). In human PET studies, [18 F]Nifene (185 MBq; <0.10 mug) was well tolerated with no adverse effects. Distribution volume ratios (DVR) of [18 F]Nifene in white matter thalamic radiations were ~1.6 (anterior) and ~1.5 (superior longitudinal fasciculus). Habenula known to contain alpha3beta2 nAChR exhibited low levels of [18 F]Nifene binding while the red nucleus with alpha2beta2 nAChR had DVR ~1.6-1.7. Females had higher [18 F]Nifene binding in all brain regions, with thalamus showing >15% than males. No significant aging effect was observed in [18 F]Nifene binding over 5 decades. In all species (mice, rats, monkeys, and humans) thalamus showed highest [18 F]Nifene binding with reference region ratios >2 compared to extrathalamic regions. Our findings suggest that [18 F]Nifene PET may be used to study alpha4beta2* nAChRs in various CNS disorders and for translational research.
