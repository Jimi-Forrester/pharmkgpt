38161929|t|The Challenges of Pain Assessment in Geriatric Patients With Dementia: A Review.
38161929|a|Pain in dementia patients is common, poorly measured, and undertreated. It is important to discuss the challenges in the pain assessment and management to find a possible solution for adequate pain management. The aim of this article is to discuss the challenges in the assessment of pain in geriatric patients with dementia. An extensive online database search was conducted via multiple websites using the following keywords: "dementia," "pain assessments," "pain assessment with dementia," "causes of pain with dementia," "pain assessments using recent technology," "geriatric," and "old age" to identify the relevant articles. Our inclusion criteria were articles that focused on pain in geriatric patients diagnosed with dementia, in English, published between January 2018 and January 2023, and available as free full text and those which were clinical trials, observational studies, review articles, systemic reviews, meta-analysis, or case series. The exclusion criteria were articles that did not have pain in geriatric patients diagnosed with dementia as their primary focus, involving geriatric or non-geriatric patients with major psychological distress, not in the English language, not published between January 2018 and January 2023, and not available as free full-text and those which were case reports and editorial articles. After manually excluding the articles that did not meet our inclusion criteria, we ended up with 38 articles. In conclusion, any instruments have been made for the pain assessment in patients with dementia. The two most common tools used to assess pain in this vulnerable population are the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD) and Pain Assessment Checklist for Seniors with Limited Ability to Communicate (PACSLAC) scales. The utilization of new technology may offer promising solutions for the pain assessment in patients with dementia.
