37833762|a|BACKGROUND: Development of in vivo biomarkers has shifted the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the later dementia stages of disease towards the earlier stages and has introduced the potential for pre-symptomatic diagnosis. The International Working Group recommends that AD diagnosis is restricted in the clinical setting to people with specific AD phenotypes and supportive biomarker findings. MAIN BODY: In this review, we discuss the phenotypic presentation and use of biomarkers for the early diagnosis of typical and atypical AD and describe how this can support clinical decision making, benefit patient communication, and improve the patient journey. Early diagnosis is essential to optimize the benefits of available and emerging treatments. As atypical presentations of AD often mimic other dementias, differential diagnosis can be challenging and can be facilitated using AD biomarkers. However, AD biomarkers alone are not sufficient to confidently diagnose AD or predict disease progression and should be supplementary to clinical assessment to help inform the diagnosis of AD. CONCLUSIONS: Use of AD biomarkers with incorporation of atypical AD phenotypes into diagnostic criteria will allow earlier diagnosis of patients with atypical clinical presentations that otherwise would have been misdiagnosed and treated inappropriately. Early diagnosis is essential to guide informed discussion, appropriate care and support, and individualized treatment. It is hoped that disease-modifying treatments will impact the underlying AD pathology; thus, determining the patient's AD phenotype will be a critical factor in guiding the therapeutic approach and the assessment of the effects of interventions.
