38160618|t|Synthesis and evaluation of butylphthalide-scutellarein hybrids as multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
38160618|a|A series of butylphthalide and scutellarein hybrids 3-(alkyl/alkenyl) hydroxyphthalide derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated as multifunctional agents against Alzheimer's disease. In vitro bioactivity assays indicated that most of the compounds displayed excellent antioxidant activity and moderate to good inhibition activities of self-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation. Among them, compound 7c was demonstrated as a potential and balanced multifunctional candidate displaying the best inhibitory effects on self- and Cu2+-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation (90.2 % and 35.4 %, respectively) and moderate activity for disaggregation of Abeta1-42 aggregation (42.5 %). In addition, 7c also displayed excellent antioxidant (2.42 Trolox equivalents), metal ions chelating, oxidative stress alleviation, neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammatory activities. Furthermore, in vivo study demonstrated that 7c could ameliorate the learning and memory impairment induced by sodium nitrite and Abeta1-42 in the step-down passive avoidance test. These balanced multifunctional profiles supporting compound 7c as a novel potential candidate for the treatment of AD.
