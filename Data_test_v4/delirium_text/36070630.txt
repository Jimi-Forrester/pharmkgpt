36070630|t|Rational design of molecular rotor-based fluorescent probes with bi-aromatic rings for efficient in vivo detection of amyloid-beta plaques in Alzheimer's disease.
36070630|a|The presence of Abeta plaques in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we designed and synthesized a series of molecular rotors with various bi-aromatic rings and investigated their applications as near-infrared (NIR) probes for Abeta plaques. We found that the interaction with Abeta aggregates hindered the rotational freedom of the molecular rotors, which brought about a noticeable enhancement in fluorescence intensity. Among them, probe 4b (Kd = 8.5 nM) with a phenyl-pyridine ring showed a 98-fold increase in fluorescence intensity upon binding with Abeta aggregates. In addition, 4b could identify Abeta plaques in brain sections of both a transgenic (Tg) mouse and AD patients. Furthermore, 4b could readily penetrate the mouse blood-brain barrier (brain2min = 10.11% ID/g) and washed out rapidly. Finally, the NIR imaging with Tg mice confirmed the practical application of 4b in detecting Abeta plaques in vivo. Altogether, our work widens the landscape of Abeta NIR probes and offers a new tool for Abeta detection.
