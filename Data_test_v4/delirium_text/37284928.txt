37284928|t|The Efficacy and Safety of Parecoxib Multimodal Preemptive Analgesia in Artificial Joint Replacement: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.
37284928|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative pain after artificial joint replacement is intense and remains an unsolved problem. Some studies have shown that parecoxib can provide better analgesia in postoperative multimodal analgesia, however, doubts arise about whether its multimodal preemptive analgesia can reduce postoperative pain. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the impact of preoperative injection of parecoxib on postoperative pain in patients undergoing artificial joint replacement. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING: Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP, Wangfang databases were searched to identify relevant randomized controlled trials. The last search was in May 2022. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials of efficacy and adverse reactions of intra-operative and postoperative injection of parecoxib in artificial joint replacement were collected. The primary outcome was postoperative visual analog scale scores and the secondary outcomes included cumulative postoperative opioid consumption and incidence of adverse reactions. Using the Cochrane systematic review method to screen the studies, evaluate the quality of the included studies, and extract feature information, RevMan 5.4 software performs a meta-analysis of the corresponding research indicators. RESULTS: In total, nine studies were involved in the meta-analysis with 667 patients. The trial and control group were given the same dose of parecoxib or placebo at the same time point before and after surgery. The results showed that compared with the control group, the trial group is associated with substantially reduced visual analog scale scores in 24, 48 h at rest (P < 0.05), visual analog scale scores in 24, 48, 72 h at movement (P < 0.05), dose of opioid need in trial group is notably lower than that in control group (P < 0.05), but shows no obvious effect on visual analog scale scores in 72 h at rest, and adverse events (P > 0.05). LIMITATIONS: The major limitation of this meta-analysis relates to some low-quality studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support parecoxib multimodal preemptive analgesia in reducing postoperative acute pain in hip and knee replacement patients, and reduces cumulative opioid consumption without increasing the risk of adverse drug events. Its multimodal preemptive analgesia is safe and effective in hip and knee replacement. PROSPERO REGISTRATION: CRD42022379672.
