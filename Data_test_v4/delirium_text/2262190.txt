2262190|a|Clomethiazol (Distraneurin) has decisively improved our therapeutic possibilities in delirium tremens. Furthermore, it has acquired a certain degree of importance in the treatment of agitation and sleep disorders in geronto-psychiatric patients. In the meantime, owing to the fact that doctors have been too ready to prescribe it for indications other than those mentioned above, a level of abuse of this substance--which has the potential for both psychological and physical dependence--has reached a point at which its usefulness threatens to become eclipsed.
