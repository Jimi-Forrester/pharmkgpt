38755685|a|BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative joint disease causing limited mobility and pain, with no curative treatment available. Recent in vivo studies suggested autonomic alterations during OA progression in patients, yet clinical evidence is scarce. Therefore, autonomic tone was analyzed in OA patients via heart rate variability (HRV) measurements. METHODS: Time-domain (SDRR, RMSSD, pRR50) and frequency-domain (LF, HF, LF/HF) HRV indices were determined to quantify sympathetic and parasympathetic activities. In addition, perceived stress, WOMAC pain as well as serum catecholamines, cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEA-S) were analyzed. The impact of the grade of disease (GoD) was evaluated by linear regression analysis and correlations with clinical data were performed. RESULTS: GoD significantly impacted the autonomic tone in OA patients. All time-domain parameters reflected slightly decreased HRV in early OA patients and significantly reduced HRV in late OA patients. Moreover, frequency-domain analysis revealed decreased HF and LF power in all OA patients, reflecting diminished parasympathetic and sympathetic activities. However, LF/HF ratio was significantly higher in early OA patients compared to late OA patients and implied a clear sympathetic dominance. Furthermore, OA patients perceived significantly higher chronic stress and WOMAC pain levels compared to healthy controls. Serum cortisol and cortisol/DHEA-S ratio significantly increased with GoD and positively correlated with WOMAC pain. In contrast, serum catecholamines only trended to increase with GoD and pain level. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study provides compelling evidence of an autonomic dysfunction with indirect sympathetic dominance in early and late knee OA patients for the first time based on HRV analyses and further confirmed by serum stress hormone measurements. Increased sympathetic activity and chronic low-grade inflammation in OA as well as in its major comorbidities reinforce each other and might therefore create a vicious cycle. The observed autonomic alterations coupled with increased stress and pain levels highlight the potential of HRV as a prognostic marker. In addition, modulation of autonomic activity represents an attractive future therapeutic option.
