33050925|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by progressive degeneration and loss of neurons in specific regions of the central nervous system. Chronic activation of the immune cells resident in the brain, peripheral immune cell trafficking across the blood-brain barrier, and release of inflammatory and neurotoxic factors, appear critical contributors of the neuroinflammatory response that drives the progression of neurodegenerative processes in AD. As the neuro-immune network is impaired in course of AD, this review is aimed to point out the essential supportive role of innate and adaptive immune response either in normal brain as well as in brain recovery from injury. Since a fine-tuning of the immune response appears crucial to ensure proper nervous system functioning, we focused on the role of the TNF superfamily member, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which modulates both the innate and adaptive immune response in the pathogenesis of several immunological disorders and, in particular, in AD-related neuroinflammation. We here summarized mounting evidence of potential involvement of TRAIL signaling in AD pathogenesis, with the aim to provide clearer insights about potential novel therapeutic approaches in AD.
