38152796|t|A Unique Case of Adult-Onset Still's Disease Not Responsive to Steroid Treatment.
38152796|a|A 53-year-old patient was admitted to the emergency department, presenting with fever, generalized weakness, and various myalgias and arthralgias lasting over seven days. Based upon the patient's worsening symptoms, elevated white blood cell count with neutrophilia and overall presentation, she was initially treated for an infectious cause and prescribed various antibiotics and antipyretic medications. As the patient's condition continued to worsen throughout the initial days of her intake, she was tested for a variety of infections, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Streptococcus, and influenza, and was administered a viral respiratory panel, all of which resulted negative. Upon the development of an evanescent rash on hospital day 9, as well as other symptoms including sore throat, arthritis, and an elevated fever present for over a week, a rheumatology consult now expressed concern for a possible case of Adult-Onset Still's Disease (AOSD). In line with the current treatment used for AOSD and the absence of all other infectious causes, the patient discontinued antibiotic treatment and was started on 125 milligrams of intravenous methylprednisolone every six hours. The patient showed minor improvements in symptoms over the next 24 hours but soon became refractory to treatment, resulting from multiorgan damage, and expired on hospital day 13.
