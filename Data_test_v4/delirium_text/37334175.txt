37334175|t|Physical restraint within the prehospital Emergency Medical Care Environment: A scoping review.
37334175|a|Background: Psychomotor agitation and aggressive behaviour (AAB) have the potential to occur in any healthcare setting, including those in which Emergency Medical Services (EMS) operate. This scoping review aimed to examine the available literature on physical restraint of patients within the prehospital setting and to identify guidelines and their effectiveness, safety to patients and health care practitioners and strategies relating to physical restraint when used by EMS. Methods: We performed our scoping review using the methodological framework described by Arksey and O'Malley augmented by that of Sucharew and Macaluso. Several steps guided the review process: identification of the research question, eligibility criteria, information sources (CINAHL, Medline, Cochrane and Scopus), search, selection and data collection, ethical approval, collation, summarizing and reporting on the results. Results: The population of interest, in this scoping review was prehospital physically restrained patients, however, there was a reduced research focus on this population in comparison to the larger emergency department. Conclusion: The limitation of informed consent from incapacitated patients may relate to the lack of prospective real-world research from previous and future studies. Future research should focus on patient management, adverse events, practitioner risk, policy, and education within the prehospital setting.
