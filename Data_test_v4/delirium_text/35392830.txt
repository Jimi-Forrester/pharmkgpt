35392830|a|BACKGROUND: Older adults frequently experience fall-related injuries, including hip fractures. Following a hip fracture, patients receive care across a number of settings and from multiple different providers. Transitions between providers and across settings have been noted as a vulnerable time, with potentially negative impacts. Currently, there is limited research on how to improve experiences with transitions in care following a hip fracture for older adults from the perspectives of those with lived experienced. The purpose of this study was to explore service recommendations made by patients, caregivers, healthcare providers, and decision-makers for improving transitions in care for older adults with hip fracture. METHODS: This descriptive qualitative study was part of a larger longitudinal qualitative multiple case study. Participants included older adults with hip fracture, caregivers supporting an individual with hip fracture, healthcare providers, and decision-makers. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with all participants, with patients and caregivers having the opportunity to participate in follow-up interviews as they transitioned out of hospital. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed thematically. RESULTS: A total of 47 participants took part in 65 interviews. We identified three main categories of recommendations: (1) hospital-based recommendations; (2) community-based recommendations; and (3) cross-sectoral based recommendations. Hospital-based recommendations focused on treating patients and families with respect, improving the consistency, frequency, and comprehensiveness of communication between hospital providers and between providers and families, and increasing staffing levels. Community-based recommendations included the early identification of at-risk individuals and providing preventative and educational programs. Cross-sectoral based recommendations were grounded in enhanced system navigation through communication and care navigators, particularly within primary and community care settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlighted the central role primary care can play in providing targeted, integrated services for older adults with hip fracture. The recommendations outlined have the potential to improve experiences with care transitions for older adults with hip fracture, and thus, addressing and acting on them should be a priority.
