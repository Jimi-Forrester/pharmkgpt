6221327|t|[Acute rhabdomyolysis in alcoholic patients].
6221327|a|Six episodes of acute rhabdomyolysis were observed within a two-year period in 5 male adult alcoholic patients hospitalised in a hepatology intensive care unit. Painful muscle swelling was discrete of absent in 4 of the 5 patients. Acute rhabdomyolysis was preceded by grand mal seizures in 4 patients, delirium tremens in 1 and high fever with shivers in 3. All cases were rapidly diagnosed on the finding of very high serum creatinine phosphokinase levels. One patient developed acute respiratory failure and recovered after prolonged mechanical ventilation. Three patients had acute renal failure with severe hyperkalemia in one but none required dialysis. Three patients died within 2 to 6 days of the diagnosis, but the deaths were not directly related to rhabdomyolysis. It would appear that in alcoholic patients: the prevalence of rhabdomyolysis is probably underestimated; any muscular hyperactivity as seen in seizures, delirium tremens and prolonged shivers may be a precipitating factor; the condition is easily diagnosed by measuring serum creatinine kinase activity; some cases of acute renal failure in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis might be explained by acute rhabdomyolysis with minimal symptoms.
