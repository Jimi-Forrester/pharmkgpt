24372615|a|The self-assembly of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide of 39-43 amino acids into senile plaques is one hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. While A2 V carriers remain healthy in the heterozygous state, they suffer from early onset AD in the homozygous state. As a first toward understanding the impact of A2 V on Abeta at its earlier stage, we characterized the equilibrium ensemble of the Abeta1-28 wild type and Abeta1-28 A2 V monomers by means of extensive atomistic replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. While global conformational properties such as the radius of gyration and the average secondary structure content of the whole peptides are very similar, the population of beta-hairpins is increased by a factor of 4 in A2 V, and this may explain the enhanced Abeta1-40 A2 V aggregation kinetics with respect to Abeta1-40 wild type. Both peptides display a non-negligible population of extended metastable conformations differing however in their atomic details that represent ideal seeds for polymerization. Remarkably, upon A2 V mutation, the intrinsic disorder of Abeta1-28 monomer is reduced by a factor of 2, and the free energy landscape is completely different. This difference in the conformational ensembles of the two peptides may explain in part why the mixture of the Abeta40 WT and A2 V peptides protects against AD.
