8059176|t|[Contribution of morphological imaging in the diagnosis of dementia. I--Alzheimer disease].
8059176|a|In patients with Alzheimer's disease, morphological neuroimaging techniques usually reveal signs of global cerebral atrophy which gradually worsen over time and depends on age and severity of the cognitive decline. Because of the lack of artifacts and of a more appropriate angle, magnetic resonance imaging scans may visualize a prominent atrophy of the medial temporal lobes, including hippocampal structures. Hippocampal atrophy is relatively specific of Alzheimer's disease before 65 and is related to the severity of memory disorders. White matter changes in patients without cerebrovascular risk factors are not more severe in patients with presenile Alzheimer's disease than in age-matched controls. They are, however, more severe in patients with senile onset than in age-matched controls. These findings suggest that white matter changes in patients with senile onset are consistent with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
