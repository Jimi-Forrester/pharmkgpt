39595025|t|Potential Applications and Ethical Considerations for Artificial Intelligence in Traumatic Brain Injury Management.
39595025|a|Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have emerged as promising tools for rapidly identifying patterns in large amounts of healthcare data to help guide clinical decision making, as well as to assist with medical education and the planning of research studies. Accumulating evidence suggests AI techniques may be particularly useful for aiding the diagnosis and clinical management of traumatic brain injury (TBI)-a considerably heterogeneous neurologic condition that can be challenging to detect and treat. However, important methodological and ethical concerns with the use of AI in medicine necessitate close monitoring and regulation of these techniques as advancements continue. The purpose of this narrative review is to provide an overview of common AI techniques in medical research and describe recent studies on the possible clinical applications of AI in the context of TBI. Finally, the review describes the ethical challenges with the use of AI in medicine, as well as guidelines from the White House, the Department of Defense (DOD), the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), and other organizations on the appropriate uses of AI in research.
