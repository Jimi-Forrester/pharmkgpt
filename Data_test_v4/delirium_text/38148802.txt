38148802|a|Vibrio parahaemolyticus is distributed worldwide in seafood such as fish, shrimp, and shellfish and is a major cause of seafood-borne diarrhoeal disease. Previous studies have reported infections contacting with contaminated seafood seawater. So far, 11 cases reported of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) caused by V. parahaemolyticus, which 5 patients died and 6 survived. We found that transmission through contact with contaminated water also causes infection. We report a 46-year-old male contracted V. parahaemolyticus after being splashed with market sewage. His condition deteriorated rapidly and he died eventually, suggesting that more atypical modes of V. parahaemolyticus transmission may be possible in the future. Literature review revealed that SSTIs due to V. parahaemolyticus are rare, so, detailed questioning of the patient's exposure history can help with empirical drug administration early. Patients with immunodeficiency disease and progressive blistering need mandatory debridement urgently. If fascial necrosis is found during debridement, early amputation may save the patient's life.
