36831738|t|Genetic and Epigenetic Sexual Dimorphism of Brain Cells during Aging.
36831738|a|In recent years, much of the attention paid to theoretical and applied biomedicine, as well as neurobiology, has been drawn to various aspects of sexual dimorphism due to the differences that male and female brain cells demonstrate during aging: (a) a dimorphic pattern of response to therapy for neurodegenerative disorders, (b) different age of onset and different degrees of the prevalence of such disorders, and (c) differences in their symptomatic manifestations in men and women. The purpose of this review is to outline the genetic and epigenetic differences in brain cells during aging in males and females. As a result, we hereby show that the presence of brain aging patterns in males and females is due to a complex of factors associated with the effects of sex chromosomes, which subsequently entails a change in signal cascades in somatic cells.
