39035691|a|Background and aim: Hypoxia of the cartilage has been considered as a potential pathogenic factor in knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Studies have shown that impaired blood perfusion of joint leads to cartilage hypoxia. Electroacupuncture (EA) has proven effects on pain relief and improving microcirculation. This study aimed to explore the effect of EA on articular microcirculation and cartilage anoxic and the underlying mechanisms. Procedures: Videman's method was used for 6 weeks to establish the KOA model. EA intervention was performed in four points around the knee for 3 weeks after KOA modeling. The Lequesne MG score was used to assess ethology. We recorded the oxygen tension of synovial fluid and the synovial microcirculation in vivo. HE-staining was used to assess cartilage morphology, and immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western blotting, and RT-PCR were used to assess expression of the major glycolytic enzymes glucosetransporter1 (GLUT1), pyruvate kinase M2(PKM2), and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) was used to detect lactate content. Results and conclusion: There was a significant decrease in Lequesne MG score and improvement in Mankin score after EA intervention (P < 0.01), a significant increase in synovial microcirculation (P < 0.05) and synovial fluid oxygen tension (P < 0.01), and there was significant decrease in the expression of GLUT1, PKM2 and LDHA (P < 0.01) and lactate (P < 0.05). This study suggested that EA ameliorate cartilage hypoxia and regulate glycolytic metabolism in chondrocytes in KOA model rabbits by improving articular microcirculation and oxygen tension.
