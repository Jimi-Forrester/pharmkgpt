37928414|t|Assessing objective cognitive impairments in cancer survivors: Features and validity of measures for research and clinical applications.
37928414|a|Objective: This narrative review aims to (1) identify neuropsychological tests for assessing cognitive function impairment in patients with cancer, specifically in the domains of attention and memory, (2) summarize the characteristics of these tests, including cognitive function domains, test content, readability, and psychometric quality, and (3) evaluate the feasibility of each test in cancer care. Methods: Data sources include published test manuals, documents from official web pages, and published journal articles. Results: Our study identified eight neuropsychological tests that are most frequently used to assess the attention and memory domains of objective cognitive function in patients with breast cancer. These tests include the California Verbal Learning Test, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure, CNS Vital Signs, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Wechsler Memory Scale, and Trail Making Test. They demonstrate acceptable evidence of psychometric quality and varying degrees of feasibility. Test feasibility is influenced by factors such as short testing time, brevity and comprehensiveness, clear cognitive domain distinctions, availability of normative data, minimal practice effects, ease of administration, and limited attention-span requirements. These attributes determine a test's feasibility for use in cancer care. Among the evaluated measures, the California Verbal Learning Test for memory, the Trail Making Test for attention, and the CNS Vital Signs for comprehensive assessment emerge as the most practical choices for cancer care. Conclusions: The assessment and management of cognitive function impairment are crucial for enhancing the quality of life in cancer survivors. Nurses should possess knowledge of assessment tools for early detection and the ongoing monitoring of this symptom's progression.
