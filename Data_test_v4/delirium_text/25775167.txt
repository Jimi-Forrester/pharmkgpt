Several trials focus on this stage and use biomarkers to include Abeta-positive participants, but an even earlier prevention of Abeta accumulation may be an effective treatment strategy. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether people who appear to be Abeta negative but are at high risk for Abeta positivity within the near future can be identified. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal biomarker cohort study involving 35 cognitively healthy individuals who underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling for up to 3 years during the study (October 24, 2005, to September 1, 2014). All participants had normal CSF Abeta42 levels at baseline. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Predictors of future Abeta positivity (levels of CSF Abeta42 declining below a previously validated cutoff level of 192 ng/L) tested by random forest models. Tested predictors included levels of protein in the CSF, hippocampal volume, genetics, demographics, and cognitive scores. RESULTS: The CSF Abeta42 levels declined in 11 participants, and the CSF became Abeta positive. The baseline CSF Abeta42 level was a strong predictor of future positivity (accuracy, 79% [95% CI, 70%-87%]). Ten of 11 decliners had baseline CSF Abeta42 levels in the lower tertile of the reference range (<225 ng/L), and 22 of 24 nondecliners had baseline CSF Abeta42 levels in the upper 2 tertiles (>=225 ng/L). A high CSF P-tau level was associated with decline (accuracy, 68%; 95% CI, 55%-81%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Baseline CSF Abeta42 levels in the lower part of the reference range are strongly associated with future Abeta positivity. This finding can be used in trials on very early prevention of Alzheimer disease to identify people at high risk for Abeta accumulation as defined by low CSF Abeta42 levels.
