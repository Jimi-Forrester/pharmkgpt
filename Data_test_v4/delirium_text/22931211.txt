22931211|t|beta-Secretase (BACE1) inhibitory property of loganin isolated from Corni fructus.
22931211|a|In the course of searching for anti-dementia agents from natural products, loganin isolated from EtOAc fraction of Corni fructus possessed specific inhibitory activity against beta-secretase (BACE1) with 9.2 x 10-5  M and K(i) value of 5.5 x 10-5 M. Loganin exhibited less inhibitory activity to alpha-secretase (TACE) and other serine proteases exhibiting that it was a relatively specific inhibitor of BACE1. These novel findings suggest that loganin may be used to attenuate the progression and/or prevention of Alzheimer's disease.
