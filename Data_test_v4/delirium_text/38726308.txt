38726308|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia. There are two main types of AD: familial and sporadic. Familial AD is linked to mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), and presenilin-2 (PSEN2). On the other hand, sporadic AD is the more common form of the disease and has genetic, epigenetic, and environmental components that influence disease onset and progression. Investigating the epigenetic mechanisms associated with AD is essential for increasing understanding of pathology and identifying biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment. Chemical covalent modifications on DNA and RNA can epigenetically regulate gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels and play protective or pathological roles in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.
