38684972|t|Attitudes, knowledge and practices concerning delirium among paediatric intensive care unit nurses: a multisite cross-sectional study in Sichuan, China.
38684972|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is an acute mental state associated with poor outcomes. The incidence of delirium is high, especially in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). It is important for staff, particularly nurses, to understand delirium and implement interventions to prevent it. We performed a survey with the aim of evaluating and analysing the factors influencing the knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of PICU nurses towards delirium. METHODS: This cross-sectional descriptive study included 215 PICU nurses in 6 PICUs from five teaching hospitals in Sichuan Province, China. An online survey about the knowledge, attitudes and practices related to delirium care was conducted among PICU nurses used a self-made and validated questionnaire. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics; differences between groups were compared using t tests, ANOVA and rank-sum tests. Variables with a significance level of 0.05 in the univariate analysis were entered into the multivariable regression analysis to identify predictors. RESULTS: Only 14.4% of the nurses had a good understanding of delirium, and 40.9% had received relevant training. The mean knowledge score was 9.01 +- 3.86, and the overall passing rate of knowledge was 49.8%. The mean attitude and behaviour scores were 40.95 +- 5.62 and 40.33 +- 8.01, respectively. Among the hospitals, different delirium assessments for children and specific training were performed, explaining approximately 10% of the variability in knowledge scores (F = 6.152), approximately 10% of the variability in attitude/belief scores (F = 5.908), and approximately 17% of the variability in practice scores (F = 10.767). CONCLUSIONS: PICU nurses have poor knowledge of delirium, particularly regarding its clinical manifestations, influencing factors and medications used, and they have adequate attitudes and confidence and good behaviour regarding delirium in children. To better prevent delirium, we suggest that PICU departments routinely assess delirium and conduct delirium training for nurses. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable.
