38388523|t|XBP1-mediated transcriptional regulation of SLC5A1 in human epithelial cells in disease conditions.
38388523|a|BACKGROUND: Sodium-Glucose cotransporter 1 and 2 (SGLT1/2) belong to the family of glucose transporters, encoded by SLC5A1 and SLC5A2, respectively. SGLT2 is almost exclusively expressed in the renal proximal convoluted tubule cells. SGLT1 is expressed in the kidneys but also in other organs throughout the body. Many SGLT inhibitor drugs have been developed based on the mechanism of blocking glucose (re)absorption mediated by SGLT1/2, and several have gained major regulatory agencies' approval for treating diabetes. Intriguingly these drugs are also effective in treating diseases beyond diabetes, for example heart failure and chronic kidney disease. We recently discovered that SGLT1 is upregulated in the airway epithelial cells derived from patients of cystic fibrosis (CF), a devastating genetic disease affecting greater than 70,000 worldwide. RESULTS: In the present work, we show that the SGLT1 upregulation is coupled with elevated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, indicated by activation of the primary ER stress senor inositol-requiring protein 1alpha (IRE1alpha) and the ER stress-induced transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), in CF epithelial cells, and in epithelial cells of other stress conditions. Through biochemistry experiments, we demonstrated that the spliced form of XBP1 (XBP1s) acts as a transcription factor for SLC5A1 by directly binding to its promoter region. Targeting this ER stress   SLC5A1 axis by either the ER stress inhibitor Rapamycin or the SGLT1 inhibitor Sotagliflozin was effective in attenuating the ER stress response and reducing the SGLT1 level in these cellular model systems. CONCLUSIONS: The present work establishes a causal relationship between ER stress and SGLT1 upregulation and provides a mechanistic explanation why SGLT inhibitor drugs benefit diseases beyond diabetes.
