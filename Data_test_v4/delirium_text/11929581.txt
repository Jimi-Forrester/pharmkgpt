11929581|t|A case of diffuse neurofibrillary tangles with calcification.
11929581|a|We report a 79-year-old female with atypical senile dementia with Fahr-type calcification. The patient started to show memory disturbance at the age of 75 years, followed by visual hallucination, stereotypy, personality changes such as irritability, aggression and disinhibition. Brain computed tomography (CT) demonstrated bilateral and symmetric calcification of the basal ganglia and thalamus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed diffuse cortical atrophy pronounced in the fronto-temporal areas. On MRI T1-weighted images the calcified areas showed a mixture of low- and high-intensity signals. Based on the overlapping clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and Pick's disease, together with the brain CT and MRI findings, we clinically diagnosed the patient as having 'diffuse neurofibrillary tangles with calcification' (DNTC). The characteristics of psychiatric symptoms and neuroradiological findings in DNTC are discussed.
