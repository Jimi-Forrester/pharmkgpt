36577409|t|Interaction between apolipoprotein E genotypes, excessive daytime sleepiness, and cognitive function in obstructive sleep apnea patients.
36577409|a|BACKGROUND: Some studies show an association between the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele (ApoEepsilon4) and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), and other studies, an association between ApoEepsilon4 and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), but there are no data in the literature on the interaction between EDS, cognitive function, and ApoEepsilon4 in patients with OSA. OBJECTIVE: To examine the cognitive function of adults with and without EDS and with and without ApoEepsilon4. METHODS: A total of 21 male and female patients aged between 33 and 79 years, underwent a clinical interview, ApoE genotyping, neuropsychological evaluation, polysomnography, and the application of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. RESULTS: Excessive daytime sleepiness was associated with lower intelligence quotient (IQ; total performance) and worse immediate visual memory, regardless of the ApoE genotype. Patients carrying the ApoEepsilon3/epsilon4 genotype had a worse performance in divided attention, constructional praxis, perceptual organization, and cognitive flexibility. A combination of the epsilon4 allele and EDS potentiates the negative effect on cognition, except for immediate visual memory. In this case, patients had a worse performance in terms of processing speed, selective attention, and visuomotor coordination. CONCLUSIONS: Excessive daytime sleepiness and the ApoEepsilon3/epsilon4 genotype are associated with worse cognitive performance in OSA patients. The combination of EDS and epsilon4 allele potentiates cognitive impairment.
