37248598|t|[Risk Factors and Prognosis of Delirium After Liver Transplantation].
37248598|a|Objective: To analyze the incidence, the onset time, and the risk factors of delirium after liver transplantation (LT). Methods: The clinical data of 211 patients who underwent LT at Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University between January 2019 and December 2021 were collected to investigate the incidence and the onset time of postoperative delirium. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were conducted to analyze the risk factors of delirium and to analyze the effect of delirium on clinical outcomes. Results: The incidence of delirium was 20.4% (43/211) and the median interval between LT and the onset of delirium was 19 hours. Univariate analysis showed that the preoperative Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score>=22, preoperative length-of-stay>=7, liver cancer, preoperative hepatic encephalopathy, infections within 2 months before LT, preoperative lymphocyte value<0.5x10 9 L -1, massive amount of intraoperative red blood cell infusion, and carbapenem antibiotics use for 3 days or longer were associated with postoperative delirium. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative infections within 2 months before LT (odds ratio [ OR]=2.597, 95% confidence interval [ CI]: 1.135-5.944, P=0.024), preoperative MELD score>=22 ( OR=2.967, 95% CI: 1.104-7.975, P=0.031), and preoperative hepatic encephalopathy ( OR=4.700, 95% CI: 2.043-10.602, P<0.001) were independent risk factors for delirium after LT, while carbapenems antibiotics use for 3 days or longer ( OR=0.192, 95% CI: 0.083-0.441, P<0.001) was a protective factor for postoperative delirium among LT recipients. Regarding clinical outcomes, patients with delirium had longer postoperative ICU length-of-stays than those without delirium did ( P=0.025). Conclusion: There is a high incidence of postoperative delirium among patients who undergo LT and the onset time of delirium after LT is early. Risk factors include preoperative infections, high MELD score, and hepatic encephalopathy. On the other hand, the use of carbapenems can help prevent delirium.
