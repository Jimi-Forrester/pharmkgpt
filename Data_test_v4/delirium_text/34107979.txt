34107979|a|BACKGROUND: Malignant tumours of the female reproductive system threaten the lives and health of women worldwide, with ovarian cancer having the highest mortality rate. Based on previous work, this study analysed the expression and role of YWHAE in ovarian epithelial tumours. METHODS: The interaction between YWHAE and HE4 was evaluated via immunoprecipitation, western blot analysis, and cellular immunofluorescence. Immunohistochemistry was used to address the relationship between YWHAE expression, clinicopathological parameters, and patient prognosis. Changes in cell invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration, proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle before and after differential expression of YWHAE were also explored in ovarian cancer cell lines and via in vivo experiments. RESULTS: YWHAE was found to interact with HE4, and its expression was positively correlated with HE4 expression. Moreover, YWHAE upregulation was associated with advanced stages of ovarian cancer and poor patient prognosis. In addition, YWHAE enhanced invasion, migration, and proliferation, but inhibited the apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells. These biological effects were found to be mediated by the AKT and MAPK signalling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, this study demonstrates that YWHAE is substantially upregulated in ovarian cancer tissues, representing a risk factor for the prognosis of ovarian cancer that is positively correlated with HE4 expression. Furthermore, YWHAE and its downstream pathways may represent new therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer.
