35965319|a|BACKGROUND: Plasma metabolomic profile is disturbed in dementia patients, but previous studies have discordant conclusions. METHODS: Circulating metabolomic data of 110,655 people in the UK Biobank study were measured with nuclear magnetic resonance technique, and incident dementia records were obtained from national health registers. The associations between plasma metabolites and dementia were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models. The 10-fold cross-validation elastic net regression models selected metabolites that predicted incident dementia, and a 10-year prediction model for dementia was constructed by multivariable logistic regression. The predictive values of the conventional risk model, the metabolites model, and the combined model were discriminated by comparison of area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs). Net reclassification improvement (NRI) was used to estimate the change of reclassification ability when adding metabolites into the conventional prediction model. RESULTS: Amongst 110,655 participants, the mean (standard deviation) age was 56.5 (8.1) years, and 51 186 (46.3%) were male. A total of 1439 (13.0%) developed dementia during a median follow-up of 12.2 years (interquartile range: 11.5-12.9 years). A total of 38 metabolites, including lipids and lipoproteins, ketone bodies, glycolysis-related metabolites, and amino acids, were found to be significantly associated with incident dementia. Adding selected metabolites (n=24) to the conventional dementia risk prediction model significantly improved the prediction for incident dementia (AUC: 0.824 versus 0.817, p =0.042) and reclassification ability (NRI = 4.97%, P = 0.009) for identifying high risk groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis identified various metabolomic biomarkers which were significantly associated with incident dementia. Metabolomic profiles also provided opportunities for dementia risk reclassification. These findings may help explain the biological mechanisms underlying dementia and improve dementia prediction.
