36859718|t|Comparison of neoadjuvant chemohormonal therapy vs. extended pelvic lymph-node dissection in high-risk prostate cancer treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.
36859718|a|We compared the impact of treatment strategies on postoperative complications and prognosis between robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) plus extended pelvic lymph-node dissection (ePLND) and RARP plus neoadjuvant chemohormonal therapy (NCHT) without ePLND. We retrospectively evaluated 452 patients with high-risk prostate cancer (defined as any one of prostate-specific antigen >= 20 ng/mL, Gleason score 8-10, or cT2c-3) who were treated with RARP between January 2012 and February 2021. The patients were divided into two groups: RARP with ePLND (ePLND group) and NCHT plus RARP without ePLND (NCHT group). We compared the complication rate (Clavien-Dindo classification), biochemical recurrence-free survival, and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)-free survival between the groups. We performed multivariable Cox regression analysis using inverse probability weighting (IPTW) methods to assess the impact of the different treatments on prognosis. There were 150 and 302 patients in the ePLND and NCHT groups, respectively. The postoperative complication rate was significantly higher in the ePLND group than in the NCHT group (P < 0.001). IPTW-adjusted biochemical recurrence-free survival and CRPC-free survival were significantly higher in the NCHT group than in the ePLND group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.29, P < 0.001, and HR 0.29, P = 0.010, respectively). NCHT plus RARP without ePLND may reduce the risk of postoperative complications compared with ePLND during RARP. The impact of treatment strategies on oncological outcomes needs further studies.
