28652635|a|. Risk factors for delirium in intensive care unit in liver transplant patients. INTRODUCTION: Delirium is a disorder of the state of consciousness characterized by acute onset and temporal variability of cognitive abilities. It is frequent in intensive care unit (ICU) and it is associated with worst outcomes. AIM: To identify risk factors for the development of delirium in patients in intensive care unit (ICU) after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx). METHODS: Observational retrospective study on all the patients undergoing OLTx between January 2014 and December 2015. The daily assessment for delirium was performed with the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU), by nemed nurses. RESULTS: Of the 123 patients included, 15 (12.2%) developed post-operative delirium. The main risk factor was preoperative hepatic encephalopathy (OR = 8.80, 95% CI 2.70-28.59): the deterioration of the state of consciousness (GCS pre-OLTx score < 15) increased the risk of developing delirium (OR 6.18; IC 95% 1.51 - 25.31). A high Acute Physiologic and Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score (OR=1.29, IC 95%: 1.12-1.47) showed how patients with a more severe clinical situation at ICU admission were more likely to develop delirium. CONCLUSIONS: The risk factors identified predict the development of delirium in ICU. Its prevention with the implementation of pharmacological or other strategies may reduce the onset of delirium and improve the quality of care.
