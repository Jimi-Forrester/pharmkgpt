36224337|t|Elevation of serum plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 predicts postoperative delirium independent of neural damage: a sequential analysis.
36224337|a|Older adult surgical patients are susceptible to developing delirium. Early intervention can be initiated if a potential biomarker associated with delirium can be identified during the acute phase of surgery. Therefore, we investigated the changes in the levels of serum inflammatory mediators responsible for delirium. Serum biomarkers were measured preoperatively to postoperative day 3 in 96 patients who underwent esophageal cancer surgery and compared between patients who did and did not develop delirium. Serum concentrations of the brain-derived phosphorylated neurofilament heavy subunit remained at higher levels throughout the entire perioperative period in patients with delirium (n = 15) than in those without delirium (n = 81). The interaction between delirium and non-delirium was significant for plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (including age as a covariate, F = 13.360, p < 0.0001, eta2 p = 0.134, observed power 1.000) during the perioperative periods. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 level discriminated between patients with and without clinically diagnosed delirium with significantly high accuracy (area under curve, 0.864; sensitivity, 1.00: negative predictive value, 1.000; p = 0.002). Rapid increases in the levels of serum plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 may enable clinicians to identify patients at risk of developing postoperative delirium and initiate early prevention and intervention.
