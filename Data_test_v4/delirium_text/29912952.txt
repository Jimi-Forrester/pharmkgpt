29912952|a|BACKGROUND: Diuretic response is a strong predictor of outcome for admitted patients of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). However, little is known about the effects of early diuretic response to carperitide. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed records of 85 patients hospitalized for ADHF who received carperitide as initial treatment and <40 mg furosemide during the early period. The eligible patients were divided into good diuretic responder (GR) group and poor diuretic responder (PR) group on the basis of median urinary volume. RESULTS: The PR group demonstrated older age, lower body mass index (BMI), lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, and higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level, left ventricular ejection fraction, and beta-blockers prescribed at baseline than the GR group. The incidence of worsening renal function (WRF) was significantly higher in the PR group than in the GR group. There was no correlation between early intravenous furosemide dose and urinary volume (Spearman correlation, rho = 0.111, p = 0.312). Multivariate analysis showed that the statistically significant independent factors associated with poor diuretic response to carperitide were BMI (Odds ratio (OR) = 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68-0.94, p = 0.004) and BUN (OR = 1.07, 95%CI 1.01-1.15, p = 0.018). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated a lower event-free rate in the PR group than in the GR group (log-rank, p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: BMI and BUN levels on admission were significant determinants of early poor diuretic response to carperitide. Early poor diuretic response to carperitide was associated with future poor outcomes.
