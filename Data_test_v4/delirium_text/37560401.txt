37560401|t|Patient-related benefits of amyloid PET imaging in dementia: Rationale and design of the German randomized coverage with evidence development study ENABLE.
37560401|a|The utility of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) for the etiological diagnosis of dementia and its impact on functional status of patients in routine care are currently unclear. Here, we describe the design of ENABLE, a randomized controlled two-armed coverage with evidence development (CED) study in Germany. Approximately 1126 patients with mild to moderate dementia of unclear etiology will be randomly assigned to either an amyloid PET or a no amyloid PET group. Patients will be followed-up for 24 months. The study has been registered at the German Clinical Trials Register (https://drks.de/search/de/trial/DRKS00030839) with the registration code DRKS00030839. The primary endpoint of ENABLE is the ability to perform functional activities of daily living at 18 months. Secondary endpoints include change in diagnosis, diagnostic confidence, and cognitive and clinical outcomes of patients. We expect that the CED study ENABLE will inform about patient relevant effects of amyloid PET in routine care. Furthermore, we anticipate that ENABLE will support physicians' and payers' decisions on provision of health care for patients with dementia. Highlights: Study design focuses on the usefulness of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) in routine care.Study design addresses the patient-relevant effect of amyloid PET.Patient representatives were involved in the creation of the study design.The study will help improve routine care for people with dementia.
