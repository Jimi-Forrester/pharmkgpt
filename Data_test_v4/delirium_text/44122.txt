44122|t|[Pharmacotoxic psychoses in patients with neurological disorders during old age (author's transl)].
44122|a|23.3 per cent out of 180 old patients (age above 60 years, 71 y in the mean) suffering from chronic cerebral disorders (3 large groups of disease) developed pharmacotoxic psychoses. This relative high percentage can be explained by psychotoxic side effects of the modern antiparkinson-therapy. The incidence to psychotoxicity of combined L-Dopa seems to be less marked in patients without Parkinson's disease when compared to patients with progredient nigrostriatal degeneration. Toxic delirium as a result of treatment with antidepressants, diuretics and digitalis was observable only in a few percentage. This occurance was even less pronounced in comparison to acute developing exogene psychoses in the same group of patients when drugs were not administered.
