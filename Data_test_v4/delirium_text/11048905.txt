11048905|a|BACKGROUND: Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent that does not appear to increase patient risk for treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) or anticholinergic symptoms. Previous studies of quetiapine use in elderly patients with schizophrenia and other psychoses examined short-term administration (< or = 12 weeks). Given the growing elderly population, the commensurate increase in elderly patients with psychoses, and the expected increase in disease treatment-years, the effect of long-term quetiapine administration in older patients is of considerable interest. OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the long-term tolerability, safety, and clinical benefit of quetiapine in elderly patients with psychosis. METHODS: Elderly patients (> or = 65 years of age) with psychotic disorders, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, participated in this 52-week, open-label, multicenter trial. Investigators increased (and later adjusted) daily doses of quetiapine on the basis of clinical response and tolerability, and assessed safety and efficacy. Efficacy assessments were made using the 18-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), Simpson-Angus Scale, and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). For patients who withdrew before week 52, analyses were performed using observed data and the last observation carried forward. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-four patients with psychotic disorders (98 women and 86 men) with a mean age of 76.1 years entered the trial. Seventy-two percent had psychotic disorders due to general medical conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, and 28% had other psychotic disorders, most commonly schizophrenia. Overall, 89 (48%) patients completed treatment through 52 weeks. Median total daily dose was 137.5 mg. Reasons, for withdrawal included lack of efficacy (19%), adverse events or intercurrent illness (15%), failure to return for follow-up (13%), protocol noncompliance (3%), and diminished need for treatment (2%). Somnolence (31%), dizziness (17%), and postural hypotension (15%) were common adverse events, but they rarely resulted in withdrawal from therapy. EPS-related adverse events occurred in 13% of patients. At end point (week 52), mean total score on the Simpson-Angus Scale had decreased from baseline by 1.8 points, whereas changes in AIMS scores were negligible. No clinically important effects were reported relative to mean changes in hematologic, thyroid function, or hepatic function variables. Quetiapine treatment appeared to have no associated cardiovascular adverse outcomes despite cardiovascular comorbidities and unrestricted use of concomitant cardiovascular medications. Significant decreases in BPRS total score (n = 170, P < 0.001) and CGI Severity of Illness item score (n = 177, P < 0.002) were seen at end point (observed data and last observation carried forward). Decreases of > or = 20% in mean BPRS total score were observed in 83 (49%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide preliminary information to clinicians regarding tolerability, safety, and clinical improvement with quetiapine in elderly patients with psychotic symptoms, and support controlled studies of quetiapine in this patient population.
