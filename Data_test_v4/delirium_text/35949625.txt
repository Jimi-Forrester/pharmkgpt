35949625|t|Familial Co-Aggregation of Dementia with Schizophrenia: A Cross Sectional Pedigree Analysis.
35949625|a|Background: Cognitive impairment is the core outcome defining feature in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia, in the context of a broader neurodegenerative conceptualization, may have shared etiology with major neurocognitive disorders (MNCD). To elucidate this association there is definite need to explore the familial loading of dementia, in families of patients with schizophrenia. Methods: The authors compared relatives including parental generation and siblings of 100 cases (schizophrenia probands) and 100 controls (anxiety disorder) in order to assess the familial co-aggregation of MNCD. All cases and control were screened with Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview screen for psychiatric morbidity. The pedigree analysis was conducted by family history method and Family Interview for Genetic Studies. Cognitive impairment in pedigree was screened by community screening instrument for dementia. Results: There was nonreporting of MNCD in the total 2538 relatives (proband siblings +parental generation) of both cases and controls. Diabetes mellitus was the most common somatic morbidity, found significantly more among the parental generation of cases than healthy controls (chi2 (1, 1713) = 6.452, P < 0.05). The odds of having various psychiatric and medical morbidities in the schizophrenia families compared to control are less than 1. Conclusion: There is no familial co-aggregation of MNCD in schizophrenia probands and common etiology between the two is less likely. Either schizophrenia could be counter-intuitively protective for MNCD or a reversible risk factor that can be prevented by effective treatments.
