36559788|t|A Review of Cyclodextrin Encapsulation and Intelligent Response for the Release of Curcumin.
36559788|a|To overcome the low water solubility and low bioavailability of curcumin (CUR), multiple delivery strategies have been proposed. Among these, cyclodextrin-based carriers have been widely used for the encapsulation and delivery of CUR. Cyclodextrins (CDs), as natural oligosaccharides, have been well known for their biodegradability, biocompatibility, non-toxicity, and internal hydrophobic and external hydrophilic structural features. This paper summarizes the recently reported CD-based carriers for encapsulating CUR. Particularly, the polymerization properties of CD self-assembly to enhance the encapsulation of CUR are discussed. In addition, the current progress on stimuli-responsive CD carriers for controlled release of CUR is described, which laid an important foundation for the development of CUR-based precision therapy in clinical practice. In conclusion, this review may provide ideas for the future development of a CD-based encapsulant for CUR.
