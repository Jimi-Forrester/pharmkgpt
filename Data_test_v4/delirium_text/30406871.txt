30406871|t|Incidence and clinical significance of postoperative delirium after brain tumor surgery.
30406871|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is an acute and reversible deterioration of mental state. Postoperative delirium (POD) can develop after surgical procedures and is associated with impaired health status and worse recovery. So far, there is little data about postoperative delirium after brain surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate frequency, risk factors, and prognostic value of POD in predicting short-term postoperative outcomes after brain tumor surgery. METHODS: Five-hundred and twenty-two patients who underwent elective brain tumor surgery in 2010-2017 were included in this prospective study. Patients were monitored for POD using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) for 2 to 7 days after the surgery. At hospital discharge, outcomes were evaluated using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). RESULTS: POD was diagnosed in 22 (4.2%) patients. Risk factors of POD were low level of hemoglobin, poor functional status at time of admission, low education level and older age (65 years and older). POD incidence was not associated with brain tumor laterality, location, extent of resection, histological diagnosis, or affected brain lobe. POD was associated with greater risk for unfavorable outcomes at hospital discharge (OR = 5.3; 95% CI [2.1-13.4], p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: POD is not a common complication after elective brain tumor surgery. Older age, poor functional status, low education level and anemia are associated with greater POD risk. Extent of surgical intervention and brain tumor location are not associated with POD risk. POD is associated with worse outcome at hospital discharge.
