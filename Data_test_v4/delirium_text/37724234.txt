37724234|a|Accurate determination of intravascular volume status is challenging in acutely ill patients. Favorable patient outcome is vital to correctly identify intravascular volume depletion and avoid systemic venous congestion. Most of the conventional means of hemodynamic monitoring in the acute healthcare setting are geared toward addressing the cardiac output and maintaining an optimum mean arterial pressure. While assessing and maintaining cardiac output in an acutely ill patient is very important, a venous congestion cascade is often overlooked, which can negatively affect the intraabdominal end organs. The prospect of using point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) to determine systemic venous congestion could be a potentially handy tool for clinicians. Venous excess ultrasound score (VExUS) has also been utilized by clinicians as a semi-quantitative assessment tool to assess fluid status. This review aims to discuss the potential role of POCUS and VExUS scores in determining systemic venous congestion through a narrative review of recently published literature.
