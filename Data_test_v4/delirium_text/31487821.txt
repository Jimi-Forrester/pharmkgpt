31487821|t|Modeling the Kinetic Behavior of Reactive Oxygen Species with Cerium Dioxide Nanoparticles.
31487821|a|The world of medicinal therapies has been historically, and remains to be, dominated by the use of elegant organic molecular structures. Now, a novel medical treatment is emerging based on CeO2 nano-crystals that are discrete clusters of a few hundred atoms. This development is generating a great deal of exciting and promising research activity, as evidenced by this Special Issue of Biomolecules. In this paper, we provide both a steady-state and time-dependent mathematical description of a sequence of reactions: superoxide generation, superoxide dismutase, and hydrogen peroxide catalase and ceria regeneration. This sequence describes the reactive oxygen species (ROS); superoxide, O2-, molecular oxygen, O2, hydroxide ion OH- and hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, interacting with the Ce3+, and Ce4+ surface cations of nanoparticle ceria, CeO2. Particular emphasis is placed on the predicted time-dependent role of the Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio within the crystal. The net reaction is succinctly described as: H2O2 + 2O2- + 2H+   2H2O + 2O2. The chemical equations and mathematical treatment appears to align well with several critical in vivo observations such as; direct and specific superoxide dismutase (SOD), ROS control, catalytic regeneration, ceria self-regulation and self-limiting behavior. However, in contrast to experimental observations, the model predicts that the 4+ ceric ion state is the key SOD agent. Future work is suggested based on these calculations.
