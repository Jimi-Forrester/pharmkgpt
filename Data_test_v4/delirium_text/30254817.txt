30254817|t|Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity after Cardiac Arrest in a Young Male.
30254817|a|Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) is a syndrome of an increased sympathetic drive after brain injury. PSH has been previously referred with multiple different names. It is seen most commonly after a traumatic brain injury, but rarely it has been reported after infections, brain malignancies, and brain injury after cardiac arrest. We present a case of a young male who developed PSH after cardiac arrest and will discuss clinical features and various management options.
