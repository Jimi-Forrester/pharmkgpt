36302813|a|Postural sway and eye movements are potential biomarkers for dementia screening. Assessing the two movements comprehensively could improve the understanding of complicated syndrome for more accurate screening. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effects of comprehensive assessment in healthy older adults (OA), using a novel concurrent comprehensive assessment system consisting of stabilometer and virtual reality headset. 20 healthy OA (70.4 +- 4.9 years) were recruited. Using a cross-sectional study design, this study investigated the effects of various dual-tasking paradigms with integrated tasks of visuospatial memory (VM), spatial orientation (SO), and visual challenge on posture and saccades. Dual-task paradigms with VM and SO affected the saccadic eye movements significantly. Two highly intensive tests of anti-saccade with VM task and pro-saccade with SO task also influenced postural sway significantly. Strong associations were seen between postural sway and eye movements for the conditions where the two movements theoretically shared common neural pathways in the brain, and vice versa. This study suggests that assessing posture and saccades with the integrated tasks comprehensively and simultaneously could be useful to explain different functions of the brain. The results warrant a cross-sectional study in OA with and without dementia to explore differences between these groups.
