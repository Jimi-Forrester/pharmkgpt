32288970|t|Critical care management of the lung transplant recipient.
32288970|a|Lung transplantation provides the prospect of improved survival and quality of life for patients with end stage lung and pulmonary vascular diseases. Given the severity of illness of such patients at the time of surgery, lung transplant recipients require particular attention in the immediate post-operative period to ensure optimal short-term and long-term outcomes. The management of such patients involves active involvement of a multidisciplinary team versed in common post-operative complications. This review provides an overview of such complications as they pertain to the practitioners caring for post-operative lung transplant recipients. Causes and treatment of conditions affecting early morbidity and mortality in lung transplant recipients will be detailed, including primary graft dysfunction, cardiovascular and surgical complications, and immunologic and infectious issues. Additionally, lung donor management issues and bridging the critically ill potential lung transplant recipient to transplantation will be discussed.
