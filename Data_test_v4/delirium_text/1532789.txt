1532789|a|Genes encoding G-protein-coupled receptors, including dopamine, serotonin, muscarinic cholinergic, and adrenergic receptors, play an important role in neurotransmission and may be involved in the pathophysiology of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or Huntington's disease (HD). We mapped the gene encoding the D5 dopamine receptor (DRD5) to human chromosome 4p, an area implicated in HD and the Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, using gene-specific amplification with the polymerase chain reaction on a panel of somatic cell hybrids carrying different human chromosomes. Further localization of the DRD5 gene was carried out through the isolation and analysis of yeast artificial chromosomes, fluorescence in situ suppression hybridization to human metaphase chromosomes, and analysis of a panel of somatic cell hybrids subdividing human chromosome 4 into nine regions. The human DRD5 gene is located at 4p15.1-p15.33, centromeric to the location of the Huntington's disease locus although not in the obligate area containing the HD gene. The localization of the DRD5 gene to 4p15.1-p15.33 suggests the possibility that cis-position effects could be responsible for the altered D1-type dopamine receptor number observed in HD tissues or that the DRD5 gene could be a candidate for some of the abnormalities associated with the Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome.
