38398345|t|External Ventricular Drain Placement, Critical Care Utilization, Complications, and Clinical Outcomes after Spontaneous Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A Single-Center Retrospective Cohort Study.
38398345|a|BACKGROUND: To examine the association between external ventricular drain (EVD) placement, critical care utilization, complications, and clinical outcomes in hospitalized adults with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). METHODS: A single-center retrospective study included SAH patients 18 years and older, admitted between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2022. The exposure variable was EVD. The primary outcomes of interest were (1) early mortality (<72 h), (2) overall mortality, (3) improvement in modified-World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (m-WFNSs) grade between admission and discharge, and (4) discharge to home at the end of the hospital stay. We adjusted for admission m-WFNS grade, age, sex, race/ethnicity, intraventricular hemorrhage, aneurysmal cause of SAH, mechanical ventilation, critical care utilization, and complications within a multivariable analysis. We reported adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The study sample included 1346 patients: 18% (n = 243) were between the ages of 18 and 44 years, 48% (n = 645) were between the age of 45-64 years, and 34% (n = 458) were 65 years and older, with other statistics of females (56%, n = 756), m-WFNS I-III (57%, n = 762), m-WFNS IV-V (43%, n = 584), 51% mechanically ventilated, 76% White (n = 680), and 86% English-speaking (n = 1158). Early mortality occurred in 11% (n = 142). Overall mortality was 21% (n = 278), 53% (n = 707) were discharged to their home, and 25% (n = 331) improved their m-WFNS between admission and discharge. Altogether, 54% (n = 731) received EVD placement. After adjusting for covariates, the results of the multivariable analysis demonstrated that EVD placement was associated with reduced early mortality (aOR 0.21 [0.14, 0.33]), an improvement in m-WFNS grade (aOR 2.06 [1.42, 2.99]) but not associated with overall mortality (aOR 0.69 [0.47, 1.00]) or being discharged home at the end of the hospital stay (aOR 1.00 [0.74, 1.36]). EVD was associated with a higher rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia (aOR 2.32 [1.03, 5.23]), delirium (aOR 1.56 [1.05, 2.32]), and a longer ICU (aOR 1.33 [1.29;1.36]) and hospital length of stay (aOR 1.09 [1.07;1.10]). Critical care utilization was also higher in patients with EVD compared to those without. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that EVD placement in hospitalized adults with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is associated with reduced early mortality and improved neurological recovery, albeit with higher critical care utilization and complications. These findings emphasize the potential clinical benefits of EVD placement in managing SAH. However, further research and prospective studies may be necessary to validate these results and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing clinical outcomes in SAH.
