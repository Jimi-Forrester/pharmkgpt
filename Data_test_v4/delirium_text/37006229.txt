37006229|a|More than two-thirds of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients are diagnosed at advanced stages due to the lack of sensitive biomarkers. Currently, exosomes are intensively investigated as non-invasive cancer diagnostic markers. Exosomes are nanovesicles released in the extracellular milieu with the potential to modulate recipient cells' behavior. EOC cells release many altered exosomal cargoes that exhibit clinical relevance to tumor progression. Exosomes represent powerful therapeutic tools (drug carriers or vaccines), posing a promising option in clinical practice for curing EOC in the near future. In this review, we highlight the importance of exosomes in cell-cell communication, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and their potential to serve as diagnostic and prognostic factors, particularly in EOC.
