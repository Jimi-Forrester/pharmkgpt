35561457|t|APOE gene region methylation is associated with cognitive performance in middle-aged urban adults.
35561457|a|Apolipoprotein (APOE) epsilon4 allele is a strong risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive decline. Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation (DNAm) play a central role in cognition. This study sought to identify DNAm sites in the APOE genomic region associated with cognitive performance in a racially diverse middle-aged cohort (n = 411). Cognitive performance was measured by 11 standard neuropsychological tests. Two CpG sites were associated with the Card Rotation and Benton Visual Retention cognitive tests. The methylation level of the CpG site cg00397545 was associated with Card Rotation Test score (p = 0.000177) and a novel CpG site cg10178308 was associated with Benton Visual Retention Test score (p = 0.000084). Significant associations were observed among the dietary inflammatory index, which reflects the inflammatory potential of the diet, cognitive performance and the methylation level of several CpG sites. Our results indicate that DNAm in the APOE genomic area is correlated with cognitive performance and may presage cognitive decline.
