27094761|t|Characterization of a sensitive mouse Abeta40 PD biomarker assay for Alzheimer's disease drug development in wild-type mice.
27094761|a|AIM: Transgenic mice that overexpress human amyloid precursor protein with Swedish or London (APPswe or APPlon) mutations have been widely used for preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug development. AD patients, however, rarely possess these mutations or overexpress APP. RESULTS: We developed a sensitive ELISA that specifically and accurately measures low levels of endogenous Abeta40 in mouse plasma, brain and CSF. In wild-type mice treated with a bispecific anti-TfR/BACE1 antibody, significant Abeta reductions were observed in the periphery and the brain. APPlon transgenic mice showed a slightly less reduction, whereas APPswe mice did not have any decrease. CONCLUSION: This sensitive and well-characterized mouse Abeta40 assay enables the use of wild-type mice for preclinical PK/PD and efficacy studies of potential AD therapeutics.
