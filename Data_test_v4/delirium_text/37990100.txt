37990100|a|Organophosphorus poisoning kills individuals by causing central apnea; however, the underlying cause of death remains unclear. Following findings that the pre-Botzinger complex impairment alone does not account for central apnea, we analyzed the effect of paraoxon on the brainstem-spinal cord preparation, spanning the lower medulla oblongata to phrenic nucleus. Respiratory bursts were recorded by connecting electrodes to the ventral 4th cervical nerve root of excised brainstem-spinal cord preparations obtained from 6-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. We observed changes in respiratory bursts when paraoxon, neostigmine, atropine, and 2-pyridine aldoxime methiodide were administered via bath application. The percentage of burst extinction in the paraoxon-poisoning group was 50% compared with 0% and 18.2% in the atropine and 2-pyridine aldoxime methiodide treatment groups, respectively. Both treatments notably mitigated the paraoxon-induced reduction in respiratory bursts. In the neostigmine group, similar to paraoxon, bursts stopped in 66.7% of cases but were fully reversed by atropine. This indicates that the primary cause of central apnea is muscarinic receptor-mediated in response to acetylcholine excess. Paraoxon-induced central apnea is hypothesized to result from neural abnormalities within the inferior medulla oblongata to the phrenic nucleus, excluding pre-Botzinger complex. These antidotes antagonize central apnea, suggesting that they may be beneficial therapeutic agents.
