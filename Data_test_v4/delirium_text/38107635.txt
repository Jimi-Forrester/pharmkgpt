38107635|a|Introduction: This study aimed to evaluate morphological changes in cortical and subcortical regions and their asymmetrical differences in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). These morphological changes may provide valuable insights into the early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: We conducted structural MRI scans on a cohort comprising 62 SCD patients, 97 MCI patients, and 70 age-, sex-, and years of education-matched healthy controls (HC). Using Freesurfer, we quantified surface area, thickness, the local gyrification index (LGI) of cortical regions, and the volume of subcortical nuclei. Asymmetry measures were also calculated. Additionally, we explored the correlation between morphological changes and clinical variables related to cognitive decline. Results: Compared to HC, patients with MCI exhibited predominantly left-sided surface morphological changes in various brain regions, including the transverse temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, insula, and pars opercularis. SCD patients showed relatively minor surface morphological changes, primarily in the insula and pars triangularis. Furthermore, MCI patients demonstrated reduced volumes in the anterior-superior region of the right hypothalamus, the fimbria of the bilateral hippocampus, and the anterior region of the left thalamus. These observed morphological changes were significantly associated with clinical ratings of cognitive decline. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that cortical and subcortical morphometric changes may contribute to cognitive impairment in MCI, while compensatory mechanisms may be at play in SCD to preserve cognitive function. These insights have the potential to aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of AD.
