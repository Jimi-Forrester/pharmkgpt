2305013|a|Scopolamine hydrobromide was administered by subcutaneous injection to 30 young subjects in a dose of 0.22 mg/70 kg, 0.43 mg/70 kg, or 0.65 mg/70 kg. Treatment effects were compared to placebo on an extensive cognitive assessment battery. Almost all tests in the battery had been previously administered to Alzheimer's disease patients and nondemented elderly subjects. Scopolamine produced deficits on tests of verbal recall, visuospatial recall, visual recognition memory, visuospatial praxis, visuoperceptual function, and psychomotor speed. Immediate memory, language function, object sorting, and frequency of intrusion errors were unaffected. The low dose of scopolamine produced some peripheral anticholinergic signs but did not affect the cognitive measures. The results support the conclusion reached in previous studies that the cognitive profile of scopolamine-injected young subjects is more similar to that of the nondemented elderly than to that of Alzheimer's disease patients.
