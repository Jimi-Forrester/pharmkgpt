27651264|t|Role of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Their Metabolites on Stem Cell Proliferation and Differentiation.
27651264|a|The nervous system is highly enriched with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Essential fatty acids, namely, omega-6 (n - 6) and omega-3 (n - 3) PUFA, and their metabolites are critical components of cell structure and function and could therefore influence stem cell fate. The available supporting experimental data reveal that n - 6 and n - 3 PUFA and their metabolites can act through multiple mechanisms to promote the proliferation and differentiation of various stem cell types. PUFAs and their mediators regulate several processes within the brain, such as neurotransmission, cell survival and neuroinflammation, and thereby mood and cognition. PUFA levels and the signaling pathways that they regulate are altered in various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and major depression. Therefore, elucidating the role of PUFAs and their metabolites in stem cell fate regulation is important for stem cell biology as well as stem cell therapy. PUFA-based interventions to generate a positive environment for stem cell proliferation or differentiation might be a promising and practical approach to controlling stem cell fate for clinical applications.
