33000258|t|Sorting Nexin 27 as a potential target in G protein-coupled receptor recycling for cancer therapy (Review).
33000258|a|G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of membrane receptors and activate several downstream signaling pathways involved in numerous physiological cellular processes. GPCRs are usually internalized and desensitized by intracellular signals. Numerous studies have shown that several GPCRs interact with sorting nexin 27 (SNX27), a cargo selector of the retromer complex, and are recycled from endosomes to the plasma membrane. Recycled GPCRs usually contain specific C-terminal postsynaptic density protein 95/Discs large protein/Zonula occludens 1 (PDZ) binding motifs, which are specifically recognized by SNX27, and return to the cell surface as functionally naive receptors. Aberrant endosome-to-membrane recycling of GPCRs mediated by SNX27 may serve a critical role in cancer growth and development. Therefore, SNX27 may be a novel target for cancer therapies.
