35405962|a|Rubber seed oil (RSO) is a typical PUFA-enriched plant oil, but it has not been widely used as a healthy edible oil resource due to the lack of understanding of its nutritional values, health biological effects, and action mechanisms. This work was conducted to characterize the basic physicochemical properties, evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and explore the involved mechanisms of RSO in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. In the present study, the basic physicochemical parameters of RSO indicated that RSO has good qualities as a potential edible plant oil resource. In LPS-induced macrophages, RSO supplementation displayed a significant antioxidant effect by decreasing ROS and MDA levels as well as elevating T-AOC. In addition, RSO supplementation showed an anti-inflammatory effect by reducing the production of NO, IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha while promoting the production of IL-10. Moreover, RSO supplementation decreased the mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, iNOS, and MCP-1 genes while increasing the mRNA expression of the IL-10 gene. Furthermore, RSO supplementation increased Nrf2 protein expression and up-regulated antioxidant genes (HO-1 and NQO-1), which was accompanied by the decrease in TLR4 protein expression and NF-kappaB p65 phosphorylation as well as IkappaBalpha phosphorylation. This study provided some insight into the applications of RSO as a healthy edible oil resource.
