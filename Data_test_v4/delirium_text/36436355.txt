36436355|a|BACKGROUND: The apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele, involved in fatty acid (FA) metabolism, is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study examined the influence of APOE genotypes on blood and brain markers of the L-carnitine system, necessary for fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and their collective influence on the clinical and pathological outcomes of AD. METHODS: L-carnitine, its metabolites gamma-butyrobetaine (GBB) and trimethylamine-n-oxide (TMAO), and its esters (acylcarnitines) were analyzed in blood from predominantly White community/clinic-based individuals (n = 372) and in plasma and brain from the Religious Order Study (ROS) (n = 79) using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). FINDINGS: Relative to total blood acylcarnitines, levels of short chain acylcarnitines (SCAs) were higher whereas long chain acylcarnitines (LCAs) were lower in AD, which was observed pre-clinically in APOE epsilon4s. Plasma medium chain acylcarnitines (MCAs) were higher amongst cognitively healthy APOE epsilon2 carriers relative to other genotypes. Compared to their respective controls, elevated TMAO and lower L-carnitine and GBB were associated with AD clinical diagnosis and these differences were detected preclinically among APOE epsilon4 carriers. Plasma and brain GBB, TMAO, and acylcarnitines were also associated with post-mortem brain amyloid, tau, and cerebrovascular pathologies. INTERPRETATION: Alterations in blood L-carnitine, GBB, TMAO, and acylcarnitines occur early in clinical AD progression and are influenced by APOE genotype. These changes correlate with post-mortem brain AD and cerebrovascular pathologies. Additional studies are required to better understand the role of the FAO disturbances in AD.
