33663022|a|INTRODUCTION: We determined whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light (NfL), neurogranin (Ng), and total-tau (t-tau) differentially mapped to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of cortical thickness, microstructural integrity (corpus callosum and cingulum fractional anisotropy [FA]), and white matter hyperintensities (WMH). METHODS: Analyses included 536 non-demented Mayo Clinic Study of Aging participants with CSF NfL, Ng, t-tau, amyloid beta (Abeta)42 and longitudinal MRI scans. Linear mixed models assessed longitudinal associations between CSF markers and MRI changes. RESULTS: Higher CSF NfL was associated with decreasing microstructural integrity and WMH. Higher t-tau was associated with decreasing temporal lobe and Alzheimer's disease (AD) meta region of interest (ROI) cortical thickness. There was no association between Ng and any MRI measure. CSF Abeta42 interacted with Ng for declines in temporal lobe and AD meta ROI cortical thickness and cingulum FA. DISCUSSION: CSF NfL predicts changes in white matter integrity, t-tau reflects non-specific changes in cortical thickness, and Ng reflects AD-specific synaptic and neuronal degeneration.
