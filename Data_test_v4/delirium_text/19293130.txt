19293130|a|OBJECTIVE: Evaluate safety and tolerability of switching from donepezil to rivastigmine transdermal patch in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Prospective, parallel-group, open-label study to evaluate immediate or delayed switch from 5-10 mg/day donepezil to 4.6 mg/24 h rivastigmine following a 4-week treatment period. RESULTS: Rates of discontinuation due to any reason or adverse events were similar between groups. Incidences of gastrointestinal adverse events were 3.8% in the immediate and 0.8% in the delayed switch group. No patients discontinued secondary to nausea and vomiting. Discontinuations due to application site reactions were low (2.3%). Asymptomatic bradycardia was more common following the immediate switch (2.3% vs 0%); however, these patients had coexisting cardiac comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Both switch strategies were safe and well tolerated. The majority of patients may be able to switch directly to rivastigmine patches without a withdrawal period. Appropriate clinical judgment should be used for patients with existing bradycardia or receiving beta blockers.
