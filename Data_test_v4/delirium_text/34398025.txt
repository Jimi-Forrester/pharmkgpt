34398025|t|Intraoperative development of pulmonary thromboembolism in a bedridden patient owing to a pelvic bone fracture with negative preoperative computed tomography pulmonary angiographic findings: A case report.
34398025|a|RATIONALE: Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) is a potentially life-threatening condition with high morbidity and mortality, and computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is an important diagnostic tool for patients in whom PTE is suspected; however, intraoperative PTE is very difficult to diagnose and often has a rapid clinical course. We experienced a case of intraoperative PTE with persistent tachycardia refractory to conventional treatments despite negative preoperative CTPA findings. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 53-year-old man with a pelvic bone fracture who had been on bed rest for 10 days underwent open reduction and internal fixation under general anesthesia. He remained tachycardic (heart rate of 120 beats/min) despite treatments with fluid resuscitation, analgesics, and beta-blockers. DIAGNOSES: Preoperative CTPA, computed tomography (CT) venography, and transthoracic echocardiography showed no signs of deep vein thrombosis and PTE. However, the levels of D-dimer were elevated. After the start of the surgery, tachycardia (heart rate between 100 and 110 beats/min) could not be treated with fluid resuscitation. Systolic blood pressure was maintained between 90 and 100 mm Hg using continuous infusion of phenylephrine. Ninety minutes after the surgery, systolic and diastolic blood pressures suddenly dropped from 100/60 to 30/15 mm Hg with a decrease in end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration from 29 to 13 mm Hg and development of atrial fibrillation. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed hypercapnia. Under the suspicion of PTE, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was immediately initiated. Three CPR cycles raised the blood pressure back to 90/50 mm Hg with sinus tachycardia (115 beats/min). Transesophageal echocardiography showed right ventricular dysfunction and paradoxical septal motion. However, emboli were not found. Postoperative chest CT revealed massive PTE in both pulmonary arteries. INTERVENTIONS: Immediately, surgical embolectomy was performed uneventfully. OUTCOMES: The patient was discharged from the hospital 1 month later without any complications. LESSONS: The patient with moderate risk for PTE (heart rate > 95 beats/min and immobilization, surgery under general anesthesia, and lower limb fracture within 1 month) should be closely monitored and managed intraoperatively even if preoperative CTPA findings are negative. The development of PTE needs to be expected if tachycardia is refractory to conventional treatments.
