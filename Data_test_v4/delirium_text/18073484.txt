18073484|t|An apolipoprotein A-I gene promoter polymorphism associated with cognitive decline, but not with Alzheimer's disease.
18073484|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Accumulating biological and epidemiological evidence suggests a close link between cholesterol metabolism and the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The observation that the use of statins reduces the risk of AD sustains this hypothesis. Apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1) is the major component of the high-density lipoproteins, particles involved in reverse cholesterol transport. Therefore, genetic polymorphisms in the gene encoding APOA1 might influence cholesterol metabolism and be a risk factor for AD. A previous study suggested an impact of a G-->A polymorphism at position -75 bp in the APOA1 gene on the risk for early-onset AD and on the age at onset of the disease. We studied this polymorphism in 3 independent European population samples. METHODS: Genotyping was conducted asdescribed in the previous study. RESULTS: We were unable to show any impact of this polymorphism on the risk of AD. Conversely, subjects bearing the A allele of this polymorphism were at risk of cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: Our resultssuggest an impact of the G-->A polymorphism at position -75 bp in the APOA1 gene on cognitive impairment, but not on the risk of AD.
