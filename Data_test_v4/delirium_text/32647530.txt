32647530|t|Do ABC transporters regulate plasma membrane organization?
32647530|a|The plasma membrane (PM) spatiotemporal organization is one of the major factors controlling cell signaling and whole-cell homeostasis. The PM lipids, including cholesterol, determine the physicochemical properties of the membrane bilayer and thus play a crucial role in all membrane-dependent cellular processes. It is known that lipid content and distribution in the PM are not random, and their transversal and lateral organization is highly controlled. Mainly sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich lipid nanodomains, historically referred to as rafts, are extremely dynamic "hot spots" of the PM controlling the function of many cell surface proteins and receptors. In the first part of this review, we will focus on the recent advances of PM investigation and the current PM concept. In the second part, we will discuss the importance of several classes of ABC transporters whose substrates are lipids for the PM organization and dynamics. Finally, we will briefly present the significance of lipid ABC transporters for immune responses.
