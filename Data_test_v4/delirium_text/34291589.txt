34291589|a|PURPOSE: To assess the three-dimensional outer retina thickness and choroid in eyes with white matter lesions (WMLs) using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). METHODS: Participants without dementia and stroke with cerebral WMLs were enrolled in our study. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) were used to image and evaluate the outer retinal layer, choroidal structure, and perfusion of the choriocapillaris, microvessels of the choroid, respectively. Measurement of the outer retinal thickness, choroidal thickness and perfusion of the choriocapillaris was done by the SS-OCT tool. RESULTS: Thirty-one eyes from 16 WMLs and 40 eyes from 20 healthy controls were included in the data analyses. Outer retinal thickness was significantly reduced (P < .001) in WMLs participants when compared to healthy controls. Choroidal thickness was also significantly reduced (P < .001) in WMLs participants when compared to healthy controls. Choriocapillaris perfusion was significantly reduced (P = .002) in WMLs when compared to healthy controls. A significant correlation (Rho = .392, P = .032) was seen between the outer retinal thickness and choriocapillaris perfusion in WMLs participants. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing retinal thickness and choroidal changes with the SS-OCTA as a proxy for WML could prove to be a potentially valuable tool for early detection of cognitive decline and other neurodegenerative diseases.
