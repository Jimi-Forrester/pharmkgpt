34452120|t|Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Perspective: New Potential Therapeutic for the Treatment of Neurological Diseases.
34452120|a|Several studies have shown that mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) exert their neuroprotective and neurorestorative efficacy via the secretion of neurotrophic factors. Based on these studies, many clinical trials using MSCs for the treatment of neurological disorders have been conducted, and results regarding their feasibility and efficacy have been reported. The present review aims to highlight the characteristics and basic research regarding the role of MSCs in neurological disease and to discuss the recent progress in clinical trials using MSCs to treat various neurological disorders.
