32300476|t|Update on the Management of Parkinson's Disease for General Neurologists.
32300476|a|Management of Parkinson's disease (PD) is complicated due to its progressive nature, the individual patient heterogeneity, and the wide range of signs, symptoms, and daily activities that are increasingly affected over its course. The last 10-15 years have seen great progress in the identification, evaluation, and management of PD, particularly in the advanced stages. Highly specialized information can be found in the scientific literature, but updates do not always reach general neurologists in a practical and useful way, potentially creating gaps in knowledge of PD between them and neurologists subspecialized in movement disorders, resulting in several unmet patient needs. However, general neurologists remain instrumental in diagnosis and routine management of PD. This review provides updated practical information to identify problems and resolve common issues, particularly when the advanced stage is suspected. Some tips are provided for efficient communication with the members of a healthcare team specialized in movement disorders, in order to find support at any stage of the disease in a given patient, and especially for a well-timed decision on referral.
