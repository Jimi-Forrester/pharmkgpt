38963357|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on perioperative blood glucose levels in adult diabetes mellitus (DM) patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS AND MATERIAL: A prospective, observational study was conducted on 100 adult diabetic patients aged between 18 and 75 years undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The patients were divided into two groups (group D and group C) of 50 each. Group D patients received DEX infusion, whereas the group C patients received 0.9% normal saline infusion. RESULTS: The blood glucose levels, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and serum potassium levels at different time points were comparable between the two groups (P > 0.05). The mean dose of insulin required in the combined population as well as in both controlled and uncontrolled DM patients was significantly less in group D than in group C (combined population - 36.03 +- 22.71 vs 47.82 +- 30.19 IU, P = 0.0297; uncontrolled DM - 37.36 +- 23.9 IU vs 48.16 +- 25.15 IU, P = 0.0301; controlled DM - 34.7 +- 21.5 IU vs 47.63 +- 35.25 IU, P = 0.0291). Duration of mechanical ventilation and VIS were comparable between the two groups. The incidence of arrhythmias (20% vs 46%, P = 0.0059) and delirium (6% vs 20%, P = 0.0384) was significantly less in group D than in group C. None of the patients in either group had stroke, myocardial ischemia, and mortality. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that DEX infusion during the intraoperative period was very effective for perioperative glycemic control and reduction of insulin requirement in DM patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
