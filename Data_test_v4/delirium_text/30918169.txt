30918169|a|We herein report a case of Campylobacter fetus meningoencephalitis in a patient with chronic alcoholism. C. fetus is a rare cause of meningitis. The patient presented with hallucinations and monology, and alcohol withdrawal was initially suspected. After he was unsuccessfully treated for alcohol withdrawal delirium, we diagnosed C. fetus meningoencephalitis. Ampicillin monotherapy gradually improved his clinical status. A previous report stated that C. fetus infection is associated with chronic alcoholism. In patients with chronic alcoholism and disturbed consciousness, an atypical bacterial central nervous system infection, such as C. fetus meningoencephalitis, should be considered.
