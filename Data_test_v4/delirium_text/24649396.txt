24649396|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is widely considered to be caused by amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) accumulation in the brain. Abeta is excised from amyloid-beta precursor protein through sequential cleavage by beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) and gamma-secretase. Thus, BACE1 inhibition could prevent Abeta accumulation. Here, we identified myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) as a BACE1 inhibitory molecule in rice grain extract and digest. The rice digest and IP6 significantly inhibited Abeta production in neuroblastoma cells without cytotoxicity. These results suggested that rice components, including IP6, may be promising starting materials for the development of potent and safe drugs and/or food to prevent AD.
