26834475|t|Incidence and risk factors of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing transurethral resection of prostate: a prospective cohort study.
26834475|a|AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate the occurrence of postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients undergoing transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) and to identify those factors associated with delirium. METHODS: From July 2010 to February 2015, 358 patients, aged >=65 years and undergoing TURP were prospectively enrolled. Personal, medical and cognitive data, laboratory assessments, pain intensity, preoperative medications, and details of hemodynamic control were collected as predictors of delirium. POD was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method. RESULTS: In the present study, POD occurred in 28 out of 358 cases (7.8%) after TURP, with duration of 1-4 days. The multivariate analysis showed that old age and visual analog scale pain scores were associated with POD. Marital status, body mass index, education, alcohol consumption, smoking history, preoperative psychotropic medication usage, activities of daily living scores, preoperative Mini-Mental Status Examination score, anesthesia type, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, or hypotensive episodes during surgery did not significantly correlate with the occurrence of POD. CONCLUSION: Old age and pain intensity after surgery were found as the risk factors for the development of delirium in elderly patients undergoing TURP. These findings might help develop preventive strategies to decrease POD through targeted evaluation.
