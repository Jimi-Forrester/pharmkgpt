30023996|t|Novel D-A-D based near-infrared probes for the detection of beta-amyloid and Tau fibrils in Alzheimer's disease.
30023996|a|Novel D-pi-A-pi-D probes were investigated for the detection of Abeta plaques and NFTs. The probes displayed remarkable optical properties, and DADNIR-2 possessed high affinity towards Tau and Abeta aggregates (Kd = 0.41 nM and 1.04 nM, respectively) with certain selectivity. DADNIR-2 could penetrate the BBB and label Abeta plaques in vivo.
