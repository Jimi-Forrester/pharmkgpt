33416206|a|Differentiating between subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and normal cognition (NC) remains a challenge, and reliable neuroimaging biomarkers are needed. The current study, therefore, investigated the discriminative ability of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) metrics in segregated thalamic regions and compare with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics. Twenty-three SIVD patients, 30 AD patients, and 24 NC participants underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging. The DKI metrics including mean kurtosis (MK), axial kurtosis (Kaxial ) and radial kurtosis (Kradial ) and the DTI metrics including diffusivity and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured within the whole thalamus and segregated thalamic subregions. Strategic correlations by group, thalamo-frontal connectivity, and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) were used to demonstrate the discriminative ability of DKI for SIVD, AD, and NC. Whole and segregated thalamus analysis suggested that DKI metrics are less affected by white matter hyperintensities compared to DTI metrics. Segregated thalamic analysis showed that MK and Kradial were notably different between SIVD and AD/NC. The correlation analysis between Kaxial and MK showed a nonsignificant relationship in SIVD group, a trend of negative relationship in AD group, and a significant positive relationship in NC group. A wider spatial distribution of thalamo-frontal connectivity differences across groups was shown by MK compared to FA. CDA showed a discriminant power of 97.4% correct classification using all DKI metrics. Our findings support that DKI metrics could be more sensitive than DTI metrics to reflect microstructural changes within the gray matter, hence providing complementary information for currently outlined pathogenesis of SIVD and AD.
