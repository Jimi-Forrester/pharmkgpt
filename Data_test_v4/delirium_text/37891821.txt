37891821|t|Microglial Activation: Key Players in Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy.
37891821|a|Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common brain dysfunction, which results in severe cognitive and neurological sequelae and an increased mortality rate in patients with sepsis. Depending on the stimulus, microglia (resident macrophages in the brain that are involved in SAE pathology and physiology) can adopt two polarization states (M1/M2), corresponding to altered microglial morphology, gene expression, and function. We systematically described the pathogenesis, morphology, function, and phenotype of microglial activation in SAE and demonstrated that microglia are closely related to SAE occurrence and development, and concomitant cognitive impairment. Finally, some potential therapeutic approaches that can prime microglia and neuroinflammation toward the beneficial restorative microglial phenotype in SAE were outlined.
