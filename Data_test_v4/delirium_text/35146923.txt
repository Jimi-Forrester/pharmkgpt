35146923|a|Perioperative neurological disorders are important causes of postoperative disability and even perioperative death, bringing a huge challenge to the vulnerable and increasing aging population. Perioperative neurological disorders usually contain ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and neurocognitive disorders during the perioperative period. Although a few prevention and treatment strategies have been developed for each disorder, there is still a lack of effective treatments and the underlying mechanisms are far from well-understood. This special issue is dedicated to introducing the recent advances in new strategies towards the management of perioperative neurological disorders. The issue collects research articles and reviews focusing on the neuroprotection mechanisms and application of novel technologies in perioperative neurological disorders, including machine learning and nano-delivery system. These works help to shed lights on developing novel therapeutic targets of perioperative neurological disorders in the pursuit of better recovery and prognosis of the surgical patients.
