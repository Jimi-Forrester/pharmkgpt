SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The plasma levels of Arc/Arg3.1 in 62 boys with autism and 32 healthy boys were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) was used to assess the severity of autism as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV). The Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparisons between children with autism and healthy children. The Spearman r correlation coefficient (r) was used to determine the relationship between the CARS scores among patients with autism and different variables. RESULTS: The mean plasma level of Arc/Arg3.1 protein in autism was 1.689 +- 0.917 pg/ml, significantly higher than that of healthy controls, i.e. 0.792 +- 1.056 pg/ml (p < 0.001). No significant relationship was found between plasma levels of Arc/Arg3.1 protein and CARS scores (r = -0.06; p > 0.05) or age (r = -0.27; p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The mean plasma level of Arc/Arg3.1 protein was higher in children with autism than in controls, suggesting that Arc/Arg3.1 could be a potential early blood biomarker for diagnosis of autism.
