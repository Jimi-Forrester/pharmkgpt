35055275|t|Biocompatible Electrochemical Sensor Based on Platinum-Nickel Alloy Nanoparticles for In Situ Monitoring of Hydrogen Sulfide in Breast Cancer Cells.
35055275|a|Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), an endogenous gasotransmitter, is produced in mammalian systems and is closely associated with pathological and physiological functions. Nevertheless, the complete conversion of H2S is still unpredictable owing to the limited number of sensors for accurate and quantitative detection of H2S in biological samples. In this study, we constructed a disposable electrochemical sensor based on PtNi alloy nanoparticles (PtNi NPs) for sensitive and specific in situ monitoring of H2S released by human breast cancer cells. PtNi alloy NPs with an average size of 5.6 nm were prepared by a simple hydrothermal approach. The conversion of different forms of sulfides (e.g., H2S, HS-, and S2-) under various physiological conditions hindered the direct detection of H2S in live cells. PtNi NPs catalyze the electrochemical oxidation of H2S in a neutral phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.0). The PtNi-based sensing platform demonstrated a linear detection range of 0.013-1031 microM and the limit of detection was 0.004 microM (S/N = 3). Moreover, the PtNi sensor exhibited a sensitivity of 0.323 muA muM-1 cm-2. In addition, the stability, repeatability, reproducibility, and anti-interference ability of the PtNi sensor exhibited satisfactory results. The PtNi sensor was able to successfully quantify H2S in pond water, urine, and saliva samples. Finally, the biocompatible PtNi electrode was effectively employed for the real-time quantification of H2S released from breast cancer cells and mouse fibroblasts.
