31208706|a|BACKGROUND: The e4 isoform of apolipoprotein E (apoE4) is a major genetic risk factor for the development of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), and its modification has been an intense focus for treatment of AD during recent years. METHODS: We investigated the binding of apoE, a peptide corresponding to its low-density lipoprotein receptor binding domain (amino acids 133-152; ApoEp), and modified ApoEp to amyloid precursor protein (APP) and their effects on amyloid-beta (Abeta) production in cultured cells. Having discovered a peptide (6KApoEp) that blocks the interaction of apoE with N-terminal APP, we investigated the effects of this peptide and ApoEp on AD-like pathology and behavioral impairment in 3XTg-AD and 5XFAD transgenic mice. RESULTS: ApoE and ApoEp, but not truncated apoE lacking the low-density lipoprotein receptor binding domain, physically interacted with N-terminal APP and thereby mediated Abeta production. Interestingly, the addition of 6 lysine residues to the N-terminus of ApoEp (6KApoEp) directly inhibited apoE binding to N-terminal APP and markedly limited apoE- and ApoEp-mediated Abeta generation, presumably through decreasing APP cellular membrane trafficking and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. Moreover, while promoting apoE interaction with APP by ApoEp exacerbated Abeta and tau brain pathologies in 3XTg-AD mice, disrupting this interaction by 6KApoEp ameliorated cerebral Abeta and tau pathologies, neuronal apoptosis, synaptic loss, and hippocampal-dependent learning and memory impairment in 5XFAD mice without altering cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein receptor, and apoE expression levels. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that disrupting apoE interaction with N-terminal APP may be a novel disease-modifying therapeutic strategy for AD.
