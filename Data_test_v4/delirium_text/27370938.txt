27370938|a|Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent and life-threatening forms of mental illnesses affecting elderly people and has been associated with poor cognitive function. Recent evidence suggests a strong relationship between MDD and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), as well as natural processes of aging. Changes in the neuroplasticity, morphology, and neurotransmission in the brain are seem to be associated to both, MDD and neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, there is evidence that psychological stress and MDD are associated with molecular and cellular signs of accelerated aging. This review will highlight the relationship between MDD, the aging process, and neurodegenerative diseases, emphasizing the neurochemical processes involved.
