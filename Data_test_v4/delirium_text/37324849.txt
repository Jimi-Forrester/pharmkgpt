37324849|t|Functional roles and novel tools for improving-oxidative stability of polyunsaturated fatty acids: A comprehensive review.
37324849|a|Polyunsaturated fatty acids may be derived from a variety of sources and could be incorporated into a balanced diet. They protect against a wide range of illnesses, including cancer osteoarthritis and autoimmune problems. The PUFAs, omega-6, and omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in both the marine and terrestrial environments, are given special attention. The primary goal is to evaluate the significant research papers in relation to the human health risks and benefits of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acid dietary resources. This review article highlights the types of fatty acids, factors affecting the stability of polyunsaturated fatty acids, methods used for the mitigation of oxidative stability, health benefits of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and future perspectives in detail.
