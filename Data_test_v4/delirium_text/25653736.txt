25653736|t|The role of flavonoids on oxidative stress in epilepsy.
25653736|a|BACKGROUNDS: Oxidative stress can result from excessive free-radical production and it is likely implicated as a possible mechanism involved in the initiation and progression of epileptogenesis. Flavonoids can protect the brain from oxidative stress. In the central nervous system (CNS) several flavonoids bind to the benzodiazepine site on the GABAA-receptor resulting in anticonvulsive effects. OBJECTIVE: This review provides an overview about the role of flavonoids in oxidative stress in epilepsy. The mechanism of action of flavonoids and its relation to the chemical structure is also discussed. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that suggests that flavonoids have potential for neuroprotection in epilepsy.
