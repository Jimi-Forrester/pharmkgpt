9493485|t|Finding and treating depression in Alzheimer's patients: a study of the effects on patients and caregivers.
9493485|a|Unrecognized and untreated depression occurs frequently in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, adding to the agony already experienced by patient and caregiver. The authors screened AD patients living with a family caregiver for depression. Twelve patients with confirmed depression were treated in an open-label study with antidepressant medication, with dosage adjustment by a psychiatrist at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 16. Data collection occurred at baseline, Week 4, and Week 16. Depression decreased significantly (p < .01). Contrary to expectations, patient functional capacity declined (p = .045). Cognition remained unchanged (p > .05). Caregiver burden, caregiver depressive symptomatology, and quality of life of patient and caregiver remained unchanged (p > .05). The authors conclude that depression in AD can be detected if a collateral source, such as the caregiver, is available. The depression can and should be treated. More research is needed to determine the impact on patient functioning, caregiver burden, caregiver depressive symptomatology, and quality of life of patient and caregiver.
