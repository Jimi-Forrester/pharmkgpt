31861839|t|Self-Assembly in Ganglioside-Phospholipid Systems: The Co-Existence of Vesicles, Micelles, and Discs.
31861839|a|Ganglioside lipids have been associated with several physiological processes, including cell signaling. They have also been associated with amyloid aggregation in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. In biological systems, gangliosides are present in a mix with other lipid species, and the structure and properties of these mixtures strongly depend on the proportions of the different components. Here, we study self-assembly in model mixtures composed of ganglioside GM1 and a zwitterionic phospholipid, 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC). We characterize the structure and molecular dynamics using a range of complementary techniques, including cryo-TEM, polarization transfer solid state NMR, diffusion NMR, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and calorimetry. The main findings are: (1) The lipid acyl chains are more rigid in mixtures containing both lipid species compared to systems that only contain one of the lipids. (2) The system containing DOPC with 10 mol % GM1 contains both vesicles and micelles. (3) At higher GM1 concentrations, the sample is more heterogenous and also contains small disc-like or rod-like structures. Such a co-existence of structures can have a strong impact on the overall properties of the lipid system, including transport, solubilization, and partitioning, which can be crucial to the understanding of the role of gangliosides in biological systems.
