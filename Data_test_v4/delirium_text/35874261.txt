35874261|a|Objectives: Malvidin, a dietary anthocyanin can be a potent drug for the treatment of neuronal toxicity. The investigation was aimed to study the antioxidant role of malvidin against aluminum chloride (AlCl3)-induced neurotoxicity in rats. Methods: To evaluate the neuroprotective role of malvidin, the rats were divided into four different groups: group I received saline, group II received AlCl3, and groups III and IV were administered with 100 and 200 mg/kg malvidin after AlCl3 for 60 days. During the evaluation period, all the groups were subjected to a behavioral test. On the 61st day of the study, rat brains were removed and used for a neurochemical assay. Results: From the present study, malvidin ameliorated the effects of AlCl3 on behavioral parameters. Biochemical investigation revealed that oral treatment of malvidin shows neuroprotective effects through regulation of antioxidant levels and neuroinflammation in the AlCl3-exposed rats. Conclusion: The results indicate that malvidin possesses antioxidant activity via acetylcholinesterase inhibition and regulation of oxidative stress in neuronal cells. Hence, malvidin could be a potential drug in correcting Alzheimer's disease.
