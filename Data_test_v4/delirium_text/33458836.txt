33458836|a|The central nervous system (CNS) regulates and coordinates an extensive array of complex processes requiring harmonious regulation of specific genes. CNS disorders represent a large burden on society and cause enormous disability and economic losses. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used for many years in the treatment of neurological illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and depression, as the combination of TCM and Western medicine has superior therapeutic efficacy and minimal toxic side effects. Mangiferin (MGF) is an active compound of the traditional Chinese herb rhizome anemarrhenae, which has antioxidant, anti-inflammation, anti-lipid peroxidation, immunomodulatory, and anti-apoptotic functions in the CNS. MGF has been demonstrated to have therapeutic effects in CNS diseases through a multitude of mechanisms. This review outlines the latest research on the neuroprotective ability of MGF and the diverse molecular mechanisms involved.
