38535457|a|Low levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the brain have been related to neurological disorders, like Alzheimer's disease (AD). After ingestion, dietary DHA must cross the blood-brain barrier, where it is absorbed as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), due to its role as a preferential DHA carrier in the brain. This work aimed at the production of LPC-DHA extracts to be used in supplementation/food fortification intended neural enrichment in DHA. As it is rich in DHA, especially its phospholipids (PL), Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus, caught in Spring/2022) was used as a raw material. The polar lipids fraction was separated and hydrolysed with Rhizomucor miehei lipase, to enzymatically convert phosphatidylcholine (PC) into LPC. The fish (muscle and by-products) lipids fraction was used for total lipids (TL) content, lipid classes (LC) and fatty acid (FA) profile evaluation, whilst polar lipids extracts were studied for LC production and FA analysis. Muscle TL ranged between 1.45 and 4.64 g/100 g (WW), while by-products accounted for 7.56-8.96 g/100 g, with the highest contents being found in March. However, PL were more abundant in muscle (22.46-32.20% of TL). For polar lipids extracts, PL represented 50.79% of TL, among which PC corresponded to 57.76% and phosphatidylethanolamine to 42.24%. After hydrolysis, nearly half of this PC was converted into LPC. When compared to the initial PC, DHA relative content (33.6% of total FA) was significantly higher after hydrolysis: 55.6% in PC and 73.6% in LPC. Such extract, obtained from this undervalued species, may represent a promising strategy to increase DHA uptake into brain cells while allowing this species to upgrade.
