32665636|t|Effect of A/T/N imaging biomarkers on impaired odor identification in Alzheimer's disease.
32665636|a|Odor identification ability may serve as an important diagnostic biomarker in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the study is to investigate the contribution of A/T/N neuroimaging biomarkers to impaired odor identification ability in the Alzheimer's disease spectrum. In 127 participants, we compared A/T/N neuroimaging biomarkers between normosmia and hyposmia groups, and performed correlation analysis between the biomarkers and Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test (CCSIT) scores. Additionally, path analysis for odor identification ability was performed using cognitive function as a mediator. In between-group comparison, individuals with hyposmia showed higher frequency of amyloid-beta (Abeta) positivity, and lower neuropsychological test performance than those with normosmia. After correction for covariates including total cognition scores, there was no difference in the Abeta or tau burden between the normosmia and hyposmia groups, and no correlation between CCSIT scores and Abeta or tau burden. Meanwhile, cortical volumes in the lateral and medial temporal cortices were smaller in the hyposmia group and decreased with the worsening of CCSIT scores. Path analysis showed that only neurodegeneration had a direct effect on odor identification, while Abeta and tau burden contributed to odor identification with the mediation of cognition. In the Alzheimer's disease spectrum, impaired odor identification ability may be attributable to neurodegeneration rather than the direct effect of Abeta or tau burden.
