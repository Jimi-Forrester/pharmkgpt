38886640|a|BACKGROUND: A range of strategies are available that can improve the outcomes of older persons particularly in relation to basic activities of daily living during and after an acute care (AC) episode. This paper outlines the original development of outcome-oriented quality indicators (QIs) in relation to common geriatric syndromes and function for the care of the frail aged hospitalized in acute general medical wards. METHODS: Design QIs were developed using evidence from literature, expert opinion, field study data and a formal voting process. A systematic literature review of literature identified existing QIs (there were no outcome QIs) and evidence of interventions that improve older persons' outcomes in AC. Preliminary indicators were developed by two expert panels following consideration of the evidence. After analysis of the data from field testing (indicator prevalence, variability across sites), panel meetings refined the QIs prior to a formal voting process. SETTING: Data was collected in nine Australian general medical wards. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 70 years and over, consented within 24 h of admission to the AC ward. MEASUREMENTS: The interRAI Acute Care - Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (interRAI AC-CGA) was administered at admission and discharge; a daily risk assessment in hospital; 28-day phone follow-up and chart audit. RESULTS: Ten outcome QIs were established which focused on common geriatric syndromes and function for the care of the frail aged hospitalized in acute general medical wards. CONCLUSION: Ten outcome QIs were developed. These QIs can be used to identify areas where specific action will lead to improvements in the quality of care delivered to older persons in hospital.
