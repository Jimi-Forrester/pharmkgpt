26440217|t|Characterization of aggregate/aggresome structures formed by polyhedrin of Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus.
26440217|a|Virus infections often lead to formation of aggregates and aggresomes in host cells. In this study, production of aggregates and aggresomes by the highly expressed protein polyhedrin of Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) at 24 h postinfection (p.i.) was detected with a fluorescent molecular dye, and verified by colocalization of polyhedrin with aggresomal markers, GFP-250 and gamma-tubulin. Polyhedrin aggregates showed hallmark characteristics of aggresomes: formation was microtubule-dependent; they colocalized with heat shock cognates/proteins of the 70-kDa family (HSC/HSP70s), ubiquitinated proteins and recruited the mitochondria. Aggregated polyhedrin protein gradually gained its active conformation accompanying progress of BmNPV infection. At 48 h p.i. recovered polyhedrin bound directly to Bombyx mori microtubule-associated protein 1-light chain 3 (BmLC3), an autophagosome marker, and was colocalized with BmLC3 to the isolation membrane of autophagosome, implying the involvement of polyhedrin in cellular autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) dramatically resulted in decrease of polyhedrin expression and polyhedra particle production. These observations suggested that highly expressed polyhedrin forms aggregate to get involved in cellular autophagy then play an important role in polyhedra production.
