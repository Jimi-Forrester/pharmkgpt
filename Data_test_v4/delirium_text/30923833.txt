30923833|t|Copper-Induced Upregulation of MicroRNAs Directs the Suppression of Endothelial LRP1 in Alzheimer's Disease Model.
30923833|a|Chronic exposure to copper and its dyshomeostasis have been linked to accelerated cognitive decline and potentially increasing risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We and others have previously demonstrated that exposure to copper through drinking water significantly increased parenchymal amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and decreased endothelial low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in mouse models of AD. In this study, we determined the underlying mechanisms that microRNA critically mediated the copper-induced loss of endothelial LRP1. In human primary microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs), microRNA-200b-3p, -200c-3p, and -205-5p were significantly elevated within the 24-h exposure to copper and returned to baseline after 48-h postexposure, which corresponded with the temporal change of LRP1 expression in these cells. Transient expression of synthetic microRNA-200b-3p, -200c-3p, or -205-5p on MVECs significantly decreased endothelial LRP1, and cotreatment of synthetic antagomirs effectively prevented the loss of LRP1 during copper exposure, collectively supporting the key regulatory role of these microRNAs in copper-induced loss of LRP1. In mice, a significant reduction of LRP1 in cortical vasculature was evident following 9 months exposure to 1.3 ppm copper in drinking water, although the levels of cortical microRNA-205-5p, -200b-3p, and -200c-3p were only marginally elevated. This, however, correlated with increased vascular accumulation of Abeta and impairment of spatial memory, indicating that copper exposure has the pivotal role in the vascular damage and development of cognitive decline.
