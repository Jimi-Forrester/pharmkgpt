37560530|a|Purpose of review: Insomnia impacts a significant proportion of older adults yet is not an inevitable consequence of aging and is amenable to intervention. The aim of this narrative review is to provide an overview of recent recommendations and empirical findings regarding the management of insomnia in older adults. Recent findings: The treatment of insomnia with cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) continues to be empirically supported and the recommended first-line intervention for adults. Accumulating evidence indicates that other non-pharmacological therapies for insomnia, such as mindfulness-based therapies, light therapy, and physical activity interventions, as well as treatment delivered by non-clinician "sleep coaches" also positively impact insomnia symptoms. Finally, recent systematic reviews offer guidelines and recommendations for pharmacological management of insomnia. Summary: CBT-I remains the recommended first-line treatment for insomnia across adult ages. There is a continued need to increase the availability and optimize the delivery of CBT-I and other therapies for older adults with insomnia to maximize treatment benefits. There is also evidence for some benefit of pharmacological agents to treat insomnia; however, these are not without risks, particularly in the geriatric population.
