7878742|t|Neuronal cdc2-like kinase.
7878742|a|Neurofilament proteins and the neuron-specific microtubule-associated protein tau are phosphorylated in vivo at sites conforming to the phosphorylation consensus motif of the cell-cycle-control protein kinase, p34cdc2-cyclin. Abnormalities in the phosphorylation of these proteins are associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as amylotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. A cdc2-like kinase composed of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) and a brain-specific regulatory subunit is proposed to be responsible for the cdc2-like phosphorylation of these neuronal proteins.
