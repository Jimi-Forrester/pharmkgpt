14753413|t|Expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) following transient cerebral ischemia.
14753413|a|It has been considered that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) is participated in the Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases, brain injury and brain ischemia. However, expression of TNFalpha after brain ischemia has not been demonstrated in detail. Therefore we examined the cellular expression of TNFalpha during and after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in mice by use of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical technique. TNFalpha mRNA expression was gradually increased in the neocortex of the ipsilateral hemisphere during ischemia and peaked at 1 hour after reperfusion. Then, the mRNA expression decreased and peaked again at 24 hours after reperfusion. TNFalpha-like immunoreactivities were observed in the process such as dendrite of neuron slightly before ischemia, and markedly increased in neurons in addition to the process of the ipsilateral hemisphere at 1 and 24 hours after ischemia. The results suggest that the expression of TNFalpha is up-regulated in the neurons after tMCAO. TNFalpha may induce ischemic neuronal cell death during ischemic insult.
