37808487|a|Background: Neuropsychiatric disturbances and chorea are less recognized consequences of polycythemia vera (PV), and their role in post-PV myelofibrosis (MF) has not been reported. Clinical features that predict post-PV MF lack specificity. Case presentation: We describe an elderly patient with PV who developed acute-onset reversible neuropsychiatric disturbances accompanied by generalized chorea and was finally diagnosed with post-PV MF after a bone marrow examination. We also reviewed four cases of late PV associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms since 1966 and analyzed their clinical characteristics and therapeutic effects. Conclusion: Our case indicates that Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-related PV is a treatable cause of late-onset chorea and that chorea may herald the deterioration of hematological parameters. Our case provides a clinically specific representation of post-PV MF. Patients with a long course of PV are recommended to undergo bone marrow re-examinations when they present with neuropsychiatric symptoms to achieve an early diagnosis of post-PV MF.
