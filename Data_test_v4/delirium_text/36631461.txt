36631461|a|Essential tremor (ET) is the most prevalent movement disorder with poorly understood etiology. Some neuroimaging studies report cerebellar involvement whereas others do not. This discrepancy may stem from underpowered studies, differences in statistical modeling or variation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition and processing. To resolve this, we investigated the cerebellar structural differences using a local advanced ET dataset augmented by matched controls from PPMI and ADNI. We tested the hypothesis of cerebellar involvement using three neuroimaging biomarkers: VBM, gray/white matter volumetry and lobular volumetry. Furthermore, we assessed the impacts of statistical models and segmentation pipelines on results. Results indicate that the detected cerebellar structural changes vary with methodology. Significant reduction of right cerebellar gray matter and increase of the left cerebellar white matter were the only two biomarkers consistently identified by multiple methods. Results also show substantial volumetric overestimation from SUIT-based segmentation-partially explaining previous literature discrepancies. This study suggests that current estimation of cerebellar involvement in ET may be overemphasized in MRI studies and highlights the importance of methods sensitivity analysis on results interpretation. ET datasets with large sample size and replication studies are required to improve our understanding of regional specificity of cerebellum involvement in ET.
