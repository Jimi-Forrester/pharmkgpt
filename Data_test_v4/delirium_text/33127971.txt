33127971|a|Oxidative stress (OS) is associated with poor oocyte quality and in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) outcomes for patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Growth hormone (GH) can function to reduce OS in some types of cells. Therefore, this prospective randomized study investigated whether GH can significantly improve OS and oocyte quality in women with PCOS. This study enrolled 109 and 50 patients with and without PCOS (controls), respectively. The patients with PCOS were randomly assigned to receive treatment with GH (PCOS-T) or not (PCOS-C). The primary outcome included markers of OS in serum and FF, and secondary outcomes were mitochondrial function in granulosa cells (GCs) and IVF-ET outcomes. The PCOS groups showed higher basal serum total oxidant status (TOS) and OS index (OSI) levels. The follicle fluid (FF) TOS and OSI and GC apoptosis rate were significantly higher, whereas the GC mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was significantly lower in the PCOS-C group than in the PCOS-T and non-PCOS control groups (P < 0.05). Significantly more oocytes were fertilised and cleavage stage embryos were produced in the PCOS-T group than in the PCOS-C group (P < 0.05). GH also improved the rates of implantation and clinical pregnancy, but not significantly (P > 0.05). This study showed that GH alleviated the TOS and OSI level in FF and improved GC mitochondrial dysfunction and oocyte quality in patients with PCOS.Clinical Trial Registration Number: This project was prospectively registered on the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on October 20, 2018.
