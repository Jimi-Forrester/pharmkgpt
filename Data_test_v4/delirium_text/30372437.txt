30372437|a|Recent interest in reversal of the hypnotic effects of anesthesia has mainly focused on overcoming a surge in GABA-mediated inhibitory signaling through activation of subcortical arousal circuits or antagonizing GABA receptors. Here we examine the reversal of anesthesia produced from non-GABA agents ketamine/xylazine and the effects of antagonists of adrenoreceptors. These antagonists vary in selectivity and produce temporally unique waking behavior post-anesthesia. We compared two antagonists with differential selectivity for alpha1- vs. alpha2-receptors, yohimbine (YOH, 1:40 selectivity) and atipamezole (ATI, 1:8500). Adult mice received intraperitoneal injections of either YOH (4.3 mg/kg), ATI (0.4 mg/kg), or saline after achieving sustained loss of righting following injection of ketamine/xylazine (ketamine: 65.0 mg/kg; xylazine: 9.9 mg/kg). Behaviors indicative of the post-anesthesia, re-animation sequence were carefully monitored and the timing of each behavior relative to anesthesia induction was compared. Both YOH and ATI hastened behaviors indicative of emergence, but ATI was faster than YOH to produce certain behaviors, including whisker movement (YOH: 21.9+-1.5 min, ATI: 17.5+-0.5 min, p = 0.004) and return of righting reflex (RORR) (YOH: 40.6+-8.8 min, ATI: 26.0+-1.2 min, p<0.001). Interestingly, although YOH administration hastened early behavioral markers of emergence relative to saline (whisking), the completion of the emergence sequence (time from first marker to appearance of RORR) was delayed with YOH. We attribute this effect to antagonism of alpha1 receptors by yohimbine. Also notable was the failure of either antagonist to hasten the re-establishment of coordinated motor behavior (e.g., attempts to remove adhesive tape on the forepaw placed during anesthesia) relative to the end of emergence (RORR). In total, our work suggests that in addition to pharmacokinetic effects, re-establishment of normal waking behaviors after anesthesia involves neuronal circuits dependent on time and/or activity.
