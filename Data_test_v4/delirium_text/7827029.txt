7827029|t|Prolines and amyloidogenicity in fragments of the Alzheimer's peptide beta/A4.
7827029|a|Although it is well accepted that the structure of amyloid fibrils is dominated by some form of antiparallel beta-sheet, there are few details on the secondary structural arrangements of the constituent peptides and how these peptides pack together in the fibril. We describe here the use of scanning proline mutagenesis to map the secondary structural roles of each residue in amyloidogenic peptide fragments of the Alzheimer's amyloid peptide beta/A4. In two series of fragments related to residues 15-23 and 12-26 of beta/A4, we show that Pro replacement of any residue in the amyloidogenic sequence LVFFAED, corresponding to residues 17-23, leads to essentially complete loss of fibril formation and to excellent peptide solubility. Since peptidyl-prolyl bonds are incapable of forming standard extended chain conformations, the results suggest that residues 17-23 make up the beta-sheet core of the fibrils formed by these fragments. In contrast to the proline replacements, alanine substitutions at residues 17, 18, and 20 have no effect on fibril formation, while replacement of Phe19 reduces fibril formation to 15% of the level found for the wild type sequence. Scanning proline mutagenesis should play a useful role in mapping the secondary structural features of larger amyloidogenic peptide sequences, including longer, physiologically relevant forms of beta/A4. In addition, these results suggest explanations for some amyloidogenic effects observed in disease-related peptides and also suggest a possible role for aggregation-inhibiting insertion of prolines in protein evolution and protein design.
