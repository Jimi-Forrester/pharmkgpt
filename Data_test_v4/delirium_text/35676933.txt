35676933|a|Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) suffer from developmental delay, intellectual disability, and an early-onset of neurodegeneration, Alzheimer's-like disease, or precocious dementia due to an extra chromosome 21. Studying the changes in anatomical, cellular, and molecular levels involved may help to understand the pathogenesis and develop target treatments, not just medical, but also surgical, cell and gene therapy, etc., for individuals with DS. Here we aim to identify key neurodevelopmental manifestations, locate knowledge gaps, and try to build molecular networks to better understand the mechanisms and clinical importance. We summarize current information about the neuropathology and neurodegeneration of the brain from conception to adulthood of foetuses and individuals with DS at anatomical, cellular, and molecular levels in humans. Understanding the alterations and characteristics of developing Down syndrome will help target treatment to improve the clinical outcomes. Early targeted intervention/therapy for the manifestations associated with DS in either the prenatal or postnatal period may be useful to rescue the neuropathology and neurodegeneration in DS.
