22922658|a|Induction of an immune response to amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein is effective in treating animal models of Alzheimer's disease. The Abeta1-15 sequence contains the antibody epitope(s), but lacks the T-cell reactive sites of full-length Abeta1-42. We tested two alternative peptide immunogens encompassing either a tandem repeat of GPGPG-linked Abeta1-15 sequences (2Abeta15-linker) or a tandem repeat Abeta1-15 without the spacer sequence (2Abeta15). Titers of the immunized sera were measured by indirect ELISA. We analyzed the production of interferon-gamma and interleukin-4 cytokine by lymphocytes and CD4 T-cells using ELISPOT and FACS assays; we then measured CD4 T-cell proliferation using a CFSE-based lymphoproliferation assay. Immunization with 2Abeta15-linker resulted in a high anti-Abeta titer of the noninflammatory T-helper 2 isotype, a lack of lymphocyte proliferation against the spacer part peptide. We observed much lower titers against the Abeta protein after immunization with 2Abeta15. Restimulation of lymphocytes with the corresponding immunogens resulted in proliferative responses, which showed that the sequential arrangement of the epitopes created junctional epitopes. The disruption of junctional epitopes through the introduction of a GPGPG spacer restored the immunogenicity against all the epitopes. Our novel immunogen with spacer may be a safer alternative to a peptide-based vaccine.
