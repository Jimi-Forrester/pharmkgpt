37250100|t|Novel dicarbonyl metabolic pathway via mitochondrial ES1 possessing glyoxalase III activity.
37250100|a|Glycation, caused by reactive dicarbonyls, plays a role in various diseases by forming advanced glycation end products. In live cells, reactive dicarbonyls such as glyoxal (GO) and methylglyoxal (MGO) are produced during cell metabolism, and these should be removed consistently. However, the dicarbonyl metabolic system in the mitochondria remains unclear. It has been speculated that the mammalian mitochondrial protein ES1 is a homolog of bacterial elbB possessing glyoxalase III (GLO3) activity. Therefore, in this study, to investigate ES1 functions and GLO3 activity, we generated ES1-knockout (KO) mice and recombinant mouse ES1 protein and investigated the biochemical and histological analyses. In the mitochondrial fraction obtained from ES1-KO mouse brains, the GO metabolism and cytochrome c oxidase activity were significantly lower than those in the mitochondrial fraction obtained from wildtype (WT) mouse brains. However, the morphological features of the mitochondria did not change noticeably in the ES1-KO mouse brains compared with those in the WT mouse brains. The mitochondrial proteome analysis showed that the MGO degradation III pathway and oxidative phosphorylation-related proteins were increased. These should be the response to the reduced GO metabolism caused by ES1 deletion to compensate for the dicarbonyl metabolism and damaged cytochrome c oxidase by elevated GO. Recombinant mouse ES1 protein exhibited catalytic activity of converting GO to glycolic acid. These results indicate that ES1 possesses GLO3 activity and modulates the metabolism of GO in the mitochondria. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show a novel metabolic pathway for reactive dicarbonyls in mitochondria.
