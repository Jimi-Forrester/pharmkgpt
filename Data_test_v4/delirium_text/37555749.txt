37555749|a|The brainstem functions as a relay and integrative brain center and plays an essential role in motor function. Whether brainstem tissue deterioration, including demyelination, affects motor function has not been studied. Understanding the potential relationship between brainstem demyelination and motor function may be useful for the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases and to understand age-related gait impairments that have no apparent cause. In this work, we investigated the associations between rapid or usual gait speeds, as integrative measures of motor function, and cerebral myelin content. In 118 individuals (age 22-94 yrs.) free of neurodegenerative diseases or cognitive impairment, myelin content was assessed as the myelin water fraction (MWF), a direct MRI measure of myelin content, and longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates (R1 and R2), which are sensitive MRI measures of myelin content. Our results indicate that participants with lower usual or rapid gait speed exhibited lower values of MWF and R1 in the main brainstem regions, which were more evident and statistically significant in the midbrain. In contrast, we found no significant associations between gait speeds and R2, an expected result since various physiological factors confound R2. These original findings provide evidence that the level of brainstem myelination may affect gait performance among cognitively unimpaired adults who are free from any clinically detectable neurodegenerative diseases. Further studies are needed to understand the longitudinal changes in brainstem myelination with aging and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
