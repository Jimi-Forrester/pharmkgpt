32468130|t|Tetraspanin 7 and its closest paralog tetraspanin 6: membrane organizers with key functions in brain development, viral infection, innate immunity, diabetes and cancer.
32468130|a|Tetraspanin (TSPAN) protein family forms a family of transmembrane proteins that act as organizers/scaffold for other proteins. TSPANs are primarily present on plasma membranes although they are also found in other biological membranes. They are organized in tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs), which allow spatiotemporal tuning of protein functions through the control of their membrane localization. TSPAN6 and TSPAN7 are close paralogs expressed in different tissues, TSPAN7 being highly expressed in the brain. Their functions only started to be unveiled in the late 2000's and are still poorly understood. Here, we introduce how TSPAN7 was first highlighted has a protein mutated in some forms of X-linked mental retardation, which was later proposed to be caused by defects in neuronal morphogenesis and synaptic transmission. We then discuss the impacts TSPAN7 has on cell morphology of dendritic cells and osteoclasts, through rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton and how TSPAN7 was shown to be a target of autoantibody in patients suffering from type 1 diabetes. Finally, we are addressing the double edge sword that is TSPAN7 in cancer. In the second part of this review, we address the known roles of TSPAN6 and how this protein was shown to participate in synaptic transmission and in amyloid precursor protein secretion, which may contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathology. We conclude this review by discussing the anti-inflammatory effect of TSPAN6.
