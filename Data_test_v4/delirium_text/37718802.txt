37718802|t|Association Between Olfactory Test Data with Multiple Levels of Odor Intensity and Suspected Cognitive Impairment: A Cross-Sectional Study.
37718802|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory function decline has recently been reported to be associated with a risk of cognitive impairment. Few population-based studies have included younger adults when examining the association between olfactory test data with multiple odor intensities and suspected cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between high-resolution olfactory test data with fewer odors and suspected cognitive impairments. We also examined the differences between older and younger adults in this association. METHODS: The Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J) was administered to 1,450 participants, with three odor-intensity-level olfactometry using six different odors. Logistic regressions to discriminate suspected cognitive impairment were conducted to examine the association, adjusted for age, sex, education duration, and smoking history. Data were collected from the Program by Tohoku University Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization, with an additional olfactory test conducted between 2019 and 2021. RESULTS: We generally observed that the lower the limit of distinguishable odor intensity was, the higher the MoCA-J score was. The combination of spearmint and stuffy socks contributed most to the distinction between suspected and unsuspected cognitive impairment. Furthermore, the association was significant in women aged 60-74 years (adjusted odds ratio 0.881, 95% confidence interval [0.790, 0.983], p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate an association between the limit of distinguishable odor intensity and cognitive function. The olfactory test with multiple odor intensity levels using fewer odors may be applicable for the early detection of mild cognitive impairment, especially in older women aged 60-74 years.
