39803334|a|In this paper, we introduce MiVitals-a Mixed Reality (MR) system designed for healthcare professionals to monitor patients in wards or clinics. We detail the design, development, and evaluation of MiVitals, which integrates real-time vital signs from a biosensor-equipped wearable, Vitaliti TM. The system generates holographic visualizations, allowing healthcare professionals to interact with medical charts and information panels holographically. These visualizations display vital signs, trends, other significant physiological signals, and medical early warning scores in a comprehensive manner. We conducted a User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX) study focusing on novel holographic visualizations and interfaces that intuitively present medical information. This approach brings traditional bedside medical information to life in the real environment through non-contact 3D images, supporting rapid decision-making, vital pattern and anomaly detection, and enhancing clinicians' performance in wards. Additionally, we present findings from a usability study involving medical doctors and healthcare practitioners to assess MiVitals' efficacy. The System Usability Scale study yielded a score of 84, indicating that the MiVitals system has high usability.
