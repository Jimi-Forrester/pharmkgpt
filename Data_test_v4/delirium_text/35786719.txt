35786719|t|A 20-year experience with cryopreserved allografts as the valve replacement of choice in aortic root reconstruction for destructive endocarditis with abscess formation.
35786719|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the early- and long-term outcomes following the use of cryopreserved allografts in aortic valve endocarditis with peri-annular abscess formation. METHODS: From 2001 to 2021, 110 consecutive patients with active infective endocarditis and peri-annular abscess, underwent a cryopreserved allograft root replacement. In 100 patients (91%), the operation was performed <48 h after admission due to refractory heart failure and or septic shock. In 95 patients (86.4%), a redo operation was performed due to a prosthetic valve endocarditis. Preoperatively, 12 patients were dialysis-dependent and 30 patients suffered from a recent stroke. RESULTS: The 30-day mortality was 18% (20 patients). Freedom from reintervention was 98.3% (standard deviation: 1.7) at 1 year and 83.3% (standard deviation: 8.5) at 10 years. Four patients required a redo operation. Three patients did develop re-endocarditis. Freedom from re-endocarditis was 95% after 17 years of follow-up. Preoperative dialysis dependency (odds ratio: 22.75, 95% confidence interval: 4.79-108.14, P < 0.001), ejection fraction under 30% (odds ratio: 17.91, 95% confidence interval: 3.27-98.01, P < 0.001) and stroke within 14 days prior to operation (odds ratio: 5.21, 95% confidence interval: 1.28-21.2, P = 0.021) were incremental factors associated with the 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In aortic root endocarditis with abscesses formation, cryopreserved allografts exhibit excellent clinical performance with a low rate of reinfection and reintervention, which make its use as valve replacement a very desirable option. Dialysis dependency, ejection fraction under 30% and recent stroke have the highest impact on the 30-day mortality.
