39063013|a|Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide. While much of post-stroke recovery is focused on physical rehabilitation, post-stroke dementia (PSD) is also a significant contributor to poor functional outcomes. Predictive tools to identify stroke survivors at risk for the development of PSD are limited to brief screening cognitive tests. Emerging biochemical, genetic, and neuroimaging biomarkers are being investigated in an effort to unveil better indicators of PSD. Additionally, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, NMDA receptor antagonists, dopamine receptor agonists, antidepressants, and cognitive rehabilitation are current therapeutic options for PSD. Focusing on the chronic sequelae of stroke that impair neuroplasticity highlights the need for continued investigative trials to better assess functional outcomes in treatments targeted for PSD.
