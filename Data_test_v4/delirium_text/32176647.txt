32176647|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular disease is a common cause of dementia in older adults, and potentially preventable with early intervention. Oxylipins are produced from the oxidation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) possessing potent vascular effects. Oxylipins generated from the cytochrome P450 pathway are enzymatically converted to diols by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH); sEH products have been associated with small vessel ischemic disease. Little is known about oxylipins' impact on markers of dementia risk. OBJECTIVE: An exploratory examination of the association between omega-6 and omega-3 derived oxylipins, brain MRI, and cognition. METHODS: Thirty-seven non-demented participants with controlled hypertension (mean age 65.6 years) were enrolled in a dementia prevention study investigating fish oil and lipoic acid on preserving cognitive function. Baseline associations between plasma oxylipins, white matter hyperintensity (WMH), and Trails-B were examined using linear regression. P450-derived diol/epoxide ratio was an indirect measure of sEH activity. RESULTS: Omega-6 derived 9-HODE was associated with increased WMH (p = 0.017) and reduced grey matter volume (p = 0.02). Omega-6 P450-derived diol/epoxide ratio 9,10-DiHOME/9,10-EpOME was associated with increased WMH (p = 0.035) and poorer performance on Trails-B (p = 0.05); ratio14,15-DHET/14,15-EET was associated with increased WMH (p = 0.045). Omega-3 P450-derived diol/epoxide ratio 19,20-DiHDPE/19,20-EpDPE was associated with increased WMH (p = 0.04) and poorer performance on Trails-B (p = 0.04). Arachidonic acid was associated with better performance on Trails-B (p = 0.012); Omega-3 derived 16,17-EpDPE was associated with decreased WMH (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of arachidonic acid, it was specific oxylipin products, not their parent PUFAs, that were associated with unfavorable and favorable MRI and cognitive markers of dementia risk.
