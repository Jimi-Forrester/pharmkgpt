33154851|a|Central nervous system (CNS) viral infections result in the clinical syndromes of aseptic meningitis or encephalitis. Although the primary target of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the respiratory system, it is increasingly being recognized as a neuropathogen. The hallmark clinical feature is altered mental status, ranging from mild confusion to deep coma. Most patients with encephalopathy or encephalitis are critically ill. We present a case of COVID-19-related encephalitis who presented with acute delirium and new-onset seizures. The patient responded well to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins and rituximab.
