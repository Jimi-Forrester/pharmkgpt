31830165|t|Highly specific detection of Abeta oligomers in early Alzheimer's disease by a near-infrared fluorescent probe with a "V-shaped" spatial conformation.
31830165|a|In this report, we demonstrate a "V-shaped" NIRF probe PTO-29, which can monitor Abeta oligomers with high selectivity. PTO-29 was designed and showed significant response to Abeta oligomers in the fluorescence spectral tests and good properties. In vivo imaging results indicate that 4 month APP/PS1 AD mice have higher signals in the brain than age-matched wild type mice.
