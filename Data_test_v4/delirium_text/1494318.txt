1494318|a|Recent studies have shown that compensatory processes have an important role in counteracting the neurodegenerative changes underlining Alzheimer's disease (AD), much like their well known role in Parkinson's disease (PD). In the light of these reports, we review the findings of the positive correlation existing between the appearance of extra-pyramidal symptoms and an increased rate of progression in AD patients. We propose that this correlated symptomatology arises from the wasting of globally shared compensatory resources, manifested both in an increasing inability to compensate for persisting sub-clinical nigral lesions, and in enhanced AD deterioration rate. Our hypothesis gains support from various clinical reports and by the neural modeling of synaptic changes in AD.
