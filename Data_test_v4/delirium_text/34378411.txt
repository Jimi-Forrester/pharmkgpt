34378411|a|In patients admitted to hospital, preoperative mild cognitive impairment predicts postoperative complications. The effect of mild cognitive impairment on discharge readiness among the day stay surgery population is unknown. Our aims were to determine the incidence of impaired cognitive performance at discharge after day stay endoscopy and whether pre-existing mild cognitive impairment was associated with its development. A single-centre cohort study of elective day stay endoscopy patients was undertaken. Over a three-month period, data were collected from 69 patients aged 65 years and over. Patients were cognitively assessed on admission and discharge using the Montreal cognitive assessment tool and the three-minute diagnostic confusion assessment method. At baseline, patients who scored 1.5 or more standard deviations below age-adjusted levels on the Montreal cognitive assessment tool in conjunction with a subjective memory complaint were classified as having mild cognitive impairment. At discharge, patients were classified as having impaired cognitive performance if there was a reduction in the Montreal cognitive assessment tool score by at least two points. We also assessed delirium and subsyndromal delirium at discharge using the three-minute diagnostic confusion assessment method. We identified mild cognitive impairment in 23 patients (33.3%) on admission, and impaired performance on the Montreal cognitive assessment tool test at discharge in 35 (50.7%) patients. There was no association between mild cognitive impairment on admission and impaired cognitive performance at discharge (50.0% versus 51.1%, P = 0.94). This study demonstrates that evidence of impaired cognitive performance on the Montreal cognitive assessment tool testing is present after day stay endoscopy in over 50% of elderly patients, but this is not associated with preoperative cognitive status.
