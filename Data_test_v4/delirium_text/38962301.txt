38962301|a|Emergence delirium is a common postoperative complication in patients undergoing general anesthesia, especially in children. In severe cases, it can cause unnecessary self-harm, affect postoperative recovery, lead to parental dissatisfaction, and increase medical costs. With the widespread use of inhalation anesthetic drugs (such as sevoflurane and desflurane), the incidence of emergence delirium in children is gradually increasing; however, its pathogenesis in children is complex and unclear. Several studies have shown that age, pain, and anesthetic drugs are strongly associated with the occurrence of emergence delirium. Alterations in central neurophysiology are essential intermediate processes in the development of emergence delirium. Compared to adults, the pediatric nervous system is not fully developed; therefore, the pediatric electroencephalogram may vary slightly by age. Moreover, pain and anesthetic drugs can cause changes in the excitability of the central nervous system, resulting in electroencephalographic changes. In this paper, we review the pathogenesis of and prevention strategies for emergence delirium in children from the perspective of brain electrophysiology-especially for commonly used pharmacological treatments-to provide the basis for understanding the development of emergence delirium as well as its prevention and treatment, and to suggest future research direction.
