35562681|t|Older adults' perspectives on rehabilitation and recovery one year after a hip fracture - a qualitative study.
35562681|a|BACKGROUND: In order to improve quality of care and recovery after hip fracture we need to include the perspectives of the individual older adults when evaluating different rehabilitation interventions. The aim of this study was therefore to explore older adults' experiences of their rehabilitation after a hip fracture and of the recovery process during the 12 months following the fracture. METHODS: Qualitative interviews were conducted with 20 older adults (70-91 years of age) who had participated in a randomised controlled trial evaluating the effects of early discharge followed by geriatric interdisciplinary home rehabilitation compared to in-hospital care according to a multifactorial rehabilitation program. Ten participants from each group were interviewed shortly after the one-year follow-up when the study was completed. Data were analysed with qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The analysis resulted in four themes: Moving towards recovery with the help of others; Getting to know a new me; Striving for independence despite obstacles; and Adapting to an altered but acceptable life. The participants emphasised the importance of having access to rehabilitation that was provided by skilled staff, and support from family members and friends for well-being and recovery. They experienced a change in their self-image but strove for independence despite struggling with complications and functional limitations and used adaptive strategies to find contentment in their lives. CONCLUSIONS: Rehabilitation interventions provided by competent health care professionals, as well as support from family members and friends, were emphasised as crucial for satisfactory recovery. Participants' experiences further highlight the importance of targeting both physical and psychological impacts after a hip fracture. To improve recovery, rehabilitation providers should customise future interventions to suit each individual s wishes and needs and provide rehabilitation in various settings throughout the recovery process. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered at Current Controlled Trials Ltd, ICRCTN 15738119 . Date of registration 16/06/2008, retrospectively registered.
