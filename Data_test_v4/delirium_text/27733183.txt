27733183|a|BACKGROUND: Femoral neck fractures are common injuries in the geriatric population associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Studies have shown outcomes can be positively influenced by early postoperative mobilization. The supercapsular percutaneously assisted total hip (SuperPath) surgical technique has been shown to lead to early mobilization for osteoarthritic total hip replacement patients and as such has the potential to provide similar benefits in fracture patients. This manuscript provides a detailed description of this technique using hemiarthroplasty to treat femoral neck fractures and presents the first case series of this application. METHODS: Seventeen patients with femoral neck fractures managed with this technique at two separate institutions were reviewed. In an attempt to minimize blood loss and enhance early mobilization, hemiarthroplasty utilizing the SuperPath technique was performed. The authors noticed decreased blood loss, operative time, and postoperative narcotic usage when compared to their previous experiences using traditional techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Early mobilization following femoral neck fractures has been shown to decrease mortality and morbidity. There is little existing literature on the use of tissue-sparing surgical techniques for this application, and none details the use of the SuperPath technique for it. The described case reports suggest the technique is a viable option for bipolar hemiarthroplasty to treat femoral neck fractures. Appropriately designed future studies are needed to confirm findings and definitively compare outcomes to traditional approaches.
