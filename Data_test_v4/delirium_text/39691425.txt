39691425|t|Global, regional, and national burdens of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia in the elderly population from 1999 to 2019: A trend analysis based on the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.
39691425|a|Dementia represents a significant health issue, afflicting both patients and their families. To assess the global trends in the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias in the elderly population, the Global Burden of Disease Study (1999-2019) was used. The average annual percentage change (AAPC) was estimated using linear regression. Stratified analysis of the global trends by age, sex, region, national level, and social development index (SDI) were also performed. The global incidence of AD and other dementias increased from 507.96 per 100,000 in 1990 to 569.39 per 100,000 in 2019, showing a significant increase in this period. In males, the incidence increased from 387.56 per 100,000 population in 1990 to 462.40 per 100,000 in 2019 (AAPC = 0.61), whereas females experienced a slower rise (AAPC = 0.31) and had a higher incidence in 2019 (662.93 per 100,000 population). The most significant increase was observed in individuals aged 60-64 and those in the middle-SDI quintile. Regionally, the high-income Asia Pacific had the highest incidence (890.01 per 100,000 population) and DALYs (3043.86 per 100,000) in AD and other dementias in 2019. As for national trends, Japan had the most pronounced increase in the incidence and DALYs of AD and other dementias during the 1990-2019 period. These findings highlight the growing burden of dementias on life expectancy at a population level, which is significant for healthcare professionals and decision-makers to conduct the ongoing debate on the policy of AD and other dementias.
