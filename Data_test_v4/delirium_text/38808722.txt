38808722|t|hdWGCNA and Cellular Communication Identify Active NK Cell Subtypes in Alzheimer's Disease and Screen for Diagnostic Markers through Machine Learning.
38808722|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a recognized complex and severe neurodegenerative disorder, presenting a significant challenge to global health. Its hallmark pathological features include the deposition of beta-amyloid plaques and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Given this context, it becomes imperative to develop an early and accurate biomarker model for AD diagnosis, employing machine learning and bioinformatics analysis. METHODS: In this study, single-cell data analysis was employed to identify cellular subtypes that exhibited significant differences between the diseased and control groups. Following the identification of NK cells, hdWGCNA analysis and cellular communication analysis were conducted to pinpoint NK cell subset with the most robust communication effects. Subsequently, three machine learning algorithms-LASSO, Random Forest, and SVM-RFE-were employed to jointly screen for NK cell subset modular genes highly associated with AD. A logistic regression diagnostic model was then designed based on these characterized genes. Additionally, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of model genes was established. Furthermore, unsupervised cluster analysis was conducted to classify AD subtypes based on the model genes, followed by the analysis of immune infiltration in the different subtypes. Finally, Spearman correlation coefficient analysis was utilized to explore the correlation between model genes and immune cells, as well as inflammatory factors. RESULTS: We have successfully identified three genes (RPLP2, RPSA, and RPL18A) that exhibit a high association with AD. The nomogram based on these genes provides practical assistance in diagnosing and predicting patients' outcomes. The interconnected genes screened through PPI are intricately linked to ribosome metabolism and the COVID-19 pathway. Utilizing the expression of modular genes, unsupervised cluster analysis unveiled three distinct AD subtypes. Particularly noteworthy is subtype C3, characterized by high expression, which correlates with immune cell infiltration and elevated levels of inflammatory factors. Hence, it can be inferred that the establishment of an immune environment in AD patients is closely intertwined with the heightened expression of model genes. CONCLUSION: This study has not only established a valuable diagnostic model for AD patients but has also delved deeply into the pivotal role of model genes in shaping the immune environment of individuals with AD. These findings offer crucial insights into early AD diagnosis and patient management strategies.
