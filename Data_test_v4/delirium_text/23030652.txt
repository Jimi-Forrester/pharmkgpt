23030652|a|Assessment of trace elements such as Cu, Zn, and Se in patients with neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), may be useful in etiologic studies and in assessing the risk of developing these conditions. A prototype point-of-care (POC) instrument based on monochromatic x-ray fluorescence (M-XRF) was assembled and evaluated for the determination of Cu, Zn, and Se in whole blood, plasma, and urine. The prototype instrument was validated using certified reference materials for Cu and Zn in serum/plasma, and the reported bias and relative imprecision were <10%. The M-XRF prototype performance was further assessed using human specimens collected from AD and PD subjects, and was found to be satisfactory (<20% bias) for monitoring Cu and Zn levels in plasma and whole blood. However, the prototype M-XRF sensitivity was not sufficient for quantifying Cu, Zn, or Se in urine. Nonetheless, while validating the prototype instrument, body fluids (whole blood, plasma, and urine) were collected from 19 AD patients, 23 PD patients, and 24 controls specifically for trace element analysis using well-validated methods based on inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). This limited biomonitoring study provided robust data for up to 16 elements including Sb, As, Ba, Cd, Cs, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Mo, Se, Tl, Sn, Zn, and U in plasma, whole blood, and urine. The results did not indicate any significant differences in most trace elements studied between AD or PD patients compared to controls, although the sample size is limited. A statistically significant increase in plasma Se was identified for PD patients relative to AD patients, but this could be due to age differences.
