36431232|t|A Clinician's View of Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome.
36431232|a|The purpose of this article is to improve recognition and treatment of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. It is well known that Korsakoff syndrome is a chronic amnesia resulting from unrecognized or undertreated Wernicke encephalopathy and is caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. The clinical presentation of thiamine deficiency includes loss of appetite, dizziness, tachycardia, and urinary bladder retention. These symptoms can be attributed to anticholinergic autonomic dysfunction, as well as confusion or delirium, which is part of the classic triad of Wernicke encephalopathy. Severe concomitant infections including sepsis of unknown origin are common during the Wernicke phase. These infections can be prodromal signs of severe thiamine deficiency, as has been shown in select case descriptions which present infections and lactic acidosis. The clinical symptoms of Wernicke delirium commonly arise within a few days before or during hospitalization and may occur as part of a refeeding syndrome. Wernicke encephalopathy is mostly related to alcohol addiction, but can also occur in other conditions, such as bariatric surgery, hyperemesis gravidarum, and anorexia nervosa. Alcohol related Wernicke encephalopathy may be identified by the presence of a delirium in malnourished alcoholic patients who have trouble walking. The onset of non-alcohol-related Wernicke encephalopathy is often characterized by vomiting, weight loss, and symptoms such as visual complaints due to optic neuropathy in thiamine deficiency. Regarding thiamine therapy, patients with hypomagnesemia may fail to respond to thiamine. This may especially be the case in the context of alcohol withdrawal or in adverse side effects of proton pump inhibitors combined with diuretics. Clinician awareness of the clinical significance of Wernicke delirium, urinary bladder retention, comorbid infections, refeeding syndrome, and hypomagnesemia may contribute to the recognition and treatment of the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.
