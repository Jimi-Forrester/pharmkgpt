36018154|a|Neurodegeneration affects a large number of cell types including neurons, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes, and neural stem cells. Neural stem cells can generate new neuronal populations through proliferation, migration, and differentiation. This neurogenic potential may be a relevant factor to fight neurodegeneration and aging. In the last years, we can find growing evidence suggesting that melatonin may be a potential modulator of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. The lack of therapeutic strategies targeting neurogenesis led researchers to explore new molecules. Numerous preclinical studies with melatonin observed how melatonin can modulate and enhance molecular and signaling pathways involved in neurogenesis. We made a special focus on the connection between these modulation mechanisms and their implication in neurodegeneration, to summarize the current knowledge and highlight the therapeutic potential of melatonin.
