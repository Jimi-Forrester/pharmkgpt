35390029|a|INTRODUCTION: The preoperative evaluation of Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients for subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) includes the assessment of the neuropsychological status of the patient. A widely used preoperative test is the Mattis Dementia rating scale (MDRS). However, the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) has also been proven to be a sensitive, time-sparing tool with high diagnostic validity in PD. We evaluate the utility of the MoCA as a preoperative screening test for PD patients undergoing bilateral STN-DBS. METHODS: In this single-centre, retrospective study, we analysed pre- and postoperative assessments of MoCA, MDRS, Movement disorder society-Unified PD Rating Scale-motor examination, PD Questionnaire-39 and levodopa equivalent daily dose. Longitudinal outcome changes were analysed using paired t-test, Pearson's correlation coefficient, linear regression and CHAID (chi-square automatic interaction detector) regression tree model. RESULTS: Clinical motor and cognitive scores of 59 patients (61.05+-7.73 years, 24 females) were analysed. The MoCA, but not the MDRS, identified significant postoperative cognitive decline in PD patients undergoing STN-DBS. The preoperative MoCA score correlated with postoperative quality of life improvement, whereas the MDRS did not. PD patients with a MoCA score <= 23 points had a significant decline of quality of life after DBS surgery compared to patients > 23 points. CONCLUSION: This study identifies the MoCA as an alternative test within the preoperative evaluation of PD patients for the detection of neuropsychological deficits and prediction of the postoperative improvement of quality of life.
