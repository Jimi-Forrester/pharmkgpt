34114053|a|BACKGROUND: Population is ageing and orthogeriatric care is an emerging research topic. PURPOSE: This bibliometric review aims to provide an overview, to investigate the status and trends in research in the field of orthogeriatric care of the most influential literature. METHODS: From the Core Collection databases in the Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge, the most influential original articles with reference to orthogeriatric care were identified in December 2020 using a multistep approach. A total of 50 articles were included and analysed in this bibliometric review. RESULTS: The 50 most cited articles were published between 1983 and 2017. The number of total citations per article ranged from 34 to 704 citations (mean citations per article: n = 93). Articles were published in 34 different journals between 1983 and 2017. In the majority of publications, geriatricians (62%) accounted for the first authorship, followed by others (20%) and (orthopaedic) surgeons (18%). Articles mostly originated from Europe (76%), followed by Asia-pacific (16%) and Northern America (8%). Key countries (UK, Sweden, and Spain) and key topic (hip fracture) are key drivers in the orthogeriatric research. The majority of articles reported about therapeutic studies (62%). CONCLUSION: This bibliometric review acknowledges recent research. Orthogeriatric care is an emerging research topic in which surgeons have a potential to contribute and other topics such as intraoperative procedures, fractures other than hip fractures or elective surgery are related topics with the potential for widening the field to research.
