33984006|t|Stroke outcome assessment: Optimizing cutoff scores for the Longshi Scale, modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index.
33984006|a|The Longshi Scale, a visual-based scale, is reliable and valid in activity assessment, but lacks cutoff definition corresponding to classical scales such as the modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationships of the Longshi Scale with the modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index and optimize cutoff scores of these scales in stroke outcomes assessment. This is a cross-sectional study. Stroke patients were measured concurrently by the Longshi scale, modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index. Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman correlation analysis were used to analyze the differences and associations among the three scales. The receiver operating characteristic curve was performed to determine the optimal cutoff scores. A total of 5475 stroke patients (67.3% ischemic) were included in this study. There are close relationships of the Longshi Scale with adjusted modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index (r = -0.861, 0.922; p<0.001, <0.001; respectively). The activity levels assessed by adjusted modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index among different Longshi scale grades were significantly different (chi2:4217.27, 4676.55; p<0.001, <0.001; respectively). The optimal cutoff scores were adjusted modified Rankin Scale 4, 3, 3, 3, 2 for Longshi scale grade 2 to 6 (sensitivity%: 96.12, 70.24, 89.10, 96.80, 86.23, specificity%: 72.72, 98.29, 93.81, 79.82, 92.89, respectively), and Barthel Index 15, 45, 60, 75, 80 for Longshi scale grade 2 to 6 (sensitivity%: 92.54, 89.28, 91.32, 90.30, 95.65, specificity%: 95.48, 89.51, 94.02, 90.41, 90.62, respectively). In conclusion, the classification of Longshi Scale is consistent with those of modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index. We recommend the Longshi Scale as an effective supplement for modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index in assessing the outcome in acute stroke patients.
