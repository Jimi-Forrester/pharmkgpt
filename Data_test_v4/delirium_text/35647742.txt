35647742|t|A comprehensive review on the prevention and regulation of Alzheimer's disease by tea and its active ingredients.
35647742|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) has brought a heavy burden to society as a representative neurodegenerative disease. The etiology of AD combines multiple factors, concluding family, gender, head trauma, diseases and social psychology. There are multiple hypotheses explaining the pathogenesis of AD such as beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation, which lead to extracellular amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in neurons. The existing therapeutic drugs have several disadvantages including single target, poor curative effect, and obvious side effects. Tea contains many bioactive components, such as tea polyphenols (TPP), L-theanine (L-TH), tea pigment, tea polysaccharides and caffeine. The epidemiological investigations have shown that drinking tea can reduce the risk of AD. The mechanisms of tea active ingredients in the prevention and regulation of AD includes reducing the generation and aggregation of Abeta; inhibiting tau aggregation and hyperphosphorylation; inhibiting neuronal apoptosis and regulate neurotransmitters; relieving oxidative stress and neuroinflammation as well as the regulation of intestinal flora. This review summarizes the different signaling pathways that tea active ingredients regulate AD. Furthermore, we propose the main limitations of current research and future research directions, hoping to contribute to the development of natural functional foods based on tea active ingredients in the prevention and treatment of AD.
