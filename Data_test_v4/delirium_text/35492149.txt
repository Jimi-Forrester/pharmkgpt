35492149|t|A mild and metal-free synthesis of 2- and 1-alkyl/aryl/dialkyl-aminoquinolines and isoquinolines.
35492149|a|A simple synthetic strategy has been developed for the synthesis of 2- and 1-alkyl/aryl/dialkylaminoquinolines and isoquinolines from the easily available quinoline and isoquinoline-N-oxides, different amines, triflic anhydride as activating agent and acetonitrile as solvent in a one-pot reaction under metal-free conditions at 0  C to room temperature.
