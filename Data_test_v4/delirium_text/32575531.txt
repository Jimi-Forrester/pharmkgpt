32575531|a|Allium subhirsutum, known as hairy garlic, is a bulbous plant widespread in the Mediterranean area and locally used as a food and spice. In the present study, the chemical profile of the ethanolic extracts from bulbs (BE) and aerial parts (APE) were analyzed by HPLC-ESI-MSn, and antioxidant properties were evaluated by DPPH, ABTS and TEAC assays. The traditional use in the diet, and the well documented biological activity of Allium species suggest a potential as a new nutraceutical. For this reason, the potential usefulness of this food can be considered in the treatment and prevention of degenerative Alzheimer disease. For this reason, acetylcholinesterase inhibitory property was investigated. Furthermore, due to the observed presence of sulfur-containing and phenolic constituents, the cytotoxicity on tumor cells line was investigated. Results revealed significant AChE inhibitory activity for BE and APE. Both extracts exhibited also moderate antioxidant properties in the in vitro assays. Finally, limited cytotoxic activity was observed towards Human colon carcinoma and adenocarcinoma cell line, with differences between the individual parts tested. HPLC-ESI-MSn analysis showed that hairy garlic is a good source of sulphur compounds, flavonoids and phenylpropanoids derivatives, thus being a valid alternative to the common garlic (A. sativum). This work opens new opportunities for the application of A. subhirsutum as a health-promoting food.
