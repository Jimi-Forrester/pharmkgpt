28471102|a|PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a cycloplegic regimen using 0.5% tropicamide and 0.5% phenylephrine (Tropherine, Hanmi Pharm), in addition to 1% cyclopentolate, in hyperopic children. METHODS: The medical records of hyperopic patients below the age of 14 years who had undergone cycloplegic retinoscopy were retrospectively reviewed. Cycloplegic refractions were performed using one of two cycloplegic regimens. Regimen 1 was a Tropherine-added regimen comprising the administration of one drop of 1% cyclopentolate followed by two to three drops of Tropherine added at 15-minute intervals. Regimen 2 was a cyclopentolate-only regimen comprising the administration of three to four drops of 1% cyclopentolate at 15-minute intervals. The mean difference between noncycloplegic and cycloplegic refraction was compared between the two regimens. RESULTS: A total of 308 eyes of 308 hyperopic children were included. The mean difference (+-standard deviation) in the spherical equivalent (SE) between cycloplegic and noncycloplegic refraction was significantly larger in regimen 2 than in regimen 1, with values of +1.70 +- 1.03 diopters (D) and +1.25 +- 0.89 D, respectively (p=0.001). The SE change after cycloplegia was significantly different between the two regimens only in patients aged 5 years or younger (p=0.001), particularly in those with high hyperopia with an SE >=5 D (p=0.005) or fully accommodative esotropia (p=0.009). There was no significant difference between the two regimens in patients older than 5 years, regardless of the presence of high hyperopia or fully accommodative esotropia. CONCLUSIONS: The Tropherine-added regimen exerted a weaker cycloplegic effect than the cyclopentolate-only regimen, particularly in children under the age of 5 years with high hyperopia or fully accommodative esotropia. However, the difference in refraction between the two regimens was small. A Tropherine-added regimen can be effective in hyperopic children, with less associated discomfort than the instillation of cyclopentolate.
