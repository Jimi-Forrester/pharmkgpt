Therefore, it is interest to analyze amyloid-betaeta precursor protein (APP), beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), presenilin (PSEN1 and PSEN2) genes from brain tissues to gain insights. Development of potential inhibitors for these targets is of significance. EST sequences of 2898 (APP), 539 (BACE1), 786 (PSEN1) and 314 (PSEN2) genes were analyzed in this study. A contig sequences with APP (contigs 1-4), BACE1 (contigs 5-7), PSEN1 (contigs 8, 9, 10, 11), PSEN2 (contigs 13, 14) except PSEN1 (contigs 10) and PSEN2 (contigs 13) genes were identified. APP (contig 3 without translational error) was further analyzed using molecular modeling and docking to show its binding with curcumin (principal curcuminoid of turmeric) having -7.3 kcal/mol interaction energy for further consideration as a potential inhibitor.
