22778868|a|Abeta oligomers play a key role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Research into structure-function relationships of Abeta oligomers has been hampered by the lack of large amounts of homogeneous and stable material. Using computational chemistry, we designed conservative cysteine substitutions in Abeta aiming at accelerating and stabilizing assembly of Abeta dimers by an intermolecular disulfide bond without changing its folding. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that mutants AbetaS8C and AbetaM35C exhibited structural properties similar to those of Abeta wildtype dimers. Full length, mutant APP was stably expressed in transfected cell lines to study assembly of Abeta oligomers in the physiological, secretory pathway and to avoid artifacts resulting from simultaneous in vitro oxidation and aggregation. Biochemical and neurophysiological analysis of supernatants indicated that AbetaS8C generated an exclusive, homogeneous, and neurotoxic dimer, whereas AbetaM35C assembled into dimers, tetramers, and higher oligomers. Thus, molecular engineering enabled generation of bioactive, homogeneous, and correctly processed Abeta dimers in vivo.
