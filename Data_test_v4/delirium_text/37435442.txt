37435442|t|Leg Length Discrepancy After Hip Fracture Repair is Associated With Reduced Gait Speed.
37435442|a|Introduction: A negative correlation exists between functional outcomes and leg length discrepancy (LLD) following hip fracture repair. We have assessed the effects of LLD following hip fracture repair in elderly patients on 3-meter walking time, standing time, activities of daily living (ADL), and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Methods: One hundred sixty-nine patients enrolled in the STRIDE trial were identified with femoral neck, intertrochanteric, and subtrochanteric fractures that were treated with partial hip replacement, total hip replacement, cannulated screws, or intramedullary nail. Baseline patient characteristics recorded included age, sex, body mass index Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score. ADL, IADL, grip strength, sit-to-stand time, 3-meter walking time and return to ambulation status were measured at 1 year after surgery. LLD was measured on final follow-up radiographs by either the sliding screw telescoping distance or the difference from a trans-ischial line to the lesser trochanters, and was analyzed as a continuous variable using regression analysis. Results: Eighty eight patients (52%) had LLD <5 mm, 55 (33%) between 5-10 mm and 26 subjects (15%) >10 mm. Age, sex, BMI, Charlson score, and ambulation status had no significant impact on LLD occurrence. Type of procedure and fracture type did not correlate with severity of LLD. Having a larger LLD was not found to have a significant impact on post-operative ADL (P = .60), IADL (P = .08), sit-to-stand time (P = .90), grip strength (P = .14) and return to former ambulation status (P = .60), but did have a statistically significant impact on 3-meter walking time (P = .006). Discussion: LLD after hip fracture was associated with reduced gait speed but did not affect many parameters associated with recovery. Continued efforts to restore leg length after hip fracture repair are likely to be beneficial.
