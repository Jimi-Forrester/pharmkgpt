37042410|a|End-of-Life Dreams and Visions Abstract: End-of life dreams and visions (ELDVs) or so-called death bed phenomena are transcendent experiences at the end of life that can be visual, auditory and/or kinesthetic, and often include visions of (deceased) loved ones, close friends or perceptions of places, travels, bright lights, or music. ELDVs typically occur weeks to hours prior to death and may comfort the dying and prepare spiritually for the end of life. Such experiences are frequently reported by dying individuals, the prevalence varying between 30 and 80%, but in the clinical context ELDVs are usually neglected, but interpreted and treated as pathological changes in the brain that result in, and from, delirium. This article tries to enlighten the occurrence, the contents and meanings of ELDVs in dying persons as opposed to delirium and night dreams using findings from the literature and from clinical observations. Implications of these conclusions for palliative care and the therapeutic relevance of ELDVs when taking care of dying individuals and their loved ones will also be discussed.
