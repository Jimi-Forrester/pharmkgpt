37790195|a|The Geriatrics 5Ms: Medications, Mind, Mobility, what Matters most and Multicomplexity is a framework to address the complex needs of older adults. Intelligent Voice Assistants (IVAs) are increasingly popular and have potential to support health-related needs of older adults. We utilized previously collected qualitative data on older adults' views of how an IVA may address their health-related needs and ascertained their fit into the Geriatrics 5Ms framework. The codes describing health challenges and potential IVA solutions fit the framework: (1) Medications: difficulty remembering medications. SOLUTION: reminders. (2) Mind: isolation, anxiety, memory loss. SOLUTION: companionship, memory aids. (3) Mobility: barriers to exercise. SOLUTION: incentives, exercise ideas. (4) Matters most: eating healthy foods. SOLUTION: suggest and order nutritious foods, (5) Multicomplexity; managing multimorbidity. SOLUTION: symptom tracking and communicating with health care professionals. Incorporating the 5Ms framework into IVA design can aid in addressing health care priorities of older adults.
