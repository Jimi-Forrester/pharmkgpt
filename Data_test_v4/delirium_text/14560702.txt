14560702|a|The evidence supports from clinical and epidemiological studies demonstrates that the prevalence of various neurological diseases changes with gender. The reason for the gender difference in these diseases is still unclear, but accumulating evidence suggests a link between gonadal hormone, such as estrogens, levels and the incidence of these diseases. Numerous reports support the idea that immunological processes contribute to the etiopathogenesis of the neurodegenerative disease, such as, Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease; psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia or depression; multiple sclerosis or stroke. The neuroinflammation is regulated by numerous signal molecules, including cytokines. Estrogens have been shown to play a major role in inflammatory processes. One mechanisms by which estrogens could modulated the immune reaction is regulation of the cytokines expression. This article briefly describes different biological mechanisms underlying estrogen anti-inflammatory activity.
