38861272|t|Peptide-Hitchhiking for the Development of Nanosystems in Glioblastoma.
38861272|a|Glioblastoma (GBM) remains the epitome of aggressiveness and lethality in the spectrum of brain tumors, primarily due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that hinders effective treatment delivery, tumor heterogeneity, and the presence of treatment-resistant stem cells that contribute to tumor recurrence. Nanoparticles (NPs) have been used to overcome these obstacles by attaching targeting ligands to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Among these ligands, peptides stand out due to their ease of synthesis and high selectivity. This article aims to review single and multiligand strategies critically. In addition, it highlights other strategies that integrate the effects of external stimuli, biomimetic approaches, and chemical approaches as nanocatalytic medicine, revealing their significant potential in treating GBM with peptide-functionalized NPs. Alternative routes of parenteral administration, specifically nose-to-brain delivery and local treatment within the resected tumor cavity, are also discussed. Finally, an overview of the significant obstacles and potential strategies to overcome them are discussed to provide a perspective on this promising field of GBM therapy.
