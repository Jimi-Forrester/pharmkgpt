Probiotics have received much attention for their excellent ability to prevent pathogen infections. Particularly, explaining mechanism of action of probiotics against pathogen infections is important for more efficient and rational use of probiotics and the maintenance of host health. RESULTS: Here, we describe the impacts of probiotic on host resistance to pathogen infections. Our findings revealed that (I) the protective effect of oral supplementation with B. velezensis against Aeromonas hydrophila infection was dependent on gut microbiota, specially the anaerobic indigenous gut microbe Cetobacterium; (II) Cetobacterium was a sensor of health, especially for fish infected with pathogenic bacteria; (III) the genome resolved the ability of Cetobacterium somerae CS2105-BJ to synthesize vitamin B12 de novo, while in vivo and in vitro metabolism assays also showed the ability of Cetobacterium somerae CS2105-BJ to produce vitamin B12; (IV) the addition of vitamin B12 significantly altered the gut redox status and the gut microbiome structure and function, and then improved the stability of the gut microbial ecological network, and enhanced the gut barrier tight junctions to prevent the pathogen infection. CONCLUSION: Collectively, this study found that the effect of probiotics in enhancing host resistance to pathogen infections depended on function of B12 produced by an anaerobic indigenous gut microbe, Cetobacterium. Furthermore, as a gut microbial regulator, B12 exhibited the ability to strengthen the interactions within gut microbiota and gut barrier tight junctions, thereby improving host resistance against pathogen infection.
