9409382|t|Progressive myoclonus epilepsy in young adults with neuropathologic features of Alzheimer's disease.
9409382|a|Progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME) may develop in adult life. We present two patients with PME appearing around the age of 30 years in whom the disorder represented a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. This diagnosis must be considered in addition to possible Kufs' disease or myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF) when PME develops in young adults.
