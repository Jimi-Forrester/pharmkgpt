30939771|t|Design, Synthesis, and In Vitro Biological Activities of a Bio-Oxidizable Prodrug to Deliver Both ChEs and DYRK1A Inhibitors for AD Therapy.
30939771|a|Despite their side effects, cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors remain the only approved drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease patients, along with the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist memantine. In the last few years, the dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) has also been studied as a promising target for the development of new drugs for this pathology. In this context, and based on our previous characterization of bio-oxidizable prodrugs of potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, we envisioned a strategy involving the synthesis of a bio-oxidizable prodrug of both ChE and DYRK1A inhibitors. To this end, we fixed our interest on a known potent inhibitor of DYRK1A, namely INDY. The designed prodrug of both ChE and DYRK1A inhibitors was successfully synthesized, connecting both inhibitors by a carbonate link. This prodrug and its corresponding drug were then evaluated as ChEs and DYRK1A inhibitors. Remarkably, in vitro results were in accordance with the starting hypothesis, showing a relative inactivity of the prodrug against DYRK1A and ChEs and a potent inhibition of ChEs by the oxidized form. Molecular docking and kinetic studies of ChE inhibition by the active compound are also discussed in this report.
