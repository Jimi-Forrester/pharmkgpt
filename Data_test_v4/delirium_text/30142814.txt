30142814|a|The aim of the study was to study the changes in brain structure and functional connectivity in primary insomnia (PI) patients, as well as to explore the biological characteristics of PI abnormality and the pathophysiological mechanism underlying the brain structure and the abnormal functional connectivity under depression.Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) technique and resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI) techniques were used to investigate the brain structure and rs-fc in PI and light-moderate primary insomnia with depression (PID) patients; healthy individuals were used as the normal control (NC) group. The differences between the 3 groups, the correlation between the brain network connection of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and clinical information were compared.Compared with the NC group, patients in PI and PID groups showed changes in brain structure and brain functional connectivity, which might be related to the pathophysiological mechanism of primary insomnia. PI patients had enhanced connections in the left anterior cingulate cortex/insula, left posterior cingulate, and the right limbic lobe/cingulate gyrus/paracingulate gyrus with ACC. Compared with PI patients, PID patients had weaker brain functional connectivity in the left corpus callosum/posterior cingulate with ACC and enhanced functional connectivity in the frontal and limbic lobes with ACC, suggesting that PI patients with depression had abnormal brain network connection.Primary insomnia has abnormalities in intracephalic multisystem structure and neural network connection. The interaction and influence between depression and insomnia aggravate the cognitive function damage. This study provided the theoretical basis for exploring the neuropathology underlying the PID disorder and cognitive function.
