34316627|a|BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) causes dysphagia and dementia, both of which are risk factors for malnutrition. Gastrostomy is used to sustain enteral intake in neurodegenerative diseases and specifically improves outcomes in ALS, but its indications and outcomes in HD are understudied. OBJECTIVE: To explore the indications and outcomes for gastrostomy for HD. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of all HD admissions in the National Inpatient Sample. Logistic regression models compared the patient- and hospital-level characteristics associated with gastrostomy placement in HD and the prevalence of associated diagnoses in HD vs. ALS gastrostomy patients. We also examined in-hospital mortality, length of stay (LOS), and discharge status. RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2010, 5.12% (n = 1614) of HD admissions included gastrostomy tube placement. Gastrostomy patients were more likely to be Black (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.55, 95% CI: 1.09-2.21) and have Medicare coverage (AOR 1.43, 95% CI: 1.0-2.05). The most common comorbidities were aspiration pneumonia (34.1%), dementia (31.3%), malnutrition (30.3%), and dysphagia (29.5%). Dementia and delirium were associated with discharge type but not LOS. Aspiration pneumonia, sepsis, and Elixhauser comorbidity index were associated with LOS but not discharge type. Compared to 7908 ALS gastrostomy patients, those with HD more frequently had aspiration pneumonia (34.1% vs. 20.5%, p < 0.0001), sepsis (28.1% vs. 13.7%, p < 0.0001), prolonged LOS (OR 1.14, 95% CI: 1.02-1.28), and skilled nursing facility discharge (p < 0.0001, Wald chi square test). CONCLUSIONS: Gastrostomy is frequently performed in HD patients with dementia and aspiration pneumonia who are at increased risk for negative hospitalization outcomes.
