31920356|a|BACKGROUND: Interactions between environmental factors, such as diet and lifestyle, and metabolic pathways are pivotal in understanding aging mechanisms. hNAA40, Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), and NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT-1) have been shown to exert important biological processes, including stress response and aging. METHODS: hNAA40, NAMPT, and SIRT-1 mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were quantitated in 30 lean adult volunteers of normal weight, 30 obese, 20 drug-naive obese Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and 30 obese T2DM on Metformin. Similarly, hNAA40, NAMPT, and SIRT-1 expression in PBMC were quantitated in 36 normal healthy adults randomly assigned to three different groups (Glucose or Whey proteins or lipids; 300 kcal). Blood samples were obtained at 1, 2, and 3 hrs after the macronutrient intake. RESULTS: There was an increase in hNAA40 and a decrease in NAMPT and SIRT-1 expression in PBMC from T2DM. Metformin treatment reverted hNAA40, NAMPT, and SIRT-1 expression levels to normal levels. Glucose intake resulted in a significant increase in expression of hNAA40 at 1 hr and decreased significantly at 3 hrs post intake. Lipid intake resulted in an increase in expression of hNAA40 at 2 hr post intake and returned to normal levels at 3 hrs. Neither glucose nor lipid intake resulted in a significant change in NAMPT or SIRT-1 expression. Whey proteins resulted in significantly lower expression of NAMPT at 3 hrs and did not alter the expression levels of SIRT-1 significantly. CONCLUSION: hNAA40, NAMPT, and SIRT-1 pathway could play a role in the determination of the healthy life-span. Metformin modulates this pathway.
