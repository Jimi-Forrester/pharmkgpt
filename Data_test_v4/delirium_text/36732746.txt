36732746|t|Systematic review of structured care pathways in major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.
36732746|a|BACKGROUND: Structured care pathways (SCPs) consist of treatment algorithms that patients advance through with the goal of achieving remission or response. These SCPs facilitate the application of current evidence and adequate treatment, which potentially benefit patients with mood disorders. The aim of this systematic review was to provide an updated synthesis of SCPs for the treatment of depressive disorders and bipolar disorder (BD). METHOD: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase were searched through June 2022 for peer-reviewed studies examining outcomes of SCPs. Eligibility criteria included being published in a peer-reviewed journal in the English language, reporting of intervention used in the SCP, and having quantitative outcomes. Studies Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess quality of RCTs. RESULTS: Thirty-six studies including 15,032 patients were identified for qualitative synthesis. Six studies included patients with BD. The studies were highly heterogeneous in design, outcome measures, and algorithms. More than half of the studies reported superiority of SCPs over treatment as usual, suggesting that the standardized structure and consistent monitoring inherent in SCPs may be contributing to their effectiveness. We also found accumulating evidence supporting feasibility of SCPs in different settings, although dropout rates were generally higher in SCPs. The studies included were limited to being published in peer-reviewed journals in English language. The heterogeneity of studies did not allow quantitative evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our study suggest that SCPs are equally or more effective than treatment as usual in depression and BD. Further studies are required to ascertain their effectiveness, particularly for BD, and to identify factors that influence their feasibility and success.
