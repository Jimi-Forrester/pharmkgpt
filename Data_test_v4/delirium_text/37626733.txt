37626733|a|This review explores the biological activity and structural diversity of steroids and related isoprenoid lipids, with a particular focus on compounds containing an oxirane ring. These natural compounds are derived from fungi, fungal endophytes, as well as extracts of plants, algae, and marine invertebrates. To evaluate their biological activity, an extensive examination of refereed literature sources was conducted, including in vivo and in vitro studies and the utilization of the QSAR method. Notable properties observed among these compounds include strong anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic, antiproliferative, anti-hypercholesterolemic, antiparkinsonian, diuretic, anti-eczematic, anti-psoriatic, and various other activities. Throughout this review, 3D graphs illustrating the activity of individual steroids are presented, accompanied by images of selected terrestrial or marine organisms. Furthermore, this review provides explanations for specific types of biological activity associated with these compounds. The data presented in this review are of scientific interest to the academic community and carry practical implications in the fields of pharmacology and medicine. By analyzing the biological activity and structural diversity of steroids and related isoprenoid lipids, this review offers valuable insights that contribute to both theoretical understanding and applied research. This review draws upon data from various authors to compile information on the biological activity of natural steroids containing an oxirane ring.
