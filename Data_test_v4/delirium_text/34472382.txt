34472382|t|A systematic review of carbohydrate-based bioactive molecules for Alzheimer's disease.
34472382|a|The abundance, low cost, high density of functional groups and ease of purification of carbohydrates are among the most important features that make them a prime candidate for designing therapeutics. Several carbohydrate-based molecules, of both natural and synthetic origin, are known for their wide range of therapeutic activities. The incorporation of a carbohydrate moiety not only retains the pharmacological characteristics of a molecule but also improves its activity. Several sugar conjugates have been designed and reported to inhibit acetylcholinesterase, beta-amyloid and tau aggregation. This systematic review provides a brief overview of carbohydrate-based bioactive molecules having anti-Alzheimer's activity along with improved therapeutic potential. Most importantly, several reported carbohydrate-based molecules for Alzheimer's disease act on beta-amyloid aggregation, tau protein, cholinesterase and oxidative stress, with enhanced pharmacokinetic and mechanistic properties. The prospect of designing carbohydrate-based molecules for Alzheimer's disease will definitely provide potential opportunities to discover novel carbohydrate-based drugs.
