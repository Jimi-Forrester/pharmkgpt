38637745|a|BACKGROUND: Fat to muscle mass ratio (FMR), a novel index integrating fat and muscle composition, has garnered attention in age-related conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and neurodegenerative diseases. Despite this research on the relationship between FMR and cognitive impairment (CI) in T2DM remains scarce. This study aimed to investigate the sex-specific association between FMR and CI in elderly T2DM patients. METHODS: A total of 768 elderly (> 60 years) T2DM in-patients (356 men and 412 women) were recruited from the Department of Endocrinology at Tianjin Nankai University affiliated hospital. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) was used to assess body composition, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to evaluate cognitive performance. T2DM patients were categorized into normal cognitive function (NC) and cognitive impairment (CI) groups based on MoCA scores and stratified by sex. Binary logistic regression was employed to examine the association between FMR and CI. RESULTS: Among the participants, 42.7% of men and 56.3% of women experienced cognitive deterioration. Women with CI exhibited lower body mass index (BMI) and skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), while men with cognitive disorders showed lower SMI, FMR, and higher fat mass index (FMI). FMR was consistently unrelated to cognition in females, irrespective of adjustment made. However, in males, FMR was significantly associated with an increasing risk of cognitive dysfunction after adjusting for demographic and clinical variables (OR: 1.175, 95% CI: 1.045-1.320, p = 0.007). Furthermore, for each 0.1 increase in FMR, the incidence of CI rose by 31.1% after additional adjustment for BMI. In males, the prevalence of CI increased sequentially across FMR quartiles (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Elderly T2DM men with high FMR had unfavorable cognitive function. FMR is independently associated with an increased risk of CI in male T2DM patients regardless of BMI.
