39222891|t|Synthesis and evaluation of lipoic acid - donepezil hybrids for Alzheimer's disease using a straightforward strategy.
39222891|a|Alzheimer's disease is associated with a progressive loss of neurons and synaptic connections in the cholinergic system. Oxidative stress contributes to neuronal damages and to the development of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Therefore, antioxidants have been widely studied to mitigate the progression of Alzheimer's disease, and among these, lipoic acid has demonstrated a neuroprotective effect. Here, we present the synthesis, the molecular modelling, and the evaluation of lipoic acid-donepezil hybrids based on O-desmethyldonepezil. As compounds 5 and 6 display a high inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (IC50 = 7.6 nM and 9.1 nM, respectively), selective against butyrylcholinesterase, and a notable neuroprotective effect, slightly better than that of lipoic acid, the present study suggests that O-desmethyldonepezil could serve as a platform for the straightforward design of donepezil hybrids.
