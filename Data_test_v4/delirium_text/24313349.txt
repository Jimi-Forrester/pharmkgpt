24313349|t|SHIP2: a "new" insulin pathway target for aging research.
24313349|a|Strong evidence suggests that systemic inflammation and central adiposity contribute to and perpetuate metabolic syndrome. All of these alterations predispose individuals to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular disease, as well as Alzheimer's disease (AD), all characterized by chronic inflammatory status. On the other hand, extensive abnormalities in insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF-II signaling mechanisms in brains with AD have been demonstrated, suggesting that AD could be a third form of diabetes. The Src homology domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 2 (SHIP2) has an important role in the insulin pathway because its over-expression causes impairment of insulin/IGF-1 signaling. Because some single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the gene encoding SHIP2 were significantly associated in T2DM patients with metabolic syndrome and some related conditions, we decided to conduct a case-control study on this gene, analyzing AD and T2DM subjects as cases and young, old, and centenarians as controls. Our results suggest a putative correlation between the the rs144989913 SNP and aging, both successful and unsuccessful, rather than age-related diseases. Because this SNP is an insertion/deletion of 28 bp, it might cause an alteration in SHIP2 expression. It is noteworthy that SHIP2 has been demonstrated to be a potent negative regulator of insulin signaling and insulin sensitivity. Many studies demonstrated the association of the insulin/IGF1 pathway with aging and longevity, so it is tempting to speculate that the found association with SHIP2 and aging might depend on its effect on the insulin/IGF-1 pathway.
