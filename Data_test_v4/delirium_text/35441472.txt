35441472|a|Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin commonly used to treat infection. However, encephalopathy is an emerging adverse effect of ceftriaxone infusion. These patients present with various symptoms, including those of neurotoxicity, that typically resolve 1 week after discontinuation of ceftriaxone. We experienced two cases of ceftriaxone-induced encephalopathy that were successfully treated by rapid removal of ceftriaxone by hemoperfusion.
