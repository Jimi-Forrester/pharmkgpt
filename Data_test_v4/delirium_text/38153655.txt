38153655|a|BACKGROUND: Climate change is leading to more extreme heat events in temperate climates that typically have low levels of preparedness. Our objective was to describe the characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of adults presenting to hospitals with heatstroke during BC's 2021 heat dome. METHODS: We conducted a review of consecutive adults presenting to 7 hospitals in BC's Lower Mainland. We screened the triage records of all patients presenting between June 25th and 30th, 2021 for complaints related to heat, and reviewed the full records of those who met heatstroke criteria. Our primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. We used Mann-Whitney U tests and logistic regression to investigate associations between patient and treatment factors and mortality. RESULTS: Among 10,247 consecutive presentations to urban hospitals during the extreme heat event, 1.3% (139; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.1-1.6%) met criteria for heatstroke. Of heatstroke patients, 129 (90.6%) were triaged into the two highest acuity levels. Patients with heatstroke had a median age of 84.4 years, with 122 (87.8%) living alone, and 101 (84.2%) unable to activate 911 themselves. A minority (< 5, < 3.6%) of patients presented within 48 h of the onset of extreme heat. Most patients (107, 77.0%) required admission, and 11.5% (16) died in hospital. Hypotension on presentation was associated with mortality (odds ratio [OR] 5.3). INTERPRETATION: Heatstroke patients were unable to activate 911 themselves, and most presented with a 48-h delay. This delay may represent a critical window of opportunity for pre-hospital and hospital systems to prepare for the influx of high-acuity resource-intensive patients.
