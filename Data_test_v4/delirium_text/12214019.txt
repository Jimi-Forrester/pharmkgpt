12214019|a|Long-term exposure to AlCl_3 resulted in 57% phospholipid (TPL) content of synaptic plasma membranes from rat brain with significant decrease in the proportion and content of most of the phospholipid classes (32%- decreases was of lesser magnitude for phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The microsomal TPL and cholesterol (CHL) content decreased by 74% composition. However, the contents of all phospholipids decreased uniformly by about 70%. fluidized in Al fed rats. The results suggest that long-term exposure of rats to Al can alter the structure/function of synaptic plasma membranes and microsomes.
