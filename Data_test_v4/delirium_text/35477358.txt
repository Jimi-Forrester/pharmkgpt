35477358|t|Prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications based on the STOPPFrail criteria in frail older patients with limited life expectancy: a cross-sectional study.
35477358|a|BACKGROUND: The recently developed Screening Tool of Older Persons' Prescriptions in Frail adults with a limited life expectancy (STOPPFrail) criteria can be helpful for screening medications (PIMs), but it is yet to be widely used in clinical practice. Herein, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of PIMs based on the STOPPFrail criteria (STOPPFrail-PIM) among frail older adults with limited life expectancy admitted to the geriatric center. METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted in the geriatric center at an academic tertiary care hospital in Korea. We evaluated frail older adults with limited life expectancy who received comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) admitted between 1 January, 2019 and 30 June, 2020. Frail older adults with limited life expectancy were identified by geriatricians with retrospective records and the prevalence of STOPPFrail-PIMs was analysed by trained pharmacists. Descriptive analysis, t-test, and chi-square test were conducted using IBM SPSS software version 25.0. RESULTS: Among 504 older adults who underwent CGA after admission, 171 frail older adults with limited life expectancy were identified by geriatricians and included in the study. An average of 11.3 +- 4.7 medications were administered regularly to each patient before admission. Overall, 97.1% (166/171) had at least one STOPPFrail-PIM, and the mean number of STOPPFrail-PIM was 4.2 +- 2.8. Drugs without clear clinical indication (A2) were the most frequent pre-admission STOPPFrail-PIM, followed by lipid-lowering therapies (B1) and neuroleptic antipsychotics (D1). The number of STOPPFrail-PIM was significantly lower at discharge than that at admission, with the decrease being the highest for A2 at 94.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Most frail older adults with limited life expectancy had at least one STOPPFrail-PIM at admission, and the rate of STOPPFrail-PIM decreased significantly at discharge after the geriatric multidisciplinary team care. Further studies are needed to investigate the association between the use of STOPPFrail-PIM and adverse consequences in frail older adults.
