32096046|t|Tau Prion-Like Propagation: State of the Art and Current Challenges.
32096046|a|It has been almost a decade since the hypothesis of active tau protein propagation in Alzheimer's disease and associated tauopathies was formally raised. We view tau propagation as a cascade of events, starting with early tau misfolding, followed by transfer to another, anatomically connected, cell, contaminating in corruption of endogenous tau in the recipient cell through a seeding mechanism of templated misfolding. These mechanisms are very similar to those of other proteinopathies and to ideas about how prion pathologies spread through the brain. Nonetheless, the specific mechanisms underlying each of these steps remains uncertain and is a fertile ground for new experimental approaches potentially requiring new experimental models. We review, here, the state of the art of the research on tau prion-like propagation and we highlight some key challenges to understanding the detailed mechanisms of cell to cell propagation.
