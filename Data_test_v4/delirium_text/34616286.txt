34616286|t|Semantic Recollection in Parkinson's Disease: Functional Reconfiguration and MAPT Variants.
34616286|a|Decline in semantic cognition in early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a leading risk factor for future dementia, yet the underlying neural mechanisms are not understood. The present study addressed this gap by investigating the functional connectivity of regions involved in semantic recollection. We further examined whether microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) risk variants, which may accelerate cognitive decline, altered the strength of regional functional connections. Cognitively normal PD and healthy elder controls underwent fMRI while performing a fame-discrimination task, which activates the semantic network. Analyses focused on disturbances in fame-modulated functional connectivity in PD for regions that govern semantic recollection and interrelated processes. Group differences were found in multiple connectivity features, which were reduced into principal components that reflected the strength of fame-modulated regional couplings with other brain areas. Despite the absence of group differences in semantic cognition, two aberrant connectivity patterns were uncovered in PD. One pattern was related to a loss in frontal, parietal, and temporal connection topologies that governed semantic recollection in older controls. Another pattern was characterized by functional reconfiguration, wherein frontal, parietal, temporal and caudate couplings were strengthened with areas that were not recruited by controls. Correlations between principal component scores and cognitive measures suggested that reconfigured frontal coupling topologies in PD supported compensatory routes for accessing semantic content, whereas reconfigured parietal, temporal, and caudate connection topologies were detrimental or unrelated to cognition. Increased tau transcription diminished recruitment of compensatory frontal topologies but amplified recruitment of parietal topologies that were unfavorable for cognition. Collectively, the findings provide a new understanding of early vulnerabilities in the functional architecture of regional connectivity during semantic recollection in cognitively normal PD. The findings also have implications for tracking cognitive progression and selecting patients who stand to benefit from therapeutic interventions.
