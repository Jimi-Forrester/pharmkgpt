38350967|a|Emerging evidence suggests a potential role for natural killer (NK) cells in neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the precise function of NK cells in these diseases remains ambiguous. The existence of two NK cell subsets, CD56bright and CD56dim NK cells, complicates the understanding of the contribution of NK cells in neurodegeneration as their functions within the context of neurodegenerative diseases may differ significantly. CD56bright NK cells are potent cytokine secretors and are considered more immunoregulatory and less terminally differentiated than their mostly cytotoxic CD56dim counterparts. Hence, this review focusses on NK cells, specifically on CD56bright NK cells, and their role in neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, it explores the mechanisms underlying their ability to enter the central nervous system. By consolidating current knowledge, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview on the role of CD56bright NK cells in neurodegenerative diseases. Elucidating their impact on neurodegeneration may have implications for future therapeutic interventions, potentially ameliorating disease pathogenesis.
