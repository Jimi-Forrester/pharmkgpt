37520470|t|Eyes on dementia: an overview of the interplay between eye movements and cognitive decline.
37520470|a|The economic and disease burden of dementia is forecasted to continue increasing. Considering its cognitive effects, timely diagnosis is important in developing a stage-based treatment plan and gathering data to support advocacy efforts and plan healthcare and social services. Eye-tracking technology has emerged as an efficient diagnostic tool in clinical practice and experimental studies. This review aimed to comprehensively analyze various aspects of eye-tracking technology, including pupillometry parameters, eye movements, eye-tracking devices, and neuropsychological tools. We conducted a systematic review retrieving articles published in the last ten years from six databases. Our results provide a complex overview for each included form of dementia/cognitive decline in terms of patient characteristics (age, sex-disaggregated by included pathologies), inclusion and exclusion criteria, devices, and neuropsychological tools. We also summarized findings on fixation stability tasks, saccadic evaluation, pupillometry, scene perception, object recognition, spatial memory, eye-tracking video tasks, and visual search. The eye-tracking method has become more common in cognitive assessments.
