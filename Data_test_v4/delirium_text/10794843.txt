10794843|a|Choline acetyltransferase activity and cognitive domain scores of Alzheimer's patients. Item scores from the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) from 389 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease were submitted to principal component analysis with orthogonal rotation. The optimal solution identified four factors that reflected the cognitive domains of attention/registration, verbal fluency/reasoning, graphomotor/praxis and recent memory. A subgroup of patients was identified for whom both the MDRS and the MMSE had been administered within the 12 months before death. Scores were assigned to these patients for the four factors. These cognitive-domain scores were then correlated with postmortem choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in the medial frontal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, and hippocampus. ChAT activity in both the medial frontal and the inferior parietal cortex significantly correlated with scores on the graphomotor/praxis factor. Medial frontal ChAT also correlated significantly with the attention/registration scores. Hippocampal ChAT correlated significantly only with recent memory scores. These results are consistent with current animal research regarding the effect of selective cholinergic lesions on behavior.
