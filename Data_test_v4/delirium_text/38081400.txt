38081400|t|Polysaccharide from Polygala tenuifolia alleviates cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease mice by alleviating Abeta damage and targeting the ERK pathway.
38081400|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Polygala tenuifolia is used in a variety of Chinese medicine prescriptions for the classic dementia treatment, and polysaccharide is an important active component in the herb. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study investigated the in vivo anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) activity of the polysaccharide PTPS from Polygala tenuifolia using the senescence-accelerated mouse/prone8 (SAMP8) model and explored its molecular mechanism to lay the foundation for the development of polysaccharide-based anti-AD drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Morris water maze test (MWM)was used to detect changes in the spatial cognitive ability of mice, and Nissl staining was applied to observe the state of neurons in the classic hippocampus. The levels of acetylcholine (ACh) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were measured by ELISA. Immunofluorescence was used to reflect beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels in brain tissue. Apoptosis was evaluated by TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) method. The status of dendritic branches and spines was observed by Golgi staining. Meanwhile, the expression levels of recombinant human insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB), extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK), and cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) proteins were determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: PTPS improves spatial cognitive deficits in AD mice, reduces cellular damage in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, maintains the balance of the cholinergic system, and exerts an anti-AD effect in vivo. The molecular mechanism of its action may be related to the reduction of Abeta deposition as well as the activation of ERK pathway-related proteins with enhanced synaptic plasticity. CONCLUSIONS: PTPS is able to exert anti-AD activity in vivo by mitigating Abeta damage and targeting the ERK pathway.
