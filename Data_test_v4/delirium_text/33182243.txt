33182243|t|Development and Evaluation of Clinical Practice Guideline for Delirium in Long-Term Care.
33182243|a|Delirium is highly prevalent and leads to several bad outcomes for older long-term care (LTC) residents. For a more successful translation of delirium knowledge, Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) tailored to LTC should be developed and applied based on the understanding of the barriers to implementation. This study was conducted to develop a CPG for delirium in LTC and to determine the barriers perceived by healthcare professionals related to the implementation of the CPG. We followed a structured, evidence- and theory-based procedure during the development process. After a systematic search, quality appraisal, and selection for eligible up-to-date CPGs for delirium, the recommendations applicable to the LTC were drafted, evaluated, and confirmed by an external group of experts. To evaluate the barriers to guideline uptake from the users' perspectives, semi-structured interviews were conducted which resulted in four major themes: (1) a lack of resources, (2) a tendency to follow mindlines rather than guidelines, (3) passive attitudes, and (4) misunderstanding delirium care in LTC. To minimize adverse prognoses through prompt delirium care, the implementation of a CPG with an approach that comprehensively considers various barriers at the system, practice, healthcare professional, and patients/family levels is necessary.
