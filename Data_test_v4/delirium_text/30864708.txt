30864708|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system that causes severe cognitive impairment. One of the most significant pathological features of AD is the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide in the brain. Resveratrol (Res) is a polyphenol derived from peanuts, red grapes and other plants, which has received increasing attention due to its neuroprotective features. Tg6799 mice are transgenic mice with five familial AD (FAD) mutations that are also known as 5XFAD mice. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of Res on Tg6799 mice. The transgenic mice were randomly divided into the Res treatment group and the vehicle control group, and were treated with 0.5% Res solution (60 mg/kg) or volume-matched normal saline, respectively. Treatment was administered by oral gavage daily for 60 consecutive days. Res reduced amyloid plaque formation and the levels of Abeta42, and beta-secretase 1 levels were also significantly decreased. Furthermore, Res was able to reduce the expression of amyloid precursor protein and its cleavage products. The administration of Res to Tg6799 mice also improved their spatial working memory, as measured by the Y-maze test, and rescued spatial memory deficits, as measured using the Morris water maze test; however, Res did not affect their motor function. In conclusion, this study suggested that Res may reduce Abeta-induced neuronal damage, thus preventing memory loss.
