34073141|t|Drupe Characters, Fatty Acids, Polyphenolic and Aromatic Profile of Olive Oil Obtained from "Oliva Bianca", Minor Autochthonous Cultivar of Campania.
34073141|a|Campania, due to its pedo-climatic conditions and to its large varietal heritage, is able to produce oils with high typicity, each different from the other. In this study a "minor" autochthonous cultivar of Campania "Oliva Bianca" was analyzed. In autumn 2020, on drupes from trees belonging to the Campania germplasm collection a varietal characterization through physical, chemical and chromatic parameters at the harvest was carried out. Phenolic compounds profile, fatty acids composition and volatile organic compounds have been investigated in the resulting oil. Quality indices, organoleptic and sensory qualities (panel test) were also determined on the oil. Drupe weight was 4.31 g, flesh/pit ratio was 3.68 and the accumulation of oil content at harvest in drupes was 18.63% FW. The drupes showed high anthocyanins content equal to 116.10 mg/kg. In the oil studied, the secoiridoids represented the 82.25% of total phenolic compounds, the concentration of oleic acid was 74.82% and the most present volatile compound was trans-2-hexenal (72.30%). High secoiridoid derivatives concentrations such as oleuropein (85.93 mg/kg) and ligstroside (122.43 mg/kg) aglycones were showed. This study showed a good content of qualitative and quantitative parameters of "Oliva Bianca" oil and drupe, that can have important beneficial effects on human health.
