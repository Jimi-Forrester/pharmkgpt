35531783|a|Objective: To evaluate the role of visual pretreatment in preventing emergence delirium in children receiving ophthalmic surgery. Methods: Four randomized controlled trials were identified in four databases, and a meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.3. Results: The meta-analysis demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of postoperative emergence delirium (risk ratio: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.31-0.49) and propofol rescue (risk ratio: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.13-0.65) but comparable modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale score (mean difference: -3.66; 95% CI: -9.96 to 2.65) and incidence of adverse events in the visual pretreatment group. Conclusion: Visual pretreatment is effective in preventing postoperative emergence delirium in children undergoing ophthalmic surgery without significant adverse effects and can also decrease the incidence of propofol rescue.
