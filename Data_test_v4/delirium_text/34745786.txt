34745786|t|Treatment and Management of Sexual Disinhibition in Elderly Patients With Neurocognitive Disorders.
34745786|a|Sexual disinhibition is uncommon but challenging symptom to address in elderly patients with neurocognitive disorders. Due to the lack of large-scale studies, there is no gold standard treatment for sexual disinhibition, and treatment is largely left up to the discretion of the provider based on the severity and onset of the patient's symptoms. A review was conducted to investigate the non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for treating this condition. Articles that discussed treatments were screened for the type of treatment and possible side effects of medication if applicable. Thorough patient history should be taken prior to starting any drug therapy to rule out possible behavioral changes due to an existing medication side effect, delirium, or past mental or sexual health history. Non-pharmacological treatment has been generally recommended as first-line therapy over pharmacological treatment. Distraction/diversion of the patient when inappropriate sexual behaviors occur was the most common non-pharmacological intervention. Antidepressants were generally recommended as the first line of pharmacological treatment after attempting all possible non-pharmacological interventions. Several other categories of interventions are discussed as well in addition to the ethical implications of treating a patient for this condition.
