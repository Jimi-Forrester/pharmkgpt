25886313|t|Retrograde radical cystectomy and consequent peritoneal cavity reconstruction benefits localized male bladder cancer: results from a cohort study.
25886313|a|BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer is the second most common genitourinary malignancy. Our study was to introduce a standardized surgical procedure of retrograde radical cystectomy and consequent peritoneal cavity reconstruction in localized male bladder cancer. METHODS: Eighty-four consecutive male patients with localized bladder cancer (clinical stage T2 or lower) underwent surgery in our institute with the proposed procedure between May 2012 and April 2013. Median age was 65 years (range, 35 to 83 years); patient characteristics, surgical parameters, perioperative complications, pathology, and short-term prognosis were analyzed. Median follow-up was 24 months (range, 18 to 30 months). RESULTS: The complete procedure including urinary diversion took 4.0 h (2.2 to 5.0 h), with a median exposed peritoneal cavity of 45 min (0 to 75 min); the median blood loss was 140 ml (50 to 600 ml), and 2 patients needed transfusion; neurovascular bundles were reserved in 76 cases; the median abdominal and pelvic drainage was 9.0 days (6 to 15 days), the median gastrointestinal recovery was 2.5 days (1 to 12 days), and the median postoperative hospital stay was 13.0 days (10 to 21 days). Four patients had severe surgical complications, and two had mild to moderate ileus, with recovery in 1 and 2 weeks with supportive treatment. No perioperative deaths or postoperative recurrence were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The surgical procedure in male localized bladder cancer described in the present study provided surgical facilities, with limited abdominal organ disturbance and satisfactory tumor control. The procedure was associated with good gastrointestinal recovery, few postoperative complications, and a short hospital stay.
