32974019|t|Neurological manifestations in COVID-19: A narrative review.
32974019|a|COVID-19, a respiratory viral infection, has affected more than 10 million individuals worldwide. Common symptoms include fever, dry cough, fatigue and shortness of breath. Some patients show neurological manifestations such as headache, dizziness, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral nerve and muscle symptoms and smell and taste impairment. In previous studies, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV were found to affect the nervous system. Given the high similarity between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, effects on the nervous system by SARS-CoV-2 are a possibility. We have outlined the common neurological manifestations in COVID-19 (information are up-to-date as of June 2020) and discussed the possible pathogenetic mechanisms and management options.
