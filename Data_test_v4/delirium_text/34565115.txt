34565115|a|Objective: To explore the clinical characteristics, imaging findings, laboratory tests and treatment strategies for Chlamydia psittaci pneumonia. Methods: From January 1, 2019 to January 20, 2021, 48 cases of Psittacosis from 11 hospitals in China were diagnosed via metagenomic next-generation sequencing(mNGS). The data of all patients on occupational history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, chest computed tomography(CT)findings, treatment outcomes and prognosis were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Among the 48 patients, there were 29 males and 19 females, with a mean age of (57.1+-10.3) years. Thirty patients had a confirmed history of exposure to poultry. The onset to admission interval was (6.5+-3.2) days, and hospital stay was (12.4+-4.8) days. Clinical manifestations included fever (100%, 48/48), relative bradycardia (71%, 34/48), cough (54.2%, 26/48), sputum (27.1%, 13/48), fatigue (16.7%, 8/48), headache and delirium (20.8%, 9/48), and gastrointestinal symptoms (16.7%, 8/48). Laboratory data showed that white blood cells were (8.0+-3.8)x109/L, and the proportion of neutrophils increased in 44 patients. The level of C-reactive protein was (155.3+-74.1)mg/L, and that of procalcitonin (PCT)in 59.5% of patients was more than 0.5 mug/L. Percentages of patients with increased lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase were 82.9% and 45.2%, respectively. Chest CT scans showed unilateral lung involvement in 34 cases(70.8%) and single lobe involvement in 27 cases(56.3%).The most common imaging change was consolidation, with 38 cases (79.2%) showing lobar consolidation. In terms of treatment, 25 patients were treated with fluoroquinolones alone, 6 patients with doxycycline alone, and 13 patients with combined treatment. The combined-treatment group and the doxycycline alone group were similar in the course of defervescence. The combined treatment group and the doxycycline alone group were both superior to the fluoroquinolones alone group. However, 11 patients were admitted to ICU, all of them received artificial ventilation, and 5 cases developed shock, and one died. Conclusions: Chlamydia psittaci pneumonia is an animal-derived infectious disease with unique features in clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and chest imaging. Appropriate treatment is able to significantly shorten the course of disease and improve the prognosis.
