39568323|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia in seniors and is also one of the critical social issues of modern healthcare. Since AD is considered a multifactorial disease, the significance of particular risk factors in different ethnic populations is constantly reevaluated. METHOD: The study group consisted of 181 patients with AD, and the control group included 244 healthy seniors comparable in sex and age to the dementia group. Our study compared clinical data, blood biochemical parameters, various sociodemographic characteristics, and ApoE gene polymorphism in patients diagnosed with AD from Kazakhstan's north (Astana city) and south (Almaty city) regions. RESULTS: In our cohort, significant dementia-associated variables included smoking, clinically significant depression, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, and liver dysfunction. Notably, AD patients had higher HDL levels, lower ALT levels, and higher total bilirubin and AST/ALT ratios. The ApoE e4 genotype, a well-known AD risk factor, was more prevalent in the northern AD group. Additionally, participants from Astana city had a higher incidence of strokes, potentially linked to elevated LDL levels, while Almaty city residents exhibited a higher prevalence of clinically severe depression. DISCUSSION: These findings underscore the importance of considering bio-geographic and environmental factors in AD research. The study's outcomes may aid in further research and the development of personalized approaches for managing and treating AD in distinct geographical regions.
