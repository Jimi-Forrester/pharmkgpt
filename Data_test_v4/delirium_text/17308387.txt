17308387|a|BACKGROUND: Recent studies have emphasized specific deficits of attention and executive functions, such as those of cognitive flexibility, divided attention, in geriatric patients with depression. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), depressive symptoms are known to occur even from an early stage of the disease. However, the nature of the impairment of executive functions in depression associated with AD remains unclear, because of the frequent occurrence of the apathy syndrome as a major confounding factor. METHOD: In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparative neuropsychological assessment in AD patients with (n=21) and without (n=21) depression. The diagnosis of depression was based on provisional criteria proposed by Olin's group. RESULTS: In terms of apathy symptoms, both groups had a similar degree of deficits, which were mild as assessed according to Neuropsychiatric Inventory criteria. While no significant differences were observed in regard to the scores in general intellectual functioning, episodic memory and some attention and executive tasks between the two groups, AD patients with depression showed significantly lower scores in several attention and executive function tasks, such as the dual-task performance task administered to assess the capacity for divided attention, and the cognitive flexibility (Trail Making Test; Part B), than AD patients without depression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that depressive symptoms in AD patients increase the deficits of cognitive flexibility and divided attention. This is the first study to report a correlation between depressions, diagnosed based on the provisional criteria for depression in AD by Olin's group, and an impaired capacity for divided attention in AD patients.
