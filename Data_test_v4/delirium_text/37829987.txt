37829987|t|Correlation Between Sociocultural and Economic Factors in Pediatric Patients' Families and Emergence Delirium.
37829987|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is a commonly encountered condition that can arise from multiple factors, and its occurrence varies based on the type of surgery in pediatric patients. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of delirium during the recovery from anesthesia in children undergoing eye surgery and its association with the sociocultural and economic status of their families. METHODS: This prospective observational study included children aged 2-12 years who underwent eye surgeries. Demographic data, socioeconomic and educational status of parents, parental separation and cooperation scores, Cravero agitation score, and face, legs, activity, cry, and consolability (FLACC) score (at zero, five, 15, and 30 minutes in the postoperative period) were recorded. Patients who scored 5 on the Cravero agitation scale for at least five minutes were considered to have postoperative delirium. The STROBE checklist was followed for reporting. RESULTS: A total of 104 patients were included in the study, of which 65 were male. The mean age of the patients was 6.5+-2.9 years, and 42 patients (40.4%) belonged to the preschool age group. The incidence of delirium was found to be 51.9%. Delirium was found to be associated with postoperative pain (p=0.003), age (p=0.001), preoperative anxiety (not cooperative examination score (p=0.047), poor separation score (p=0.006)), presence of a surgical history (p=0.012), and cataract surgery (p=0.007). No evidence was found to demonstrate a link between sociocultural and economic conditions and the development of delirium. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified several factors that influenced the occurrence of delirium, including postoperative pain (FLACC>=4), younger age (<6 years), cataract surgery, presence of surgical history, examination score (score 3, not cooperative), and separation score (scores 3-4, poor).
