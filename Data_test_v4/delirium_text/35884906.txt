35884906|a|Advances in pharmacotherapy have brought extraordinary benefits to humanity. However, unmet medical needs in patients remain, particularly in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases and cancers. CNS drug delivery into the brain across the endothelium is difficult due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is composed mainly of tight junctions and efflux transporters, such as multiple drug resistance 1 (MDR1) (P-glycoprotein). On the other hand, the development of anti-cancer drugs is a challenging task due to their frequent off-target side effects and the complicated mechanisms of cancer pathogenesis and progression. Brain cancer treatment options are surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. It is difficult to remove all tumor cells, even by surgical removal after a craniotomy. Accordingly, innovative brain cancer drugs are needed. Currently, antibody (Ab) drugs that show high therapeutic effects are often used clinically. Furthermore, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), such as trastuzumab deruxtecan, an anti-HER2 (human epidermal receptor 2) ADC with low-molecular cancer drugs through the suitable linker, have been developed. In the case of trastuzumab deruxtecan, it is internalized into cancer cells across the membrane via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, it is reported that drug delivery into the brain across the BBB was carried out via receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT), using anti-receptor Abs as a vector against the transferrin receptor (TfR) or insulin receptor (InsR). Thus, anti-TfR ADCs with cancer drugs are promising brain cancer agents due to their precise distribution and low side effects. In this review, I introduce the implementations and potential of brain cancer drug delivery into the brain across the BBB, based on RMT using ADCs.
