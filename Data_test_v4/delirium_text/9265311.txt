9265311|a|Although clinicians have observed for centuries that som depressed patients become worse in the winter, it was first in 1984 that Norman Rosenthal and co-workers described a syndrome which they called seasonal affective disorder (SAD), characterised by winter depression, lethargy and a craving for carbohydrate. Phototherapy was proved to be an effective treatment right from the start. Recently it has been reported that not only depression, but also panic disorder and obsessive compulsive disorders may exhibit a seasonal pattern and thus benefit from phototherapy. Phototherapy may also benefit patients suffering from "sun-downing", a syndrome of confusion and agitation in the evening in persons with Alzheimer's disease. Based on the observation that bright light may both elevate brain serotonin and ameliorate sleep abnormalities, the authors report the results of phototherapy for treatment of non-seasonal depressions, either alone or in combination with antidepressants or sleep deprivation.
