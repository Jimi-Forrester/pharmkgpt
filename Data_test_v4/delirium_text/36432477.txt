36432477|a|Metastasis is the main reason for the high mortality rate of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Despite the whole improvement in the field of cancer medicine, the treatment options for the patient in the late stages are very restricted. Our previous studies have elucidated metastasis-associated in colon cancer 1 (MACC1) as a direct link to metastasis formation. Therefore, we have aimed to inhibit its expression by using natural products, which are recently the center of most studies due to their low side effects and good tolerability. In this study, we have investigated the effect of one of the promising natural products, curcumin, on MACC1 expression and MACC1-induced tumor-promoting pathways. Curcumin reduced the MACC1 expression, restricted the MACC1-induced proliferation, and was able to reduce the MACC1-induced cell motility as one of the crucial steps for the distant dissemination of the tumor. We further showed the MACC1-dependent effect of curcumin on clonogenicity and wound healing. This study is, to our knowledge, the first identification of the effect of curcumin on the restriction of cancer motility, proliferation, and colony-forming ability by using MACC1 as a target.
