36831785|a|BACKGROUND: Prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) can emerge with the onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Standard biomarkers can help identify such patients to improve therapy and treatment strategies. Our review aims to describe the latest evidence on promising biomarkers in prodromal DLB with MCI onset (MCI-LB). METHODS: We selected articles on different biomarkers in MCI-LB from PubMed and conducted a narrative review. RESULTS: We identified potentially promising clinical biomarkers, e.g., (1) assessing autonomic symptoms specifically, (2) describing the cognitive profile in several subdomains including executive and visual functions, and (3) measuring the speed of speech. In addition, we describe the measurement of seeding amplification assays of alpha-synuclein in cerebrospinal fluid as a relevant biomarker for MCI-LB. Electroencephalographic markers, as in calculating the theta/beta ratio or intermittent delta activity, or analyzing peak frequency in electroencephalography-methods also potentially useful once they have been validated in large patient cohorts. The 18F fluorodesoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) technique is also discussed to investigate metabolic signatures, as well as a specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique such as for the volumetric region of interest analysis. CONCLUSIONS: These biomarker results suggest that MCI-LB is a promising field for the use of biomarkers other than established ones to diagnose early prodromal DLB. Further large-scale studies are needed to better evaluate and subsequently use these promising biomarkers in prodromal DLB.
