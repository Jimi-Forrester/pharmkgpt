38803031|a|Sleep deprivation is a prevalent problem in critically ill patients, which leads to delayed recovery and delirium. Slow-wave sleep (SWS) is essential to energy restoration, tissue repair, and immune system strengthening. This study aimed to investigate the effects of gabapentin on SWS in critically ill patients. We performed a prospective open-label randomized controlled study to compare SWS and the clinical outcomes of gabapentin versus a control intervention in critically ill adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) within 24 h. The patients' characteristics and sleep-related outcomes were recorded. The sleep-related outcomes, namely, bispectral analysis (BIS), the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, were evaluated. Furthermore, clinical outcomes and safety were assessed. Sixty patients from 348 cases were eligible for randomization. On day 3 of the study, patients in the gabapentin group had significantly increased SWS (66.79 vs. 0.00 min; p < 0.001), total sleep time (TST) (331.39 vs. 46.16 min; p = 0.001), RCSQ score (55.05 +- 20.18 vs. 32.80 +- 15.31; p < 0.001), and IGF-1 concentrations (84.33 +- 12.40 vs. 44.00 +- 10.20 ng/mL, p < 0.001) compared with the control group. Improvements in clinical outcomes, such as delirium, ICU-free days, and mechanical ventilator-free days, were observed; however, these differences did not reach statistically significant. Gabapentin at bedtime increased SWS, TST, and IGF-1 concentrations in critically ill patients. This regimen might be beneficial to critically ill patients for improving their sleep quality.
