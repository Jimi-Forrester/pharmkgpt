28831293|t|3-Hydroxykynurenine and 3-Hydroxyanthranilic Acid Enhance the Toxicity Induced by Copper in Rat Astrocyte Culture.
28831293|a|Copper is an integral component of various enzymes, necessary for mitochondrial respiration and other biological functions. Excess copper is related with neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer and is able to modify cellular redox environment, influencing its functions, signaling, and catabolic pathways. Tryptophan degradation through kynurenine pathway produces some metabolites with redox properties as 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HANA). The imbalance in their production is related with some neuropathologies, where the common factors are oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death. This study evaluated the effect of these kynurenines on the copper toxicity in astrocyte cultures. It assessed the CuSO4 effect, alone and in combination with 3-HK or 3-HANA on MTT reduction, ROS production, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), GHS levels, and cell viability in primary cultured astrocytes. Also, the chelating copper effect of 3-HK and 3-HANA was evaluated. The results showed that CuSO4 decreased MTT reduction, MMP, and GSH levels while ROS production and cell death are increasing. Coincubation with 3-HK and 3-HANA enhances the toxic effect of copper in all the markers tested except in ROS production, which was abolished by these kynurenines. Data suggest that 3-HK and 3-HANA increased copper toxicity in an independent manner to ROS production.
