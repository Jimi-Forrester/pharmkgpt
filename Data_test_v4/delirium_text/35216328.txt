35216328|t|An Essential Role for Alzheimer's-Linked Amyloid Beta Oligomers in Neurodevelopment: Transient Expression of Multiple Proteoforms during Retina Histogenesis.
35216328|a|Human amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) is a brain catabolite that at nanomolar concentrations can form neurotoxic oligomers (AbetaOs), which are known to accumulate in Alzheimer's disease. Because a predisposition to form neurotoxins seems surprising, we have investigated whether circumstances might exist where AbetaO accumulation may in fact be beneficial. Our investigation focused on the embryonic chick retina, which expresses the same Abeta as humans. Using conformation-selective antibodies, immunoblots, mass spectrometry, and fluorescence microscopy, we discovered that AbetaOs are indeed present in the developing retina, where multiple proteoforms are expressed in a highly regulated cell-specific manner. The expression of the AbetaO proteoforms was selectively associated with transiently expressed phosphorylated Tau (pTau) proteoforms that, like AbetaOs, are linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). To test whether the AbetaOs were functional in development, embryos were cultured ex ovo and then injected intravitreally with either a beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) inhibitor or an AbetaO-selective antibody to prematurely lower the levels of AbetaOs. The consequence was disrupted histogenesis resulting in dysplasia resembling that seen in various retina pathologies. We suggest the hypothesis that embryonic AbetaOs are a new type of short-lived peptidergic hormone with a role in neural development. Such a role could help explain why a peptide that manifests deleterious gain-of-function activity when it oligomerizes in the aging brain has been evolutionarily conserved.
