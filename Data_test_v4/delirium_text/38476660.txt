38476660|t|Dual-task turn velocity - a novel digital biomarker for mild cognitive impairment and dementia.
38476660|a|Background: Disorders associated with cognitive impairment impose a significant burden on both families and society. Previous studies have indicated that gait characteristics under dual-task as reliable markers of early cognitive impairment. Therefore, digital gait detection has great potential for future cognitive screening. However, research on digital biomarkers based on smart devices to identify cognitive impairment remains limited. The aim of this study is to explore digital gait biomarkers by utilizing intelligent wearable devices for discriminating mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Methods: This study included 122 subjects (age: 74.7 +- 7.7 years) diagnosed with normal cognition (NC, n = 38), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 42), or dementia (n = 42). All subjects underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessments and cranial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Gait parameters were collected using validated wearable devices in both single-task and dual-task (DT). We analyzed the ability of gait variables to predict MCI and dementia, and examined the correlations between specific DT-gait parameters and sub-cognitive functions as well as hippocampal atrophy. Results: Our results demonstrated that dual-task could significantly improve the ability to predict cognitive impairment based on gait parameters such as gait speed (GS) and stride length (SL). Additionally, we discovered that turn velocity (TV and DT-TV) can be a valuable novel digital marker for predicting MCI and dementia, for identifying MCI (DT-TV: AUC = 0.801, sensitivity 0.738, specificity 0.842), and dementia (DT-TV: AUC = 0.923, sensitivity 0.857, specificity 0.842). The correlation analysis and linear regression analysis revealed a robust association between DT-TV and memory function, as well as the hippocampus atrophy. Conclusion: This study presents a novel finding that DT-TV could accurately identify varying degrees of cognitive impairment. DT-TV is strongly correlated with memory function and hippocampus shrinkage, suggests that it can accurately reflect changes in cognitive function. Therefore, DT-TV could serve as a novel and effective digital biomarker for discriminating cognitive impairment.
