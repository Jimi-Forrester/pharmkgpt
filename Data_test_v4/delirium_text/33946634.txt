33946634|a|Basic and preclinical research founded the progress of personalized medicine by providing a prodigious amount of integrated profiling data and by enabling the development of biomedical applications to be implemented in patient-centered care and cures. If the rapid development of genomics research boosted the birth of personalized medicine, further development in omics technologies has more recently improved our understanding of the functional genome and its relevance in profiling patients' phenotypes and disorders. Concurrently, the rapid biotechnological advancement in diverse research areas enabled uncovering disease mechanisms and prompted the design of innovative biological treatments tailored to individual patient genotypes and phenotypes. Research in stem cells enabled clarifying their role in tissue degeneration and disease pathogenesis while providing novel tools toward the development of personalized regenerative medicine strategies. Meanwhile, the evolving field of integrated omics technologies ensured translating structural genomics information into actionable knowledge to trace detailed patients' molecular signatures. Finally, neuroscience research provided invaluable models to identify preclinical stages of brain diseases. This review aims at discussing relevant milestones in the scientific progress of basic and preclinical research areas that have considerably contributed to the personalized medicine revolution by bridging the bench-to-bed gap, focusing on stem cells, omics technologies, and neuroscience fields as paradigms.
