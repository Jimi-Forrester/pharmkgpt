36111769|a|Dopamine (DA) agonists, as an excellent dopamine replacement therapy for patients with early and advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), play a vital role in controlling motor and several non-motor symptoms. Besides, the application of DA agonists may delay levodopa therapy and the associated risk of motor complications. Indeed, each DA agonist has unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics and therefore has different therapeutic efficacy and safety profile. The comorbidities, significant non-motor manifestations, concomitant medications, and clinical features of PD individuals should guide the selection of a specific DA agonist to provide a more patient-tailored treatment option. Thorough knowledge of DA agonists helps clinicians better balance clinical efficacy and side effects. Therefore, this review refers to recent English-written articles on DA agonist therapy for PD patients and summarizes the latest findings on non-ergot DA agonists as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each compound to help clinicians in the selection of a specific DA agonist. In addition, novel D1/D5 partial agonists and new formulations of DA agonists are also discussed.
