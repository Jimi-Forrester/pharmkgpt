38490119|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the bidirectional relationship of late-onset epilepsy (LOE) with dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Using the common electronic databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library databases and EMBASE, we systematically reviewed published cohort studies that assessed the risk of LOE in individuals comorbid with dementia or AD, and those with dementia or AD comorbid with LOE that had been published up to 31 March 2023. The data extraction process was carried out independently by two authors. The summary adjusted relative ratio (aRR) was calculated by employing Rev Man 5.3 for the inclusion of studies. To investigate the origins of heterogeneity, we conducted both subgroup and sensitivity analyses. In the presence of heterogeneity, a random-effects model was employed. To evaluate potential publication bias, we utilized the funnel plot and conducted Begg's and Egger's tests. RESULTS: We included 20 eligible studies in the final analysis after a rigorous screening process. Pooled results indicated that LOE was association with an increased risk of all-cause dementia (aRR: 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-1.59) and AD (aRR: 2.49, 95% CI: 1.16-5.32). In addition, the pooled effect size for LOE associated with baseline AD and all-cause dementia were 3.51 (95% CI: 3.47-3.56) and 2.53 (95% CI: 2.39-2.67), respectively. Both sensitivity and subgroup analyses showed that these positive correlations persisted. According to the results of the Egger's and Begg's tests, as well as visual inspection of funnel plots, none of the studies appeared to be biased by publication. CONCLUSION: The findings suggested that LOE is a potential risk factor for dementia and AD, and vice versa, dementia and AD are both potential risk indicators for LOE. Since there is substantial heterogeneity among the cohorts analyzed and more cohort studies should be conducted to confirm the correlations found in the current study.
