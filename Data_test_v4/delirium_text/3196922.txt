3196922|t|Lamina-specific arrangement of astrocytic gliosis and senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease visual cortex.
3196922|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) visual cortex (area 17) was investigated using stains for plaques and tangles (Bielschowsky, thioflavine S) and gliosis (GFAP immunoperoxidase). Pathology was heaviest in layers II, III, IVa and IVc. Of especial interest was a thin line of plaques and astrocytic gliosis at the lower margin of layer IVc. These results could provide an insight into the pathogenesis of AD, and suggest that patients with AD may have specific visual deficits.
