38857232|t|Lipopolysaccharides derived from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli: Differential and interactive effects on novelty-induced hyperlocomotion, blood cytokine levels and TLR4-related processes.
38857232|a|Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall, activates Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) may be involved in the progression of periodontal disease. Mice exposed to a novel environment show hyperlocomotion that is inhibited by systemic administration of LPS derived from Escherichia coli (Ec-LPS). However, whether Pg-LPS influences novelty-induced locomotion is unknown. Accordingly, we carried out an open field test to analyse the effects of Pg-LPS. For comparison, effects of Ec-LPS were also studied. We additionally investigated the influence of systemic administration of Pg-LPS or Ec-LPS on IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-10 levels in blood, as they could be involved in the changes in locomotion. The TLR4 receptor antagonist TAK-242 was used to study the involvement of TLR4. Since Pg-LPS may block TLR4 in vitro, we analysed the effects of Pg-LPS on Ec-LPS-induced changes in behavioural and biochemical parameters. Male ddY mice were used. Pg- or Ec-LPS and TAK-242 were administered intraperitoneally. Ec-LPS (840 mug/kg), but not Pg-LPS (100, 500 and 840 mug/kg), inhibited novelty-induced locomotion, which was antagonized by TAK-242 (3.0 mg/kg). Ec-LPS (840 mug/kg) increased blood levels of IL-6 and IL-10, which were antagonized by TAK-242 (3.0 mg/kg). However, TAK-242 did not inhibit Ec-LPS-induced increases in TNF-alpha levels in blood. Pg-LPS (100, 500, and 840 mug/kg) did not alter blood IL-6, TNF-alpha, or IL-10 levels. The Ec-LPS-induced increase in blood IL-10, but not IL-6 and TNF-alpha, levels was inhibited by Pg-LPS (500 mug/kg). These results suggest that TLR4 stimulation mediates the inhibition of novel environment-induced locomotion in mice following systemic administration of Ec-LPS, while also increasing blood IL-6 and IL-10 levels. In contrast, Pg-LPS did not exhibit these effects. The present study also provides in vivo evidence that Pg-LPS can inhibit TLR4-mediated increases in blood levels of IL-10, a cytokine thought to prevent the development of periodontal disease.
