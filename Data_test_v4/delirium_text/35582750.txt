35582750|t|Communication challenges in social isolation, subjective cognitive decline, and mental health status in older adults: A scoping review (2019-2021).
35582750|a|PURPOSE: Through an evolutionary concept analysis, social isolation (SI) was defined as lack of social belonging and engagement with others, minimal number of social contacts, and insufficient quality relationships. This definition represents broader understanding of most contributing factors to SI and supports the concepts of reduced communication and socialization experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic served to heighten this problem, including communication challenges, and brought negative outcomes of SI to light. The overall research question examined the impact of communication challenges and SI on OAs with Alzheimer's disease, related dementias, and subjective cognitive changes (2020-2021). This scoping literature review was developed to compare the psychosocial and mental health of older adults between prepandemic and pandemic lockdown of 2020-2021. DESIGN AND METHODS: This review followed the procedures for scoping review reporting as stated by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). In collaboration with an expert scientific information specialist assigned to the college of nursing, the literature was queried through MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process, In-Data-Review & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily 1946 to September 02, 2021; APA PsycInfo 1806 to August Week 5 2021; and Embase Classic+Embase 1947 to 2021 September 02. Search terms included social isolation; nursing home; home for the aged; long-term care; old age homes or convalescent home or nursing home; long-term care, or long-term care; aged or elders or seniors, dementia, Alzheimer's or dementia; osteoporosis; and fragility fracture. FINDINGS: Quantitative data informed outcomes through increased depression and anxiety, higher rates of depression during the pandemic than prepandemic, and increased symptomology in neuropsychiatric profiles. Further, COVID19-related restrictions, including impaired communication streams, seemed to be the origin of stress-related cognitive changes and symptomology. Communication challenges in residents with dementia may lead to feelings of social isolation. Qualitative evidence supports that dementia has a social, psychological, material, and socio-demographic impact. Further, the lockdown disrupted the existing flow of communication between all stakeholders and residents, resulting in heightened perceptions of SI and a profound sense of loss. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The results include a diverse and complex characterization of negative outcomes. Further, strong evidence indicates that communication and human contact can ameliorate negative outcomes.
