37528163|a|INTRODUCTION: Non-invasive diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to assess brain microstructural changes via cortical mean diffusivity (cMD) has been shown to be cross-sectionally associated with tau in cognitively normal older adults, suggesting that it might be an early marker of neuronal injury. Here, we investigated how regional cortical microstructural changes measured by cMD are related to the longitudinal accumulation of regional tau as well as to episodic memory decline in cognitively normal individuals harboring amyloid pathology. METHODS: 122 cognitively normal participants from the Harvard Aging Brain Study underwent DWI, T1w-MRI, amyloid and tau PET imaging, and Logical Memory Delayed Recall (LMDR) assessments. We assessed whether the interaction of baseline amyloid status and cMD (in entorhinal and inferior-temporal cortices) was associated with longitudinal regional tau accumulation and with longitudinal LMDR using separate linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: We find a significant interaction effect of the amyloid status and baseline cMD in predicting longitudinal tau in the entorhinal cortex (p = 0.044) but not the inferior temporal lobe, such that greater baseline cMD values predicts the accumulation of entorhinal tau in amyloid-positive participants. Moreover, we find a significant interaction effect of the amyloid status and baseline cMD in the entorhinal cortex (but not inferior temporal cMD) in predicting longitudinal LMDR (p < 0.001), such that baseline entorhinal cMD predicts the episodic memory decline in amyloid-positive participants. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of amyloidosis and elevated cMD in the entorhinal cortex may help identify individuals at short-term risk of tau accumulation and Alzheimer's Disease-related episodic memory decline, suggesting utility in clinical trials.
