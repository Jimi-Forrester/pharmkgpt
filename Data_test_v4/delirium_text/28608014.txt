28608014|t|Incidence and Risk Factors for Postoperative Delirium in Patients After Hepatectomy.
28608014|a|BACKGROUNDS: Postoperative delirium is a common complication after surgery. However, the incidence and risk factors associated with delirium after liver resection have not been clarified. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the incidence and risk factors for delirium in patients that underwent liver resections. METHODS: This study included 196 consecutive patients that underwent a liver resection. Groups with and without delirium were compared to identify differential patient characteristics. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify independent factors that significantly influenced the development of postoperative delirium. RESULTS: Postoperative delirium developed in 44 (22.4%) of the 196 patients. Majority of incidents occurred on postoperative day 2, and mean duration was 4.2 +- 5.5 days. Patients with delirium exhibited the following features: advanced age, low serum albumin levels, a high probability of a positive test for anti-hepatitis C virus antibody, cerebrovascular disorders, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, use of benzodiazepines, and previous history of delirium. Multivariate analysis revealed that the delirium development was significantly correlated with age, serum albumin level, presence of cerebrovascular disorder, use of benzodiazepines, and a previous history of delirium. CONCLUSIONS: This study clarified the incidence and risk factors for delirium after liver resection. These results would contribute to prediction and treatment of delirium.
