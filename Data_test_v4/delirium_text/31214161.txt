31214161|t|Chromatin Architecture as an Essential Determinant of Dendritic Cell Function.
31214161|a|Epigenetics has widespread implications in a variety of cellular processes ranging from cell identity and specification, to cellular adaptation to environmental stimuli. While typically associated with heritable changes in gene expression, epigenetic mechanisms are now appreciated to regulate dynamic changes in gene expression-even in post-mitotic cells. Cells of the innate immune system, including dendritic cells (DC), rapidly integrate signals from their microenvironment and respond accordingly, undergoing massive changes in transcriptional programming. This dynamic transcriptional reprogramming relies on epigenetic changes mediated by numerous enzymes and their substrates. This review highlights our current understanding of epigenetic regulation of DC function. Epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the maintenance of the steady state and are important for precise responses to proinflammatory stimuli. Interdependence between epigenetic modifications and the delicate balance of metabolites present another layer of complexity. In addition, dynamic regulation of the expression of proteins that modify chromatin architecture in DCs significantly impacts DC function. Environmental factors, including inflammation, aging, chemicals, nutrients, and lipid mediators, are increasingly appreciated to affect the epigenome in DCs, and, in doing so, regulate host immunity. Our understanding of how epigenetic mechanisms regulate DC function is in its infancy, and it must be expanded in order to discern the mechanisms underlying the balance between health and disease states.
