25029558|t|How do membranes initiate Alzheimer's Disease? Formation of toxic amyloid fibrils by the amyloid beta-protein on ganglioside clusters.
25029558|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), a severe neurodegenerative disorder, causes more than half of dementia cases. According to the popular "Abeta hypothesis" to explain the mechanism of this disease, amyloid beta-peptides (Abeta) of 39-43 amino acid residues aggregate and deposit onto neurons, igniting the neurotoxic cascade of the disease. Therefore, researchers studying AD would like to elucidate the mechanisms by which essentially water-soluble but hydrophobic Abeta aggregates under pathological conditions. Most researchers have investigated the aggregation of Abeta in aqueous solution, and they concluded that the final aggregation product, the amyloid fibrils, were less toxic than the component peptide oligomers. They consequently shifted their interests to more toxic "soluble oligomers", structures that form as intermediates or off-pathway products during the aggregation process. Some researchers have also investigated artificial oligomers prepared under nonphysiological conditions. In contrast to these "in solution" studies, we have focused on "membrane-mediated" amyloidogenesis. In an earlier study, other researchers identified a specific form of Abeta that was bound to monosialoganglioside GM1, a sugar lipid, in brains of patients who exhibited the early pathological changes associated with AD. This Account summarizes 15 years of our research on this topic. We have found that Abeta specifically binds to GM1 that occurs in clusters, but not when it is uniformly distributed. Clustering is facilitated by cholesterol. Upon binding, Abeta changes its conformation from a random coil to an alpha-helix-rich structure. A CH-pi interaction between the aromatic side chains of Abeta and carbohydrate moieties appended to GM1 appears to be important for binding. In addition, as Abeta accumulates and reaches its first threshold concentration (Abeta/GM1 = ~0.013), aggregated beta-sheets of ~15 molecules appear and coexist with the helical form. However, this beta-structure is stable and does not form larger aggregates. When the disease progresses further and the Abeta/GM1 ratio exceeds ~0.044, the beta-structure converts to a second beta-structure that can seed aggregates. The seed recruits monomers from the aqueous phase to form toxic amyloid fibrils that have larger surface hydrophobicity and can contain antiparallel beta-sheets. In contrast, amyloid fibrils formed in aqueous solution are less toxic and have parallel beta-sheets. The less polar environments of GM1 clusters play an important role in the formation of these toxic fibrils. Membranes that contain GM1 clusters not only accelerate the aggregation of Abeta by locally concentrating Abeta molecules but also generate amyloid fibrils with unique structures and significant cytotoxicity. The inhibition of this aggregation cascade could be a promising strategy for the development of AD-modulating therapies.
