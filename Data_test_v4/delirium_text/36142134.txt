36142134|t|The Asparaginyl Endopeptidase Legumain: An Emerging Therapeutic Target and Potential Biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease.
36142134|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is incurable dementia closely associated with aging. Most cases of AD are sporadic, and very few are inherited; the pathogenesis of sporadic AD is complex and remains to be elucidated. The asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) or legumain is the only recognized cysteine protease that specifically hydrolyzes peptide bonds after asparagine residues in mammals. The expression level of AEPs in healthy brains is far lower than that of peripheral organs. Recently, growing evidence has indicated that aging may upregulate and overactivate brain AEPs. The overactivation of AEPs drives the onset of AD through cleaving tau and amyloid precursor proteins (APP), and SET, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The AEP-mediated cleavage of these peptides enhances amyloidosis, promotes tau hyperphosphorylation, and ultimately induces neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Upregulated AEPs and related deleterious reactions constitute upstream events of amyloid/tau toxicity in the brain, and represent early pathological changes in AD. Thus, upregulated AEPs are an emerging drug target for disease modification and a potential biomarker for predicting preclinical AD. However, the presence of the blood-brain barrier greatly hinders establishing body-fluid-based methods to measure brain AEPs. Research on AEP-activity-based imaging probes and our recent work suggest that the live brain imaging of AEPs could be used to evaluate its predictive efficacy as an AD biomarker. To advance translational research in this area, AEP imaging probes applicable to human brain and AEP inhibitors with good druggability are urgently needed.
