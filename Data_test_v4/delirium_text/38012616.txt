38012616|a|BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a significant health concern, with limited available treatment options. This condition poses significant medical, economic, and social challenges. SCI is typically categorized into primary and secondary injuries. Inflammation, oxidative stress, scar formation, and the immune microenvironment impede axon regeneration and subsequent functional restoration. Numerous studies have shown that the destruction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and microvessels is a crucial factor in severe secondary injury. Additionally, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced lipid peroxidation significantly contributes to endothelial cell death. Pericytes are essential constituents of the BBB that share the basement membrane with endothelial cells and astrocytes. They play a significant role in the establishment and maintenance of BBB. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence staining at different time points revealed a consistent correlation between pericyte coverage and angiogenesis, suggesting that pericytes promote vascular repair via paracrine signaling. Pericytes undergo alterations in cellular morphology and the transcriptome when exposed to hypoxic conditions, potentially promoting angiogenesis. We simulated an early ischemia-hypoxic environment following SCI using glucose and oxygen deprivation and BBB models. Co-culturing pericytes with endothelial cells improved barrier function compared to the control group. However, this enhancement was reduced by the exosome inhibitor, GW4869. In vivo injection of exosomes improved BBB integrity and promoted motor function recovery in mice following SCI. Subsequently, we found that pericyte-derived exosomes exhibited significant miR-210-5p expression based on sequencing analysis. Therefore, we performed a series of gain- and loss-of-function experiments in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that miR-210-5p regulates endothelial barrier function by inhibiting JAK1/STAT3 signaling. This process is achieved by regulating lipid peroxidation levels and improving mitochondrial function, suggesting a potential mechanism for restoration of the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) after SCI.
