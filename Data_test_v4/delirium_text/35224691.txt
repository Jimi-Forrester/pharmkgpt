35224691|t|Defining Minimum Necessary Communication During Care Transitions for Patients on Antihyperglycemic Medication: Consensus of the Care Transitions Task Force of the IPRO Hypoglycemia Coalition.
35224691|a|INTRODUCTION: Antihyperglycemic agents are significant contributors to adverse drug events, responsible for emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and death. Nationally, the rate of serious hypoglycemic events associated with these agents remains high despite widespread efforts to improve drug safety. Transitions of care between healthcare settings can lead to communication challenges between care professionals and increase the risk of adverse drug events. System-based improvements are needed to assure the safe transitions for patients with diabetes who are on antihyperglycemic agents. The objective of this study was to develop a consensus list of requisite elements that should be communicated between care settings during transitions of patients who are prescribed antihyperglycemic agents. METHODS: The Island Peer Review Organization (IPRO) Hypoglycemia Coalition identified suboptimal transitions of care as a barrier to improving patient safety and quality of diabetes care. The Coalition formed a multidisciplinary Task Force with experts in the field of diabetes care. The Task Force created a draft list of requisite communication elements through literature review and deliberation on monthly conference calls. A blinded iterative Delphi process was subsequently performed to generate a consensus list of requisite communication elements that participating experts agreed were necessary to safely and effectively assume the management of patients with diabetes upon care transitions. RESULTS: The Task Force completed a series of four iterative polls from September 2015 to August 2016, resulting in a final list of 22 requisite communication elements (the Diabetes Management Discharge Communication List), with the elements conceptually categorized into three domains: diagnosis and treatment, factors affecting glycemic control or patient risk, and patient self-management. CONCLUSIONS: The Diabetes Management Discharge Communication List provides an initial framework for the development of diabetes-specific resources to improve clinical communication between care settings.
