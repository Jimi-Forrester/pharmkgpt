33790850|a|The last years have evinced a remarkable growth in neuroimaging studies around the world. All these studies have contributed to a better understanding of the cerebral outcomes of dementia, even in the earliest phases. In low- and middle-income countries, studies involving structural and functional neuroimaging are challenging due to low investments and heterogeneous populations. Outstanding the importance of diagnosing mild cognitive impairment and dementia, the purpose of this paper is to offer an overview of neuroimaging dementia research in Brazil. The review includes a brief scientometric analysis of quantitative information about the development of this field over the past 10 years. Besides, discusses some peculiarities and challenges that have limited neuroimaging dementia research in this big and heterogeneous country of Latin America. We systematically reviewed existing neuroimaging literature with Brazilian authors that presented outcomes related to a dementia syndrome, published from 2010 to 2020. Briefly, the main neuroimaging methods used were morphometrics, followed by fMRI, and DTI. The major diseases analyzed were Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and vascular dementia, respectively. Moreover, research activity in Brazil has been restricted almost entirely to a few centers in the Southeast region, and funding could be the main driver for publications. There was relative stability concerning the number of publications per year, the citation impact has historically been below the world average, and the author's gender inequalities are not relevant in this specific field. Neuroimaging research in Brazil is far from being developed and widespread across the country. Fortunately, increasingly collaborations with foreign partnerships contribute to the impact of Brazil's domestic research. Although the challenges, neuroimaging researches performed in the native population regarding regional peculiarities and adversities are of pivotal importance.
