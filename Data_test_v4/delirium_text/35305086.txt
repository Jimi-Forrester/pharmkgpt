35305086|t|Insulinoma: an uncommon cause of delirium.
35305086|a|We present the case of an 83-year-old woman with recurrent episodes of delirium occurring overnight, associated with hypoglycaemia. Other causes for delirium were excluded. Laboratory findings were in keeping with endogenous insulin production. Computerised tomography imaging revealed a small mass in the pancreas supporting a presumed diagnosis of an insulinoma. Given the patient's frailty and cognitive impairment, a conservative management approach was taken. Diazoxide was commenced with resolution of episodes of delirium. This case highlights hypoglycaemia, and insulinoma, as a rare, but treatable cause of delirium. It demonstrates the importance of blood sugar screening in delirium. It emphasises the holistic modifications to management, which must be taken to ensure patient-centred care when caring for an older adult living with frailty, who may have cognitive impairment.
