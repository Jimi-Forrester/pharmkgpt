38915509|a|Underlying drivers of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) pathology remain unknown. However, multiple biologically diverse risk factors share a common pathological progression. To identify convergent molecular abnormalities that drive LOAD pathogenesis we compared two common midlife risk factors for LOAD, heavy alcohol use and obesity. This revealed that disrupted lipophagy is an underlying cause of LOAD pathogenesis. Both exposures reduced lysosomal flux, with a loss of neuronal lysosomal acid lipase (LAL). This resulted in neuronal lysosomal lipid (NLL) accumulation, which opposed Abeta localization to lysosomes. Neuronal LAL loss both preceded (with aging) and promoted (targeted knockdown) Abeta pathology and cognitive deficits in AD mice. The addition of recombinant LAL ex vivo and neuronal LAL overexpression in vivo prevented amyloid increases and improved cognition. In WT mice, neuronal LAL declined with aging and correlated negatively with entorhinal Abeta. In healthy human brain, LAL also declined with age, suggesting this contributes to the age-related vulnerability for AD. In human LOAD LAL was further reduced, correlated negatively with Abeta1-42, and occurred with polymerase pausing at the LAL gene. Together, this finds that the loss of neuronal LAL promotes NLL accumulation to impede degradation of Abeta in neuronal lysosomes to drive AD amyloid pathology.
