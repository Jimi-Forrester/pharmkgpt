18429496|a|For decades, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been linked to aging, gender, and menopause. Not surprisingly, this led most investigators to focus on the role of estrogen. While undoubtedly important, estrogen is unlikely the key determinant of disease pathogenesis. Rather, it appears that estrogen may work in conjunction with a novel determinant of disease pathogenesis, namely gonadotropins. The fact that gonadotropins, specifically luteinizing hormone, play a pivotal role in disease is apparent from significant etiological, epidemiological, and pathological evidences. Moreover, targeting gonadotropins appears to have beneficial actions as a therapeutic regimen.
