33771824|a|OBJECTIVES: To explore the perceptions of hospitalised older people and their relatives of the impact of taking part in group dance sessions in an acute hospital setting. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive approach was used. SETTING: An acute hospital trust in the East of England. PARTICIPANTS: Purposive sample of dance group participants. INTERVENTION: Weekly music and movement sessions for frail older people on Department of Elderly Medicine Wards and the Stroke Rehabilitation Unit. Sessions take place in the ward and are facilitated by a dance artist supported by ward staff. RESULTS: Twenty-one semistructured interviews were conducted with older people and/or their relatives. Thematic analysis of the data identified three overarching themes: (1) dance as a physical activity, (2) dance as an opportunity for social interaction and (3) the dance group as a source of emotional support. Sessions were valued as an enjoyable way to undertake physical activity and provided an opportunity for social interaction between patients. This is important as loneliness and boredom are a common occurrence during hospitalisation and are detrimental to overall health and well-being. Patients reported an emotional impact though taking part; happiness from engaging with the group and the release of pent up emotions through the triggering of memories by the music and conversations within the group. CONCLUSION: Dance for Health provides a range of physical, social and emotional benefits for hospitalised older people. Further research is required to investigate the effectiveness of group dance sessions in increasing physical activity on an acute ward and the potential psychological benefits for hospitalised older people.
