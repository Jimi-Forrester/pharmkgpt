38029236|a|Background: Mounting evidence has demonstrated the associations between gut microbiota, gut microbiota-derived metabolites, and cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs). The major categories of CVD are ischemic stroke (IS), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). However, the causal relationship is still unclear. Methods: A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted leveraging the summary data from genome-wide association studies. The inverse variance-weighted, maximum likelihood, weighted median, and MR.RAPS methods were performed to detect the causal relationship. Several sensitivity analyses were carried out to evaluate potential horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Finally, reverse MR analysis was conducted to examine the likelihood of reverse causality, and multivariable MR was performed to adjust the potential confounders. Results: We collected 1,505 host single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to 119 gut microbiota traits and 1,873 host SNPs associated with 81 gut metabolite traits as exposure data. Among these, three gut bacteria indicated an elevated risk of IS, two of ICH, and one of SAH. In contrast, five gut bacteria were associated with a reduced risk of IS, one with ICH, and one with SAH. Our study also demonstrated the potential causal associations between 11 gut microbiota-derived metabolites and CVD. Conclusions: This study provided evidence of the causal relationship between gut microbiota, gut microbiota-derived metabolites, and CVD, thereby offering novel perspectives on gut biomarkers and targeted prevention and treatment for CVD.
