32376688|t|Copper stabilizes antiparallel beta-sheet fibrils of the amyloid beta40 (Abeta40)-Iowa variant.
32376688|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a vascular disorder that primarily involves deposition of the 40-residue-long beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta40) in and along small blood vessels of the brain. CAA is often associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by amyloid plaques in the brain parenchyma enriched in the Abeta42 peptide. Several recent studies have suggested a structural origin that underlies the differences between the vascular amyloid deposits in CAA and the parenchymal plaques in AD. We previously have found that amyloid fibrils in vascular amyloid contain antiparallel beta-sheet, whereas previous studies by other researchers have reported parallel beta-sheet in fibrils from parenchymal amyloid. Using X-ray fluorescence microscopy, here we found that copper strongly co-localizes with vascular amyloid in human sporadic CAA and familial Iowa-type CAA brains compared with control brain blood vessels lacking amyloid deposits. We show that binding of Cu(II) ions to antiparallel fibrils can block the conversion of these fibrils to the more stable parallel, in-register conformation and enhances their ability to serve as templates for seeded growth. These results provide an explanation for how thermodynamically less stable antiparallel fibrils may form amyloid in or on cerebral vessels by using Cu(II) as a structural cofactor.
