25079800|t|A fresh perspective revealed by powerful trends in Alzheimer's disease research.
25079800|a|The paper, "Ethnicity Moderates Dementia's Biomarkers", by Royall and Palmer in this issue of Journal of Alzheimer's Disease represents the cutting edge of Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. The authors capitalize on several powerful and emerging trends in AD research that will surely reap benefits for our discipline during the next decade: latent variable models, biomarkers, and ethnicity. In this study, the authors specifically find that self-reported ethnicity moderates the dementing process and hypothesize that this is more likely due to distinct biological mechanisms than environmental influences.
