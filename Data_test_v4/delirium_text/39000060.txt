39000060|t|Exercise to Counteract Alzheimer's Disease: What Do Fluid Biomarkers Say?
39000060|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) represent an unsolved problem to date with an ever-increasing population incidence. Particularly, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most widespread ND characterized by an accumulation of amyloid aggregates of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and Tau proteins that lead to neuronal death and subsequent cognitive decline. Although neuroimaging techniques are needed to diagnose AD, the investigation of biomarkers within body fluids could provide important information on neurodegeneration. Indeed, as there is no definitive solution for AD, the monitoring of these biomarkers is of strategic importance as they are useful for both diagnosing AD and assessing the progression of the neurodegenerative state. In this context, exercise is known to be an effective non-pharmacological management strategy for AD that can counteract cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. However, investigation of the concentration of fluid biomarkers in AD patients undergoing exercise protocols has led to unclear and often conflicting results, suggesting the need to clarify the role of exercise in modulating fluid biomarkers in AD. Therefore, this critical literature review aims to gather evidence on the main fluid biomarkers of AD and the modulatory effects of exercise to clarify the efficacy and usefulness of this non-pharmacological strategy in counteracting neurodegeneration in AD.
