24121464|t|Barriers and facilitators to implementing delirium rounds in a clinical trial across three diverse hospital settings.
24121464|a|Delirium occurs in more than half of hospitalized older adults with dementia, substantially worsening outcomes. The use of multiple strategies and a local opinion leader, unit champion, has cumulative and lasting effects compared with single-strategy interventions. The purpose of this article is to describe the early barriers and facilitators to rounding with unit champions in a cluster randomized clinical trial in Year 2 of a 5-year trial (5R01NR011042-02). This is a mixed-method study nested within an ongoing multisite cluster-randomized, controlled clinical trial. Descriptive and comparative statistics were collected on N = 192 nursing rounds. Qualitative data were thematically analyzed. On average, rounds lasted 25.54 min (SD = 13.18) and were conducted with the unit champion 64% of the time. This is one of the first studies to systematically address quantitative and qualitative barriers and facilitators to nurse-led delirium rounds, demonstrating the gradual adoption of an intervention in diverse clinical settings.
