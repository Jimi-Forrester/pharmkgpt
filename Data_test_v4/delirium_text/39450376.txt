39450376|t|The Effects of Social Interaction Intervention on Cognitive Functions Among Older Adults Without Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
39450376|a|Background and Objectives: Previous systemic reviews, predominantly including observational studies, have shown that participation in social activities is a protective factor against cognitive decline. However, this association is subject to potential reverse causality, creating a knowledge gap in our understanding of the effect of social interaction interventions on cognitive function. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to examine the effects of social interaction interventions on cognitive decline among older adults without dementia. Research Design and Methods: This systematic review, registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022367828), systematically searched 6 databases from inception to May 6, 2022, to identify relevant articles on the effects of activities with social interaction components on cognitive function in community-dwelling older adults without dementia aged above 60. Two independent reviewers conducted study selection, data extraction, and bias assessment, with RevMan5.3 used for meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis was conducted to assess variation in intervention effects among subgroups. Results: We included 11 studies for qualitative analysis and 8 studies for the meta-analysis. The results showed that social interaction intervention had a significant effect on executive function (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 1.60; 95% CI, 0.50 to 2.70; p = .004), but not attention and memory. The subgroup analysis showed a greater cognitive benefit for healthy older adults, but not those with mild cognitive impairment. Moreover, in-person social interaction positively affected global cognition, whereas online interaction did not. Discussion and Implications: Social interaction interventions have a limited impact on cognitive function in older adults without dementia but showed potential effects on executive function. This finding offers insights for implementing social intervention in the community.
