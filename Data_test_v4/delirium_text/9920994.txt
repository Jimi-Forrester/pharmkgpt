9920994|a|The aetiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains, despite vast progress, not fully understood. Four genes involved in the development of the disease have been identified. Three fully penetrant ones (the amyloid beta-protein precursor on chromosome 21, presenilin 1 on chromosome 14, and presenilin 2 on chromosome 1) lead to the development of relatively rare familial form of AD. Together, they account for about half of this early-onset form of the disease. One genetic risk factor--polipoprotein E-4--is associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease while at least two others are proposed. None of these genes can be by now adopted for use as a diagnostic or predictive test for Alzheimer's disease. Apart from the above, some environmental factors are also implicated in pathogenesis of the disease with the amyloid cascade hypothesis being the most commonly accepted as central. In the presented paper we have critically reviewed a literature on etiopatogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and discussed some practical consequences of the progress in understanding the mechanism of the disease.
