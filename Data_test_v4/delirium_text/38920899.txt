38920899|a|The phenols from grape pomace have remarkable beneficial effects on health prevention due to their biological activity, but these are often limited by their bioaccessibility in the gastrointestinal tract. Encapsulation could protect the phenolics during digestion and influence the controlled release in such an intestine where their potential absorption occurs. The influence of freeze-drying encapsulation with sodium alginate (SA) and its combination with gum Arabic (SA-GA) and gelatin (SA-GEL) on the encapsulation efficiency (EE) of phenol-rich grape pomace extract and the bioaccessibility index (BI) of phenolics during simulated digestion in vitro was investigated. The addition of a second coating to SA improved the EE, and the highest EE was obtained with SA-GEL (97.02-98.30%). The release of phenolics followed Fick's law of diffusion and the Korsmeyer-Peppas model best fitted the experimental data. The highest BI was found for the total phenolics (66.2-123.2%) and individual phenolics (epicatechin gallate 958.9%, gallocatechin gallate 987.3%) using the SA-GEL coating were used. This study shows that freeze-dried encapsulated extracts have the potential to be used for the preparation of various formulations containing natural phenolic compounds with the aim of increasing their bioaccessibility compared to formulations containing non-encapsulated extracts.
