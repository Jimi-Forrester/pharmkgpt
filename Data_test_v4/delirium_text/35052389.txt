35052389|t|Ischemic Stroke Genetics: What Is New and How to Apply It in Clinical Practice?
35052389|a|The etiology of ischemic stroke is multifactorial. Although receiving less emphasis, genetic causes make a significant contribution to ischemic stroke genesis, especially in early-onset stroke. Several stroke classification systems based on genetic information corresponding to various stroke phenotypes were proposed. Twin and family history studies, as well as candidate gene approach, are common methods to discover genetic causes of stroke, however, both have their own limitations. Genome-wide association studies and next generation sequencing are more efficient, promising and increasingly used for daily diagnostics. Some monogenic disorders, despite covering only about 7% of stroke etiology, may cause well-known clinical manifestations that include stroke. Polygenic disorders are more frequent, causing about 38% of all ischemic strokes, and their identification is a rapidly developing field of modern stroke genetics. Current advances in human genetics provide opportunity for personalized prevention of stroke and novel treatment possibilities. Genetic risk scores (GRS) and extended polygenic risk scores (PRS) estimate cumulative contribution of known genetic factors to a specific outcome of stroke. Combining those scores with clinical information and risk factor profiles might result in better primary stroke prevention. Some authors encourage the use of stroke gene panels for stroke risk evaluation and further stroke research. Moreover, new biomarkers for stroke genetic causes and novel targets for gene therapy are on the horizon. In this article, we summarize the latest evidence and perspectives of ischemic stroke genetics that could be of interest to the practitioner and useful for day-to-day clinical work.
