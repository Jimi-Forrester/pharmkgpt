36448329|t|Perspective: leveraging the electronic health record to improve sleep in the hospital.
36448329|a|Inpatient sleep loss can worsen health outcomes, including delirium and falls. Sleep disruptions in the hospital often originate from provider-patient interactions ordered electronically through computerized provider order entry. These orders contain clinical decision support systems with default schedules. These defaults are often around-the-clock, may not align with patients' needs, and cause iatrogenic sleep loss. Optimizing clinical decision support in the electronic health record can decrease unnecessary sleep disruptions and influence sleep-friendly decision-making. CITATION: Kadura S, Siala T, Arora VM.
