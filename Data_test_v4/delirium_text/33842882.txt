33842882|a|There are no validated criteria for diagnosing chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or traumatic encephalopathy syndrome, in a living person. The purpose of this study is to examine symptom reporting resembling the research criteria for traumatic encephalopathy syndrome in men and women from the US general population. This is a retrospective analysis of publicly available data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study. The National Comorbidity Survey Replication was designed to examine the prevalence and correlates of mental disorders in the USA. The study included a nationally representative sample of 9282 adults (4139 men and 5143 women). An in-person interview and survey were conducted in the homes of men and women from the general population. The study was conducted with participants residing in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, San Francisco, Washington DC, Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, Boston, Nassau-Suffolk NY, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Minneapolis and Atlanta. Symptoms from the research criteria for the diagnosis of traumatic encephalopathy syndrome were applied to men and women in the general population and in sub-groups of people with health problems and mental health problems. A small percentage of the US general population met symptom criteria for traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (6.6-11.9%, depending on the definition applied). People with chronic pain were much more likely to meet criteria (i.e. 14.8-30.5%), and two out of three people who have experienced suicidality in the past year met symptom criteria for traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (65.2-72.2%). The majority of women with a mood disorder and chronic pain met criteria (62.7-89.8%). This is the largest study, to date, examining the aspects of the research criteria for the diagnosis of traumatic encephalopathy syndrome in the general population, and the first study to examine these criteria in women. This study has important clinical and public health implications. The potential rate for misdiagnosing traumatic encephalopathy syndrome in adults who are experiencing chronic pain, idiopathic mental health problems or both is high.
