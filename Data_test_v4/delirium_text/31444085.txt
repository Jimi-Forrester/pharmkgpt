31444085|a|A series of 2-acetylphenol-donepezil hybrids was designed and synthesized based on multi-target-directed ligands strategy. The biological activities were evaluated by AChE/BChE inhibition and MAO-A/MAO-B inhibition. The results revealed that the tertiary amines and methylene chain length significantly affected the eeAChE inhibitory potency, in particular, compound TM-14 showed the best eeAChE inhibitory activity with IC50 value of 2.9 muM, in addition, both kinetic analysis of AChE inhibition and docking study displayed that TM-14 could simultaneously bind to the catalytic active site and peripheral anionic site of AChE. Moreover, compound TM-14 was a selective metal chelator and could form 1:1 TM-14-Cu2+ complex. The structure-active-relationship also indicated that the O-alkylamine fragment remarkably decreased hMAO-B inhibitory activity, compound TM-2 exhibited potent hMAO-B inhibitory activity (IC50 = 6.8 muM), which was supported by the molecular docking study. More interestingly, compounds TM-14 and TM-2 could cross the blood-brain barrier in vitro. Therefore, the structure-active-relationship of 2-acetylphenol-donepezil hybrids could encourage the development of multifunction agents with selective AChE inhibition or selective MAO-B inhibition for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
