36367059|t|Resting Heart Rate and Cognitive Decline: A Meta-Analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies.
36367059|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several previous meta-analyses have identified an association between cognitive decline and heart rate variability, which reflects autonomic nerve activity. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the impact of increased resting heart rate (RHR) on the incidence of cognitive decline, including dementia. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, and PsycInfo databases were searched for relevant prospective cohort studies published before April 18, 2022. A methodological quality assessment of the included studies was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Summary estimates of the incidence of cognitive decline, including dementia, were generated using a random-effects model. Potential publication bias was evaluated using Begg's funnel plots and Egger's regression tests. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 7 prospective cohort studies comprising 53,621 participants. A weak significant association was observed between RHR and the risk of cognitive decline, although the analysis indicated high heterogeneity among the studies (relative risk=1.18, 95% confidence interval=1.04-1.33, I2=82.5%). Significant associations were determined between RHR and all combined types of dementia except for Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. There was also a dose-response association between increased RHR and cognitive decline. The meta-estimate of the cognitive decline risk associated with a 10 beat-per-minute increase in RHR was 1.06, and it was 1.10 for dementia. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that a higher RHR was associated with an increased cognitive decline risk. Due to study limitations such as publication bias and high heterogeneity, additional studies are required to validate this finding.
