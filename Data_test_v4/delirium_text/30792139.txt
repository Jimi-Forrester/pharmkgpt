30792139|a|INTRODUCTION: Several authors have demonstrated the efficacy of different hospital-at-home strategies in older patients. The identification of prognostic factors is key for improving the targeting process of candidates. METHODS: We performed an analysis of a cohort of older patients attended due to disabling health crises (medical, orthopaedics, or stroke) by a hospital-at-home scheme developed in an integrated care institution over a 5-year period. Main outcomes were: health crisis resolution (discharge to Primary Care); functional resolution (relative functional gain >=35%), and their combined variable. A logistic regression analysis was performed, including clinical variables from Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment at admission to detect factors related to favourable outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 484 patients were included. The main characteristics were: age 84.4 (6.7), female gender 69%, baseline Barthel score 74.2 (22.6), family-private caregiver/nursing home 82%/18%, referral from hospital wards/emergency department-community in 55%/45%. The main results (for selected processes medical/orthopaedics/stroke) were: health crisis resolution 71.7/87.5/77.6%; functional resolution 72.1/84.9/73.5%; favourable crisis resolution (health crisis resolution with functional resolution) 67.1/81.6/67.3%. Favourable crisis resolution was associated with [OR (95%CI)]: orthopaedic as main diagnosis [2.00 (1.22-3.29)], Barthel score at admission higher than 40 points [2.00 (1.18-3.38)], and the absence of pressure ulcers at admission [2.80 (1.68-4.65)]. CONCLUSIONS: Patients presenting with an orthopaedic diagnosis, not having severe disability at admission, and not having pressure ulcers at admission could obtain better results on favourable crisis resolution. Suffering cognitive impairment or delirium, or being institutionalised, was not found related with less favourable results.
