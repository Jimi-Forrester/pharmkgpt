20690885|t|Long-acting atypical injectable antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia: safety and tolerability review.
20690885|a|IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Although atypical antipsychotics have beneficial efficacy and tolerance, non-adherence and partial adherence remain in patients treated for schizophrenia. Long-acting injectable or depot atypical antipsychotics offer better medication adherence and tolerability advantages. Currently, two drugs are available for the treatment of schizophrenia, risperidone long-acting injectable (RLAI) and olanzapine pamoate (OP). AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Short- and long-term safety and tolerability data on RLAI and OP from January 2006 through September 2009 were reviewed by performing Medline and PubMed searches, reviewing abstracts and poster presentations, and viewing available material from the FDA and European Medicines Agency. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: RLAI and OP show good short- and long-term safety when treating patients with schizophrenia, with uncommon discontinuation due to adverse effects. RLAI and OP data show rare problems with injection site reactions and patients exposed to injectable treatments prefer to continue injections. Infrequent but serious post-injection delirium sedation syndrome occurred after 1% of OP injections. Weight gain was generally higher among patients treated with OP versus RLAI. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Healthcare providers, patients and family members should be made aware of the safety and benefits of long-acting injectable atypical antipsychotics in order to diminish the unnecessary restrictions of these therapies for patients with schizophrenia.
