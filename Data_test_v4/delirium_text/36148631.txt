36148631|a|The effect of a ketogenic diet (KD) on middle aged female mice is poorly understood as most of this work have been conducted in young female mice or diseased models. We have previously shown that an isocaloric KD started at middle age in male mice results in enhanced mitochondrial mass and function after 2 months on diet and improved cognitive behavior after being on diet for 14 months when compared with their control diet (CD) fed counterparts. Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of an isocaloric 2-month KD or CD on healthy 14-month-old female mice. At 16 months of age cognitive behavior tests were performed and then serum, skeletal muscle, cortex, and hippocampal tissues were collected for biochemical analysis. Two months on a KD resulted in enhanced cognitive behavior associated with anxiety, memory, and willingness to explore. The improved neurocognitive function was associated with increased PGC1alpha protein in the gastrocnemius (GTN) muscle and nuclear fraction. The KD resulted in a tissue specific increase in mitochondrial mass and kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) levels in the GTN and soleus muscles, with a corresponding decrease in kynurenine and increase in kynurenic acid levels in serum. With KAT proteins being responsible for converting kynurenine into kynurenic acid, which is unable to cross the blood brain barrier and be turned into quinolinic acid-a potent neurotoxin, this study provides a potential mechanism of crosstalk between muscle and brain in mice on a KD that may contribute to improved cognitive function in middle-aged female mice.
