37241119|t|Neuropsychiatric Symptoms as Indicators of Fall Risk in Geriatric Inpatients.
37241119|a|Background and Objectives: It is well established that patients with cognitive impairment are at a higher risk of falls. However, the impact of coexisting neuropsychiatric symptoms on the overall risk of falls in hospitalized geriatric individuals with and without dementia has not been extensively studied. This cross-sectional study will assess the association between neuropsychiatric symptoms and fall risk in geriatric individuals analyzed by sex. Materials and Methods: A total of 234 patients, both with and without dementia, admitted to the geriatric ward at Leszek Giec Upper-Silesian Medical Centre of the Silesian Medical University in Katowice, Poland, between January 2019 and January 2020 were included in this study. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire was used to assess the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Increased fall risk was defined by Berg scores of <=40. Results: The mean age of the study group was 80.7 +- 6.6, and women accounted for 62.8% of the study population. Apathy was the most common neuropsychiatric symptom, affecting 58.1% of patients, and it was the most common symptom among people with dementia, affecting 67.80% of patients. The receiver operating characteristics curve analysis revealed that a high fall risk was significantly associated with the total number of neuropsychiatric symptoms (>=4) and the total intensity of these symptoms (>=6). For women, high fall risk was associated with three or more neuropsychiatric symptoms and a total neuropsychiatric symptom intensity score of at least 6. For men, the association of high fall risk with the total number of NPS was not significant; a total NPS intensity score of 10 or more was associated with high fall risk. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified associations with fall risk for hallucinations. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms, particularly hallucinations is associated with an increased risk of falls in geriatric inpatients. In addition, the cumulative total of NPS and their cumulative intensity are both independently associated with an increased risk of falls. These results suggest that fall prevention strategies should include the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms in hospitalized geriatric individuals.
