34828374|t|APOE Gene Associated with Cholesterol-Related Traits in the Hispanic Population.
34828374|a|Genetic variants in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene are associated with lipid metabolism and lipid-related traits in the non-Hispanic population. There have been limited studies regarding the association between the APOE gene and hypercholesterolemia in the Hispanic population; therefore, our aim for this study is to examine the APOE gene's associations with cholesterol level and its related phenotypes. The APOE gene consists of three different alleles, epsilon2, epsilon3, and epsilon4, with epsilon4 being associated with dementia and cardiovascular diseases. A total of 1,382 subjects were collected from the Texas Alzheimer's Research and Care Consortium (TARCC, N = 1320) and the Initial Study of Longevity and Dementia from the Rio Grande Valley (ISLD-RGV, N = 62). Questionnaires on demographics, medical history, and blood/saliva samples were collected and APOE genotypes were performed. We observed allele frequencies of the APOE epsilon3 (96.7%), epsilon4 (22.6%) and epsilon2 (6.8%) alleles, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression revealed a significant association between the APOE epsilon4 allele and hypercholesteremia (p = 1.8 x 10-4) in our studied Hispanic population. We prove for the first time, that the APOE epsilon4 allele increases the risk for hypercholesterol in Hispanics. Further research is needed to confirm and supports our current findings.
