However, research to date has been conducted in relatively healthy samples with few comorbidities. Given that history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are risk factors for AD and common in Veterans, we compared neuropsychological, typical (Petersen/Winblad), and ADNI criteria for MCI in Vietnam-era Veterans with histories of TBI or PTSD. METHOD: 267 Veterans (mean age = 69.8) from the DOD-ADNI study were evaluated for MCI using neuropsychological, typical, and ADNI criteria. Linear regressions adjusting for age and education assessed associations between MCI status and AD biomarker levels (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] p-tau181, t-tau, and Abeta42) by diagnostic criteria. Logistic regressions adjusting for age and education assessed the effects of TBI severity and PTSD symptom severity simultaneously on MCI classification by each criteria. RESULTS: Agreement between criteria was poor. Neuropsychological criteria identified more Veterans with MCI than typical or ADNI criteria, and were associated with higher CSF p-tau181 and t-tau. Typical and ADNI criteria were not associated with CSF biomarkers. PTSD symptom severity predicted MCI diagnosis by neuropsychological and ADNI criteria. History of moderate/severe TBI predicted MCI by typical and ADNI criteria. CONCLUSIONS: MCI diagnosis using sensitive neuropsychological criteria is more strongly associated with AD biomarkers than conventional diagnostic methods. MCI diagnostics in Veterans would benefit from incorporation of comprehensive neuropsychological methods and consideration of the impact of PTSD.
