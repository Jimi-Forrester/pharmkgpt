38531510|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients show age-related decreases in the ability to perform activities of daily living and the decline in these activities is related to the severity of neurobiological deterioration underlying the disease. The 5xFAD mouse model of AD shows age-related impairments in sensory- motor and cognitive function, but little is known about changes in species-typical behaviours that may model activities of daily living in AD patients. Therefore, we examined species-typical behaviours used as indices of exploration (rearing) and compulsivity (grooming) across six tests of anxiety-like behaviour or motor function in female 5xFAD mice from 3-16 months of age. Robust decreases in rearing were found in 5xFAD mice across all tests after 9 months of age, although few differences were observed in grooming. A fine-scale analysis of grooming, however, revealed a previously unresolved and spatially restricted pattern of grooming in 5xFAD mice at 13-16 months of age. We then examined changes in species-typical behaviours in the home-cage, and show impaired nest building in 5xFAD mice at all ages tested. Lastly, we examined the relationship between reduced species typical behaviours in 5xFAD mice and the presentation of freezing behaviour, a commonly used measure of memory for conditioned fear. These results showed that along with cognitive and sensory-motor behaviour, 5xFAD mice have robust age-related impairments in species-typical behaviours. Therefore, species typical behaviours in 5xFAD mice may help to model the decline in activities of daily living observed in AD patients, and may provide useful behavioural phenotypes for evaluating the pre-clinical efficacy of novel therapeutics for AD.
