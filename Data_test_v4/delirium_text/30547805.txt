30547805|t|A hotspots analysis-relation discovery representation model for revealing diabetes mellitus and obesity.
30547805|a|BACKGROUND: Nowadays, because of the huge economic burden on society causing by obesity and diabetes, they turn into the most serious public health challenges in the world. To reveal the close and complex relationships between diabetes, obesity and other diseases, search the effective treatment for them, a novel model named as representative latent Dirichlet allocation (RLDA) topic model is presented. RESULTS: RLDA was applied to a corpus of more than 337,000 literatures of diabetes and obesity which were published from 2007 to 2016. To unveil those meaningful relationships between diabetes mellitus, obesity and other diseases, we performed an explicit analysis on the output of our model with a series of visualization tools. Then, with the clinical reports which were not used in the training data to show the credibility of our discoveries, we find that a sufficient number of these records are matched directly. Our results illustrate that in the last 10 years, for obesity accompanying diseases, scientists and researchers mainly focus on 17 of them, such as asthma, gastric disease, heart disease and so on; for the study of diabetes mellitus, it features a more broad scope of 26 diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, heart disease and so forth; for both of them, there are 15 accompanying diseases, listed as following: adrenal disease, anxiety, cardiovascular disease, depression, heart disease, hepatitis, hypertension, hypothalamic disease, respiratory disease, myocardial infarction, OSAS, liver disease, lung disease, schizophrenia, tuberculosis. In addition, tumor necrosis factor, tumor, adolescent obesity or diabetes, inflammation, hypertension and cell are going be the hot topics related to diabetes mellitus and obesity in the next few years. CONCLUSIONS: With the help of RLDA, the hotspots analysis-relation discovery results on diabetes and obesity were achieved. We extracted the significant relationships between them and other diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, heart disease and tumor. It is believed that the new proposed representation learning algorithm can help biomedical researchers better focus their attention and optimize their research direction.
