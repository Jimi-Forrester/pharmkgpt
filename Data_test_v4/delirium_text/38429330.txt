38429330|a|Acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE) activity is impaired by a variety of inhibitors including organophosphorus pesticides, leading to the accumulation of acetylcholine. In this study, we aimed to determine the association between cancer and the blood level of the (AChE). This is a multicenter hospital-based case-control study conducted in the Radiation and Isotopes Center Khartoum, and Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Biology and Oncology Gezira. One hundred and fifty participants, half of them cancer patients and half cancer free were recruited. All participants were screened for demographic, environmental, occupational, and clinical characteristics. Blood for the (AChE) activity test was drawn from participants in the two groups. The mean age of the participants was 40.6 +- 14.8 years. Geographical distribution showed the Central Region of Sudan had the highest rate of cancer, followed by North State, Khartoum State, West State, and East State. The most common tumor subtype was breast cancer, followed by leukemia, colon, esophageal, and prostate cancer. Inferential analysis revealed significantly impaired (AChE) activity among cancer patients compared to controls (53.4 +- 20.3% vs. 93.8 +- 8.8, p-value 0.001). There was a significant statistical association between impaired (AChE) activity and cancer. (AChE) activity might be applied in the future as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target. Further large sample and molecular studies are recommended.
