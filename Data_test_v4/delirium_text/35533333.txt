35533333|t|Retinal Biomarkers for Alzheimer Disease: The Facts and the Future.
35533333|a|ABSTRACT: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with limited treatment options and considerable diagnostic challenges. Identification and validation of retinal changes that correlate with clinicopathologic features of AD could provide a noninvasive method of screening and monitoring progression of disease, with notable implications for developing new therapies, particularly in its preclinical stages. Retinal biomarkers that have been studied to date include structural changes in neurosensory retinal layers, alterations in vascular architecture and function, and pathologic deposition of proteins within the retina, which have all demonstrated variable correlation with the presence of preclinical or clinical AD. Evolution of specialized retinal imaging modalities and advances in artificial intelligence hold great promise for future study in this burgeoning field. The current status of research in retinal biomarkers, and some of the challenges that will need to be addressed in future work, are reviewed herein.
