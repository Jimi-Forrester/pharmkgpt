9134454|a|The present study was undertaken to elucidate whether electrolytic lesions of nucleus basalis magnocellularis--NBM (an animal model of Alzheimer's disease--AD) may influence humoral and cellular immune responses in adult male Wistar rats. For this purpose intact control (IC), sham-operated (SO) and NBM-lesioned rats were divided into two main groups: (1) rats immunized with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) for plaque-forming cell (PFC) response and anti-SRBC agglutinins, and (2) rats immunized with bovine serum albumin in complete Freund's adjuvant (BSA-CFA) for anti-BSA antibody production, Arthus and delayed hypersensitivity skin reaction to BSA. PFC responses and anti-SRBC agglutinins as well as diameter and expression of edema/induration of Arthus/delayed skin reaction and titer of anti-BSA antibody were significantly lower in NBM lesioned rats (compared to IC and SO). The results showed that in NBM-lesioned rats both the humoral and cellular immune responses were suppressed.
