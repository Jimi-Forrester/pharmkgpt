36468051|a|Introduction: There is a scarcity of epidemiological data on neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) in East Africa. This meta-analysis provides the regional prevalence of NDs, their contributing factors, and evidence of change over time concerning gender per age or year. Methods: Articles were retrieved from electronic databases following the PRISMA standard. Results: Forty-two studies were reviewed, and 25 were meta-analyzed with a random-effects model. The pool estimate proportion of 15.27%, 95% CI (0.09-0.23) (I2 = 98.25%), (Q = 1,369.15, p < 0.0001) among a population of 15,813 male/female and 1,257 with NDs. Epidemiological characteristics associated with NDs include Dyskinesias prevalence 55.4%, 95% CI (13.5; 90.9), I2 (96%) and subsistence farming prevalence 11.3%, 95% CI (5.8; 20.9), I2 (99%). Publication bias by Egger test was (z = 4.1913, p < 0.0001), while rank correlation test using Kendall's model was (tau = 0.1237, p = 0.3873). Heterogeneity (R2 design = 5.23%, p design < 0.0001; R2 size = 52.163%, p size < 0.001; and R2 period = 48.13, p period < 0.0001. Covariates (R2 design + size + period = 48.41%, p < 0.001). Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of NDs in the East African region, which could impact life expectancy, morbidity, and quality of life. Thus, early screening and regular surveillance could assist in management strategies.
