33388635|t|Surveying work-as-done in post-operative delirium risk factors collection and diagnosis monitoring.
33388635|a|Post-operative delirium (POD) is a health hazard condition for the patients and it is associated with increased costs for the healthcare system. Following a system-theoretic approach, firstly a model, then a questionnaire, have been designed to probe the collective awareness about POD throughout the entire patient's perioperative pathway. The 58 reported answers pointed out that most of the information, specifically associated with POD, are routinely recorded but not used to stratify the patients' individual risk to develop POD. The results suggest the need for design a new socio-technical role within modern health care systems: the POD analyst. A Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP) model is proposed both to propel the awareness about POD and as a template for future POD risk factors collections.
