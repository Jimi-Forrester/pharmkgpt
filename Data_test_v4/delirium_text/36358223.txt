36358223|a|Polyhydroquinoline (PHQ) are the unsymmetrical Hantzsch derivatives of 1,4-dihydropyridines with several biological applications. In this work, twenty-five (3-27) new Schiff's base derivatives of polyhydroquinoline hydrazide were synthesized in excellent to good yields by a multi-component reaction. The structures of the synthesized products (1-27) were deduced with the help of spectroscopic techniques, such as 1H-, 13C -NMR, and HR-ESI-MS. The synthesized products (1-27) were tested for their antibacterial and in vitro calcium -channel-blocking (CCB) potentials using the agar-well diffusion method, and isolated rat aortic ring preparations, respectively. Among the series, sixteen compounds were found to inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Among them, compound 17 was observed to be the most potent one at a dose 2 microg/mL, with an 18 mm zone of inhibition against both bacteria when it was compared with the standard drug amoxicillin. Eight compounds showed CCB activity of variable potency; in particular, compound 27 was more potent, with an EC50 value of 0.7 (0.3-1.1) microg/mL, indicating their CCB effect.
