24987404|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia is a new focus of research on improved treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). In 2007, a screening tool for PD dementia (PD-D) was developed by the Movement Disorder Society (Level I testing), which still requires verification by a large population study. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional and multicenter study including 13 institutions administering the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to 304 PD patients (mean age: 70.6 +- 8.3 years; mean Hoehn and Yahr stage: 2.7 +- 0.7). RESULTS: In all, 34.5% of the patients had MMSE scores <26; 94.3% of these patients had impairments in >=2 cognitive domains and met the criteria for probable PD-D by Level I testing. Executive dysfunction combined with attention and memory impairment was most common (51.4%). In the Level I subtests of executive function, the score for phonemic fluency declined by <50% in patients with high MoCA scores (24-30 points) and lacked specificity for PD-D. No patient had visuospatial impairment (measured by the pentagon copying subtest) alone, and the score for pentagon copying stayed at >=70% even in patients with low MMSE scores (12-25 points), therefore lacking sensitivity for PD-D. CONCLUSIONS: Level I testing with administration of the MMSE and MoCA is a practical and efficient screening tool for PD-D. However, the phonemic fluency and pentagon copying tests should be replaced by more specific/sensitive ones when screening for PD-D.
