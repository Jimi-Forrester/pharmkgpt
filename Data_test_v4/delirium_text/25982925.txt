25982925|t|A Potent Multi-functional Neuroprotective Derivative of Tetramethylpyrazine.
25982925|a|Neurodegenerative disorders are one of the leading causes of death among the elderly. Therapeutic approaches with a single target have proven unsuccessful in treating these diseases. Structural combination of multi-functional compounds may lead to a molecule with multiple properties. In this study, we designed and synthesized T-006, a novel analog derived from two multi-functional neuroprotective chemicals, tetramethylpyrazine and J147. The methoxyphenyl group of J147 was replaced by tetramethylpyrazine. Bioactivity evaluation showed that T-006 at very low concentrations had multi-functional neuroprotective effects including rescuing iodoacetic acid-induced neuronal loss, preventing oxidative stress-induced neurotoxicity and reducing glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in vitro. Most importantly, T-006 significantly ameliorated memory impairments in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. These multiple functions of a single molecule suggest that T-006 is a promising novel neuroprotective agent for treating various neurodegenerative disorders, including and in particular Alzheimer's disease.
