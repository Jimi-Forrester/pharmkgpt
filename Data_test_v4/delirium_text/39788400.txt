39788400|a|The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a vital role in protecting the central nervous system (CNS) by preventing the entry of harmful pathogens from the bloodstream. However, this barrier also presents a significant obstacle when it comes to delivering drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and brain cancer. Recent breakthroughs in nanotechnology have paved the way for the creation of a wide range of nanoparticles (NPs) that can serve as carriers for diagnosis and therapy. Regarding their promising properties, organic NPs have the potential to be used as effective carriers for drug delivery across the BBB based on recent advancements. These remarkable NPs have the ability to penetrate the BBB using various mechanisms. This review offers a comprehensive examination of the intricate structure and distinct properties of the BBB, emphasizing its crucial function in preserving brain balance and regulating the transport of ions and molecules. The disruption of the BBB in conditions such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease highlights the importance of developing creative approaches for delivering drugs. Through the encapsulation of therapeutic molecules and the precise targeting of transport processes in the brain vasculature, organic NP formulations present a hopeful strategy to improve drug transport across the BBB. We explore the changes in properties of the BBB in various pathological conditions and investigate the factors that affect the successful delivery of organic NPs into the brain. In addition, we explore the most promising delivery systems associated with NPs that have shown positive results in treating neurodegenerative and ischemic disorders. This review opens up new possibilities for nanotechnology-based therapies in cerebral diseases.
