27800267|a|A 51-year-old man was diagnosed with Behcet's disease in 2001. The patient was resistant to all immunosuppressive therapies. After 6 months of infliximab therapy, he presented to our clinic with pain and blurred vision in his right eye. The visual acuity was 20/200 and the intraocular pressure was 35 mmHg in the right eye. Biomicroscopic examination revealed corneal dendritic ulcers and 2+ cells in the anterior chamber in the right eye. The herpetic keratouveitis attack was controlled with antiviral therapy but the patient needed another glaucoma surgery. Trabeculectomy with mitomycin C was performed about halfway through an eight-week interval between two doses of infliximab.
