38348813|t|Association of Rare NOTCH3 Variants With Prevalent and Incident Stroke and Dementia in the General Population.
38348813|a|BACKGROUND: It is uncertain whether rare NOTCH3 variants are associated with stroke and dementia in the general population and whether they lead to alterations in cognitive function. This study aims to determine the associations of rare NOTCH3 variants with prevalent and incident stroke and dementia, as well as cognitive function changes. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the prospective community-based Shunyi Study, a total of 1007 participants were included in the baseline analysis. For the follow-up analysis, 1007 participants were included in the stroke analysis, and 870 participants in the dementia analysis. All participants underwent baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging, carotid ultrasound, and whole exome sequencing. Rare NOTCH3 variants were defined as variants with minor allele frequency <1%. A total of 137 rare NOTCH3 carriers were enrolled in the baseline study. At baseline, rare NOTCH3 variant carriers had higher rates of stroke (8.8% versus 5.6%) and dementia (2.9% versus 0.8%) compared with noncarriers. After adjustment for associated risk factors, the epidermal growth factor-like repeats (EGFr)-involving rare NOTCH3 variants were associated with a higher risk of prevalent stroke (odds ratio [OR], 2.697 [95% CI, 1.266-5.745]; P=0.040) and dementia (OR, 8.498 [95% CI, 1.727-41.812]; P=0.032). After 5 years of follow-up, we did not find that the rare NOTCH3 variants increased the risk of incident stroke and dementia. There was no statistical difference in the change in longitudinal cognitive scale scores. CONCLUSIONS: Rare NOTCH3 EGFr-involving variants are genetic risk factors for stroke and dementia in the general Chinese population.
