885102|t|[Evaluation of treatment with hemineurine in delirium tremens].
885102|a|The authors make a sum-up of all cases of delirium tremens admitted to the Lausanne University Psychiatric Clinic during the period 1970-1974. All were treated by intravenous and oral chlormethiazole (hemineurine), its technique being described. The need to restablish the fluid and electrolitic balance is stressed. Side effects are not important and there is a shortening of the acute phase, as compared to other techniques. Mortality is nil. The authors suggest that chlormethiazole is an indication of choice in the treatment of delirium tremens and are surprised that this substance has not yet taken its place in the U.S.A.
