11723294|t|Apolipoprotein E and age at onset of Alzheimer's disease in African American patients.
11723294|a|The authors examined whether the APOE-epsilon4 allele is associated with an earlier age at onset of AD in 71 African American patients with probable AD. The authors found a linear dose effect in which each copy of the epsilon4 allele was associated with a 3.6-year earlier onset of AD, indicating a dose-dependent relationship between APOE-epsilon4 and age at onset of AD in African Americans.
