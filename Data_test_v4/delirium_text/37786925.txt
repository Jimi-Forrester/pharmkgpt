37786925|t|Membrane protein chaperone and sodium chloride modulate the kinetics and morphology of amyloid beta aggregation.
37786925|a|Protein aggregation is a biological phenomenon caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides are derived from the cleavage of a larger membrane protein molecule and accumulate to form plaques extracellularly. According to the amyloid hypothesis, accumulation of Abeta aggregates in the brain is primarily responsible for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, the disassembly of Abeta aggregates may provide opportunities for alleviating or treating AD. Here, we show that the novel protein targeting machinery from chloroplast, chloroplast signal recognition particle 43 (cpSRP43), is an ATP-independent membrane protein chaperone that can both prevent and reverse Abeta aggregation effectively. Using of Thioflavin T (ThT) dye, we obtained the aggregation kinetics of Abeta aggregation and determined that the chaperone prevents Abeta aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner. Size exclusion chromatography and sedimentation assays showed that 10-fold excess of cpSRP43 can keep Abeta in the soluble monomeric form. Electron microscopy showed that the fibril structure was disrupted in the presence of this chaperone. Importantly, cpSRP43 utilizes the binding energy to actively remodel the preformed Abeta aggregates without assistance by a co-chaperone and ATP, emphasizing its unique function among protein chaperones. Moreover, when sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration is higher than 25 mM, the Abeta aggregation rate increases drastically to form tightly-associated aggregates and generate more oligomers. Our results demonstrate that the presence of cpSRP43 and low NaCl levels inhibit or retard Abeta peptide aggregation, potentially opening new avenues to strategically develop an effective treatment for AD.
