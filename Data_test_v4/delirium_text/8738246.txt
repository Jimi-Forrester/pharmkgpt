8738246|t|Changes of neurocalcin, a calcium-binding protein, in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
8738246|a|We assessed the amount of neurocalcin, a calcium-binding protein, in samples from the postmortem normal human and Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains using a specific antibody. In the AD brains, the amount of neurocalcin in the temporal cortical tissues was significantly lower than that in the controls. Neurocalcin was detected immunohistochemically mainly in the neuropil in the temporal cortex, and its localization was very similar to that of synaptophysin. These findings suggest that reduced levels of neurocalcin reflect a biochemical deficit related to the synaptic degeneration in AD.
