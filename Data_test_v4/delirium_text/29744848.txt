29744848|t|Model Phospholipid Liposomes to Study the beta-Amyloid-Peptide-Induced Membrane Disruption.
29744848|a|Model phospholipid liposomes have been utilized widely to study the molecular interactions between peptides and membrane bilayers. In the mechanistic study of Alzheimer's disease (AD), disruption of neuronal cell membranes has been considered as a major contribution for the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides' neurotoxicity. However, clear interpretation of the Abeta-induced cellular membrane at high-resolution level is challenging because of the co-existence of multiple pathways. Here we present the generation of simplified model liposome systems that will facilitate the in-depth mechanistic studies. Protocols for the preparation of model liposomes and the characterization of individual membrane disruption effects will be described.
