3354310|t|EEG in the differential diagnosis between Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.
3354310|a|Demented patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 67), multi-infarct dementia (MID) (n = 77) and probable vascular dementia (PVD) (n = 45) were studied with electroencephalography (EEG). All patients underwent a routine EEG examination and quantitative EEG was recorded from 14 patients with AD, 20 with MID, and 12 with PVD. The patient groups did not differ in regard to sex, age, education, or degree of dementia. Diffuse abnormality of EEG increased in AD, while driving response to photic stimulation and the mean frequency of background activity decreased in all groups with increasing degree of dementia. In quantitative EEG, the percentage of alpha power decreased and those of theta and delta power increased relative to the degree of dementia. Focal abnormalities, and irritative (spikes and/or sharp waves) and slow wave paroxysms were more common in MID than in AD. Patients with different types of dementia did not differ significantly in regard to diffuse abnormality, occurrence of driving response, mean background frequency, or parameters of quantitative EEG. The mean frequency of background activity and the degree of diffuse abnormality correlated with central and cortical atrophy, white matter low attenuation seen on computed tomography, and with neuropsychological findings.
