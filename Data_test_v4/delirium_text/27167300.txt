27167300|t|Solid-Phase Synthesis and Characterization of N-Terminally Elongated Abeta-3-x -Peptides.
27167300|a|In addition to the prototypic amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 , several Abeta variants differing in their amino and carboxy termini have been described. Synthetic availability of an Abeta variant is often the key to study its role under physiological or pathological conditions. Herein, we report a protocol for the efficient solid-phase peptide synthesis of the N-terminally elongated Abeta-peptides Abeta-3-38 , Abeta-3-40 , and Abeta-3-42 . Biophysical characterization by NMR spectroscopy, CD spectroscopy, an aggregation assay, and electron microscopy revealed that all three peptides were prone to aggregation into amyloid fibrils. Immunoprecipitation, followed by mass spectrometry, indicated that Abeta-3-38 and Abeta-3-40 are generated by transfected cells even in the presence of a tripartite beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) inhibitor. The elongated Abeta peptides starting at Val(-3) can be separated from N-terminally-truncated Abeta forms by high-resolution isoelectric-focusing techniques, despite virtually identical isoelectric points. The synthetic Abeta variants and the methods presented here are providing tools to advance our understanding of the potential roles of N-terminally elongated Abeta variants in Alzheimer's disease.
