34572120|t|Sustainable Effects of Human Dental Pulp Stem Cell Transplantation on Diabetic Polyneuropathy in Streptozotocine-Induced Type 1 Diabetes Model Mice.
34572120|a|Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are suitable for use in regenerative medicine. Cryopreserved human DPSCs (hDPSCs) ameliorate diabetic polyneuropathy, and the effects of hDPSC transplantation are related to VEGF and NGF secretion. This study evaluated the long-term effects of a single transplantation of hDPSCs on diabetic polyneuropathy. hDPSCs were obtained from human third molars extracted for orthodontic treatment, which were then transplanted into the unilateral hindlimb skeletal muscles 8 weeks after streptozotocin injection in nude mice. The effects of hDPSC transplantation were analyzed at 16 weeks post-transplantation. DPSC transplantation significantly improved delayed nerve conduction velocity, decreased blood flow, and increased sensory perception thresholds. Furthermore, the hDPSC-conditioned medium promoted the neurite outgrowth of dorsal root ganglion neurons. In conclusion, the therapeutic effects of hDPSC transplantation with a single injection last for prolonged periods and may be beneficial in treating long-term diabetic polyneuropathy.
