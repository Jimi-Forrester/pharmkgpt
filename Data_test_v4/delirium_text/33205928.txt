33205928|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the delayed effect of course therapy with cerebrolysin on the cognitive functioning of the first degree relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), including, depending on the ApoE4 genotype. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cohort of 72 blood relatives of patients with AD, including 46 with objectively confirmed clinical and neuropsychological examination signs of mild cognitive dysfunction (group 1) and 26 (group 2) with cognitive impairment that meets the diagnostic criteria of mild cognitive impairment (ICD-10 F06.7), was studied. The dynamics of the initial (0 day) indicators of cognitive functioning was compared immediately after a four-week course of treatment with cerebrolysin infusions, as well as 1 and 2 months after its completion, depending on the presence of ApoE4(+) or ApoE4(-) genotype. Clinical, psychopathological, psychometric, follow-up, molecular-genetic and statistical methods were used. RESULTS: A positive prolonged effect of course therapy with cerebrolysin on cognitive functioning of the first degree relatives of patients with AD was established in both groups. A significant negative effect of the ApoE4(+) genotype on the immediate and delayed effects of cerebrolysin treatment has been proven. CONCLUSION: The results can form the basis for the development of therapeutic measures aimed at preventing the progression of cognitive impairment and the development of dementia in the first degree relatives of patients with AD as those with the highest risk of dementia.
