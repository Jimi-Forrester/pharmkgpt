37596279|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients exhibit progressive disruption of entrained circadian rhythms and an aberrant circadian input pathway may underlie such dysfunction. Here we examine AD-related pathology and circadian dysfunction in the APPSwe-Tau (TAPP) model of AD. We show these mice exhibit phase delayed body temperature and locomotor activity with increases around the active-to-rest phase transition. Similar AD-related disruptions are associated with sundowning, characterized by late afternoon and early evening agitation and aggression, and we show TAPP mice exhibit increased aggression around this transition. We show such circadian dysfunction and aggression coincide with hyperphosphorylated Tau (pTau) development in lateral parabrachial (LPB) neurons, with these disturbances appearing earlier in females. Finally, we show LPB neurons, including those expressing dynorphin (LPBdyn), project to circadian structures and are affected by pTau, and LPBdyn ablations partially recapitulate the hyperthermia of TAPP mice. Altogether we link pTau in a brainstem circadian input pathway to AD-related disturbances relevant to sundowning.
