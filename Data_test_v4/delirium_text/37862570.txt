37862570|t|Emergency Palliative Care: Early Assessment of an Older Adult With a Fall and Hip Fracture.
37862570|a|In this segment of the emergency department (ED) palliative care case series, we present a patient who arrives to the ED after a fall resulting in a hip fracture. He is also found to have hypernatremia and an acute kidney injury and develops delirium while in the ED awaiting an inpatient bed. The ED-based integrated geriatric palliative care program is consulted and performs a multidimensional assessment. The geriatric palliative care clinician facilitates discussion with his daughter about surgical intervention based on the patient's goals and values, diagnoses delirium, and worsening depression, creates a plan for delirium and pain management, and accelerates postdischarge planning.
