35554669|a|People with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and delusions have worse quality of life and prognosis. However, early markers of delusions have not been identified yet. The present study investigated whether there are any detectable differences in grey matter (GM) volume and cognitive changes in the year before symptom onset between patients with AD who did and did not develop delusions. Two matched samples of AD patients, 63 who did (PT-D) and 63 who did not develop delusions (PT-ND) over 1 year, were identified from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was used to assess the presence of delusions. Sixty-three additional matched healthy controls (HC) were selected. Repeated-measures ANCOVA models were used to investigate group-by-time effects on the volume of selected GM regions of interest and on cognitive performance. No neurocognitive differences were observed between patient groups prior to symptom onset. Greater episodic memory decline and GM loss in bilateral caudate nuclei, medio-temporal and midline cingulo-parietal regions were found in the PT-D compared with the PT-ND group. A pattern of faster GM loss in brain areas typically affected by AD and in cortical and subcortical targets of dopaminergic pathways, paralleled by worsening of episodic memory and behavioural symptoms, may explain the emergence of delusions in patients with AD.
