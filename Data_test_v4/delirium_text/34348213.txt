34348213|a|Lockdown caused by COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on mental health. The aim was to assess self-reported neurocognitive symptoms during the lockdown and identify associated vulnerable and protective factors in a sample of psychiatric patients in a Spanish population. These results are part of the Barcelona ResIlience Survey for Mental Health COVID-19 (BRIS-MHC) project. Neurocognitive symptoms were assessed through an online survey considering the five items that represented self-reported neurocognitive complaints. We split the sample into two groups based on the severity of the self-reported neurocognitive complaints: intact cognitive function/mild cognitive impairment (CI-) and moderate/severe cognitive impairment (CI+). Univariate analyses were used to compare both groups in terms of sociodemographic and clinical variables. Multiple logistic regression models were carried out to identify clinical variables and coping strategies associated with neurocognitive symptoms. 198 patients with different psychiatric diagnoses were included in this study. One hundred seventeen patients were classified in the CI- group and 81 in the CI+ group. Depressive symptoms and negative psychotic-like symptoms were vulnerable factors for neurocognitive impairment. Coping strategies of performing physical activity, carrying out relaxing activities and maintaining a routine were protective factors against cognitive impairment. Lockdown situation negatively impact on neurocognitive function. Psychopathological symptoms and coping strategies were associated with neurocognitive symptoms during lockdown in subjects with psychiatric illness. The early treatment of psychopathological symptoms in psychiatric patients and promoting coping strategies during lockdown should be considered an intervention strategy against cognitive impairment.
