19343870|t|Discontinuing Alzheimer's disease drug therapy: why, when, and how.
19343870|a|Drug therapy is an important component in the management of AD. The agents discussed do not stop or reverse the disease, but can slow its progression. There are currently 3 AChEIs and memantine available to treat AD. Generally, one agent is started and increased up to a maximum dose. If this agent is not effective or not tolerated, another agent is substituted. Combination therapy with an AChEI and memantine is another option that has shown effectiveness in managing AD. Therapy is generally discontinued if these agents prove to be ineffective or are not tolerated. The decision to stop therapy should involve the resident, family, caregivers, and providers.
