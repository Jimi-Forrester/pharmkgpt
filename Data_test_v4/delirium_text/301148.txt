301148|t|Neurotransmitter precursor amino acids in the treatment of multi-infarct dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
301148|a|Ten patients with severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or multi-infarct dementia (MID) or both, were treated with the precursor amino acids of the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine. The precursor amino acids (PAA) were given orally in a preparation that included tyrosine (4 gm daily) and 5-hydroxy-tryptophan (5-HTP) (800 mg daily), plus carbidopa (100 mg daily) as an aromatic amino-acid decarboxylase inhibitor. Diagnosis was established by an electroencephalogram, brain scan, computerized axial tomographic scan, and in one case by necropsy findings. Serial clinical evaluations and measurements of neuropsychologic function were performed. Levels of homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindole-acetic acid (5-HIAA) were determined before and after administration of probenecid. Side effects of the PAA therapy were diarrhea, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting and agitation, all of which were controlled by reducing the dosage. One patient with MID and one with AD+MID showed clinical and psychologic improvement, but the others did not improve. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid for HVA and 5-HIAA before and after the probenecid test indicated some improvement in the metabolic turnover of these acid metabolites of serotonin and dopamine after administration of their precursor amino acids.
