37075972|a|Current evidence supports the link between hearing loss and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, few studies report the hearing status of AD mice compared to wild-type mice. This study aimed to compare hearing thresholds and short-term memory (STM) performance of an AD (APPNL-G-F) mouse model of amyloid-beta (A ) pathology with C57BL/6 J and CBA/CaJ mice across age. The auditory brainstem response (ABR) test, using click and five tone-burst (TB) stimuli, was recorded at 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months. The novel object recognition (NOR) test, a measure of STM, was conducted at 6 and 12 months. While hearing thresholds were almost preserved in CBA/CaJ mice, they were not recorded at high frequencies with age in C57BL/6 J and AD mice, leading to island hearing (severe to profound hearing loss) at 9 and 12 months. AD mice showed increased hearing thresholds in TB8 and TB16 kHz at 6 and 9 months compared to C57BL/6 J mice. NOR findings were evidence of impaired STM in both C57BL/6 J and AD mice relative to CBA/CaJ mice, and a relationship was found between hearing thresholds and NOR measures in three groups. The findings were in support of the link between the degree of hearing loss and impaired STM.
