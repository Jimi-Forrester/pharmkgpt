39061458|t|Relevance and Premises of Values-Based Practice for Decision Making in Brain Health.
39061458|a|Brain health is a complex concept, shaped by a plethora of determinants related to physical health, healthy environments, safety and security, learning and social connection, as well as access to quality healthcare services. Decision-making in this complex field is characterized by diverse values, potentially conflicting interests, and asymmetrically influential stakeholders. Values-based practice (VBP) is a toolkit for balancing values in a democratic and inclusive way, so that every stakeholder feels a sense of ownership over the decision made. In VBP, the emphasis is on good process rather than on pre-determined 'correct' outcomes. Based on two case vignettes, we highlight the relevance of the ten principles of VBP for balancing different values to the satisfaction of those directly concerned, in a given decision-making process. In addition, we argue that the successful implementation of VBP in the complex area of brain health, as well as in other fields, is premised on higher order values (meta-values), beyond mutual respect and the legal, regulatory, and bioethical framework. These include mutual regard, reciprocity, autonomy, and an egalitarian attitude towards VBP procedures and involved stakeholders.
