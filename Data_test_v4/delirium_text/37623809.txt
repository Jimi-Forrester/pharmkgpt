37623809|t|Bridging the Gap between Basic Research and Clinical Practice: The Growing Role of Translational Neurorehabilitation.
37623809|a|Translational neuroscience is intended as a holistic approach in the field of brain disorders, starting from the basic research of cerebral morphology and with the function of implementing it into clinical practice. This concept can be applied to the rehabilitation field to promote promising results that positively influence the patient's quality of life. The last decades have seen great scientific and technological improvements in the field of neurorehabilitation. In this paper, we discuss the main issues related to translational neurorehabilitation, from basic research to current clinical practice, and we also suggest possible future scenarios.
