33705936|a|Diabetes has been demonstrated to be one of the strongest predictors of risk for postoperative delirium and functional decline in older patients undergoing surgery. Exercise is often prescribed as a treatment for diabetic patients and regular physical activity is hypothesized to decrease the risk of postoperative cognitive impairments. Prior studies suggest that anesthetic emergence trajectories and recovery are predictive of risk for later postoperative cognitive impairments. Therapeutic strategies aimed at improving emergence and recovery from anesthesia may therefore be beneficial for diabetic patients. Wistar (n = 32) and Goto-Kakizaki (GK) type 2 diabetic (n = 32) rats between 3-4 months old underwent treadmill exercise for 30 min/day for ten days or remained inactive. Pre-anesthesia spontaneous alternation behavior was recorded with a Y-maze. Rats then received a 2-h exposure to 1.5-2 % isoflurane or oxygen only. The time to reach anesthetic emergence and post-anesthesia recovery behaviors was recorded for each rat. Postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), an important scaffolding protein required for synaptic plasticity, protein levels were quantified from hippocampus using western blot. Spontaneous alternation behavior (p = 0.044) and arm entries (p < 0.001) were decreased in GK rats. There was no difference between groups in emergence times from isoflurane, but exercise hastened the recovery time (p = 0.008) for both Wistar and GK rats. Following 10 days of exercise, both Wistar and GK rats show increased levels of PSD-95 in the hippocampus. Prehabilitation with moderate intensity exercise, even on a short timescale, is beneficial for recovery from isoflurane in rats, regardless of metabolic disease status.
