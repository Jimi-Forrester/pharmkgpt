38939038|t|Liberation From Mechanical Ventilation in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit.
38939038|a|The prevalence of respiratory failure is increasing in the contemporary cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) and is associated with a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. For patients that survive their initial respiratory decompensation, liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and the decision to extubate requires careful clinical assessment and planning. Therefore, it is essential for the CICU clinician to know how to assess and manage the various stages of IMV liberation, including ventilator weaning, evaluation of extubation readiness, and provide post-extubation care. In this review, we provide a comprehensive approach to liberation from IMV in the CICU, including cardiopulmonary interactions relative to withdrawal from positive pressure ventilation, evaluation of readiness for and assessment of spontaneous breathing trials, sedation management to optimize extubation, strategies for patients at a high risk for extubation failure, and tracheostomy in the cardiovascular patient.
