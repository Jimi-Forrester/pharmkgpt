38928108|t|The Impact of Fine Particulate Matter on Embryonic Development.
38928108|a|Airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in air pollution has become a significant global public health concern related to allergic diseases. Previous research indicates that PM2.5 not only affects the respiratory system but may also induce systemic inflammation in various tissues. Moreover, its impact may vary among different populations, with potential consequences during pregnancy and in newborns. However, the precise mechanisms through which PM2.5 induces inflammatory reactions remain unclear. This study aims to explore potential pathways of inflammatory responses induced by PM2.5 through animal models and zebrafish embryo experiments. In this study, zebrafish embryo experiments were conducted to analyze the effects of PM2.5 on embryo development and survival, and mouse experimental models were employed to assess the impact of PM2.5 stimulation on various aspects of mice. Wild-type zebrafish embryos were exposed to a PM2.5 environment of 25-400 mug/mL starting at 6 h after fertilization (6 hpf). At 6 days post-fertilization, the survival rates of the 25, 50, 100, and 200 microg/mL groups were 100%, 80, 40%, and 40%, respectively. Zebrafish embryos stimulated with 25 mug/mL of PM2.5 still exhibited successful development and hatching. Additionally, zebrafish subjected to doses of 25-200 mug/mL displayed abnormalities such as spinal curvature and internal swelling after hatching, indicating a significant impact of PM2.5 stimulation on embryo development. In the mouse model, mice exposed to PM2.5 exhibited apparent respiratory overreaction, infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lungs, elevated levels of inflammatory response-related cytokines, and inflammation in various organs, including the liver, lungs, and uterus. Blood tests on experimental mice revealed increased expression of inflammatory and chemotactic cytokines, and GSEA indicated the induction of various inflammatory responses and an upregulation of the TNF-alpha/NFkappaB pathway by PM2.5. Our results provide insights into the harmful effects of PM2.5 on embryos and organs. The induced inflammatory responses by PM2.5 may be mediated through the TNF-alpha/NFkappaB pathway, leading to systemic organ inflammation. However, whether PM2.5-induced inflammatory responses in various organs and abnormal embryo development are generated through different pathways requires further study to comprehensively clarify and identify potential treatment and prevention methods.
