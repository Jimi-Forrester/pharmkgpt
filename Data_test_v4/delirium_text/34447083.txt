34447083|t|Evaluation of Oral Hygiene Status in Patients with Hemorrhagic and Ischemic Stroke.
34447083|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke can broadly be categorized into ischemic or hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke accounts for 85% of cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), whereas hemorrhagic stroke accounts for 15% of CVAs. Stroke is broadly associated with loss of sensation or unilateral paralysis of orofacial structures. OBJECTIVES: The present study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of various oral features in patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred patients diagnosed with stroke admitted in the intensive care unit were included in the study. The evaluation of oral manifestations and their prevalence was done by a well-experienced oral medicine expert deputed in the dental department of the hospital. A single examiner performed all oral evaluations. RESULTS: The mean and median for the age were 60.8 and 59. Sixty of 100 patients were male, whereas 38 were female. Forty patients had hemorrhagic stroke, whereas 60 had ischemic stroke. Senenty-eight patients of 100 had features of periodontitis, 90 of 100 patients presented with halitosis, 79 presented with caries, 83 patients had positive signs of tongue hypermobility, and 75 patients had dysphagia. CONCLUSION: Oral hygiene is the most neglected aspect during rehabilitation in stroke patients. It is critical for stroke patients to receive thorough oral care, as it can prevent other systemic ailments and potentially life-threatening complications like aspiration pneumonia.
