7214934|t|[Anatomo-clinical study of a case of topographic confabulation (or delusion)].
7214934|a|The authors report an observation of a fixed monothematic and long-termed topographical confabulation associated to a topographical disorientation, without mental confusion. Different factors leading to such a confabulation are discussed (alteration of topographical memory, anosognosia of the ambulatory defect, age of the patient). The favourable effect of neuroleptics permit to regard the continuity between confabulation and delirium. Anatomical data prove an isolated right parieto-temporal infarct.
