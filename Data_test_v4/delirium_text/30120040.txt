30120040|a|INTRODUCTION: Blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown is observed in older versus younger adults and in late-onset Alzheimer's disease versus age-matched controls, but its causes and consequences in aging are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that BBB breakdown is associated with cognitive decline and inflammation in nondemented elders. METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid and serum inflammatory markers were measured using sandwich immunoassays in 120 subjects. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator-logistic regression selected cerebrospinal fluid and serum signatures that best classified BBB impairment defined by the cerebrospinal fluid albumin index >=9. Linear regression examined changes in Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes as a function of BBB integrity at baseline. RESULTS: Mean age was 70 years, mean Mini-Mental State Examination was 27, and BBB impairment was recorded in 13.5%. BBB breakdown was associated with cognitive decline (P = .015). Cerebrospinal fluid intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin-8, serum amyloid A, macrophage derived chemokine, and gender generated an area under the curve of 0.95 for BBB impairment, and serum IL-16, VEGF-D, IL-15, and other variables generated an AUC of 0.92 for BBB impairment. DISCUSSION: BBB breakdown is associated with more rapid cognitive decline. Inflammatory mechanisms, including cell adhesion, neutrophil migration, lipid metabolism, and angiogenesis may be implicated.
