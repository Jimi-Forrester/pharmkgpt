38570083|t|Memory Circuits in Dementia: The Engram, Hippocampal Neurogenesis and Alzheimer's disease.
38570083|a|Here, we provide an in-depth consideration of our current understanding of engrams, spanning from molecular to network levels, and hippocampal neurogenesis, in health and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review highlights novel findings in these emerging research fields and future research directions for novel therapeutic avenues for memory failure in dementia. Engrams, memory in AD, and hippocampal neurogenesis have each been extensively studied. The integration of these topics, however, has been relatively less deliberated, and is the focus of this review. We primarily focus on the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, which is a key area of episodic memory formation. Episodic memory is significantly impaired in AD, and is also the site of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Advancements in technology, especially opto- and chemogenetics, have made sophisticated manipulations of engram cells possible. Furthermore, innovative methods have emerged for monitoring neurons, even specific neuronal populations, in vivo while animals engage in tasks, such as calcium imaging. In vivo calcium imaging contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of engram cells. Critically, studies of the engram in the DG using these technologies have shown the important contribution of hippocampal neurogenesis for memory in both health and AD. Together, the discussion of these topics provides a holistic perspective that motivates questions for future research.
