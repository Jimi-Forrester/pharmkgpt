38138159|t|Severe Vitamin D Deficiency-A Possible Cause of Resistance to Treatment in Psychiatric Pathology.
38138159|a|In the last few years, vitamin D functions have been studied progressively, and along with their main role in regulating calcium homeostasis, the potential function in the nervous system and the link between different psychiatric disorders and vitamin D deficiency have been revealed. The discovery of vitamin D receptors in multiple brain structures, like the hippocampus, led to the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency could be responsible for treatment resistance in psychiatric diseases. The aim of this study was to analyze the current knowledge in the literature regarding vitamin D deficiency among individuals afflicted with psychiatric disorders and assess the potential therapeutic benefits of vitamin D supplementation. A systematic search was conducted on the PubMed database for articles published in the last five years (2016-2022) in English, focusing on human subjects. Results show that vitamin D deficiency has implications for numerous psychiatric disorders, affecting mood and behavior through its influence on neurotransmitter release, neurotrophic factors, and neuroprotection. It also plays a role in modulating inflammation, which is often elevated in psychiatric disorders. In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency is prevalent and has far-reaching implications for mental health. This review underscores the importance of exploring the therapeutic potential of vitamin D supplementation in individuals with psychiatric disorders and highlights the need for further research in this complex field.
