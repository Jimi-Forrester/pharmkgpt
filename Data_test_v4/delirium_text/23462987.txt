23462987|a|There is evidence that naturally occurring antibodies directed against Abeta (nAbs-Abeta) have a role in Abeta-metabolism and Abeta-clearance. The presence of nAbs-Abeta leads to a reduction in amyloid fibrillation and thus a reduction in their toxicity. We investigated the effects of nAbs-Abeta in respect to oligomerization and used the Tg2576 transgenic mouse model in order to investigate the rapid effect with a single-dose (24 h) on oligomer breakdown and cytokine secretion along with immunohistochemical characterization of synaptic plasticity. nAbs-Abeta were able to reduce toxic oligomer concentration with an increase in Abeta-monomers. Cytokine secretion was significantly reduced. Synaptic plasticity was also improved after administration of nAbs. Finally, single treatment lead to a significant improvement in cognition. This study demonstrates the efficacy of nAbs-Abeta and presents evidence that several hallmarks of the disease are targeted by nAbs-Abeta.
