37340793|a|Objective: This study explored the perspectives of specialist palliative care (SPC) teams in Ireland, in relation to personal learning needs and education regarding dementia care. Methods: This mixed-methods study involved a survey and focus group. SPC staff were recruited through a professional palliative care society and via hospices in 4 regions. Survey items included challenges in clinical care, personal learning needs, and preferred modes of educational delivery. Quantitative data analysis was descriptive; open-answer survey questions and the focus group transcript underwent thematic analysis. Results: In total, 76 staff completed surveys and rated the following as most challenging: timely access to community agency and specialist support; and managing the needs of people with dementia (PwD). Respondents volunteered additional challenges around the timing/duration of SPC involvement, prognostication, and inadequate knowledge of local services. Staff ranked learning needs as highest in: nonpharmacological management of noncognitive and cognitive symptoms; differentiation of dementia subtypes; and pharmacological management of cognitive symptoms. The focus group (n = 4) gave deeper perspectives on these topics. Overall, 79.2% of staff preferred formal presentations by dementia-care specialists and 76.6% preferred e-learning. Conclusion: Several dementia-care challenges and learning needs are identified by SPC staff, as above. These can inform the design and delivery of tailored education programs for SPC staff. There is also a need for closer working between dementia services and SPC services to provide integrated, holistic care for PwD. One aspect of achieving this is greater awareness of local dementia-care services among SPC staff, and vice versa.
