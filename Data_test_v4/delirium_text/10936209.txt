10936209|a|In many neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, inclusions containing ubiquitinated proteins have been found in the brain, suggesting a pathophysiological role for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of neuronal proteins. Here we show for the first time that the beta-amyloid fragment 1-40, which in micromolar levels causes the death of cortical neurons, also induces the ubiquitination of several neuronal proteins. Prevention of ubiquitination and inhibition of proteasome activity block the neurotoxic effect of beta-amyloid. These data suggest that beta-amyloid neurotoxicity may cause toxicity through the activation of protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. These findings suggest possible new pharmacological targets for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of Alzheimer's disease and possibly for other related neurodegenerative disorders.
