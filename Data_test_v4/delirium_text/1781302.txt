1781302|t|An autopsy case of spinal arteriovenous malformation (Foix-Alajouanine syndrome).
1781302|a|An autopsy case of spinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) was reported. The patient was a 75-year-old male and his initial neurologic symptoms were paraplegia, paresthesia below the umbilical level and urination difficulty. Subsequently night delirium and parkinsonism also appeared. The clinical and pathological findings in this case are identical with those in the spinal AVM except for Parkinson's disease. In addition, the lateral funiculus of the spinal cord in the middle thoracic segment showed pallor: Under light microscopy, the funiculus was spongiform, with a thinner wall of the myelin sheath, enlargement of the axon and the perivascular infiltration of phagocytes without plasma exudation. The changes in the lateral funiculus seemed to indicate early congestive changes.
