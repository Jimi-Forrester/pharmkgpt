33089045|a|BACKGROUND: Fulminant cardiac involvement in COVID-19 patients has been reported; the underlying suspected mechanisms include myocarditis, arrhythmia, and cardiac tamponade. In parallel, atrial fibrillation is common in the elderly population which is at particularly high risk for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. CASE SUMMARY: A 72-year-old male SARS-CoV2-positive patient was admitted to the intensive care unit due to delirium and acute respiratory failure. Atrial fibrillation known from history was exacerbated, and made complex rate and rhythm control necessary. Progressive heart failure with haemodynamic deterioration and acute kidney injury with the need for continuous renal replacement therapy were further aggravated by pericardial tamponade. DISCUSSION: Treatment of acute heart failure in COVID-19 patients with a cytokine storm complicated by tachycardic atrial fibrillation should include adequate rate or rhythm control, and potentially immunomodulation.
