39897094|t|The health and economic burden of brain disorders: Consequences for investment in diagnosis, treatment, prevention and R&D.
39897094|a|Brain disorders are prevalent across all age groups but particularly in the elderly, highlighting the importance of preserving brain health in ageing populations. There have been few previous studies to address the complete scope of burden of brain disorders, including direct and indirect costs as well as intangible costs from morbidity and mortality. We seek to illustrate the full health and economic impact of brain disorders by leveraging data from previous large-scale epidemiological and health economic studies to estimate the total direct, indirect and intangible cost of brain disorders in 2019. Two alternative methods were used to estimate indirect costs: the human capital (HC) method (data from the CBDE2010 study), and the willingness-to-pay (WTP) per DALY method (data from GBD2019). Less than 10% of the costs of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias are incurred by the health care system, while Alzheimer's disease and other dementias is the costliest condition using the HC approach and stroke is the costliest condition due to the large number of life-years lost, followed by AD using the WTP approach. Using per-capita GDP as a proxy for WTP, the indirect costs were nearly four times higher compared to the conventional HC approach. We found that Indirect costs of brain disorders outweigh the direct costs for diagnosis, treatment and care even in high-income countries with advanced, universally accessible systems in Europe. There is likely underinvestment in R&D for brain disorders, and health care systems may lack sufficient incentives to invest in their treatment and prevention.
