38445335|a|Delirium in patients has well-documented adverse physical and mental outcomes. Delirium impairs patients' capacity to grasp and retain information, thus affecting their right to informed consent and active participation in treatment and care decisions. In Danish hospitals, delirium afflicts up to 50% of the elderly patients, yet it often goes unreported due to the absence of systematic screening. The selection of a screening tool should be contextually relevant. This review gives an overview of delirium screening instruments available in Danish, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages.
