38204857|t|Readmissions After Left Atrial Appendage Closure in Patients With Previous Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack.
38204857|a|Background: We examined the frequency and risk factors associated with readmission after left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) in patients with and without previous ischemic stroke and/or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Methods: Hospitalizations for LAAC were identified from the US National Readmission Database, 2016-2018. The primary outcome was the first unplanned readmission after LAAC, with readmission times stratified into those occurring within 0 to 30 days vs within 31 to 180 days. Patients were stratified based on the history of previous stroke and/or TIA. Results: Of 12,901 discharges after LAAC, 28% had previous stroke and/or TIA, and 8.2% had a readmission within 30 days while 18% had a readmission within 31 to 180 days. The rates of in-hospital complications and readmissions at both periods were not significantly different between individuals with vs without previous stroke and/or TIA. Cardiac causes accounted for 28% of readmissions within 30 days and 32% of those within 31 to 180 days, and congestive failure, bleeding, and infections were the most common readmission diagnoses. New stroke and/or TIA accounted for 4% and 6% of the total noncardiac readmissions within 30 days and 31 to 180 days, respectively, and the incidence was higher among those with previous stroke and/or TIA. Female sex and index hospitalization length of stay (LOS) > 1 day were factors independently associated with readmission within 30 days, whereas LOS, diabetes, renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and anemia were among the factors associated with readmissions within 31 to 180 days. Conclusions: Unplanned rehospitalizations were common after LAAC and had similar frequency for patients with vs without previous ischemic stroke and/or TIA. Female sex and index hospitalization LOS > 1 day were among the strongest factors that were independently associated with readmission within 30 days.
