35571625|t|Validation and psychometric properties of the multidimensional scale of perceived social support among Korean breast cancer survivors.
35571625|a|Objective: Social support plays a key role in dealing with various challenges accompanying cancer treatment and survivorship. The multidimensional scale of perceived social support (MSPSS) is a valid measurement used globally to assess general support from social interpersonal relations. This study aims to validate the psychometric properties of the Korean version of the MSPSS among Korean women with breast cancer. Methods: Two independent cross-sectional studies collected data from 349 non-metastatic breast cancer survivors. Statistical analyses of confirmatory factor analyses, t-test, and Pearson correlation were performed to test construct validity, including factorial structure, concurrent validity, and known-group comparisons. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were used to evaluate the reliability. Results: Factor analysis confirmed a three-factor construct (i.e., family, friends, and spouse) with good fit indices. Concurrent validity was verified by correlations with social well-being and interpersonal relationships, which are theoretically relevant concepts. Known-group validity was also confirmed by different MSPSS scores according to depression and symptom distress levels. Reliability was supported by good internal consistency and acceptable test-retest correlation coefficients. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate the MSPSS is a valid and reliable measurement to assess the extent to which women with breast cancer perceive social support from spouses, other family members, and friends in Korea. Further studies should verify the psychometric properties of the MSPSS in patients with other cancers beyond breast cancer. Health professionals could administer the MSPSS to evaluate the diverse resources of social support among cancer survivors.
