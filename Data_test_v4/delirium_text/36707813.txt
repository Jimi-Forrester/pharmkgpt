36707813|a|BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in adults. However, ALS, especially sporadic ALS (sALS), is difficult to diagnose due to the lack of biomarkers. RESULTS: We used the bioinformatics technology to find the potential biomarker and we found that two hundred seventy-four DEGs were identified and enrichment analysis showed DEGs were involved in nervous system activity, like axon_guidance and the neurotrophin_signaling_pathway. Five nervous system-specific expressed hub genes were further validated by three GEO datasets. APP, LRRK2, and PSEN1 might be potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of sALS, and NEAT1-miR-373-3p/miR-302c-3p/miR-372-3p-APP, circ_0000002-miR-302d-3p/miR-373-3p-APP and XIST-miR-9-5p/miR-30e-5p/miR-671-5p might be potential ceRNA regulatory pathways. APP SNP analysis showed subjects harboring the minor G allele of rs463946, minor G allele of rs466433 and minor C allele of rs364048 had an increased risk of sALS development. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identified three nervous system-specific expressed hub genes that might be diagnostic and prognostic markers of sALS and APP might be a genetic susceptibility factor contributing to sALS development.
