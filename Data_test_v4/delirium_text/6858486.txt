6858486|t|[Various aspects of current treatment of patients with alcoholic delirium].
6858486|a|The study is based on the results of clinico-catamnestic evaluation of various methods (two kinds of placebo, antabuse, esperal, and a number of psychotropic drugs and their combinations) of treating 526 chronic alcoholics. Under study there were groups of the addicts comparable in the age, form and duration of the disease, and the degree of personality degradation. The data obtained show that it is preferable to individualize the application of the psychotropic means and combinations with regard to the changes in the addicts' psychics, characteristics of their premorbid personality, and the course of the disease in each particular case.
