34988899|a|Neuroinflammation is characterized by reactive microglia and astrocytes (collectively called gliosis) in the central nervous system and is considered as one of the main pathological hallmarks in different neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, age-related dementia, and multiple sclerosis. Upon activation, glia undergoes structural and morphological changes such as the microglial cells swell in size and astrocytes become bushy, which play both beneficial and detrimental roles. Hence, they are unable to perform the normal physiological role in brain immunity. Curcumin, a cytokine suppressive anti-inflammatory drug, has a high proven pre-clinical potency and efficacy to reverse chronic neuroinflammation by attenuating the activation and morphological changes that occur in the microglia and astrocytes. This review will highlight the recent findings on the tree structure changes of microglia and astrocytes in neuroinflammation and the effects of curcumin against the activation and morphology of glial cells.
