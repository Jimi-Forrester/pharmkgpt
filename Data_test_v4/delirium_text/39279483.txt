39279483|t|The clinical value of nonpharmacological interventions for preventing postoperative delirium: a narrative review.
39279483|a|Postoperative delirium (POD) is a prevalent perioperative complication among elderly individuals and is a cause of significant detrimental consequences for both individuals and society. Pharmacological and nonpharmacological prevention methods/therapies have been proposed to mitigate the risk of POD. Nevertheless, the efficacy of pharmacological interventions is controversial, and some of them cause side effects. Therefore, numerous studies have explored the effectiveness of nonpharmacological interventions in mitigating POD and have recommended the use of nonpharmacological multicomponent interventions by an interdisciplinary team as primary interventions. However, dedicated units aimed at promoting comanagement are rare and are only present in academic hospitals. Therefore, there is increasing interest in nonpharmacological mono-component interventions for preventing POD, which offer advantages such as easy application, cost-effectiveness, patient acceptability and noninvasiveness. These interventions are divided into cognitive training and noncognitive interventions. The former is aimed at increasing cognitive reserve, thus decreasing the incidence rate of POD. Noncognitive interventions, including sensory stimuli (music therapy, odor enrichment), improving sleep disturbances, physical activity, acupuncture and transcranial magnetic/direct current stimulation, are aimed at decreasing the risk factors for POD. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recently reported nonpharmacological mono-component interventions for preventing POD and briefly describes their clinical value.
