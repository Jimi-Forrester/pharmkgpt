7404309|a|Serious withdrawal symptoms in patients with alcoholism who undergo operation can be prevented or effectively treated by providing small amounts of alcohol throughout the withdrawal period. Delirium tremens is a potentially fatal symptom complex which may develop when a prolonged daily drinking pattern is interrupted by illness or injury. It was first described by Thomas Sutton in 1813. The withdrawal period is usually less than 72 hours but may be as long as ten days. It is not necessary to maintain a measurable blood level of alcohol for this therapy to be effective. Ten to 15 milliliters of ethanol given hourly, either orally or intravenously, is usually sufficient to prevent or control serious withdrawal symptoms.
