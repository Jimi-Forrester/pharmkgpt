36089140|a|This systematic review aims to discover the plausible mechanism of Ozone in A.D., to boost translational research. The main focus of our review lies in understanding the effects of ozone pollution on the human brain and causing degenerative disease. Owing to the number of works carried out as preclinical evidence in association with oxidative stress and Alzheimer's disease and the lack of systematic review or meta-analysis prompted us to initiate a study on Alzheimer's risk due to ground-level ozone. We found relevant studies from PubMed, ScienceDirect, Proquest, DOAJ, and Scopus, narrowing to animal studies and the English language without any time limit. The searches will be re-run before the final analysis. This work was registered in Prospero with Reg ID CRD42022319360, followed the PRISMA-P framework, and followed the PICO approach involving Population, Intervention/Exposure, Comparison, and Outcomes data. Bibliographic details of 16 included studies were studied for Exposure dose of ozone, duration, exposure, and frequency with control and exposure groups. Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed based on pathology significance, and results were significant in inducing Alzheimer-like pathology by ozone. In conclusion, ozone altered oxidative stress, metabolic pathway, and amyloid plaque accumulation besides endothelial stress response involving mitochondria as the critical factor in ATP degeneration, caspase pathway, and neuronal damage. Thus, ozone is a criteria pollutant to be focused on in mitigating Alzheimer's Disease pathology.
