37903107|a|AIM AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the levels of knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward palliative care (PC) among nurses working with patients diagnosed with cancer in Jordan. BACKGROUND: PC is a growing specialty in healthcare and nursing in Jordan with an increased need to expand its scope, develop policies to govern it, and increase the awareness of its importance especially for patients diagnosed with cancer. DESIGN: Cross sectional design was used in the current study. METHODS: Using an online self-report questionnaire data was collected from 228 nurses working at four hospitals in Amman. The four hospitals were from three different healthcare sectors: one public, one educational, and two private hospitals. A convenience sampling method was employed. RESULTS: Results showed a low level of PC knowledge (M = 8.8), a moderate level of attitudes (M = 80.9) toward dying patients, and a moderate level of PC practices (M = 52.7). Differences in PC knowledge, attitudes, and practices were found in regard to nurses' gender, level of education, PC training, years of experience, and working sector. Significant correlations were found between PC practices with both PC knowledge and attitudes toward dying patients. No significant relationship between PC knowledge and attitudes toward dying patients. CONCLUSION: Low level of PC knowledge and moderate level of attitudes toward dying patients. Differences in PC knowledge, attitudes, and practices were found in regard to some participants' demographics.
