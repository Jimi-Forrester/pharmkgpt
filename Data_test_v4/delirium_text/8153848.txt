8153848|a|Individual, family, and group counseling service recommendations made by California's diagnostic and treatment center staff to a clinical sample of Alzheimer's disease clients (N = 822) are examined using logistic regression. Predictors included the patients' enabling, need, and predisposing characteristics. Analysis shows that staff tend to consider fewer patient characteristics, and rely more on assessed family problems and payment source when deciding whether they recommend counseling to their patients.
