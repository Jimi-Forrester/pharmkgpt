30834074|t|Depression was associated with apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele polymorphism: A meta-analysis.
30834074|a|OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have reached different conclusions regarding an association between apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphisms and depression. This meta-analysis was designed to clarify these controversies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literatures were identified reviewing the national and international databases. The eligible articles for meta-analysis were determined by quality assessment and implementation of inclusion/exclusion criteria. This meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.2 software. The odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CIs) were calculated using a fixed effects model. Funnel plots and Egger's regression tests were used to assess the publication bias. RESULTS: A total of nine studies that met the inclusion criteria were identified by performing a comprehensive search on the association between APOE polymorphisms and depression. APOE epsilon4 allele was significantly associated with depression (allele: OR=1.36, 95%CI=1.11-1.66, P=0.003; dominant: OR=1.34, 95%CI=1.06-1.68, P=0.001; recessive: OR= 1.11, 95%CI =0.45-2.76, P=0.82). HAMD scores were higher in depression patients with-APOE epsilon4 genotype than who without-APOE epsilon4 genotype (OR=0.96, 95%CI=0.16-1.76, P=0.02). CONCLUSION: APOE epsilon4 allele increased the depression risk; depressive patients carrying APOE epsilon4 allele had more severe depressive symptoms.
