Here we evaluated the hypothesis that long-term ibuprofen treatment affects cortical sources of resting electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms in mild AD patients. METHODS: Twenty-three AD patients (13 treated AD IBUPROFEN; 10 untreated AD PLACEBO) were enrolled. Resting EEG data were recorded before and 1 year after the ibuprofen/placebo treatment. EEG rhythms were delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta 1 (13-20 Hz), and beta 2 (20-30 Hz). LORETA was used for EEG source analysis. RESULTS: In the AD PLACEBO group, amplitude of delta sources was globally greater at follow-up than baseline. Instead, amplitude of delta sources remained stable or decreased in the majority of the AD IBUPROFEN patients. Clinical (CDR) but not global cognitive status (MMSE) reflected EEG results. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that in mild AD patients, a long-term ibuprofen treatment slightly slows down the progressive increment of delta rhythms as a sign of contrast against the neurodegenerative processes. SIGNIFICANCE: They motivate future investigations with larger population and extended neuropsychological testing, to study the relationships among ibuprofen treatment, delta cortical sources, and higher order functions.
