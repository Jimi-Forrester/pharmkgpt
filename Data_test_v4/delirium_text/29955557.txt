29955557|a|INTRODUCTION: Antipsychotics are used off label to treat behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Due to the emerging data of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for treatment of BPSD, clinicians may choose to use this medication class instead of antipsychotics when pharmacologic therapy is necessary. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of antipsychotic discontinuation 6 months after SSRI initiation for the treatment of BPSD. METHODS: Patients with Alzheimer dementia who were prescribed an antipsychotic and later prescribed an SSRI for BPSD during January 1, 2009, through December 30, 2014, were studied. Exclusion criteria included (1) a dementia diagnosis besides Alzheimer; (2) scheduled benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, or non-SSRI antidepressant use during the study period; (3) diagnoses of bipolar or psychotic disorders; and (4) diagnosis of delirium during the study period. Patients' age, sex, race, and functional assessment of staging for Alzheimer disease scores were collected. The names, doses, and stop dates of SSRIs and antipsychotics were also recorded. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were included in the analyses. Overall, antipsychotic use was reduced in 11 patients (30.6%). Ten patients (27.8%) discontinued the antipsychotic, and 1 additional patient had a reduction in dose. When comparing specific SSRIs, 8 (72%) responders were prescribed citalopram, and 15 (60%) nonresponders were prescribed sertraline. DISCUSSION: Approximately 30% of patients with Alzheimer dementia who were prescribed antipsychotics for BPSD were able to discontinue the medication or had a dose reduction after starting SSRI therapy. Most SSRI responders were prescribed citalopram.
