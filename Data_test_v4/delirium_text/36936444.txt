36936444|t|Complex Association Among Diet Styles, Sleep Patterns, and Obesity in Patients with Diabetes.
36936444|a|Background: Health risk factors (HRFs), including the adjustment of disturbed sleep patterns (including disorders and duration) and improvement of dietary intake, have become relatively novel and critical strategies to prevent the development of diabesity and treat diabetic complications. Objective: We aimed to explore 1) whether there was an association between diet styles (including healthy and unhealthy diets) and diabesity; 2) whether sleep patterns could moderate this relationship; and 3) whether there was a complex interaction association between sleep patterns, diet styles, and diabesity. Methods: The study was based on a national survey conducted by the China National Diabetic Chronic Complications Study Group, this study extracted data from some cities in Anhui Province and obtained basic and lifestyle information using a detailed questionnaire for analysis. The primary exposure was diet styles, and the outcomes were body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), while HbA1c and FBG and sleep patterns were moderators. Data were pooled using logistic regression and moderation analysis. Results: The overall response rate was 92.0%. This study ultimately included 1765 participants. The mean age was 57.10 +- 10.0 years. Sociographically, participants with lower educational levels were more likely to have lower levels of WC (chi 2 = 2.73) and BMI (chi 2 = 3.47), were female (t=6.54), were more likely to have lower educational levels (F=13.78) and were older (F=23.75), were more likely to have higher detection rates of sleep disorders and were more likely to have other HRFs (walking, SSBs, HbA1c and TG). Additionally, diet styles were also significantly associated with BMI and WC. In the moderation analysis, SES (socioeconomic status) also affected the correlation between healthy diet style, sleep disorders and WC (beta=0.20), neither in BMI nor unhealthy diet style in BMI and WC; the combination effect between diet styles, sleep patterns and HbA1c was associated with WC and BMI. Conclusion: Complex associations and interactions were found between diet styles, sleep patterns, HbA1c, and diabesity. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the dietary pattern and other HRFS that cause diabesity, so as to strengthen further preventive measures. These results can provide some theoretical basis for the treatment of diabesity in the public health field.
