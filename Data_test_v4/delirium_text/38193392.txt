38193392|a|The increasing nanoparticle (NP) applications in the biomedical field have become an emerging concern regarding human health. NP exposure may play a role in the accelerating Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression; however, the etiology of this disorder is complex and remains largely unclear. Here, we identified that intravenous injection of silica NPs (SiNPs) caused the blood-brain barrier breakdown via downregulating tight junction-related gene expressions. Meanwhile, SiNPs upregulate the transport receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) that govern the beta-amyloid (Abeta) influx to the brain; however, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) that controls the efflux of Abeta from the brain was not affected. Consequently, an increase in Abeta burden in the brain of SiNP-challenged APP/PS1 mice was found. Intriguingly, plasma apolipoprotein E (ApoE) adsorbed on the surface of SiNPs partially relieves this effect. Using ApoE knockout (ApoE-/-) mice, we confirmed that SiNPs covered with serum without ApoE showed further elevated AD symptoms. Together, this study offered a compilation of data to support the potential risk factors of NP exposure and AD pathology.
