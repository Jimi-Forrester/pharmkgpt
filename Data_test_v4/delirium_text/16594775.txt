16594775|a|Forty-six preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) participants and 188 nondemented control persons from the Kungsholmen Project (L. Backman et al., 2004) were compared on prospective memory (ProM) and retrospective memory (RetM) tasks 3 years before dementia diagnosis. The preclinical AD participants showed deficits in both ProM and RetM. Most interestingly, logistic regression analyses revealed that ProM made an independent contribution to the prediction of AD over and above that of RetM. This finding suggests that ProM and RetM tap partly different cognitive operations. Furthermore, within the ProM task, both the retrospective and prospective components were similarly impaired in preclinical AD. Within RetM, the preclinical AD participants were impaired on indices of encoding, storage (forgetting), and retrieval of information. Hence, the findings indicate a rather global episodic memory impairment in preclinical AD that cuts across type of memory assessed (ProM and RetM) as well as across different components of both the ProM and RetM tasks.
