30466001|a|Previously, a series of aurones bearing amine and carbamate functionalities was synthesized and evaluated for their cholinesterase inhibitory activity and drug-like attributes. In the present study, these aurones were evaluated for their multi-targeting properties in two Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related activities namely, monoamine oxidase (MAO) and amyloid-beta (Abeta) inhibition. Evaluation of the aurones for MAO inhibitory activity disclosed several potent selective inhibitors of MAO-B, particularly those with 6-methoxyl group attached at ring A. Of the different amine moieties attached as side chains, pyrrolidine-bearing aurones were prominent as represented by 2-2, the most potent inhibitor. Evaluation on the Abeta aggregation inhibition identified 4-3 as the best inhibitor with a percentage inhibition comparable to that of a known Abeta inhibitor curcumin. Examination on the neuroprotective ability of the more drug-like aurone 4-3 in two Caenorhabditis elegans neurodegeneration models showed 4-3 to protect the nematodes against both Abeta- and 6-hydroxydopamine-induced toxicities. These new activities further support 4-3 as a promising lead to develop the aurones as potential multipotent agents for neurodegenerative diseases.
