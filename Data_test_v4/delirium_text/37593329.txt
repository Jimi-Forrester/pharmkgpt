37593329|t|Imaging features of fulminant cerebral malaria: A case report.
37593329|a|Cerebral malaria is associated with high mortality and morbidity in patients infected with Plasmodium Falciparum. The mechanisms of cerebral malaria include sequestration of parasitized red blood cells in brain capillaries, production of cytokines, immune cell/platelet accumulation, and release of microparticles, resulting in disruption of the blood-brain barrier, which caused brain injuries. The severity of this reflects on neurological findings ranging from simple delirium to profound coma. We herein present unique magnetic resonance imaging findings of a case of fulminant cerebral malaria as computed tomography studies usually underestimate the extent of cerebral involvement in malaria.
