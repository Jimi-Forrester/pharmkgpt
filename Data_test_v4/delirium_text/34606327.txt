34606327|t|Introduction to the Theme "New Insights, Strategies, and Therapeutics for Common Diseases".
34606327|a|The reviews in Volume 62 of the Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology (ARPT) cover a diverse range of topics. A theme that encompasses many of these reviews is their relevance to common diseases and disorders, including type 2 diabetes, heart failure, cancer, tuberculosis, Alzheimer's disease, neurodegenerative disorders, and Down syndrome. Other reviews highlight important aspects of therapeutics, including placebos and patient-centric approaches to drug formulation. The reviews with this thematic focus, as well as other reviews in this volume, emphasize new mechanistic insights, experimental and therapeutic strategies, and novel insights regarding topics in the disciplines of pharmacology and toxicology. As the editors of ARPT, we believe that these reviews help advance those disciplines and, even more importantly, have the potential to improve the health care of the world's population.
