19665242|a|This study was aimed at evaluating the occurrence of DLB in a population sample recovered in assisted sanitary residence (RSA=from the Italian name of "Residenza Sanitaria Assistita") in the Province of Catania. We considered 126 patients from a randomized population recovered in RSA of Viagrande (Catania) in the period from 1st March, 2005 and 31st March, 2007. Those who proved to be demented according to the DSM-III diagnostic protocols, and having a mini mental state examination (MMSE)-score <24 were divided in 2 groups: Group A, all the demented people without the DLB; and Group B, the DLB patients, according to the diagnostic criteria of McKeith. All patients underwent at admission, after 1 month, and at emission the following psychometric and functional tests: MMSE, geriatric depression scale (GDS) [Yesavage J.A., Brink T.L., Rose T.L., Adey M., 1983. The development and validation of geriatric depression screening scale: a preliminary report. J. Psych. Res. 17, 37], Barthel index (BI), activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL). Particular attention was dedicated to the presence of delirium during the last 15 days before the admission and during the recovery, the mortality and the prevalence of other complaints. The observed data confirm the prevalence of fragility of DLB patients in 20% of them, a fluctuation of the cognitive capacities, a better recovery of the affectivity, a reduced functional autonomy and autosufficiency. In addition, the DLB patients display a major presence of prevalent delirium, compared to the total population of demented patients, while in this last population only incidental delirium episodes occurred during the recovery period (31.6% vs. 16.6%; p<0.001). In the DLB population decubital lesions occurred more frequently, and were of more severe staging, compared to the controls (45% vs. 27%; p<0.001). Also, the mortality of the DLB patients was higher (about 30% vs. 17% in 12 months). These data confirm the particularity and higher complexity of the DLB patients recovered in the RSA.
