39430440|t|Mapping research on cognitive impairment in heart failure patients: A bibliometric analysis from 2013 to 2022.
39430440|a|Background: Cognitive impairment is a common concern among individuals with heart failure, and the intersection of these conditions poses significant challenges for scholarly investigation. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis to visually depict the current state and emerging trends regarding cognitive impairment among heart failure patients. Methods: Articles focusing on cognitive impairment in heart failure patients published between 2013 and 2022 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection on February 3, 2023. Analysis of publication trends was conducted using Microsoft Excel 2016. The bibliometric analysis,involving identification of the leading countries, institutions, and authors, as well as the analysis of keywords co-occurrence and burst-detection, was performed using CiteSpace and VOSviewer. Results: A total of 260 original articles were included. The data showed a stable pattern of annual publications on cognitive impairment in heart failure patients over the last ten years. The United States stood out with 129 publications, Kent State University in the USA led in institutional output with 32 articles, and Gunstad John was identified as the most influential author with 32 articles and 572 citations. Analysis of keyword co-occurrence network revealed core research themes encompassing risk factors, interventions, assessment, and underlying mechanisms of cognitive impairment in heart failure patients. Conclusions: This study presents the first bibliometric analysis of research on cognitive impairment in heart failure patients over the past decade, offering valuable insights for exploring future research frontiers in this domain. The findings provide researchers, clinicians, and policymakers with key information to advance understanding and interventions for cognitive impairment in heart failure patients.
