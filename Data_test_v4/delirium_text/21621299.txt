21621299|t|No association of toll-like receptor 2 polymorphisms with Alzheimer's disease in Han Chinese.
21621299|a|Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) represents a reasonable functional and positional candidate gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD) as it is located under the linkage region of AD on chromosome 4q, and is functionally involved in the microglia-mediated inflammatory response and amyloid beta (Abeta) clearance. In the current study, 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that span the TLR2 were selected and their associations with late-onset AD (LOAD) risk were assessed in a case-control sample comprising 785 individuals in a Han Chinese population. No significant differences in the frequency of TLR2 alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes in the AD cases were detected compared with the controls. TLR2 gene might not play a major role in the genetic predisposition to late-onset Alzheimer's disease in this population.
