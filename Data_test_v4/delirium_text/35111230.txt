35111230|t|The Effect of Prosopis farcta and Its Bioactive Luteolin on the Hippocampus of Mice after Induced Ischemia Reperfusion.
35111230|a|BACKGROUND: Ischemia plays an important role in increasing damage to the nervous system. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Prosopis farcta (PFE) and its bioactive luteolin (Lu) and forced swimming exercise on the hippocampus of mice after induced ischemia reperfusion. METHODS: The bioactive component of PFE (Lu) was identified by HPLC. Fifty-six male mice were divided into different groups. Ischemia was induced by ligation of the common carotid artery. After mice training (swimming exercise, 8 weeks) and consuming PFE and Lu, the mice's memory ability was evaluated in the shuttle box. Histological examination was performed by Nissel staining and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Results showed that the ischemic mice exercised and treated with PFE and Lu had higher step-through latency (STL) compared with the nonexercised mice, and this was confirmed with time spent in the dark compartment (TDC). The number of dark cells in the ischemic group exercising and receiving PFE and Lu decreased compared to that of the other groups in the hippocampus. DCX protein expression was increased in nonexercised groups compared to that of the exercised groups and those treated with PFE and Lu, while NeuN decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Forced swimming exercise following ischemia, as well as consumption of PFE and Lu, has reduced cell death and increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus and thus may help improve memory in ischemia.
