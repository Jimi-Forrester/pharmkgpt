20641750|t|Anti-ICAM-1 antibody-conjugated paramagnetic liposomes
20641750|a|ICAM-1 (CD54) is a cell-surface glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (1). Upregulated by inflammatory mediators, ICAM-1 is expressed on various cells including leukocytes, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts (2). The predominant function of ICAM-1 is the recruitment and trafficking of leukocytes through interactions with leukocyte-expressed integrins (2). Therefore, ICAM-1 plays a critical role in the development of the central nervous system (CNS), in immune and inflammatory responses, and in embryonic development (1). Many cerebrovascular and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and its animal model (i.e., experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE)), Alzheimer s disease, and Parkinson s disease have neuroinflammatory responses involving the migration of leukocytes into damaged or infected tissues (3). EAE, which is an ascending encephalomyelitis, is characterized by an intense perivascular inflammatory process in the white matter of the CNS, primarily on the spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebellum, which facilitates the attachment of leukocytes to inflamed endothelium (4). For example, a 10-fold increase in ICAM-1 expression has been found on the endothelium of capillaries and venules throughout the CNS at an early stage of EAE (4). Thus, ICAM-1 has been an attractive target for imaging the early and specific upregulation of vascular CAMs in diseases (4). Amphiphiles are made from molecules containing both a hydrophobic (non-polar tail) and a hydrophilic (polar head) section. Amphiphiles can self-associate into multiple concentric lipid bilayers (called lamellae) in different sizes and geometries (5). Liposomes are generally formed by a variety of modified amphiphiles and can deliver a substantial amount of encapsulated therapeutic or diagnostic agents to targeted sites (6). Traditional liposomes suffer from the drawbacks of fast elimination from blood and easy capture by the reticulo-endothelial system (7). As an alternative to traditional liposomes, paramagnetic polymerized liposomes (PPLs) are composed of a mixture of lipids with different functional groups on the aqueous exposed surface and a polymerizable group (diacetylene) in the lipid tail (8). A typical formulation consists of gadolinium III-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA)-based lipids, amphiphilic carrier lipids, and biotinylated amphiphiles (9). PPLs possess increased physical stability, unique spectroscopic properties, and chemical modification durability (9). The diacetylene triple bonds in the PPLs are located in the fatty acyl chains. The polymerization of the triple bonds between lipids can be carried out by simple ultraviolet (UV) radiation to form a polydiacetylene backbone of alternating eneyne groups (8). A short polyethylene glycol (PEG) segment is covalently linked to the polar head of PPLs (9). The hydrophilicity of PEG allows for sterical stabilization of PPLs and protects against interactions with other molecular and biological components in blood stream, such as undesired lipid exchange or lipid fusion (9). Both polymerization and PEGylization prolong the <i>in vivo</i> circulation time of PPLs in blood. For instance, the half-life time of the PPLs is found to be ~19 h in rats (4). Because easy access to bulky water, the attachment of Gd-DTPA chelates on the surface of PPLs allows for greater relaxivity enhancement compared to Gd chelates entrapped in the traditional liposomes. The multiple Gd chelates on the surface of the liposomes further increase the sensitivity to detection by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The biotin groups in the PPLs allow for conjugation of biotinylated antibodies <i>via</i> an avidin-biotin linkage procedure (10). Avidin, a tetrameric protein with a molecular mass of 68 KDa, is capable of strongly binding four biotins (K<sub>a</sub> = 1.7 x 10<sup>15</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>) (10). Thus, avidins serve as a bridge between a biotinylated antibody against neural CAM (NCAM-1) and a biotinylated group on PPLs to form a NCAM-1-specific MRI contrast agent, anti-NCAM antibody-conjugated PPLs (ACPLs) (4).
