34340958|a|In recent months, much of the scientific efforts have focused on research on SARSCoV-2 infection and its consequences in humans. Still, many aspects remain unknown. It is known that the damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 is multifactorial and that its extension goes beyond lung inflammation and the acute phase, with the appearance of numerous complications and sequelae. To date, knowledge about the usefulness of 18F-FDG-PET/CT in the acute phase has been limited to the incidental detection of SARS-CoV-2 unsuspected pneumonia. Recent studies have been appearing collecting the findings of 18F-FDG-PET/CT in long COVID-19 or persistent COVID-19 state as well as the alterations caused after mass vaccination of the population in the metabolic studies. This work aims to review the existing literature focusing on these three issues and to briefly present our own preliminary experience.
