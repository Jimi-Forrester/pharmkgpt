33471781|t|Dietary administration of cumin-derived cuminaldehyde induce neuroprotective and learning and memory enhancement effects to aging mice.
33471781|a|Cuminaldehyde (CA) is one of the major compounds of the essential oil of Cuminum cyminum. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of CA on aging, specifically on spatial learning and memory. To achieve our objective, an in vitro study on SH-SY5Y cells was performed to analyze the neuroprotective effect of CA against dexamethasone using the MTT assay. An in vivo study was performed for evaluation of the spatial learning and memory using Morris water maze (MWM). RT-PCR was performed to quantify the expression of specific genes (Bdnf, Icam and ApoE) in the mice brain. The results obtained showed a neuroprotective effect of CA against dexamethasone-induced neuronal toxicity. The escape latency of CA-treated aged mice was significantly decreased as compared to the water-treated aged mice after 4 days of training in MWM. Moreover, CA treatment up-regulated the gene expression of Bdnf, Icam and ApoE, while it down-regulated the gene expression of IL-6. These findings suggest that CA has a neuroprotective effect, as well as a spatial learning and memory enhancement potential through the modulation of genes coding for neurotrophic factors and/or those implicated in the imbalance of neural circuitry and impairment of synaptic plasticity.
