25649061|a|S100B in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-S100B) was measured in calves with 20 neurologic and 21 non-neurologic diseases to clarify its utility as a biomarker for neurologic diseases. The median CSF-S100B value in the neurologic disease group (43.0 ng/ml) was significantly higher than that in the non-neurologic disease group (10.2 ng/ml). As CSF-S100B levels in calves with neurologic diseases widely differed, the utility of CSF-S100B as a diagnostic marker for neurologic diseases in cattle remains inconclusive.
