26606591|t|The Effect of Abeta1-42 Oligomers on APP Processing and Abeta1-40 Generation in Cultured U-373 Astrocytes.
26606591|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are a family of proteins that are considered to be a principal aspect of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of senile dementia affecting elderly individuals. These peptides result from the proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential cleavage mediated via beta- and x03B3;-secretases. Evidence suggests that an overproduction and/or a lack of degradation may increase brain Abeta levels which, in turn, contribute to neuronal loss and development of AD. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we seek to determine what effect Abeta has on APP processing in cultured astrocytes. METHODS: Using the human astrocytoma cell line U-373, we investigated the effects induced by oligomeric Abeta1-42 treatment on the cellular levels/expression of APP and its products, C-terminal fragments alphaCTF and betaCTF, and Abeta1-40. In conjunction with these experiments, we examined the relative levels and activity of beta- and x03B3;-secretases in Abeta-treated astrocytes. RESULTS: We report here that Abeta1-42 treatment of astrocytes increased the expression of APP and its cleaved products including Abeta1-40 in a time-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that activated astrocytes can contribute to the development of AD by enhancing levels and processing of APP leading to an increased production/secretion of Abeta-related peptides.
