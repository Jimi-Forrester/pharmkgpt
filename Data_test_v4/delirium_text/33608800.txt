33608800|t|Olfactory impairment in men and mice related to aging and amyloid-induced pathology.
33608800|a|Olfaction, or the sense of smell, is one of the most ancient senses in men and mice, important for a large variety of innate and acquired behaviors. Clinical data reveal an early impairment of olfaction during normal aging and in the course of neurodegenerative diseases, but the underlying cellular/molecular mechanisms remain obscure. In the current review, we compare different aspects of the aging- and Alzheimer's disease related impairment of olfaction in men and mice, aiming at the identification of common morbidities and biomarkers, which can be analyzed in detail in the appropriate mouse models. We also identify common, often interdependent (patho)physiological pathways, including but not limited to extracellular amyloid depositions, neuroinflammation, e4 allele of the apolipoprotein E, CNS insulin resistance, and the impairment of adult neurogenesis, to be targeted by basic and clinical research.
