37226461|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of two different administration methods of dexmedetomidine (DEX) used as an adjuvant to ropivacaine in ultrasound-guided bilateral intermediate cervical plexus block (CPB) in terms of efficacy and the duration of postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing ambulatory thyroidectomy. METHODS: This double-blind, randomized study enrolled patients who underwent thyroidectomy with ultrasound-guided bilateral intermediate CPB. Patients were randomized to receive either perineural administration of dexmedetomidine (group DP) or intravenous pumping of dexmedetomidine (group DI). The 40-item Quality of Recovery (QoR-40) questionnaire was used to assess the primary endpoint, which was the global QoR-40 score 24 h after the operation. RESULTS: Sixty patients were randomized equally into the two groups. The total QoR-40 score 24 h postoperatively was significantly higher in group DP than group DI (160.6 +- 9.1 versus 152.8 +- 7.9, respectively). Dimensions of physical comfort and pain scores were significantly higher in group DP than group DI. The visual analogue scale pain score scores were significantly lower in group DP than group DI at 12 and 24 h postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: DEX as an adjuvant to ropivacaine in ultrasound-guided intermediate CPB can improve the QoR-40 score and prolong postoperative analgesia.Trial registration number: ChiCTR2000031264 at www.chictr.org.cn on 26 March 2020.
