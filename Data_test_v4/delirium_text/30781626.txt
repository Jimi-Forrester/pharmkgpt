30781626|t|Hippocampal LMNA Gene Expression is Increased in Late-Stage Alzheimer's Disease.
30781626|a|Lamins are fibrillary proteins that are crucial in maintaining nuclear shape and function. Recently, B-type lamin dysfunction has been linked to tauopathies. However, the role of A-type lamin in neurodegeneration is still obscure. Here, we examined A-type and B-type lamin expression levels by RT-qPCR in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and controls in the hippocampus, the core of tau pathology in the brain. LMNA, LMNB1, and LMNB2 genes showed moderate mRNA levels in the human hippocampus with highest expression for the LMNA gene. Moreover, LMNA mRNA levels were increased at the late stage of AD (1.8-fold increase; p-value < 0.05). In addition, a moderate positive correlation was found between age and LMNA mRNA levels (Pearson's r = 0.581, p-value = 0.018) within the control hippocampal samples that was not present in the hippocampal samples affected by AD. A-type and B-type lamin genes are expressed in the human hippocampus at the transcript level. LMNA mRNA levels are up-regulated in the hippocampal tissue in late stages of AD. The effect of age on increasing LMNA expression levels in control samples seems to be disrupted by the development of AD pathology.
