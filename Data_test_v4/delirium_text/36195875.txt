36195875|a|BACKGROUND: Moderate physical exercise is conducive to the brains of healthy humans and AD patients. Previous reports have suggested that treadmill exercise plays an anti-AD role and improves cognitive ability by promoting amyloid clearance, inhibiting neuronal apoptosis, reducing oxidative stress level, alleviating brain inflammation, and promoting autophagy-lysosome pathway in AD mice. However, few studies have explored the relationships between the ubiquitin-proteasome system and proper exercise in AD. The current study was intended to investigate the mechanism by which the exercise-regulated E3 ubiquitin ligase improves AD. METHODS: Both wild type and APP/PS1 transgenic mice were divided into sedentary (WTC and ADC) and exercise (WTE and ADE) groups (n = 12 for each group). WTE and ADE mice were subjected to treadmill exercise of 12 weeks in order to assess the effect of treadmill running on learning and memory ability, Abeta plaque burden, hyperphosphorylated Tau protein and E3 ubiquitin ligase. RESULTS: The results indicated that exercise restored learning and memory ability, reduced Abeta plaque areas, inhibited the hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein activated PI3K/Akt/Hsp70 signaling pathway, and improved the function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (increased UCHL-1 and CHIP levels, decreased BACE1 levels) in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that exercise may promote the E3 ubiquitin ligase to clear beta-amyloid and hyperphosphorylated Tau by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the hippocampus of AD mice, which is efficient in ameliorating pathological phenotypes and improving learning and memory ability.
