37102472|t|Remote Digital Technologies for the Early Detection and Monitoring of Cognitive Decline in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: Insights From Studies of Neurodegenerative Diseases.
37102472|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a risk factor for cognitive decline. In neurodegenerative disease research, remote digital cognitive assessments and unobtrusive sensors are gaining traction for their potential to improve early detection and monitoring of cognitive impairment. Given the high prevalence of cognitive impairments in T2D, these digital tools are highly relevant. Further research incorporating remote digital biomarkers of cognition, behavior, and motor functioning may enable comprehensive characterizations of patients with T2D and may ultimately improve clinical care and equitable access to research participation. The aim of this commentary article is to review the feasibility, validity, and limitations of using remote digital cognitive tests and unobtrusive detection methods to identify and monitor cognitive decline in neurodegenerative conditions and apply these insights to patients with T2D.
