35453524|a|The neurologic complications of COVID-19 infection are frequent in hospitalized patients; a high percentage of them present neurologic manifestations at some point during the course of their disease. Headache, muscle pain, encephalopathy and dizziness are among the most common complications. Encephalitis is an inflammatory condition with many etiologies. There are several forms of encephalitis associated with antibodies against intracellular neuronal proteins, cell surfaces or synaptic proteins, referred to as autoimmune encephalitis. Several case reports published in the literature document autoimmune encephalitis cases triggered by COVID-19 infection. Our paper first presents our experience in this issue and then systematically reviews the literature on autoimmune encephalitis that developed in the background of SARS-CoV-2 infections and also discusses the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of auto-immune-mediated damage to the nervous system. This review contributes to improve the management and prognosis of COVID-19-related autoimmune encephalitis.
