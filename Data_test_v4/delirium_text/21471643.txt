21471643|t|Structural and functional alterations in amyloid-beta precursor protein induced by amyloid-beta peptides.
21471643|a|Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is neurotoxic as an oligomer, but not as a monomer, by an unknown mechanism. We showed previously that Abeta interacts with the amyloid-beta precursor protein (AbetaPP), leading to caspase cleavage and cell death induction. To characterize this structure and interaction further, we purified the extracellular domain of AbetaPP695 (eAbetaPP) and its complex with Abeta oligomers (AbetaOs) of varying sizes, and then performed small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). In the absence of any Abeta, eAbetaPP was a compact homodimer with a tight association between the E1 and E2 domains. Dimeric Abeta oligomers induced monomerization of eAbetaPP while larger oligomers also bound eAbetaPP but preserved the homodimer. Efficient binding of the larger oligomers correlated with the presence of prefibrillar oligomers, suggesting that the eAbetaPP binding is limited to a conformational subset of Abeta oligomers. Both forms of Abeta bound to eAbetaPP at the Abeta-cognate region and induced dissociation of the E1 and E2 domains. Our data provide the first structural evidence for Abeta-AbetaPP binding and suggest a mechanism for differential modulation of AbetaPP processing and cell death signaling by Abeta dimers versus conformationally-specific larger oligomers.
