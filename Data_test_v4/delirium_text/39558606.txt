Tear fluid (TF) containing variety of proteins that reflect pathophysiological changes of systemic diseases makes TF proteins potential biomarker candidates for AD. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the expression levels of TF proteins in persons with mild AD and cognitively healthy controls (CO) to find out if altered proteins may link to the AD pathophysiology. METHODS: We analyzed the data of the 53 study participants (34 COs, mean age 71 and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 28.9 +- 1.4 and 19 persons with AD, CDR 0.5-1, mean age 71 and MMSE 23.8 +- 2.8). All went through neurological status examination, cognitive tests, and ophthalmological examination. TF was collected using Schirmer strips. The TF protein content was evaluated via mass spectrometry-based proteomics and label-free quantification. RESULTS: Eleven proteins having a role either in protein repair and clearance system, or regulation of cytoskeleton, showed altered expression in AD group compared to CO group. Seven of them were significantly (p <= 0.05) upregulated (Sti1, Twf1, Myl6, Otub1, Pls1 and Caza1) or, downregulated (HSP90) in AD group. CONCLUSIONS: Altered expression of all these up- or downregulated proteins may be linked to AD pathophysiology. Thus, our results are encouraging for searching new biomarker candidates for AD. TF is potential biomarker candidate, because TF seems to reflect altered protein levels already in mild AD dementia.
