34576998|a|A new series of conjugates of aminoadamantane and gamma-carboline, which are basic scaffolds of the known neuroactive agents, memantine and dimebon (Latrepirdine) was synthesized and characterized. Conjugates act simultaneously on several biological structures and processes involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and some other neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, these compounds inhibit enzymes of the cholinesterase family, exhibiting higher inhibitory activity against butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), but having almost no effect on the activity of carboxylesterase (anti-target). The compounds serve as NMDA-subtype glutamate receptor ligands, show mitoprotective properties by preventing opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore, and act as microtubule stabilizers, stimulating the polymerization of tubulin and microtubule-associated proteins. Structure-activity relationships were studied, with particular attention to the effect of the spacer on biological activity. The synthesized conjugates showed new properties compared to their prototypes (memantine and dimebon), including the ability to bind to the ifenprodil-binding site of the NMDA receptor and to occupy the peripheral anionic site of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which indicates that these compounds can act as blockers of AChE-induced beta-amyloid aggregation. These new attributes of the conjugates represent improvements to the pharmacological profiles of the separate components by conferring the potential to act as neuroprotectants and cognition enhancers with a multifunctional mode of action.
