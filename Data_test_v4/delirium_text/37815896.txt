37815896|t|Literacy for Frailty among Undergraduate Medical Education: An Under-Recognized Opportunity to Improve Geriatric Care.
37815896|a|Our society is aging much faster than it was before, and this phenomenon demands concerted action to optimize geriatric care. Presentations, clinical features, and management decision making are distinct between older adults and general population, and to enhance care quality, there remains unmet needs for undergraduate geriatric education. Among all geriatric syndromes that clinically matter, frailty is particularly instrumental, serving as the overarching phenotype that connects other geriatric conditions and predisposes individuals to adverse outcomes. However, understandings for frailty, or "literacy for frailty" is often poor among healthcare professionals, and misidentification, terminology confusion, and uncertainty surrounding the care of frail older adults, are not uncommon. This lack of frailty literacy undoubtedly contributes to the suboptimal geriatric care patients receive. We therefore propose a rationally designed, concise, and structured program for eliciting medical students' motivation for understanding frailty during their undergraduate period. Our increasing-frailty-literacy program includes 7 modules, accommodating the terminology, integrative pathogenesis, epidemiology of frailty, appropriate screening and identification tool selection, prognostication and patient communication, and individualization of treatment strategies. In combination with digital technologies and hands-on practice opportunities, we believe that our curriculum can promote medical students' learning efficacy for frailty and improve geriatric care for the current generation.
