32599769|t|Dysregulation of microRNA Modulatory Network in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.
32599769|a|Abdominal artery aneurysm (AAA) refers to abdominal aortic dilatation of 3 cm or greater. AAA is frequently underdiagnosed due to often asymptomatic character of the disease, leading to elevated mortality due to aneurysm rupture. MiRNA constitute a pool of small RNAs controlling gene expression and is involved in many pathologic conditions in human. Targeted panel detecting altered expression of miRNA and genes involved in AAA would improve early diagnosis of this disease. In the presented study, we selected and analyzed miRNA and gene expression signatures in AAA patients. Next, generation sequencing was applied to obtain miRNA and gene-wide expression profiles from peripheral blood mononuclear cells in individuals with AAA and healthy controls. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 and uninformative variable elimination by partial least squares (UVE-PLS) methods. A total of 31 miRNAs and 51 genes were selected as the most promising biomarkers of AAA. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis showed good diagnostic ability of proposed biomarkers. Genes regulated by selected miRNAs were determined in silico and associated with functional terms closely related to cardiovascular and neurological diseases. Proposed biomarkers may be used for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in management of AAA. The findings will also contribute to the pool of knowledge about miRNA-dependent regulatory mechanisms involved in pathology of that disease.
