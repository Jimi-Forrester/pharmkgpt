38022390|t|The relationships between mastication and cognitive function: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
38022390|a|Masticatory function such as chewing is expected to modify human cognitive function, and/or the possibility of improving cognitive function is also predicted. This systematic review investigated whether masticatory function affects cognitive function for older/young adults. Full articles written in English from January 2000 to April 2022 were collected using PubMed and Cochrane Library. Target outcomes were cognitive function test scores, cognitive processing speed (reaction time), and masticatory function. For each research question, two independent reviewers conducted the search and screening, data extraction, quality assessment, and risk of bias assessment. The reviewers resolved any disagreements by discussion. From 226 articles retrieved, 20 were included in this review. Older adults with lower scores on the cognitive function test had lower masticatory performance, lower chewing ability, chewing difficulty, and decreased number of teeth. An increased risk of cognitive impairment was found in older adults with masticatory dysfunction. For young adults, gum chewing significantly reduced the processing speed of cognitive tasks compared to no gum chewing. Although most of the evidence included had a low level of evidence and a high risk of bias because of the research designs, the results still suggest that mastication may be a factor in improving cognitive function.
