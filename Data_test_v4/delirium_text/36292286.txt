36292286|a|Long-term sequelae refer to persistent symptoms or signs for >6 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most common symptoms of sequelae are fatigue and neuropsychiatric symptoms (concentration difficulty, amnesia, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, and depression). However, approved treatments have not been fully established. Herbal medicines are administered for 12 weeks to patients who continuously complain of fatigue or cognitive dysfunction for >4 weeks that only occurred after COVID-19 diagnoses. Based on the Korean Medicine syndrome differentiation diagnosis, patients with fatigue will be administered Bojungikgi-tang or Kyungok-go, whereas those with cognitive dysfunction will be administered Cheonwangbosim-dan. Results could support evidence that herbal medicines may mitigate fatigue and cognitive dysfunction caused by COVID-19. Furthermore, by investigating the effects of herbal medicines on changes in metabolite and immune response due to COVID-19, which may be responsible for sequelae, the potential of herbal medicines as one of the therapeutic interventions for post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be evaluated. Therefore, the effects of herbal medicine on fatigue and cognitive dysfunction sequelae due to COVID-19 will be elucidated in this study to provide an insight into the preparation of medical management for the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
