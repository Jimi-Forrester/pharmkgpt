34002336|a|BACKGROUND: During the recent lockdown measures adopted by national authorities to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, many vulnerable older patients with chronic conditions, normally followed in ambulatory setting, needed to be monitored and managed in alternative ways, including telemedicine. AIMS: In the framework of a telemedicine program, we aimed to validate and implement a telephone-administered version of the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (TELE-MPI) among community-dwelling older outpatients. METHOD: From March 9 to May 11, 2020, 131 older patients (82.1 years; 74% females) were interviewed using a telephone-based survey to calculate the TELE-MPI. The standard MPI was performed face-to-face three months apart. The Bland-Altman methodology measured the agreement between the two tools. Multivariate logistic regression models were built to ascertain the prognostic value of TELE-MPI and TELE-MPI classes (low, moderate, or severe risk) on negative outcomes occurring during the lockdown period. RESULTS: Mean MPI and TELE-MPI values were 0.523 and 0.522, respectively. Lower and upper 95% limits of agreement were - 0.122 and + 0.124, respectively, with only 4.6% of observations outside the limits. Each 0.1 increase of TELE-MPI score was significantly correlated with higher incidence of psychiatric disorders [odd ratio (OR): 1.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27, 1.95] and falls (OR: 1.41; 95% CI 1.08, 1.82) in community-dwelling-older adults. DISCUSSION: TELE-MPI showed a strong agreement with the standard MPI and was able to predict psychiatric disorders and falls during lockdown period. CONCLUSION: TELE-MPI may represent a useful way to follow by remote the health status of older adults.
