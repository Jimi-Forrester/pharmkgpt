36571343|a|Evidence from genetics and from analyzing cellular and animal models have converged to suggest links between neurodegenerative disorders of early and late life. Here, we summarize emerging links between the most common late life neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease, and the most common early life neurodegenerative diseases, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses. Genetic studies reported an overlap of clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease and mutations in genes known to cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses. Accumulating data strongly suggest dysfunction of intracellular trafficking mechanisms and the autophagy-endolysosome system in both types of neurodegenerative disorders. This suggests shared cytopathological processes underlying these different types of neurodegenerative diseases. A better understanding of the common mechanisms underlying the different diseases is important as this might lead to the identification of novel targets for therapeutic concepts, the transfer of therapeutic strategies from one disease to the other and therapeutic approaches tailored to patients with specific mutations. Here, we review dysfunctions of the endolysosomal autophagy pathway in Alzheimer's disease and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses and summarize emerging etiologic and genetic overlaps.
