39186223|a|Neurological disorders are the primary cause of human disability and mortality globally, however, current medications slightly alleviate some symptoms of degenerative diseases. Serine is an important amino acid for the brain function and involved in a variety of biosynthetic pathways and signal transduction processes. The imbalance of serine metabolism is associated with neurodegeneration, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Altered activities of serine metabolizing enzymes and accumulation of serine metabolites affect the survival and function of nerve cells. Abnormal serine levels are observed in animal models with neurological diseases, but not all human studies, therefore, the maintenance of serine homeostasis is a potentially therapeutic strategy for neurological disorders. To date, physiological and pharmacological roles of serine in neurological diseases have not been systemically recapitulated, and the association between serine and neurological diseases is controversial. In this review, we summarize physicochemical properties of serine, biological processes of serine in the brain (source, biotransformation, and transport), and the application of serine in neurological diseases including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and depression. Here, we highlight physicochemistry, physiology, pharmacology, and therapeutic potentials of serine in the prevention and treatment of neurological dysfunction. Our work provides valuable hints for future investigation that will lead to a comprehensive understanding of serine and its metabolism in cellular physiology and pharmacology. Although broad by necessity, the review helps researchers to understand great potentials of serine in the prevention and treatment of neurological dysfunction.
