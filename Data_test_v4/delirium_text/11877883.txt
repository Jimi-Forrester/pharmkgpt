11877883|a|Behavioural disturbances are common in the course of dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their treatment is usually difficult. Different pharmacological and non-pharmacological options are employed basing mainly on clinical experience, still the number of well-designed, controlled studies in the field is very small. Novel, atypical neuroleptics, including risperidone might potentially be one of these options, taking into account their good safety profile and clinical efficacy in closely related syndromes. We present the results of a retrospective analysis of 57 outpatients with behavioural symptoms complicating AD treated with risperidone, either alone or in combination with one of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AchEI; donepezil or rivastigmine). Seventy five percent of patients treated responded to risperidone with the usual effective dose of 0.5-1 mg/day. The influence of risperidone treatment on behavioural symptomatology was irrespective to the use of AchEI and equally well safe in both groups. The clinical response to the treatment was seen usually within first 2-3 weeks, those who did not respond early tended not to respond later on as well. Additionally, if not responding to low doses of risperidone (0.5-1 mg/day), patients usually did not respond to higher doses or could not tolerate them, mainly due to emerging extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Low doses of risperidone were well tolerated, with the fraction of patients experiencing EPS not achieving 10%. EPS observed, were dose dependent and tended to appear if the dose acceleration was fast. We then recommend low doses of risperidone and its slow titration if needed.
