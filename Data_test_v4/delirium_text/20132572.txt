20132572|t|[GHB withdrawal delirium].
20132572|a|A 35-year-old man had been using high doses of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) for many years. He had been trying to cut down on use of this drug for 2 months. He was admitted to the hospital suffering from a withdrawal delirium accompanied by hallucinations and agitation. Use of GHB is increasing in the Netherlands. Along with serious intoxication and dependency, the possibility of withdrawal symptoms should also be taken into consideration. Administration of high doses of benzodiazepines is an effective treatment for these withdrawal symptoms.
