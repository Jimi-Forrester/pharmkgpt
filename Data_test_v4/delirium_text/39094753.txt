39094753|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease with therapeutic limitations. Insulin resistance plays a role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Therapies that modulate insulin secretion and signaling, as well as oxidative stress in the brain are now being investigated for their potential role in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Terminalia macroptera (Combretaceae) is a plant that different parts have been used traditionally for the treatment of metabolic and neurological conditions. Previous study has indicated that the crude extract exhibit anti-diabetic property. In addition, the plant is a rich source of tannins, phenolic acids, flavonoids, triterpenes. However, there is no study on its protective effect against biochemical alterations of AD in diabetic rats. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present research study investigated the neuroprotective effects of TeMac  on Alzheimer-like pathology induced by aluminum chloride (AlCl3) in diabetic rats. METHODS: A phytochemical analysis of TeMac  was carried out to quantify tannins. The potential effect of the tannins-enriched fraction (TEF) of TeMac  to prevent the formation of senile plaques was conducted by its ability to inhibit the activities of beta-secretase (EC 3.4.23.46), monoamine oxidase A (EC 1.4.3.4) and the fibrillation of Abeta. A diabetic model was induced from female Wistar rats by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 35 mg/kg BW). After that, the blood glucose level was measured to confirm the induction of diabetes. Three days after induction, animals received AlCl3 (75 mg/kg BW) alone (AD control) or concomitantly with 400 mg/kg BW of TEF of TeMac  or 5 mg/kg BW Daonil by daily gavage for 42 days. At the end of the experiment, rats were sacrificed, blood and brains were collected. The levels of amyloid fibrils, glucose, albumin and the activities of DPP4, beta-secretase and phosphatase, and markers of oxidative stress in the brain were assessed. RESULTS: TEF of TeMac  displays a potential ability to inhibit the activities of beta-secretase, monoamine oxidase, and Abeta fibrillation. Treatment with TEF of TeMac  significantly inhibited DPP4 and BACE1 activities and reduced brain glucose and amyloid fibril levels, and improved cerebral albumin levels and modulated oxidative stress markers. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that TEF of TeMac  prevents Alzheimer's-type pathology linked to insulin resistance in rats. TEF of TeMac  may be a potential drug candidate for the treatment of diabetes-associated cognitive impairment.
