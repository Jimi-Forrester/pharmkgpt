37334603|t|Retromer Stabilization Improves Cognitive Function and Synaptic Plasticity in a Mouse Model of Down Syndrome.
37334603|a|BACKGROUND: Retromer complex proteins are decreased in postmortem brain tissues from Down syndrome subjects and inversely correlate with the Alzheimer's disease-like neuropathology. However, whether targeting in vivo the retromer system affects cognitive deficits and synaptic function in Down syndrome remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to examine the effects of pharmacological retromer stabilization on cognitive and synaptic functions in a mouse model of Down syndrome. METHODS: Ts65dn mice were administered the pharmacological chaperone, TPT-172, or vehicle from 4 to 9 months of age and then assessed for changes in cognitive function. To assess the effects of TPT-172 on synaptic plasticity, hippocampal slices from Ts65dn mice were incubated in TPT-172 and used for field potential recordings. RESULTS: Chronic TPT-172 treatment improved performance in cognitive function tests, its incubation with hippocampal slices ameliorated synaptic function response. CONCLUSION: Pharmacological stabilization of the retromer complex improves synaptic plasticity and memory in a mouse model of Down syndrome. These results support the therapeutic potential of pharmacological retromer stabilization for individual with Down syndrome.
