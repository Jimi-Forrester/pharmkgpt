11205145|a|Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a pleiotropic polypeptide with a wide range of actions in both central and peripheral nervous sytems. Over the past few years, we studied the trophic as well as neuromodulatory roles of IGF-I in the brain. Accumulated evidence indicates that IGF-I, apart from regulating growth and development, protects neurons against cell death induced by amyloidogenic derivatives, glucose or serum deprivation via the activation of intracellular pathways implicating phosphatidylinositide 3/Akt kinase, winged-helix family of transcription factor FKHRL1 phosphorylation or production of free radicals. The effects of IGF-I on neuroprotection, glucose metabolism and activity-dependent plasticity suggest the potential usefulness of this growth factor or related mimetics in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.
