36415419|t|Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis Following Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair.
36415419|a|Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a central nervous system demyelinating condition. The postulated etiology is an autoimmune reaction, however, the mechanistic details are yet unknown. While infection and immunization are the most prevalent precipitating causes of ADEM, we postulate that radiopaque contrast material might have played a role as an immunological trigger. This presentation is unusual and has not been recorded so far. This case also emphasizes the challenges involved in evaluating emerging neurological problems following a period of intubation/sedation among these patients. We present a patient who passed away due to the manifestations of ADEM following admission to the intensive care unit after thoracic endovascular aortic repair for type B aortic dissection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed following multiple attempts at sedation weaning demonstrated typical features of this condition. Clinicians and radiologists should be diligent and consider ADEM as a differential diagnosis when treating patients who present with neurological symptoms following radiological interventional procedures and have a high index suspicion to reduce mortality and achieve satisfactory clinical outcomes.
