37639783|t|Regulation of mitochondrial function by hydroquinone derivatives as prevention of platelet activation.
37639783|a|Platelet activation plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of thrombotic events in different diseases (e.g., cancer, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's, and cardiovascular diseases, and even in patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019). Therefore, antiplatelet therapy is essential to reduce thrombus formation. However, the utility of current antiplatelet drugs is limited. Therefore, identifying novel antiplatelet compounds is very important in developing new drugs. In this context, the involvement of mitochondrial function as an efficient energy source required for platelet activation is currently accepted; however, its contribution as an antiplatelet target still has little been exploited. Regarding this, the intramolecular hydrogen bonding of hydroquinone derivatives has been described as a structural motif that allows the reach of small molecules at mitochondria, which can exert antiplatelet activity, among others. In this review, we describe the role of mitochondrial function in platelet activation and how hydroquinone derivatives exert antiplatelet activity through mitochondrial regulation.
