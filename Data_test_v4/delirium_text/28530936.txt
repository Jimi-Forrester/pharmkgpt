28530936|t|Progression and Resolution of Delirium in Elderly Patients Hospitalized for Acute Care.
28530936|a|The authors describe the clinical course of delirium in 325 elderly patients hospitalized for acute care. Of those patients who developed DSM-III delirium (n = 91), over two-thirds of patients (69.2%) experienced a prodromal period of at least 1 day prior to meeting full DSM-III criteria. Clinical evidence of delirium frequently persisted after hospital discharge although there was evidence of lessening of the extent of symptoms over time. These findings have implications for discharge planners concerned with providing appropriate supports for those still experiencing delirium symptoms at the time of hospital discharge.
