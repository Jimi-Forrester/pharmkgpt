33954101|a|BACKGROUND: Sexual self-disclosure is one of the factors that affect sexual satisfaction. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of individual therapy using the Bring up, Explain, Tell, Timing, Educate, and Record (BETTER model) in comparison to individual therapy using the Permission, Limited Information, Specific Suggestions, and Intensive Therapy (PLISSIT model) in terms of increasing sexual self-disclosure in women with sexual problems after childbirth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized trial was conducted in 2017 in Mashhad, Iran. 80 women with sexual problems within 4 weeks to 6 months after childbirth were randomized into two equal groups and received the interventions in 2 sessions of 60-90 minutes. The research instruments included a demographic questionnaire, the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and Hulbert sexual self-disclosure index. Changes in mean (SD) scores of sexual self-disclosures between groups were assessed before and 4 weeks after the intervention and the results (mean changes) were compared between groups. The data analysis was conducted using independent t-test, paired t-test, Chi-square, analysis of covariance (ANOVA), and Mann-Whitney U test in SPSS (p < 0.05). RESULTS: In the PLISSIT group, the mean (SD) sexual self-disclosure score at baseline was 43.80 (9.50) and after 4 weeks was 51.60 (8.30). In the BETTER group, at baseline and after 4 weeks the mean (SD) sexual self-disclosure score was, respectively, 44.10 (10.30) and 55.60 (8.20) (Z = -2.5, p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: The findings confirm the effectiveness of the BETTER counseling model in increasing sexual self-disclosure after childbirth.
