34626746|t|Humanin and Alzheimer's disease: The beginning of a new field.
34626746|a|BACKGROUND: Humanin (HN) is an endogenous peptide factor and known as a member of mitochondrial-derived peptides. We first found the gene encoding this novel 24-residue peptide in a brain of an Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient as an antagonizing factor against neuronal cell death induced by AD-associated insults. SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review presents an overview of HN actions in AD-related conditions among its wide range of action spectrum as well as a brief history of the discovery. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: HN exhibits multiple intracellular and extracellular anti-cell death actions and antagonizes various AD-associated pathomechanisms including amyloid plaque accumulation. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This review concisely reflects accumulated knowledge on HN since the discovery focusing on its functions related to AD pathogenesis and provides a perspective to its potential contribution in AD treatments.
