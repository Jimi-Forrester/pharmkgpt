36200578|a|A chronic state of unresolved inflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is intrinsically involved with the remodeling of brain lipids. This review highlights the effect of carrying the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele (APOE4) on various brain cell types in promoting an unresolved inflammatory state. Among its pleotropic effects on brain lipids, we focus on APOE4's activation of Ca2+ -dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and its effects on arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid signaling cascades in the brain. During the process of neurodegeneration, various brain cell types, such as astrocytes, microglia, and neurons, together with the neurovascular unit, develop distinct inflammatory phenotypes that impact their functions and have characteristic lipidomic fingerprints. We propose that lipidomic phenotyping of single cell-types harvested from brains differing by age, sex, disease severity stage, and dietary and genetic backgrounds can be employed to probe mechanisms of neurodegeneration. A better understanding of the brain cellular inflammatory/lipidomic response promises to guide the development of nutritional and drug interventions for AD dementia.
