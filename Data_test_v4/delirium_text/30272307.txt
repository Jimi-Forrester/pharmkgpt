30272307|a|Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) serve key roles in cell growth, development and various diseases associated with the central nervous system. However, differential expression profiles of lncRNAs in type 2 diabetes have not been reported. The present study aimed to analyze the expression pattern of lncRNA-mRNA in a type 2 diabetic mouse model using microarray analysis. The mouse model of type 2 diabetes was established and the total RNAs were extracted from the hippocampus of the mice used in the present study. The total RNAs were then examined by the GeeDom human lncRNA + mRNA V4.0 expression profile and analyzed through comparing Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and signal pathway analysis with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. There were statistically significant differences between the expression of IncRNAs and mRNA in the healthy mice and that of the diabetic mice. In the diabetic mice, 130 different lncRNAs were expressed with 126  significantly upregulated and 4 significantly downregulated and 49 different mRNAs were detected with 45 significantly upregulated and 4 downregulated. GO analysis indicated that the mRNAs that are affected are involved in transport, cell adhesion, ion transport and metabolic processes. KEGG and Reactome enrichment analysis indicated that mRNAs impact on cholinergic synapses, nuclear factor-kB pathway, Toll like receptor 4 cascade and zinc transporter are correlated with cognitive dysfunction in type 2 diabetes. A dynamic lncRNA-mRNA network was constructed containing 123 lncRNAs and 48 mRNAs, which can elucidate the interaction between lncRNA and mRNA. Overall, this is the first study to indicate that lncRNAs are differentially expressed in the type 2 diabetic mice.
