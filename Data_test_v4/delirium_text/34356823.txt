34356823|t|Characterization of an alpha 4/7-Conotoxin LvIF from Conus lividus That Selectively Blocks alpha3beta2 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor.
34356823|a|Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), a member of pentameric ligand-gated ion channel transmembrane protein composed of five subunits, is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous system. The nAChRs are associated with various neurological diseases, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and neuralgia. Receptors containing the alpha3 subunit are associated with analgesia, generating our interest in their role in pharmacological studies. In this study, alpha-conotoxin (alpha-CTx) LvIF was identified as a 16 amino acid peptide using a genomic DNA clone of Conus lividus (C. lividus). The mature LvIF with natural structure was synthesized by a two-step oxidation method. The blocking potency of alpha-CTx lvIF on nAChR was detected by a two-electrode voltage clamp. Our results showed that alpha-CTx LvIF was highly potent against ralpha3beta2 and ralpha6/alpha3beta2beta3 nAChR subtypes, The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of alpha-CTx LvIF against ralpha3beta2 and ralpha6/alpha3beta2beta3 nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes were 8.9 nM and 14.4 nM, respectively. Furthermore, alpha-CTx LvIF exhibited no obvious inhibition on other nAChR subtypes. Meanwhile, we also conducted a competitive binding experiment between alpha-CTxs MII and LvIF, which showed that alpha-CTxs LvIF and MII bind with ralpha3beta2 nAChR at the partial overlapping domain. These results indicate that the alpha-CTx LvIF has high potential as a new candidate tool for the studying of ralpha3beta2 nAChR related neurophysiology and pharmacology.
