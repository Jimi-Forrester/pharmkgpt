36938404|t|Postural deformities in Parkinson's disease: A bibliometric analysis based on web of science.
36938404|a|Objective: Postural deformities are common debilitating conditions during the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying pathophysiology and optimal treatment strategy are unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify primary research fields, important achievements and emerging trends in postural deformities in PD. Methods: Web of Science Core Collection database was searched to retrieve all literature related to postural deformities in PD over the past 20 years. Data such as annual numbers of publications, countries of origin, publication journals, cooperation between countries, citation index and keywords were retrieved from the selected publications. Bibliometrix Package in R software were used for bibliometric analysis and visualization. Results: In total, 211 publications that met the criteria were collected. Analyses had shown that the annual numbers of publications increased gradually with fluctuations. Japan was the most prolific country (n = 59). Italy participated in international cooperation the most frequently. Parkinsonism & related disorders (n = 25) took a prominent lead among all journals, and the most productive institution in this area was University of Verona (n = 27). The most local cited author was Tinazzi Michele. According to the thematic map, "scoliosis", "fusion", and "balance" have rapidly become research hot spots in related fields. Conclusions: Articles pertaining to postural deformities in PD are still being published, in which the etiology is a combination of peripheral plus central involvement. Treatment approaches include rehabilitative exercises, oral medication, botulinum toxin injection, deep brain stimulation and spine surgery, which is getting current attention and would be a hot topic of future research.
