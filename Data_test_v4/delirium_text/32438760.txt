32438760|t|Outcomes of an Accelerated Inpatient Refeeding Protocol in 103 Extremely Underweight Adults with Anorexia Nervosa at a Specialized Clinic in Prien, Germany.
32438760|a|BACKGROUND: In mildly to moderately malnourished adolescent patients with anorexia nervosa (AN), accelerated refeeding protocols using higher initial calory supply coupled with phosphate supplements were not associated with a higher incidence of refeeding syndrome (RS). It is unclear whether this is also a feasible approach for extremely malnourished, adult AN patients. METHODS: Outcomes of a clinical refeeding protocol involving a targeted initial intake of >=2000 kcal/day, routine supplementation of phosphate and thiamine as well as close medical monitoring, were evaluated. A retrospective chart review including AN patients with a body mass index (BMI) <13 kg/m2 was conducted, to describe changes in weight, BMI, and laboratory parameters (phosphate, creatine kinase, hematocrit, sodium, liver enzymes, and blood count) over four weeks. RESULTS: In 103 female patients (age, mean +- standard deviation (SD) = 23.8 +- 5.3 years), BMI between admission and follow-up increased from 11.5 +- 0.9 to 13.1 +- 1.1 kg/m2 and total weight gain within the first four weeks was 4.2 +- 2.0 kg (mean, SD). Laboratory parameter monitoring indicated no case of RS, but continuous normalization of blood parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Combined with close medical monitoring and electrolyte supplementation, accelerated refeeding may also be applied to achieve medical stabilization in extremely underweight adults with AN without increasing the risk of RS.
