36505777|a|Introduction: Cognitive impairment has been identified in patients with non-central nervous system cancer received chemotherapy. Chemotherapy-induced changes in the brain are considered as the possible causes of the cognitive deficits of patients. This study aimed to explore chemotherapy-related functional brain changes and cognitive impairment in rectal cancer (RC) patients who had just finished chemotherapy treatment. Methods: In this study, RC patients after chemotherapy (on the day patients received the last dose of chemotherapy) (n=30) and matched healthy controls (HCs) (n=30) underwent cognitive assessments, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and resting-state functional MRI. The functional brain networks were constructed by thresholding the partial correlation matrices of 90 brain regions in the Anatomical Automatic Labeling template and the topologic properties were evaluated by graph theory analysis. Moreover, correlations between altered topological measures and scores of cognitive scales were explored in the patient group. Results: Compared with HCs, RC patients had lower scores of cognitive scales. The functional brain network had preserved small-world topological features but with a tendency towards higher path length in the whole network. In addition, patients had decreased nodal global efficiency (Eglo(i)) in the left superior frontal gyrus (dorsolateral), superior frontal gyrus (orbital part), inferior frontal gyrus (opercular part), inferior frontal gyrus (triangular part) and right inferior frontal gyrus (triangular part). Moreover, values of Eglo(i) in the superior and inferior frontal gyrus were positively associated with cognitive function in the patient group. Conclusion: These results suggested that cognitive impairment was associated with disruptions of the topological organization in functional brain networks of RC patients who had just finished chemotherapy, which provided new insights into the pathophysiology underlying acute effects of chemotherapy on cognitive function.
