36261695|t|Discovery of Molecular Networks of Neuroprotection Conferred by Brahmi Extract in Abeta42-Induced Toxicity Model of Drosophila melanogaster Using a Quantitative Proteomic Approach.
36261695|a|Accumulation of Abeta42 peptides forming plaque in various regions of the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. However, to date, there is no effective management strategy reported for attenuation of Abeta42-induced toxicity in the early stages of the disease. Alternate medicinal systems such as Ayurveda in the past few decades show promising results in the management of neuronal complications. Medhya Rasayana such as Brahmi is known for its neuroprotective properties via resolving memory-related issues, while the underlying molecular mechanism of the same remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to understand the neuroprotective effects of the aqueous extract of Bacopa monnieri and Centella asiatica (both commonly known as Brahmi) against the Abeta42 expressing model of the Drosophila melanogaster. By applying a quantitative proteomics approach, the study identified > 90% of differentially expressed proteins from Abeta42 expressing D. melanogaster were either restored to their original expression pattern or showed no change in expression pattern upon receiving either Brahmi extract treatment. The Brahmi restored proteins were part of neuronal pathways associated with cell cycle re-entry, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dynamics. The neuroprotective effect of Brahmi was also validated by negative geotaxis behavioral analysis suggesting its protective role against behavioral deficits exerted by Abeta42 toxicity. We believe that these discoveries will provide a platform for developing novel therapeutics for AD management by deciphering molecular targets of neuroprotection conferred by an aqueous extract of Bacopa monnieri or Centella asiatica.
