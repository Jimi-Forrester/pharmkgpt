38413870|a|BACKGROUND: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is frequently a precursor to dementia, affecting aspects of cognition such as language, thinking, or memory. Lifestyle interventions are increasingly studied as potential means to slow the progression from MCI to dementia. OBJECTIVE: A systematic review was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of home-based lifestyle interventions in reducing cognitive decline in older adults with MCI. METHODS: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to identify home-based lifestyle interventions for individuals with MCI from 1980 to 2023. These interventions were either single-component or multi-component and included diet, physical activity, stress-reduction, or cognitive stimulation treatments to assess their impact on cognition. We performed a comprehensive search in the PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Embase, and MEDLINE databases. RESULTS: From 320 abstracts, 20 (6.25%) studies met the criteria for inclusion, with five multi-component and fifteen single-component studies. Eighteen home-based lifestyle interventions for MCI patients were focused on physical activity, diet, and/or cognitive training, while two studies were identified that incorporated stress reduction training as a method to improve cognitive function. Nineteen studies reported significant improvements in cognitive performance between the experimental and control groups post-intervention for at least one aspect of cognition. Four studies reported nonsignificant improvements in cognitive function between the two groups for at least one area of cognition. CONCLUSIONS: Home-based lifestyle interventions have the potential to improve cognition in elderly patients with MCI. However, future RCTs with larger sample sizes and longer intervention durations are needed to confirm these findings.
