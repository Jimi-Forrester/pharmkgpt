39681155|t|The role of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in preserving cognitive function via hypertension Management: A critical Update.
39681155|a|Hypertension poses a significant risk to cognition-related disorders like dementia. As the global population ages, age-related neurological illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease are becoming increasingly prevalent. The primary hypertension treatments, angiotensin receptor blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, exhibit neuroprotective properties. However, observational studies suggest that they may independently contribute to cognitive decline and dementia. Some of these medications have shown promise in reducing cognitive impairment and amyloid buildup in Alzheimer's models. While direct comparisons between the two drug classes are limited, angiotensin receptor blockers have been associated with less brain shrinkage, lower dementia incidence, and slower cognitive decline compared to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Both types of medications can influence cognition by passing the blood-brain barrier, with angiotensin receptor blockers potentially offering superior neuroprotective effects due to their selective blockade of the angiotensin type 1 receptor.
