35334041|a|Hundreds of millions of people are influenced by neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), traumatic disorders of the nervous system, dementia, and various neurological disorders. Syringic acid (SA) is a natural phenolic compound that is found in medicinal herbs and dietary plants. The therapeutic potential of SA is due to its anti-oxidative, chemoprotective, anti-angiogenic, anti-glycating, anti-proliferative, anti-hyperglycaemic, anti-endotoxic, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic and anti-depressant properties. However, in recent studies, its neuroprotective effect has drawn attention. The current review focuses on the neuroprotective bioactivities of SA and putative mechanisms of action. An electronic data search was performed using different search engines, and the relevant articles (with or without meta-analysis) with any language were selected. In the central and peripheral nervous system, SA has been shown a significant role in excitatory neurotransmitters and alleviate behavioral dysfunctions. The consensus of the literature search was that SA treatment may help neurological dysfunction or behavioral impairments management with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory properties. Furthermore, administration and proper dose of SA could be crucial factors for the effective treatment of neurological diseases.
