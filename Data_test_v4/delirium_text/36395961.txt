36395961|t|A review on Alzheimer's disease classification from normal controls and mild cognitive impairment using structural MR images.
36395961|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative brain disorder that degrades the memory and cognitive ability in elderly people. The main reason for memory loss and reduction in cognitive ability is the structural changes in the brain that occur due to neuronal loss. These structural changes are most conspicuous in the hippocampus, cortex, and grey matter and can be assessed by using neuroimaging techniques viz. Positron Emission Tomography (PET), structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), etc. Out of these neuroimaging techniques, structural MRI has evolved as the best technique as it indicates the best soft tissue contrast and high spatial resolution which is important for AD detection. Currently, the focus of researchers is on predicting the conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) into AD. MCI represents the transition state between expected cognitive changes with normal aging and Alzheimer's disease. Not every MCI patient progresses into Alzheimer's disease. MCI can develop into stable MCI (sMCI, patients are called non-converters) or into progressive MCI (pMCI, patients are diagnosed as MCI converters). This paper discusses the prognosis of MCI to AD conversion and presents a review of structural MRI-based studies for AD detection. AD detection framework includes feature extraction, feature selection, and classification process. This paper reviews the studies for AD detection based on different feature extraction methods and machine learning algorithms for classification. The performance of various feature extraction methods has been compared and it has been observed that the wavelet transform-based feature extraction method would give promising results for AD classification. The present study indicates that researchers are successful in classifying AD from Normal Controls (NrmC) but, it still requires a lot of work to be done for MCI/ NrmC and MCI/AD, which would help in detecting AD at its early stage.
