31243095|t|A review of psychosocial factors and personality in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea.
31243095|a|Effective treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is primarily determined by adherence to the selected intervention. The most common treatment pathways are mechanical devices such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or a mandibular advancement device, often combined with weight loss therapy. Weight reduction is usually an adjunct therapy but may be used as a secondary treatment in mild-to-moderate OSA when mechanical treatments cannot be tolerated. To enhance the uptake and adherence to treatment, clinicians may assess patient's personality profiles and psychological readiness. There is a paucity of evidence related to these aspects of patient care and this article outlines the current research in relation to patient presentation, treatment uptake and barriers, and methods to enhance treatment adherence.This article disseminates personality traits observed in patients with OSA and identifies vulnerable groups who may require additional support to increase treatment adherence. It summarises the current evidence for treatment barriers in patients with OSA. Low self-efficacy in relation to CPAP and weight loss adherence will be explored as well as the potential to predict treatment responders and enhance therapeutic uptake and adherence. Extending personality traits into research and clinical practice could potentially result in more successful CPAP therapy and weight loss treatment outcomes.
