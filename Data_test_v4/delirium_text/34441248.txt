34441248|t|Severe Cardiac and Metabolic Pathology Induced by Steroid Abuse in a Young Individual.
34441248|a|Androgenic-Anabolic Steroids (AAS) abuse is known to play an important role in causing the systemic inflammatory response and multiple-organ dysfunction in healthy individuals. Although many of the undesirable effects of steroid abuse have been reported, at present, little is known about the effect of anabolic supplements and the correlation between cardiac and metabolic pathology. This paper presents a case of a 25 year old patient with a complex medical history after 6 months of steroid administration. Myocardial infraction, dyslipidemia, obesity, hyperuricemia, secondary diabetes, and chronic renal disease were identified after clinical and para-clinical examinations. The particularities of this case were interpreted in the context of a literature review, highlighting the effect of multi-organ damage as a result of the uncontrolled use of anabolic steroid supplements.
