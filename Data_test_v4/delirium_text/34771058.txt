34771058|t|Metals and Metal-Nanoparticles in Human Pathologies: From Exposure to Therapy.
34771058|a|An increasing number of pathologies correlates with both toxic and essential metal ions dyshomeostasis. Next to known genetic disorders (e.g., Wilson's Disease and beta-Thalassemia) other pathological states such as neurodegeneration and diabetes are characterized by an imbalance of essential metal ions. Metal ions can enter the human body from the surrounding environment in the form of free metal ions or metal-nanoparticles, and successively translocate to different tissues, where they are accumulated and develop distinct pathologies. There are no characteristic symptoms of metal intoxication, and the exact diagnosis is still difficult. In this review, we present metal-related pathologies with the most common onsets, biomarkers of metal intoxication, and proper techniques of metal qualitative and quantitative analysis. We discuss the possible role of drugs with metal-chelating ability in metal dyshomeostasis, and present recent advances in therapies of metal-related diseases.
