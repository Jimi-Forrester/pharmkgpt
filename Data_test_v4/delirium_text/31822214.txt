31822214|a|The main objetive was to analyze the accuracy of different verbal fluency tests (VFTs) in discriminating cognitively healthy subjects from individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a cohort of older Spanish speaking adults. As a result, we aimed to identify the VFT that best predicts conversion from MCI to probable AD. 287 subjects: 170 controls (HC), 90 stable MCI and 27 patients with MCI that evolved into probable AD (MCI-AD) were assessed with a neuropsychological battery test and five VFTs. The animal fluency test produced the best differentiation of HC from MCI (p < .001), of HC from MCI-AD (p < .001) and of MCI from MCI-AD converters (p < .001), with sensitivities 98.8%, 98.8% and 75.6%, respectively. Logistic regression showed that the animal fluency test (p < 0.001) appears to be the most useful and neuropsychological VFT to predict conversion to probable dementia.
