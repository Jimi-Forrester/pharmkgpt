34505972|t|GPR40 Agonist Ameliorate Pathological Neuroinflammation of Alzheimer's Disease via the Modulation of Gut Microbiota and Immune System, a Mini-Review.
34505972|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a central disease with high incidence, and its pathological process is closely associated with changes of some biological indicators in the periphery. Among them, the intestinal flora mainly causes a series of pathological changes such as inflammation through the immune system, which may contribute to the pathological process of AD. In this paper, we mainly focused the relationship between gut microbiota and immune system disorder in the neuropathology of AD, underlining the significance of the advanced mechanism of inflammatory response and providing a new direction for the treatment of AD.
