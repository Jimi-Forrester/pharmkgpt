36362499|t|Classification of Stiff-Knee Gait Kinematic Severity after Stroke Using Retrospective k-Means Clustering Algorithm.
36362499|a|Nowadays, a classification system for unilateral stiff-knee gait (SKG) kinematic severity in hemiparetic adult patients after stroke does not exist. However, such classification would be useful to the clinicians. We proposed the use of the k-means method in order to define unilateral SKG severity clusters in hemiparetic adults after stroke. A retrospective k-means cluster analysis was applied to five selected knee kinematic parameters collected during gait in 96 hemiparetic adults and 19 healthy adults from our clinical gait analysis database. A total of five discrete knee kinematic clusters were determined. Three clusters of SKG were identified, based on which a three-level severity classification was defined: unbend-knee gait, braked-knee gait, and frozen-limb gait. Preliminary construct validity of the classification was obtained. All selected knee kinematic parameters defining the five clusters and the majority of usual kinematic parameters of the lower limbs showed statistically significant differences between the different clusters. We recommend diagnosing SKG for values strictly below 40  of knee flexion during the swing phase. Clinicians and researchers are now able to specify the level of kinematic severity of SKG in order to optimize treatment choices and future clinical trial eligibility criteria.
