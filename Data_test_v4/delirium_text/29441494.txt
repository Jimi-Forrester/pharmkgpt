29441494|t|Cost-Minimisation Analysis of Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents in the Treatment of Anaemia in Dialysed Patients: A Pilot Study.
29441494|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the cost impact of administering erythropoiesis-stimulating agents once every 4 weeks instead of one to three times a week to treat anaemia in patients undergoing dialysis. METHODS: This was a monocentric retrospective study involving 27 patients who underwent haemodialysis between 2009 and 2013 in a university hospital in Angers, France. The study was a cost-minimisation analysis from the hospital perspective. Only direct medical costs were considered. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that therapeutic management of anaemia with methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta would save medical and nurse time (7 days and 15 days per year, respectively) and reduce costs by $59,960 a year for an active file of 40 patients undergoing haemodialysis, assuming a 100% occupancy rate in the above-mentioned hospital. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that treating anaemia by administering erythropoiesis-stimulating agents once every 4 weeks instead of one to three times a week in patients undergoing haemodialysis would be beneficial for the hospital.
