36461033|t|Magnitude and associated factors of delirium among patients attending emergency department at Jimma medical center, Jimma, southwest Ethiopia, 2022.
36461033|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a severe neuropsychiatric condition that occurs frequently in all medical settings. It has been associated to serious consequences like higher mortality, institutionalization, and longer hospital stays. Delirium is missed in emergency rooms in 57% to 83% of patients, despite its frequent incidence and detrimental repercussions. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and contributing causes of delirium in patients who visited the emergency room at Jimma Medical Center in Jimma, southwest Ethiopia, in 2022. METHODS: From August 1 through September 30, 2022, a cross-sectional study was undertaken at a hospital. The study enrolled 422 participants, who were chosen through a systematic random sampling. The Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) was used to evaluate different subtypes of delirium and level of arousal. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) was used to determine the presence or absence of delirium. Epi Data V3.1 was used to enter the data, and Version 20 of the Statistical Package for Social Scientists was used to export it (SPSS V20). Bivariate and multivariable logistic regressions were performed to identify the related factors. Variables with a p-value of less than 0.05 were considered to be significant. RESULT: 26.6% of participants (n = 107) were found to have delirium. Alcohol use (AOR = 3.6, 95% CI (2.5-8.1), visual impairment (AOR = 2.34, 95% CI (1.89-3.68), frequent admission (AOR = 3.47, 95% CI (1.24-7.34), bladder catheterization (AOR = 1.4, 95% CI (1.21-2.89), and benzodiazepine exposure (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI (1.01-2.3) had a significant association with delirium. CONCLUSION: According to this study, delirium was very common among patients in the emergency room. Benzodiazepine exposure, numerous admissions, visual impairment, current alcohol consumption, bladder catheterization, and frequent admissions all significantly increased the risk of delirium. To address identifiable causes and enhance patients' health outcomes, early recognition is crucial.
