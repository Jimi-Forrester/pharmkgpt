34728041|a|Alzheimer's disease(AD)is a chronic neurodegenerative disease whose cause remains unclear.The beta-amyloid plaques in the brain are one of the major pathological features of AD.However,the drugs targeting extracellular beta-amyloid plaques have failed to cure the disease.Innate immunity and neuroinflammation play a role in the pathogenesis and progression of AD.As the macrophages existing in the central nervous system,microglia are related with extracellular beta-amyloid deposition,intracellular neurofibrillary tangle formation,and neuron injury.Accumulating evidence demonstrates that the activation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3(NLRP3)inflammasome in microglia plays a role in AD,suggesting new therapeutic target for AD in this signaling pathway.This article reviewed the studies about the activation and regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis and progression of AD as well as the development of AD therapies targeting this pathway,aiming to provide reference for further studies in this field.
