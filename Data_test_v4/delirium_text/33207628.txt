33207628|t|Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Provocation by Different Nanoparticles: An Innovative Approach to Manage the Cancer and Other Common Diseases.
33207628|a|A proper execution of basic cellular functions requires well-controlled homeostasis including correct protein folding. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) implements such functions by protein reshaping and post-translational modifications. Different insults imposed on cells could lead to ER stress-mediated signaling pathways, collectively called the unfolded protein response (UPR). ER stress is also closely linked with oxidative stress, which is a common feature of diseases such as stroke, neurodegeneration, inflammation, metabolic diseases, and cancer. The level of ER stress is higher in cancer cells, indicating that such cells are already struggling to survive. Prolonged ER stress in cancer cells is like an Achilles' heel, if aggravated by different agents including nanoparticles (NPs) may be exhausted off the pro-survival features and can be easily subjected to proapoptotic mode. Different types of NPs including silver, gold, silica, graphene, etc. have been used to augment the cytotoxicity by promoting ER stress-mediated cell death. The diverse physico-chemical properties of NPs play a great role in their biomedical applications. Some special NPs have been effectively used to address different types of cancers as these particles can be used as both toxicological or therapeutic agents. Several types of NPs, and anticancer drug nano-formulations have been engineered to target tumor cells to enhance their ER stress to promote their death. Therefore, mitigating ER stress in cancer cells in favor of cell death by ER-specific NPs is extremely important in future therapeutics and understanding the underlying mechanism of how cancer cells can respond to NP induced ER stress is a good choice for the development of novel therapeutics. Thus, in depth focus on NP-mediated ER stress will be helpful to boost up developing novel pro-drug candidates for triggering pro-death pathways in different cancers.
