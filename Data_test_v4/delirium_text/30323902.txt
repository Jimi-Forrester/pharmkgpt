30323902|a|Cognitive impairment is a state that affects thinking, communication, understanding, and memory, and is very common in various neurological disorders. Among many factors, age-related cognitive decline is an important area in mental health research. Research to find therapeutic medications or supplements to treat cognitive deficits and maintain cognitive health has been ongoing. Ginseng and its active components may have played a role in treating chronic disorders. Numerous preclinical studies have confirmed that ginseng and its active components such as ginsenosides, gintonin, and compound K are pharmacologically efficacious in different models of and are linked to cognitive impairment. Among their several roles, they act as an anti-neuroinflammatory and help fight against oxidative stress and modulate the cholinergic signal. These roles may be involved in enhancing cognition and attenuating impairment. There have been some clinical studies on the activity of ginseng in cognitive impairment, but many ginseng species and active compounds remain to be investigated. In addition, new formulations of active ginseng components such as nanoparticles and liposomes could be used for preclinical and clinical models of cognitive impairment. Here, we discuss the therapeutic potential of active ginseng components in cognitive impairment and their chemistry and pharmacokinetics and consider prospects for their delivery and clinical study with respect to cognitive impairment.
