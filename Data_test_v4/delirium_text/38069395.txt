38069395|t|HDAC1: An Essential and Conserved Member of the Diverse Zn2+-Dependent HDAC Family Driven by Divergent Selection Pressure.
38069395|a|Zn2+-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that regulate gene expression by removing acetyl groups from histone proteins. These enzymes are essential in all living systems, playing key roles in cancer treatment and as potential pesticide targets. Previous phylogenetic analyses of HDAC in certain species have been published. However, their classification and evolutionary origins across biological kingdoms remain unclear, which limits our understanding of them. In this study, we collected the HDAC sequences from 1451 organisms and performed analyses. The HDACs are found to diverge into three classes and seven subclasses under divergent selection pressure. Most subclasses show species specificity, indicating that HDACs have evolved with high plasticity and diversification to adapt to different environmental conditions in different species. In contrast, HDAC1 and HDAC3, belonging to the oldest class, are conserved and crucial in major kingdoms of life, especially HDAC1. These findings lay the groundwork for the future application of HDACs.
