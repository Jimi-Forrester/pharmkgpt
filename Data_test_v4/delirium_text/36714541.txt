36714541|a|Objective: This scoping review aimed to summarize current knowledge about the implementation, impacts, facilitators and barriers of virtual team-based care planning for older persons in formal care settings (e.g. home and community, primary, long-term and acute care). Methods: The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology was used. The Arksey and O'Malley and Levac, Colquhoun, and O'Brien methodologies provided additional frameworks. Databases accessed included PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, AgeLine, PsycInfo and Scopus. Reference lists of selected articles and grey literature retrieved through Google and Google Scholar were also reviewed. Three researchers screened titles, abstracts and conducted full-text reviews. Extracted data were mapped in a table and analysed for summative themes. Older persons and family partners assisted in interpreting findings based on their lived experiences. Results: A total of 27 studies were included. Virtual team-based care planning led to many positive outcomes for older persons (e.g. decreased depression, reduced falls and improved medication management) and their families (e.g. reduced caregiver stress and improved caregiving skills). Only four studies reported the involvement of older persons and/or families in virtual team-based care planning. Multiple barriers to adopting virtual team-based care planning were found including lack of education/training for older persons and families in using technology. Conclusion: Despite the multiple advantages that virtual team-based care planning offers for older persons and families, it is important to ensure that this care can be offered to all. There is a need to ensure that health equity is addressed to promote access to care and respond to social determinants of health.
