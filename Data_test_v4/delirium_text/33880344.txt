33880344|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which is characterized by typical symptoms including gradual progressive muscle rigidity, tremor and loss of motor skills. Although there is no definitive cure for PD, the extract of some medicinal plants and their ingredients have been suggested to relieve its symptoms and to prevent disability in patients. This review is focused on therapeutic effects of some medicinal plants and their ingredients on PD. The findings presented in this review were collected from experimental and clinical studies in databases including PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar until the end of May 2019. The keywords "neurotoxicity " or "Parkinson's disease" or "neuroprotective" and "Medicinal plants" and "Flavonoids" were searched. Based on the results of animal and clinical studies, the extract of medicinal plants and their components which are discussed in this review have neuro-protective effects against PD. These protective properties mainly are mediated through inhibition of dopamine metabolizing enzymes, reduction oxidant markers, increase of antioxidant agents and suppression of neuro-inflammation.
