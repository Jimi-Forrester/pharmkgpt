39430570|t|Intermediate Filaments in Breast Cancer Progression, and Potential Biomarker for Cancer Therapy: A Narrative Review.
39430570|a|Intermediate filaments are one of the three components of the cytoskeletons, along with actin and microtubules. The intermediate filaments consist of extensive variations of structurally related proteins with specific expression patterns in cell types. The expression pattern alteration of intermediate filaments is frequently correlated with cancer progression, specifically with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process closely related to increasing cellular migration and invasion. This review will discuss the involvement of cytoplasmic intermediate filaments, specifically vimentin, nestin, and cytokeratin (CK5/CK6, CK7, CK8/CK18, CK17, CK19, CK20, CSK1), in breast cancer progression and as prognostic or diagnostic biomarkers. The potential for drug development targeting intermediate filaments in cancer will be reviewed.
