33375412|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease towards which pleiotropic approach using Multi-Target Directed Ligands is nowadays recognized as probably convenient. Among the numerous targets which are today validated against AD, acetylcholinesterase (ACh) and Monoamine Oxidase-B (MAO-B) appear as particularly convincing, especially if displayed by a sole agent such as ladostigil, currently in clinical trial in AD. Considering these results, we wanted to take benefit of the structural analogy lying in donepezil (DPZ) and rasagiline, two indane derivatives marketed as AChE and MAO-B inhibitors, respectively, and to propose the synthesis and the preliminary in vitro biological characterization of a structural compromise between these two compounds, we called propargylaminodonepezil (PADPZ). The synthesis of racemic trans PADPZ was achieved and its biological evaluation established its inhibitory activities towards both (h)AChE (IC50 = 0.4 microM) and (h)MAO-B (IC50 = 6.4 microM).
