35525236|a|BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multi-factorial neurodegenerative disease affecting motor function of patients. The hall markers of PD are dopaminergic neuron loss in the midbrain and the presence of intra-neuronal inclusion bodies mainly composed of aggregation-prone protein alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn). Ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a multi-step reaction process responsible for more than 80% intracellular protein degradation. Impairment of UPS function has been observed in the brain tissue of PD patients. PDE4 inhibitors have been shown to activate cAMP-PKA pathway and promote UPS activity in Alzheimer's disease model. alpha-mangostin is a natural xanthonoid with broad biological activities, such as antioxidant, antimicrobial and antitumour activities. Structure-based optimizations based on alpha-mangostin produced a potent PDE4 inhibitor, 4e. Herein, we studied whether 4e could promote proteasomal degradation of alpha-syn in Parkinson's disease models through PKA activation. METHODS: cAMP Assay was conducted to quantify cAMP levels in samples. Model UPS substrates (Ub-G76V-GFP and Ub-R-GFP) were used to monitor UPS-dependent activity. Proteasome activity was investigated by short peptide substrate, Suc-LLVY-AMC, cleavage of which by the proteasome increases fluorescence sensitivity. Tet-on WT, A30P, and A53T alpha-syn-inducible PC12 cells and primary mouse cortical neurons from A53T transgenic mice were used to evaluate the effect of 4e against alpha-syn in vitro. Heterozygous A53T transgenic mice were employed to assess the effect of 4e on the clearance of alpha-syn in vivo, and further validations were applied by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Taken together, alpha-mangostin derivative 4e, a PDE4 inhibitor, efficiently activated the cAMP/PKA pathway in neuronal cells, and promoted UPS activity as evidenced by enhanced degradation of UPS substrate Ub-G76V-GFP and Ub-R-GFP, as well as elevated proteasomal enzyme activity. Interestingly, 4e dramatically accelerated degradation of inducibly-expressed WT and mutant alpha-syn in PC12 cells, in a UPS dependent manner. Besides, 4e consistently activated PKA in primary neuron and A53T mice brain, restored UPS inhibition and alleviated alpha-syn accumulation in the A53T mice brain. CONCLUSIONS: 4e is a natural compound derived highly potent PDE4 inhibitor. We revealed its potential effect in promoting UPS activity to degrade pathogenic proteins associated with PD.
