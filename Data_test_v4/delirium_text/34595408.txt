34595408|a|The growing understanding of the bidirectional relationship between the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome and the immune system has opened up new avenues for treatment of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is the transfer of stool from a donor to a recipient who harbors a perturbed GI microbiome resulting in disease. We review the rationale for performing FMT for the treatment of acute GVHD, and summarize data on the safety and efficacy of the procedure among allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients. Overall, FMT is a promising strategy in treating and preventing HSCT-related complications. However, caution should be exerted as HSCT recipients are highly immunosuppressed and unanticipated infectious adverse events may appear with the increasing application of FMT.
