39754665|t|Mapping the knowledge landscape of the PET/MR domain: a multidimensional bibliometric analysis.
39754665|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aims to conduct a bibliometric analysis to explore research trends, collaboration patterns, and emerging themes in the PET/MR field based on published literature from 2010 to 2024. METHODS: A detailed literature search was performed using the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database with keywords related to PET/MR. A total of 4,349 publications were retrieved and analyzed using various bibliometric tools, including VOSviewer and CiteSpace. RESULTS: The analysis revealed an initial increase in PET/MR publications, peaking at 495 in 2021, followed by a slight decline. The USA, Germany, and China were the most prolific countries, with the USA demonstrating strong collaborative networks. Key institutions included the Stanford University, Technical University of Munich and University of Duisburg-Essen. Prominent authors were primarily from Germany, with significant contributions from University Hospital Essen. Major journals in the field included the European Journal of Nuclear Medicine, Journal of Nuclear Medicine, and Physics in Medicine and Biology. Emerging research areas focused on oncology, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular diseases, with keywords such as "prostate cancer," "Alzheimer's disease," and "breast cancer" showing high research activity. Recent trends also highlight the growing integration of AI, particularly deep learning, to improve imaging reconstruction and diagnostic accuracy. CONCLUSION: The findings emphasize the need for continuous investment, strategic planning, and technological innovations to expand PET/MR's clinical applications. Future research should focus on optimizing imaging techniques, fostering international collaborations, and integrating emerging technologies like artificial intelligence to enhance PET/MR's diagnostic and therapeutic potential in precision medicine.
