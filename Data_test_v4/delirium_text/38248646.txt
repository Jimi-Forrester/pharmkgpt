38248646|t|Research Progress in Heterologous Crocin Production.
38248646|a|Crocin is one of the most valuable components of the Chinese medicinal plant Crocus sativus and is widely used in the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. Traditional planting of C. sativus is unable to fulfill the increasing demand for crocin in the global market, however, such that researchers have turned their attention to the heterologous production of crocin in a variety of hosts. At present, there are reports of successful heterologous production of crocin in Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, microalgae, and plants that do not naturally produce crocin. Of these, the microalga Dunaliella salina, which produces high levels of beta-carotene, the substrate for crocin biosynthesis, is worthy of attention. This article describes the biosynthesis of crocin, compares the features of each heterologous host, and clarifies the requirements for efficient production of crocin in microalgae.
