37383650|a|This study aimed to investigate the effects of a high-fat and cholesterol diet (HFCD) on rats' gastric mucosa. In the study, a total of 16 (40-day-old Sprague Dawley) male rats were used and randomly divided into two groups (each consisted of eight rats). The rats in control group had no implementations other than normal feeding. For 10 weeks, rats in a high-fat with cholesterol diet group had daily energy amounts provided by pellet feed mixed with 65.00% butter and 2.00% cholesterol. Before beginning the study and at the end, rats live weight was recorded and their blood samples were taken for biochemical analyses. Hematoxylin and Eosin and Crossman's triple staining techniques were used to investigate the general structure of gastric tissue. The rats fed with HFCD had statistically significant increases in live weight and total cholesterol values, and were identified to have gastric tissue degeneration. The rats' gastric tissue in control group had more intense somatostatin (SST) immunoreactivity in parietal and chief cells than the HFCD group. It was determined that feeding with the HFCD has a negative effect on SST secretion in rats and hence, this may have important areas of use such as in gastric cancer treatment and preventing complications linked to gastric diseases.
