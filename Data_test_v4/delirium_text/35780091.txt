35780091|a|PURPOSE: To compare retinal ganglion cell complex (GCC) parameters between rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) eyes and normal contralateral eyes after vitrectomy and to evaluate their correlation with inflammatory blood markers. METHODS: We investigated 25 eyes that underwent vitrectomy due to RRD. Venous blood samples were collected from all participants before 08:00 a.m. on the second day of admission after a 12-hour fast for blood counts. The differences of retinal structure between RRD and contralateral eyes were compared 1 week postoperatively. RESULTS: Focal loss volume (FLV) (2.009 +- 1.286)% was significantly increased compared with the contralateral eyes (p <  0.001). Monocyte-to-high-density lipoprotein was significantly positively correlated with GCC thickness parameters, and negatively correlated with FLV and global loss volume (GLV). Postoperative best-corrected visual acuity was negatively correlated with GLV (p = 0.039, R2 = 0.172). CONCLUSION: Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) loss might present early postoperatively in RRD eyes, and was associated with systemic inflammation. RGCs loss might affect postoperative vision.
