33735950|a|BACKGROUND: Critically ill cancer patients have an increased risk of developing acute neurological signs. The study objective was to evaluate the use and the usefulness of emergency head computed tomography (EHCT) in this category of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective, single-centre, cohort study included patients with EHCT performed during Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission for a period of three years. Indications, imagistic findings, type of malignancy, and outcome were evaluated to identify diagnostic yield and correlations between abnormal findings on positive scans, malignancy type, and mortality rate. RESULTS: Sixty-four EHCTs were performed in 54 critically ill cancer patients, with 32 scans (50%) showing previously unknown lesions and considered to be positive. The most frequent abnormal findings were ischemic (15 EHCTs, 47%) and haemorrhagic (13 EHCTs, 40%) lesions. Thirty-eight EHCTs (59%) were indicated for altered mental status, with a positivity rate of 50%. Eighteen EHCTs (48%) were performed in hematological malignancy patients: 9 (50%) of which were positive with 8/9 (89%) displaying hemorrhagic lesions. Twenty EHCTs were performed in solid tumour patients, 10 (50%) of which were positive, with 9/10 (90%) displaying ischemic lesions. Out of 54 patients, 30 (55%) died during ICU stay. The mortality rate was higher in patients with hematological malignancies and positive EHCT (78% vs. 58%). CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic yield of EHCT in critically ill cancer patients is much higher than in other categories of ICU patients. We support the systematic use of EHCT in critically ill, mainly hemato-oncological patients with nonspecific neurological dysfunction, as it may lead to early identification of intracranial complications.
