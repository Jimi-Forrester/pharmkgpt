15629492|a|This paper describes a Hebrew naming test that consists of 48 line drawings ordered by word frequency. The initial validation phase included 48 young adults (ages 20-28), 48 old adults (ages 67-85), and 27 individuals with Alzheimer's disease (ages 68-87). Results indicated a modest odd-even internal consistency effect, word frequency effect, and sensitivity to neurological disease. The normative population included 365 participants, aged 18-85. Means of correct answers (responses provided spontaneously and those following a functional cue), of spontaneous responses alone, and of responses provided after a functional and after a phonemic cue are presented, along with cumulative percentiles for the total score. Results show that age had the greatest effect on naming performance with age at immigration accounting for a significant share of the variance as well.
