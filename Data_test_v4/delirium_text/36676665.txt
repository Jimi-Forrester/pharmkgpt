36676665|t|The Influence of Nutritional Status and Sleep Quality on Gustatory Function in Older Adults.
36676665|a|Background and Objectives: Age-related declines in taste function are common. Taste acuity can be affected by nutritional status and sleep quality. This research aims to examine the effect of nutritional status and sleep quality on gustatory function in community-dwelling older adults. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study included 119 community-dwelling older adults (50.4% of whom were female). The gustatory function was evaluated using four liquid taste solutions (sweet, bitter, sour, and salty) each at four different concentrations and the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was applied. Additionally, anthropometric measurements were taken. Results: The mean scores on the gustatory test for the sweet, bitter, sour, and salty tastes were 2.11 +- 1.27, 2.12 +- 1.03, 2.28 +- 1.03, and 1.98 +- 1.41, respectively. There were significant differences according to gender, polypharmacy, nutritional status, and sleep quality in identifying sweet tastes (all p < 0.05). It was also found that females and participants without polypharmacy had better scores for bitter tastes. When the gustatory functions were evaluated according to BMI classification, it was determined that underweight participants had a higher sour taste score than the obese ones. Multiple regression analysis revealed that age, MNA score, PSQI score, and gender accounted for a total of 20.4% of the variance in the sweet taste score. Conclusions: Determining the relationship between taste function, nutritional status, and sleep quality in older adults is important in terms of developing new strategies for older adults who have these problems.
