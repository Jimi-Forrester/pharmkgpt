37033521|t|Cerebral Venous Thromboses in a Patient With No Reported Risk Factors: A Case Report.
37033521|a|Stroke is a neurologic condition caused either by brain ischemia or brain hemorrhage, where most cases are a result of ischemic brain injury. Stroke more commonly affects the arterial blood supply of the brain, but in rare cases, it is evoked by the occlusion of the venous sinuses that drain blood from the brain. This phenomenon is known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), also referred to as cerebral sinovenous thrombosis. The pathogenesis of CVST is not completely understood, although common risk factors associated with the condition include obesity, hypercoagulable states, oral contraceptive use, intracranial infections, trauma, and, more recently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Immediate medical intervention is required because CVST can result in increased intracranial pressure and diffuse cerebral edema, which can bring about fatal complications that can lead to early death. However, CVST is challenging to diagnose, as its clinical presentation is highly variable. It can range from headaches to signs of elevated intracranial pressure, including nausea, vomiting, and vision problems. In this case report, the patient is a 25-year-old previously healthy African American female who presented with a weeklong headache and acute onset of delirium an hour prior to arrival at the hospital. The patient had prior emergency department (ED) visits from different facilities where head imaging was performed and showed negative results allowing her to return home. The patient was then brought by a friend to our ED due to altered mental status and agitation. Initial computed tomography of the head did not reveal acute abnormalities; however, magnetic resonance angiography and magnetic resonance venography revealed evidence of venous sinus thrombosis and lack of flow requiring urgent attention. The patient was then referred to endovascular neurology, but despite medical intervention, the patient's medical status deteriorated, and she was declared brain dead. Although rare, this case report emphasizes the atypical presentation and the severity of CVST where a young individual with no significant past medical history presented with neurological symptoms that rapidly progressed to complications that caused her early death.
