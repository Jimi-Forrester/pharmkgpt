11584984|t|Underlying mechanisms of psychosis and aggression in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
11584984|a|It is well known that serotonergic function is related to aggression. Patients with Alzheimer's disease exhibit aggressive behavior, and alterations in their serotonergic function have been identified. Recent clinical trials involving new antipsychotic agents, such as risperidone, which has both serotonergic and dopaminergic activity, have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of these drugs in treating the psychosis and aggressive behavior associated with dementia.
