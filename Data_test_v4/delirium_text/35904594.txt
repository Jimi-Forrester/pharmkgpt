35904594|t|Characterization of the angular gyrus in an older adult population: a multimodal multilevel approach.
35904594|a|The angular gyrus (AG) has been associated with multiple cognitive functions, such as language, spatial and memory functions. Since the AG is thought to be a cross-modal hub region suffering from significant age-related structural atrophy, it may also play a key role in age-related cognitive decline. However, the exact relation between structural atrophy of the AG and cognitive decline in older adults is not fully understood, which may be related to two aspects: First, the AG is cytoarchitectonically divided into two areas, PGa and PGp, potentially sub-serving different cognitive functions. Second, the older adult population is characterized by high between-subjects variability which requires targeting individual phenomena during the aging process. We therefore performed a multimodal (gray matter volume [GMV], resting-state functional connectivity [RSFC] and structural connectivity [SC]) characterization of AG subdivisions PGa and PGp in a large older adult population, together with relations to age, cognition and lifestyle on the group level. Afterwards, we switched the perspective to the individual, which is especially important when it comes to the assessment of individual patients. The AG can be considered a heterogeneous structure in of the older brain: we found the different AG parts to be associated with different patterns of whole-brain GMV associations as well as their associations with RSFC, and SC patterns. Similarly, differential effects of age, cognition and lifestyle on the GMV of AG subdivisions were observed. This suggests each region to be structurally and functionally differentially involved in the older adult's brain network architecture, which was supported by differential molecular and genetic patterns, derived from the EBRAINS multilevel atlas framework. Importantly, individual profiles deviated considerably from the global conclusion drawn from the group study. Hence, general observations within the older adult population need to be carefully considered, when addressing individual conditions in clinical practice.
