30636731|t|Early after Administration [11C]PiB PET Images Correlate with Cognitive Dysfunction Measured by the CERAD Test Battery.
30636731|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid-beta (Abeta) and [18F]FDG PET are established as amyloid pathology and neuronal injury biomarkers. Early after administration Abeta PET images have the potential to replace [18F]FDG PET images allowing dual biomarker delivery by the administration of a single tracer. For [18F]FDG PET data, a correlation with cognitive performance is known. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether early after administration [11C]PiB PET data also correlate with cognitive performance. METHODS: The early after administration [11C]PiB PET data of 31 patients with cognitive impairment were evaluated. CERAD subtests were summarized to five cognitive domains. The resulting z scores were correlated with the PET data on a voxel- and VOI-based approach. Additional subgroup analyses (MCI versus dementia, Abeta-positive versus Abeta-negative subjects) were performed. RESULTS: Significant correlations between cognitive performance and early after administration [11C]PiB PET data were found between left temporo-parietal SUVR and language domain, bilateral occipital as well as left temporal SUVR and executive function, left pre- and postcentral SUVRs, and visuospatial abilities. For the episodic and immediate memory domains, the analysis at the high significance level did not show any correlated cluster, however, the exploratory analysis did. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed correlations between deficits in different cognitive domains and regional early after administration [11C]PiB PET data similar to those known from [18F]FDG PET studies. Thus, our data support the assumption that early [11C]PiB PET data have a potential as neuronal injury biomarker. Head-to-head double-tracer studies of larger cohorts are needed to confirm this assumption.
