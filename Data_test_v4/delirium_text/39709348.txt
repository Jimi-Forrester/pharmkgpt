39709348|a|BACKGROUND: The number of people reaching old age is rising, bringing an increase in age-related diseases like cardiovascular conditions and cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive impairment (CI) impacts various brain functions, affecting daily activities and quality of life. Metabolic syndrome (MetS), a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors, has been implicated in CI. This study examines the prevalence of MetS and CI among older adults in Calabar Metropolis and the associated risk factors. METHODS: This study was conducted in Calabar Metropolis, Cross River State, Nigeria, with 236 older adults (aged 65 years and above) selected via a multi-stage sampling technique. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Physical examinations and biomarker assessments included measurements of blood pressure, height, weight, waist and hip circumference, fasting plasma glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. MetS was defined according to the NCEP Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. CI was assessed using the Mini-Cog  test, with scores <= 3 indicating poor cognitive status. Data analysis utilized SPSS version 26.0, employing chi-square tests and binary logistic regression. Significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: The prevalence of MetS was 32.2%, and CI was observed in 44% of participants. Females had a slightly higher prevalence (57.9%) of MetS compared to males (42.1%). Significant differences were found between MetS and non-MetS groups in systolic blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, triglycerides, abdominal obesity, and cardiovascular risk. MetS overall was not significantly associated with CI. However, reduced HDL levels were significantly linked to poor cognitive status (OR = 70.528, 95% CI = 3.269-1521.748). Other MetS components did not show significant associations with CI. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the prevalence of MetS and CI among older adults in Calabar Metropolis. The findings suggest that while MetS as a whole is not associated with CI, reduced HDL levels are significantly linked to poor cognitive status. The findings emphasize the importance of managing specific metabolic risk factors, particularly HDL, to maintain cognitive health in elderly population. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable.
