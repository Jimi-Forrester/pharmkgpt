37897832|a|Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a type of breast cancer with the worst clinical outcome. TNBC is not sensitive to typical endocrine therapy and targeted therapy. Thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), known as a tumor suppressor, is related to oxidative stress and energy metabolism. However, the clinical significance of TXNIP in TNBC and mechanism in immunity have not been fully reported. In this study, we found that the expression of TXNIP was downregulated obviously in TNBC tissues and negatively correlated with tumor grade by comprehensive bioinformatics analysis and immunohistochemistry staining of 108 TNBC tissues. Through in vivo and in vitro experiments, we identified TXNIP as a tumor suppressor in TNBC. By bulk mRNA and scRNA analysis, we found that TXNIP could enhance immune response in TNBC and was a potential biomarker for cancer immunity and immunotherapy. We also performed the drug susceptibility analysis to reveal the therapeutic value of TXNIP. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that TXNIP was a tumor suppressor in TNBC and was involved in tumor malignancy progression. TXNIP was a potential biomarker for immunotherapy and promising molecular therapeutic target.
