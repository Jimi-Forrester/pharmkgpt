34562779|t|Mapping the impact of ICU design on patients, families and the ICU team: A scoping review.
34562779|a|PURPOSE: Scoping review to map outcomes and describe effects of intensive care unit (ICU) design features on patients, family, and healthcare professionals (HCPs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Iteratively developed search strategy executed across seven databases. We included studies (January 2007 to May 2020) exploring ICU design features using any study design. We grouped studies into 12 design features and categorized outcomes into four domains. RESULTS: Of 18,577 citations screened, 44 studies met inclusion criteria. Newly built or renovated ICUs/ICU rooms were evaluated in 27 (61%) studies; 17 (39%) evaluated existing designs/features. Most commonly evaluated design features were lighting (24, 55%), single vs multi-occupancy rooms/pods (17, 39%), and family-centered design (13, 30%). We identified 63 distinct outcomes in four domains; HCP-related (20, 45%); patient-related (20, 45%); family-related (11, 25%); and environment-related (7, 16%). Eleven (25%) studies measured patient/family-reported outcomes. In studies evaluating single occupancy rooms, three reported increased family satisfaction, two reported decreased delirium burden, while six reported negative consequences on HCP wellbeing and working. CONCLUSION: Studies evaluating ICU design measure disparate outcomes. Few studies included patient/ family-reported outcomes; fewer measured objective environment characteristics. Single room layouts may benefit patients and family but contribute to adverse HCP-related outcomes.
