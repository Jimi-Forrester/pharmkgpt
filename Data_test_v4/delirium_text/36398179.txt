36398179|t|Perioperative Considerations in a Patient with Kleine-Levin Syndrome Undergoing a Neurosurgical Procedure under General Anesthesia.
36398179|a|Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) is a rare central disorder of daytime hypersomnolence and is often characterized by a relapsing and remitting course, recurrent episodes of excessive sleep lasting from 12 to 20 hours a day, and symptoms including hyperphagia, hallucinations, derealization, disorientation, and hypersexuality. There are numerous perioperative considerations in dealing with KLS that include challenges during induction of anesthesia, delayed emergence, postoperative sleep disorders, and delirium. However, due to its rare occurrence, the anesthetic considerations of KLS remain poorly described. This case report outlines the anesthetic considerations and management of a young female patient with KLS who underwent transnasal excision of a trigeminal schwannoma under general anesthesia.
