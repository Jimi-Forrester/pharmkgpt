38849934|t|Role of NLRP3 inflammasome in central nervous system diseases.
38849934|a|The central nervous system (CNS) is the most delicate system in human body, with the most complex structure and function. It is vulnerable to trauma, infection, neurodegeneration and autoimmune diseases, and activates the immune system. An appropriate inflammatory response contributes to defence against invading microbes, whereas an excessive inflammatory response can aggravate tissue damage. The NLRP3 inflammasome was the first one studied in the brain. Once primed and activated, it completes the assembly of inflammasome (sensor NLRP3, adaptor ASC, and effector caspase-1), leading to caspase-1 activation and increased release of downstream inflammatory cytokines, as well as to pyroptosis. Cumulative studies have confirmed that NLRP3 plays an important role in regulating innate immunity and autoimmune diseases, and its inhibitors have shown good efficacy in animal models of various inflammatory diseases. In this review, we will briefly discuss the biological characteristics of NLRP3 inflammasome, summarize the recent advances and clinical impact of the NLRP3 inflammasome in infectious, inflammatory, immune, degenerative, genetic, and vascular diseases of CNS, and discuss the potential and challenges of NLRP3 as a therapeutic target for CNS diseases.
