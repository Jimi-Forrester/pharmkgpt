29577161|t|The active role of Ca2+ ions in Abeta-mediated membrane damage.
29577161|a|Calcium dysregulation, membrane leakage and Abeta amyloid growth are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that Ca2+ ions inhibit membrane damage due to amyloid channels but enhance membrane disruption associated with fibers growing on the lipid surface. The similarities with IAPP suggest that this may represent a mechanism common to all proteinopathies.
