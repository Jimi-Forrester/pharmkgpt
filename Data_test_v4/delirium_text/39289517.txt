39289517|a|Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and age-related neurological diseases (ANDs), such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases, are increasingly prevalent conditions that significantly contribute to global morbidity, disability, and mortality. The retina, as an accessible part of the central nervous system (CNS), provides a unique window to study brain aging and neurodegeneration. By examining the associations between AMD and ANDs, this review aims to highlight novel insights into fundamental mechanisms of aging and their role in neurodegenerative disease progression. This review integrates knowledge from the emerging field of aging research, which identifies common denominators of biological aging, specifically loss of proteostasis, impaired macroautophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation. Finally, we emphasize the clinical relevance of these pathways and the potential for cross-disease therapies that target common aging hallmarks. Identifying these shared pathways could open avenues to develop therapeutic strategies targeting mechanisms common to multiple degenerative diseases, potentially attenuating disease progression and promoting the healthspan.
