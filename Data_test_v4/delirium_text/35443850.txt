35443850|a|INTRODUCTION: alpha-syn aggregates represent the pathological hallmark of synucleinopathies as well as a frequent copathology (almost 1/3 of cases) in AD. Recent research indicates a potential role of alpha-syn species, measured in CSF with conventional analytical techniques, in the differential diagnosis between AD and synucleinopathies (such as DLB). Pioneering studies report the detection of alpha-syn in blood, however, conclusive investigations are controversial. Ultrasensitive seed amplification techniques, enabling the selective quantification of alpha-syn seeds, may represent an effective solution to identify the alpha-syn component in AD and facilitate a biomarker-guided stratification. AREAS COVERED: We performed a PubMed-based review of the latest findings on alpha-syn-related biomarkers for AD, focusing on bodily fluids. A dissertation on the role of ultrasensitive seed amplification assays, detecting alpha-syn seeds from different biological samples, was conducted. EXPERT OPINION: alpha-syn may contribute to progressive AD neurodegeneration through cross-seeding especially with tau protein. Ultrasensitive seed amplification techniques may support a biomarker-drug co-development pathway and may be a pathophysiological candidate biomarker for the evolving ATX(N) system to classify AD and the spectrum of primary NDDs. This would contribute to a precise approach to AD, aimed at implementing disease-modifying treatments.
