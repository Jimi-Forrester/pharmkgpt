22840743|t|Hsp90 modulation for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
22840743|a|Hsp90 serves as the master regulator of the prosurvival, heat shock response. Upon exposure to cellular stress or small molecule inhibitors of Hsp90, various heat shock proteins are induced to assist in the rematuration of misfolded proteins. Several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, manifest through the accumulation of misfolded proteins, suggesting that induction of the heat shock response may provide a viable approach toward the management of such diseases. In this chapter, the rationale for such an approach and potential therapeutics are discussed.
