688616|t|Plasma calcium, copper, magnesium, and zinc concentrations in patients with the alcohol withdrawal syndrome.
688616|a|We determined zinc, copper, magnesium, and calcium concentrations by atomic absorption spectrophotometry in the plasma of 30 patients hospitalized for treatment of seizures during a period of alcohol withdrawal. Those patients who developed delirium tremens or a prolonged hallucinatory state had significantly higher plasma copper concentrations (P = 0.026), significantly lower zinc concentrations (P = 0.004), and significantly higher copper/zinc ratios (P = 0.001) than the patients who recovered uneventfully. Zinc deficiency may be one of the factors that contribute to the neurologic complications of alcoholism. A determination of the plasma copper/zinc ratio early in the course of alcohol withdrawal could be of value in indicating which patients have the most substantial underlying disease or metabolic imbalance and therefore may be at greatest risk of developing delirium tremens or prolonged hallucinosis.
