34686034|t|Phytochemical, Pharmacological, and Biotechnological Study of Ageratina pichinchensis: A Native Species of Mexico.
34686034|a|Ageratina pichinchensis (Asteraceae) has been used for a long time in traditional Mexican medicine for treating different skin conditions and injuries. This review aimed to provide an up-to-date view regarding the traditional uses, chemical composition, and pharmacological properties (in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials) that have been achieved using crude extracts, fractions, or pure compounds. Moreover, for a critical evaluation of the published literature, key databases (Pubmed, Science Direct, and SciFinder, among others) were systematically searched using keywords to retrieve relevant publications on this plant. Studies that reported on crude extracts, fractions, or isolated pure compounds of A. pichinchensis have found a varied range of biological effects, including antibacterial, curative, antiulcer, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory activities. Phytochemical analyses of different parts of A. pichinchensis revealed 47 compounds belonging to chromenes, furans, glycosylated flavonoids, terpenoids, and essential oils. Furthermore, biotechnological studies of A. pichinchensis such as callus and cell suspension cultures have provided information for future research perspectives to improve the production of valuable bioactive compounds.
