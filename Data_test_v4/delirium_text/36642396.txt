36642396|a|Peroxiredoxin-6 (PRDX6), a member of the peroxiredoxin family, has progressively emerged as a possible therapeutic target for a variety of brain diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease and ischemic stroke. However, the role of PRDX6 in neurons under ischemic conditions has remained elusive. Here, we found that astrocytes could release PRDX6 extracellularly after OGD/R, and that PRDX6 release actually worsened neuroapoptosis under OGD/R. We discovered a unique PRDX6/RAGE/JNK signaling pathway that contributes to the effect of neuroapoptosis. We applied a specific inhibitor of the RAGE signaling pathway in a mouse MCAO model and observed significant alterations in animal behavior. Considered together, our findings show the crucial role of the astrocyte-released PRDX6 in the process of neuroapoptosis caused by OGD/R, and could provide novel insights for investigating the molecular mechanism of protecting brain function from ischemia-reperfusion injury.
