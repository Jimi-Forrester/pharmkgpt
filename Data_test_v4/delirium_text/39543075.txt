39543075|a|Berberine (BBN) is a naturally occurring alkaloid as a secondary metabolite in many plants and exhibits several benefits including neuroprotective activities. However, data on the neuromodulating potential of nanoformulated BBN are still lacking. In the present study, BBN loaded within iron oxide nanoparticles (BBN-IONP) were prepared and characterized by transmission electron microscopy FTIR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy particle-size distribution, zeta potential, and HPLC. The remyelinating neuroprotective potential of BBN-IONP relative to free BBN was evaluated against cuprizone (CPZ)-induced neurotoxicity (rats administered 0.2% CPZ powder (w/w) for five weeks). CPZ rats were treated with either free BBN or IONP-BBN (50 mg/kg/day, orally) for 14 days. Cognitive function was estimated using Y-maze. Biochemically, total antioxidant capacity lipid peroxides and reduced glutathione in the brain tissue, as well as, serum interferon-gamma levels were estimated. Moreover, the genetic expression contents of myelin basic protein Matrix metallopeptidase-9 Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and S100beta were measured. The histopathological patterns and immunohistochemical assessment of Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein in both cerebral cortex and hippocampus CA1 regions were investigated. CPZ-rats treated with either free BBN or IONP-BBN demonstrated memory restoring, anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-astrocytic, and remyelinating activities. Comparing free BBN with IONP-BBN revealed that the latter altered the neuromodulating activities of BBN, showing superior neuroprotective activities of IONP-BBN relative to BBN. In conclusion, both forms of BBN possess neuroprotective potential. However, the use of IONPs for brain delivery and the safety of these nano-based forms need further investigation.
