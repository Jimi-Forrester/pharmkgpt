33573322|t|Aging and Microglial Response following Systemic Stimulation with Escherichia coli in Mice.
33573322|a|Systemic infection is an important risk factor for the development cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration in older people. Animal experiments show that systemic challenges with live bacteria cause a neuro-inflammatory response, but the effect of age on this response in these models is unknown. Young (2 months) and middle-aged mice (13-14 months) were intraperitoneally challenged with live Escherichia coli (E. coli) or saline. The mice were sacrificed at 2, 3 and 7 days after inoculation; for all time points, the mice were treated with ceftriaxone (an antimicrobial drug) at 12 and 24 h after inoculation. Microglial response was monitored by immunohistochemical staining with an ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1) antibody and flow cytometry, and inflammatory response by mRNA expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. We observed an increased microglial cell number and moderate morphologically activated microglial cells in middle-aged mice, as compared to young mice, after intraperitoneal challenge with live E. coli. Flow cytometry of microglial cells showed higher CD45 and CD11b expressions in middle-aged infected mice compared to young infected mice. The brain expression levels of pro-inflammatory genes were higher in middle-aged than in young infected mice, while middle-aged infected mice had similar expression levels of these genes in the systemic compartment. We conclude that systemic challenge with live bacteria causes an age-dependent neuro-inflammatory and microglial response. Our data show signs of an age-dependent disconnection of the inflammatory transcriptional signature between the brain and the systemic compartment.
