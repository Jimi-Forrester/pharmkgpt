32121043|t|Natural Products of Marine Macroalgae from South Eastern Australia, with Emphasis on the Port Phillip Bay and Heads Regions of Victoria.
32121043|a|Marine macroalgae occurring in the south eastern region of Victoria, Australia, consistingof Port Phillip Bay and the heads entering the bay, is the focus of this review. This area is home toapproximately 200 different species of macroalgae, representing the three major phyla of the greenalgae (Chlorophyta), brown algae (Ochrophyta) and the red algae (Rhodophyta), respectively. Overalmost 50 years, the species of macroalgae associated and occurring within this area have resultedin the identification of a number of different types of secondary metabolites including terpenoids,sterols/steroids, phenolic acids, phenols, lipids/polyenes, pheromones, xanthophylls andphloroglucinols. Many of these compounds have subsequently displayed a variety of bioactivities.A systematic description of the compound classes and their associated bioactivities from marinemacroalgae found within this region is presented.
