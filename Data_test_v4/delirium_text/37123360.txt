37123360|t|EEG microstate changes during hyperbaric oxygen therapy in patients with chronic disorders of consciousness.
37123360|a|Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy is an effective treatment for patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC). In this study, real-time electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were obtained from patients with DOC during HBO therapy. EEG microstate indicators including mean microstate duration (MMD), ratio of total time covered (RTT), global explained variance (GEV), transition probability, mean occurrence, and mean global field power (GFP) were compared before and during HBO therapy. The results showed that the duration of microstate C in all patients with DOC increased after 20 min of HBO therapy (p < 0.05). Further statistical analysis found that the duration of microstate C was longer in the higher CRS-R group (>=8, 17 cases) than in the lower group (<8, 24 cases) during HBO treatment. In the higher CRS-R group, the transition probabilities from microstate A to microstate C and from microstate C to microstate A also increased significantly compared with the probability before treatment (p < 0.05). Microstate C is generally considered to be related to a salience network; an increase in the transition probability between microstate A and microstate C indicates increased information exchange between the auditory network and the salience network. The results of this study show that HBO therapy has a specific activating effect on attention and cognitive control in patients and causes increased activity in the primary sensory cortex (temporal lobe and occipital lobe). This study demonstrates that real-time EEG detection and analysis during HBO is a clinically feasible method for assessing brain function in patients with DOC. During HBO therapy, some EEG microstate indicators show significant changes related to the state of consciousness in patients with chronic DOC. This will be complementary to important electrophysiological indicators for assessing consciousness and may also provide an objective foundation for the precise treatment of patients with DOC.
