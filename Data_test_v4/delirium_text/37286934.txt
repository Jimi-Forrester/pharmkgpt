37286934|a|Theobromine is an abundant methylxanthine in cocoa/chocolate. A recent article in BMC Psychiatry concludes that theobromine consumption increases the risk of depression. In our opinion, it is difficult to make a correlation between dietary habits and the risk of depression, the diagnosis of which is not simple to make. Also, it is not easy to assess the amount of theobromine because it varies from one brand of chocolate to another and/or depending on the percentage of cocoa it has. Assuming that there is a correlation, we postulate that the conclusion may be the opposite, that is, that depressed individuals benefit from the intake of products containing theobromine. Since some antidepressant drugs alter the craving for sweet products, it would be interesting to try to correlate the data on theobromine intake with the kind of therapy used in depressed individuals.
