32166707|t|Inhibitory Control Deficits in Individuals with Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment: a Meta-Analysis.
32166707|a|Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease that is characterized by impairments in episodic memory. Recent evidence has shown that inhibitory control is also impaired in aMCI. The aim of the present meta-analysis was to quantify inhibitory control ability in individuals with aMCI by examining performance across a range of well-defined inhibition paradigms that tapped into one of three inhibitory control subtypes (i) interference control (e.g., Stroop task), (ii) response inhibition (e.g., Go/Nogo task), or (iii) inhibition of cognitive sets (Wisconsin Card Sort Task). Reference databases (PsychINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science) were searched for studies comparing individuals with aMCI to healthy controls on behavioural measures of inhibition. Across 70 effect sizes involving 2184 adults with aMCI and 3049 controls, overall inhibition deficits of moderate magnitude (g = -0.73) were found among individuals with aMCI. Inhibition deficits were moderate in size regardless of inhibitory control subtype: interference control (g = -0.74), response inhibition (g = -0.71), inhibition of cognitive sets (g = -0.76). Subgroup analyses revealed that Stroop outcome measure (reaction time vs. accuracy) and recruitment source (clinical vs. community) moderated interference control deficits. Together these findings support a generalized inhibition deficit in aMCI, and suggest that inhibition tasks should be included routinely in neuropsychological test batteries to provide a more comprehensive overview of executive dysfunction in aMCI.
