39377411|a|The yellow pigment curcumin has long been used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antioxidant activities. Over the past half-century, scien-tific investigations have shown that curcumin is endowed with additional health benefits be-cause it can modify key molecular targets associated with a number of pathologies, such as diabetes, cancer, and arthritis, in addition to cardiovascular, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, and Crohn's diseases. However, this molecule has several disadvantages, such as low bioavail-ability and solubility, severe oxidative destruction, light sensitivity, fast systemic clearance and breakdown at alkaline pH levels. To address these drawbacks, several methods of micro-encapsulation employing a variety of shell materials have been investigated. These techniques contributed toward the increase of curcumin's solubility and stability against heat, light, oxy-gen, and an alkaline pH. The various shell materials and methods used to microencapsulate this chemical are the main topics of this review. The use of microencapsulated curcumin in food, medicine, and cosmetics is also discussed in more detail. Recent relevant research from the last few years has been given in this area, along with future difficulties.
