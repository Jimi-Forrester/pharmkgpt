37288246|t|Brain structure and structural basis of neurodegenerative diseases.
37288246|a|The brain is one of the most complex organs in nature. In this organ, multiple neurons, neuron clusters, or multiple brain regions are interconnected to form a complex structural network where various brain functions are completed through interaction. In recent years, multiple tools and techniques have been developed to analyze the composition of different cell types in the brain and to construct the brain atlas on macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic levels. Meanwhile, researchers have found that many neuropsychiatric diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease, are closely related to abnormal changes of brain structure, which means the investigation in brain structure not only provides a new idea for understanding the pathological mechanism of the diseases, but also provides imaging markers for early diagnosis and potential treatment. This article pays attention to the research of human brain structure, reviews the research progress of human brain structure and the structural mechanism of neurodegenerative diseases, and discusses the problems and prospects in the field.
