26356679|a|The aim of the present study was to investigate the antioxidant activity and protective potential of T. tetraptera extracts against ion toxicity. The antioxidant activity of the extracts was investigated spectrophotometrically against several radicals (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH( )), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS( )), hydroxyl radical (HO( )), and nitric oxide (NO( ))), followed by the ferric reducing power, total phenols, flavonoid, and flavonol contents. The effects of the extracts on catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase activities were also determined using the standard methods as well as the polyphenol profile using HPLC. The results showed that the hydroethanolic extract of T. tetraptera (CFH) has the lowest IC50 value with the DPPH, ABTS, OH, and NO radicals. The same extract also exhibited the significantly higher level of total phenols (37.24 +- 2.00 CAE/g dried extract); flavonoids (11.36 +- 1.88 QE/g dried extract); and flavonols contents (3.95 +- 0.39 QE/g dried extract). The HPLC profile of T. tetraptera revealed that eugenol (958.81 +- 00 mg/g DW), quercetin (353.78 +- 00 mg/g DW), and rutin (210.54 +- 00 mg/g DW) were higher in the fruit than the bark extracts. In conclusion, extracts from T. tetraptera may act as a protector against oxidative mediated ion toxicity.
