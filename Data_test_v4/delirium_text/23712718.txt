23712718|t|Caregiver health: health of caregivers of Alzheimer's and other dementia patients.
23712718|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and is a significant public health problem that will intensify as the population ages. The behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) present a significant burden to patients, their families, and their caregivers. The majority of care is provided at home by family caregivers. Caring for a person with AD and other dementias is associated with significant risk to the caregiver's health and well-being. Healthcare providers must recognize that family caregivers often present as secondary patients. Given the importance of these caregivers to patients with AD and other dementias, it is vital to understand the risk factors that impact caregiver health and well-being. Non-pharmacological interventions can reduce the negative impact of caregiver burden on caregiver health, reduce premature institutionalization of patients, and improve quality of life for patients, their families, and their caregivers. This article summarizes recent relevant research concerning AD and dementia caregiver health and psychosocial interventions.
