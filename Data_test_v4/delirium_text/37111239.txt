37111239|a|Traditional medicine in Latin America and mainly in Mexico represents an essential alternative for treating different diseases. The use of plants as medicine is the product of a rich cultural tradition of the indigenous peoples, in which a great variety of species are used for the treatment of gastrointestinal, respiratory, and mental diseases and some other sicknesses; the therapeutic efficacy that they possess is due to the properties that derive from the active ingredients of plants principally antioxidants, such as phenolic compounds, flavonoids, terpenes, and tannins. An antioxidant is a substance that, at low concentrations, delays or prevents substrate oxidation through the exchange of electrons. Different methods are used to determine the antioxidant activity and the most commonly used are described in the review. Cancer is a disease in which some cells multiply uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body, a process known as metastasis. These cells can lead to the formation of tumors, which are lumps of tissue that can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). Generally, the treatment of this disease consists of surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy, which have side effects that decrease the quality of life of patients, so new treatments, focusing on natural resources such as plants, can be developed. This review aims to gather scientific evidence on the antioxidant compounds present in plants used in traditional Mexican medicine, specifically as antitumor treatment in the most common cancer types worldwide (e.g., breast, liver, and colorectal cancer).
