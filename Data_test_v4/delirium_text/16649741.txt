16649741|a|Due to involvement of multiple systems, thallium poisoning is notorious for complexity and seriousness as symptoms of toxicity are non-specific and diverse. Alopecia and painful neuropathy are its cardinal features, others being gastrointestinal disturbances, encephalopathy, tachycardia, ataxia, hepatorenal and cardiac damage etc. We report a case of thallium poisoning who presented initially with gastrointestinal symptoms and later developed neurological features (peripheral neuropathy and delirium). Various diagnoses were entertained in this case and thallium poisoning was suspected only after he developed alopecia and neuropsychosis. He made a significant recovery by conservative management in spite of delay in diagnosis. We conclude that a high level of suspicion should be kept for thallium poisoning, especially in patients with painful, peripheral neuropathy and gastrointestinal symptoms which appear earlier than alopecia, since prognosis is more rewarding with early diagnosis, leading to complete recovery.
