29580670|a|INTRODUCTION: Individuals in early stages of Alzheimer's disease are a targeted population for secondary prevention trials aimed at preserving normal cognition. Understanding within-person biomarker(s) change over time is critical for trial enrollment and design. METHODS: Longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were assayed for novel markers of neuronal/synaptic injury (visinin-like protein 1, Ng, and SNAP-25) and neuroinflammation (YKL-40) and compared with beta amyloid 42, tau, and phospho-tau181. General linear mixed models were used to compare within-person rates of change in three clinical groups (cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease) further defined by beta amyloid status. RESULTS: Levels of injury markers were highly positively correlated. Despite elevated baseline levels as a function of clinical status and amyloid-positivity, within-person decreases in these measures were observed in the early symptomatic, amyloid-positive Alzheimer's disease group. DISCUSSION: Knowledge of within-person biomarker change will impact interpretation of biomarker outcomes in clinical trials that are dependent on disease stage.
