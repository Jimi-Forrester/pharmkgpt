30453886|a|BACKGROUND: Ebola still remains as one of the most problematic infectious diseases in Africa with a high rate of mortality. Although this disease has been known for an almost half-century, there are no vaccines and drugs available in the market to treat Ebola. Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), a single-stranded RNA virus which belongs to Filoviridae family and Mononegavirales order, is one of the virus causing Ebola. As one of seven proteins that EBOV encodes, Ebola virus nucleoprotein (EBOV NP) plays an imperative role in EBOV proliferation cycle. Therefore, the development of a new Ebola treatment can be targeted towards EBOV NP. RESULTS: In this work, we screened about 190,084 natural product compounds from ZINC15 database through in silico virtual screening and flexible docking simulation. Furthermore, the bioavailability and toxicity prediction have been conducted as well. Two best ligands according to the simulation and prediction tests were progressed into the molecular dynamics simulation. CONCLUSION: In the end, we found that our proposed ligands, namely alpha-lipomycin (ZINC56874155) and 3-(((S)-1-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-5-yl)methyl)-5-((5-((5R,7S)-5,7-dihydroxy-3-oxodecyl)-2-hydroxyphenoxy) methyl)pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrrol-5-ium (ZINC85628951), showed the promising results to be developed as a lead compounds for treating Ebola. Therefore, an experimental study is required to validate their inhibition activities against EBOV NP.
