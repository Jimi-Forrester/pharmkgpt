28655611|a|BACKGROUND: Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and neuroinflammation are implicated in the pathogenesis and development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuron-enriched miR-137 was aberrantly downregulated and may be associated with the pathogenesis of AD. However, the detailed function of miR-137 in AD pathogenesis and the molecular mechanism have not been elucidated. METHODS: The expressions of miR-137 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)-induced protein 1 (TNFAIP1) at mRNA and protein levels in primary mouse cortical neurons and Neuro2a (N2a) cells exposed to different concentrations of Abeta25-35 were examined by qRT-PCR and western blot. Luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the potential target of miR-137. MTT assay, flow cytometry analysis, caspase-3 activity assay, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and western blot were used to detect cell viability, apoptosis, caspase-3 activity, Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activity and level, respectively. RESULTS: Abeta25-35 downregulated miR-137 and upregulated TNFAIP1 in primary mouse cortical neurons and N2a cells. In addition, miR-137 was found to directly target TNFAIP1 and suppress its mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, miR-137 restoration and TNFAIP1 knockdown facilitate Abeta25-35-induced cell toxicity, apoptosis, caspase-3 activity, and activated NF-kappaB in N2a cells, which was partially abolished by TNFAIP1 overexpression. CONCLUSION: miR-137 attenuated Abeta-induced neurotoxicity through inactivation of NF-kappaB pathway by targeting TNFAIP1 in N2a cells, shedding light on the molecular mechanism of miR-137 underlying Abeta-induced neurotoxicity.
