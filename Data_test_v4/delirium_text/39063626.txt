39063626|t|Mental Manifestations and Biomarkers of Alcohol Consumption.
39063626|a|The purpose of this study is to examine healthcare usage, morbidities, and alcohol consumption monitoring in patients before a diagnosis of mental manifestations to assist in the early identification of individuals at risk. Biological markers of alcoholism are separated into two groups: those biological variables that highlight with great confidence and validate the presence of a predisposition to alcoholism, also called trait markers, or those that highlight alcohol consumption, called markers of alcoholism ("status markers"). Biomarkers are the true "gold standard" for the diagnosis of alcoholism. They are valuable for tracking evolution and progress during biological and psychological therapy and for highlighting relapse. This review compiles the existing data from research on healthcare utilization, comorbidities, and alcohol consumption monitoring in patients before a diagnosis of mental manifestations to aid in the early identification of individuals at risk. This documentary study took place over three to four months by searching for terms on the Science Direct platform, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar such as alcoholism, alcohol use disorders, alcohol abuse, and biomarkers. Studies reporting on the development, characteristics, and utilization of blood biomarkers for alcohol consumption were included in the search. The initial search included a number of 11.019 articles that contained the keywords biomarkers and alcohol. Finally, a total of 50 research articles were considered. I am involved in clinical studies, meta-analyses, reviews, and case studies regarding alcohol consumption detection, as well as potential alcohol markers.
