38572166|t|Classifying breast cancer and fibroadenoma tissue biopsies from paraffined stain-free slides by fractal biomarkers in Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy.
38572166|a|Breast cancer is one of the most spread and monitored pathologies in high-income countries. After breast biopsy, histological tissue is stored in paraffin, sectioned and mounted. Conventional inspection of tissue slides under benchtop light microscopes involves paraffin removal and staining, typically with H&E. Then, expert pathologists are called to judge the stained slides. However, paraffin removal and staining are operator-dependent, time and resources consuming processes that can generate ambiguities due to non-uniform staining. Here we propose a novel method that can work directly on paraffined stain-free slides. We use Fourier Ptychography as a quantitative phase-contrast microscopy method, which allows accessing a very wide field of view (i.e., mm2) in one single image while guaranteeing high lateral resolution (i.e., 0.5 microm). This imaging method is multi-scale, since it enables looking at the big picture, i.e. the complex tissue structure and connections, with the possibility to zoom-in up to the single-cell level. To handle this informative image content, we introduce elements of fractal geometry as multi-scale analysis method. We show the effectiveness of fractal features in describing and classifying fibroadenoma and breast cancer tissue slides from ten patients with very high accuracy. We reach 94.0 +- 4.2% test accuracy in classifying single images. Above all, we show that combining the decisions of the single images, each patient's slide can be classified with no error. Besides, fractal geometry returns a guide map to help pathologist to judge the different tissue portions based on the likelihood these can be associated to a breast cancer or fibroadenoma biomarker. The proposed automatic method could significantly simplify the steps of tissue analysis and make it independent from the sample preparation, the skills of the lab operator and the pathologist.
