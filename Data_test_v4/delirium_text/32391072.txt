32391072|a|BACKGROUND: Ginsenosides are pharmacologically active compounds that are often extracted from the Panax plant for their medicinal properties. Ginsenosides have multiple effects, including antitumor effects which have been widely studied. In recent years, studies have found that ginsenosides promote proliferation and osteogenesis of osteoblast-related cells, as well as inhibit the activity of osteoclasts. MAIN BODY: We briefly introduces the molecules and BMP, WNT, and RANKL signalling pathways involved in bone formation and bone resorption. Next, recent studies on the mechanism of action of ginsenosides in bone remodelling are reviewed from three perspectives: the effects on proliferation of osteoblast-related cells, effects on osteogenesis and effects on osteoclasts. To expedite the development of drugs containing ginsenosides, we summarize the multiple beneficial roles of various types of ginsenosides in bone remodelling; including the promotion of bone formation, inhibition of bone resorption, and anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. CONCLUSION: Many ginsenosides can promote bone formation and inhibit bone resorption, such as Rb1, Rb2 and Re. Ginsenosides have the potential to be new drugs for the treatment of osteoporosis, promote fracture healing and are strong candidates for cytokines in the tissue-engineered bone. This review provides a theoretical basis for clinical drug applications and proposes several future directions for exploring the beneficial role of ginseng compounds in bone remodelling.
