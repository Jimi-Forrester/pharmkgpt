35479489|t|Sex Modulates the Pathological Aging Effect on Caudate Functional Connectivity in Mild Cognitive Impairment.
35479489|a|Purpose: To assess the pathological aging effect on caudate functional connectivity among mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants and examine whether and how sex and amyloid contribute to this process. Materials and Methods: Two hundred and seventy-seven functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions from 163 cognitive normal (CN) older adults and 309 sessions from 139 participants with MCI were included as the main sample in our analysis. Pearson's correlation was used to characterize the functional connectivity (FC) between caudate nuclei and each brain region, then caudate nodal strength was computed to quantify the overall caudate FC strength. Association analysis between caudate nodal strength and age was carried out in MCI and CN separately using linear mixed effect (LME) model with covariates (education, handedness, sex, Apolipoprotein E4, and intra-subject effect). Analysis of covariance was conducted to investigate sex, amyloid status, and their interaction effects on aging with the fMRI data subset having amyloid status available. LME model was applied to women and men separately within MCI group to evaluate aging effects on caudate nodal strength and each region's connectivity with caudate nuclei. We then evaluated the roles of sex and amyloid status in the associations of neuropsychological scores with age or caudate nodal strength. An independent cohort was used to validate the sex-dependent aging effects in MCI. Results: The MCI group had significantly stronger age-related increase of caudate nodal strength compared to the CN group. Analyzing women and men separately revealed that the aging effect on caudate nodal strength among MCI participants was significant only for women (left: P = 6.23 x 10-7, right: P = 3.37 x 10-8), but not for men (P > 0.3 for bilateral caudate nuclei). The aging effects on caudate nodal strength were not significantly mediated by brain amyloid burden. Caudate connectivity with ventral prefrontal cortex substantially contributed to the aging effect on caudate nodal strength in women with MCI. Higher caudate nodal strength is significantly related to worse cognitive performance in women but not in men with MCI. Conclusion: Sex modulates the pathological aging effects on caudate nodal strength in MCI regardless of amyloid status. Caudate nodal strength may be a sensitive biomarker of pathological aging in women with MCI.
