38526953|a|This study investigated the sensory nerve function in people with different subtypes of Parkinson's disease (PD), which included the tremor-dominant (TD) group (n = 30), postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) group (n = 33), and healthy-controls (HC) group (n = 33). Sural nerve's current perception threshold (CPT) and pain tolerance threshold (PTT) in both feet were measured at different frequencies. Results were evaluated using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Hoehn Yahr scale (H-Y), and 3-meter timed-up-and-go-test (TUGT). The MMSE scores of the TD and HC groups were higher than those of the PIGD group (TD < HC). The 3-meter TUGT scores of the PIGD group were higher than theTD and HC groups (TD > HC). The PIGD patients experienced a significantly shorter disease duration and higher H-Y score than the TD patients (P<0.05). The values of 2 KHz CPT of left-side (CPTL), 2KHz CPT of right-side (CPTR), and 5Hz CPTR in the PIGD group were significantly higher compared to the TD and HC groups (P<0.05, Bonferroni correction). Additionally, the values of 250Hz CPTL, 5Hz CPTL, 250Hz CPTR, 2 kHz PTT of left-side (PTTL), 250Hz PTTL, and 5Hz PTTL in the PIGD group were significantly elevated relative to the TD group (P<0.05, Bonferroni correction). Distinctive current threshold perception and PTT of the sural nerve can be observed in patients with varying PD subtypes, and sensory nerve conduction threshold electrical diagnostic testing can detect these discrepancies in sensory nerve function.
