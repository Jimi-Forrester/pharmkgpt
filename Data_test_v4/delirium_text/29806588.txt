29806588|t|Content of nitric oxide and glycative compounds in cured meat products-Negative impact upon health.
29806588|a|The content of nitric oxide (NO), 3-nitrotyrosine, advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) and trans fatty acids (TFAs) in 16 kinds of cured meat products was examined. Results showed that NO and 3-nitrotyrosine levels were in the range of non-detectable to 4.6 muM/mg protein, and non-detectable to 0.49 nmol/mg protein, respectively. Carboxymethyllysine could be detected in 13 kinds of cured meat products; its content was in the range of 48-306 mug/100 g meat. Pentosidine was found in 14 kinds of meat products, in the range of 109-631 mug/100 g meat. Furosine was presented in all test meat samples, in the range of 156-676 mug/100 g meat. Palmitelaidic acid was found in 3 kinds of meat product, and the content was in the range of 0.59-0.71%. Vaccenic acid was presented in 9 kinds of meat products; its content was in the range of 0.89-1.47%. Elaidic acid was detected in 5 kinds of meat products, and the content was in the range of 0.67-1.21%. Because NO, 3-nitrotyrosine and AGEs might have adverse impact upon health, people with certain healthy conditions should carefully consider the frequency and amount of consumption for these cured meat products.
