39259053|a|Evidence from observational researches have suggested that mental diseases are able to affect thyroid diseases. However, the causal relationship between mental diseases and the risk of thyroid diseases still remains unclear. Herein, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) statistical analysis method to assess the causality between mental diseases and thyroid diseases. Initially, publicly available genome-wide association studies summary data were leveraged to obtain single-nucleotide polymorphisms based on set parameters. Subsequently, a two-sample MR was utilized to analyze causal relationships between mental diseases (Alzheimer disease, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Parkinson disease, schizophrenia) and thyroid diseases (hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism) with removing outliers based on MR-PRESSO method. Finally, 8 regression MR methods (inverse variance weighted [IVW], IVW fixed effects, c, MR Egger, weighted median, penalized weighted median, simple mode, weighted mode) were performed to evaluate bias and effectiveness, of which IVW was considered as the primary method. Our results demonstrated that most of mental diseases have no causal relationships with thyroid diseases except bipolar disorder and hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis based on IVW method [odds ratio: 0.999, 95% confidence interval: 0.998-1.000, P = .028], and bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism based on IVW method [odds ratio: 0.997, 95% confidence interval: 0.995-0.999, P = .002]. Then we subsequently conducted a consistent robustness analysis to assess heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. Our method reports causal relationships exist mental diseases and the risk of thyroid diseases. Subsequent researches are still warranted to determine how mental diseases influence the development of thyroid diseases.
