38645987|t|Clinical Application and Research Progress of Remimazolam for Pediatric Patients.
38645987|a|Remimazolam is a novel ultrashort-acting benzodiazepine that allosterically modulates gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors to exert sedative effects. Remimazolam has the properties of controllable sedation, rapid onset, and a short duration of action, along with minor depression of circulation and respiration. Remimazolam has been approved for clinical use since 2020 in Japan, and it has been applied for procedural sedation, general anesthesia induction and maintenance, and sedation in ICU patients, and has been proven to be safe and effective. Currently, no consensus has been reached on the clinical application of remimazolam in pediatric patients. This review introduces the clinical research progress and limitations of remimazolam in recent years, aiming to supply scientific guidance and a theoretical reference for the application of remimazolam in pediatric anaesthesia.
