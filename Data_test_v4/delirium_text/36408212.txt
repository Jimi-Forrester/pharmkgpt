36408212|a|Postpartum Depression (PPD) is a serious psychiatric disorder of women within the first year after delivery. It grievously damages women's physical and mental health. Inflammatory reaction theory is well-established in depression, and also has been reported associated with PPD. This review summarized the inflammatory pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in PPD, including decreased T cell activation, increased proinflammatory cytokines secretion, active kynurenine pathway, and initiated NLRP3 inflammasome. Clinical and preclinical research are both gathered. Potential therapeutical alternatives targeting the inflammatory mechanisms of PPD were introduced. In addition, this review briefly discussed the differences of inflammatory mechanisms between PPD and depression. The research of inflammation in PPD is limited and seems just embarking, which indicates the direction we can further study. As a variety of risky factors contribute to PPD collectively, therapy for women with PPD should be comprehensive, and clinical heterogeneity should be taken into consideration. As PPD has a predictability, early clinical screening and interventions are also needed. This review aims to help readers better understand the inflammatory pathological mechanisms in PPD, so as to identify biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in the future.
