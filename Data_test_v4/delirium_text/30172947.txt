30172947|t|Commentary on the 2018 Named Series on blood-brain interfaces: Roles of neuroimmunomodulation in health and disease.
30172947|a|This year's 2018 Named Series on blood-brain interfaces highlights the importance of brain barriers as mediators of neuroimmune communication and regulators of neurological function. The term "brain interfaces" reflects our growing understanding that brain barriers such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB) are not only gatekeepers, but facilitators of bidirectional communication between the brain and periphery. There is also an emerging appreciation that CNS sites that are exposed to blood-borne immune molecules and cells, such as the leptomeninges and circumventricular organs, may also be considered brain interfaces with important homeostatic and pathological functions. The work featured in this Series covers novel aspects of brain interface functions that focus on mechanisms regulating barrier integrity and transporter activities, downstream consequences of neurovascular injury, peripheral organ infection/injury, and clearance of pathogenic proteins. Results of these studies have emphasized new mechanisms by which brain interface dysfunction could contribute to neuroinflammation and CNS damage in eclampsia, fetal and adult hypoxic/ischemic injury, traumatic brain injury, Helicobacter infections, acute lung injury, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. This body of work emphasizes that brain interfaces may themselves be important therapeutic targets for a variety of CNS diseases that are associated with immune dyshomeostasis. Future works are warranted to further investigate brain interface functions in health and disease.
