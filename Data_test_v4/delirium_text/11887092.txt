11887092|a|In this article we describe the role of compression of the vertebral, subclavian, internal mammary, internal carotid arteries, brachial plexus and coiling and kinking of the vertebral and basilar arteries, the faulty irrigation of blood supply and oxygen of the cerebellum and basal ganglia and other areas of the brain followed by metabolic processes. Among the effects are: a decrease in the secretion of dopamine at the level of the putamen, which produces the symptoms of symptomatic Parkinson's disease, chorea due to chronic transitory faulty blood supply and oxygen to the caudate nucleus, ballism by hypoxia at the level of sub-thalamic and thalamus nuclei and athetosis in the lenticular nucleus. This compression is caused by hypertrophy of the anterior scalenus muscles and the cervical ribs at the level of the vertebrae C6-C7; by the sternocleidomastoid at the level of the cervical atlas, by the pectoralis minor muscles and coiling and kinking of the vertebral, basilar and the internal carotid arteries. The decreased blood supply to the cerebellum and basal ganglia is the cause of the cerebral thoracic neuro vascular syndrome (CTNVS) and its neurological complications, among which are ipsilateral paralysis, symptomatic Parkinson's disease, functional Alzheimer's disease multiple sclerosis and others. We are presently engaged in genetic studies to widen our understanding of these illness.
