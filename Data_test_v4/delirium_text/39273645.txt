39273645|t|Alzheimer's Disease Pathology and Assistive Nanotheranostic Approaches for Its Therapeutic Interventions.
39273645|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) still prevails and continues to increase indiscriminately throughout the 21st century, and is thus responsible for the depreciating quality of health and associated sectors. AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by a significant amassment of beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles near the hippocampus, leading to the consequent loss of cognitive abilities. Conventionally, amyloid and tau hypotheses have been established as the most prominent in providing detailed insight into the disease pathogenesis and revealing the associative biomarkers intricately involved in AD progression. Nanotheranostic deliberates rational thought toward designing efficacious nanosystems and strategic endeavors for AD diagnosis and therapeutic implications. The exceeding advancements in this field enable the scientific community to envisage and conceptualize pharmacokinetic monitoring of the drug, sustained and targeted drug delivery responses, fabrication of anti-amyloid therapeutics, and enhanced accumulation of the targeted drug across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), thus giving an optimistic approach towards personalized and precision medicine. Current methods idealized on the design and bioengineering of an array of nanoparticulate systems offer higher affinity towards neurocapillary endothelial cells and the BBB. They have recently attracted intriguing attention to the early diagnostic and therapeutic measures taken to manage the progression of the disease. In this article, we tend to furnish a comprehensive outlook, the detailed mechanism of conventional AD pathogenesis, and new findings. We also summarize the shortcomings in diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic approaches undertaken to alleviate AD, thus providing a unique window towards nanotheranostic advancements without disregarding potential drawbacks, side effects, and safety concerns.
