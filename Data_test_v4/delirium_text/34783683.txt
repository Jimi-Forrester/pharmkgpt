34783683|a|BACKGROUND: Virtual reality and hypnosis are little studied in complex contexts, such as intensive care, where patients need significant physical and psychological assistance. OBJECTIVES: To compare and combine hypnosis and virtual reality benefits on anxiety and pain on patients before and after cardiac surgery. DESIGN: Prospective randomised controlled clinical trial. SETTING: The study was conducted in the University Hospital of Liege (Belgium) from October 2018 to January 2020. PATIENTS: One hundred patients (66 +- 11.5 years; 24 women, 76 men) were included. Participants were adults undergoing cardiac surgery. Exclusion criteria: psychiatric diseases, claustrophobia, acrophobia, hearing loss, visual impairment, extreme fatigue, confusion surgery cancelled. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to four arms (control; hypnosis; virtual reality; virtual reality hypnosis) and had 20 min of one of the techniques the day before and the day after surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Anxiety, pain, fatigue, relaxation, physiological parameters, and opioid use were evaluated before and after each session. RESULTS: The main results did not show any significant differences between the groups. In all groups, anxiety decreased and pain increased from baseline to the postoperative day. Relaxation increased in all groups in the pre-operative (P < 0.0001) and postoperative period (P = 0.03). There were no significant differences for fatigue, physiological measures, or opioid use. CONCLUSION: As there were no significant differences between groups for the measured variables, we cannot affirm that one technique is better than another. Additional studies are required to compare and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these techniques for critical care patients and caregivers.
