36348262|t|Role of tRNA-Derived Fragments in Neurological Disorders: a Review.
36348262|a|tRFs are small tRNA derived fragments that are emerging as novel therapeutic targets and regulatory molecules in the pathophysiology of various neurological disorders. These are derived from precursor or mature tRNA, forming different subtypes that have been reported to be involved in neurological disorders like stroke, Alzheimer's, epilepsy, Parkinson's, MELAS, autism, and Huntington's disorder. tRFs were earlier believed to be random degradation debris of tRNAs. The significant variation in the expression level of tRFs in disease conditions indicates their salient role as key players in regulation of these disorders. Various animal studies are being carried out to decipher their exact role; however, more inputs are required to transform this research knowledge into clinical application. Future investigations also call for high-throughput technologies that could help to bring out the other hidden aspects of these entities. However, studies on tRFs require further research efforts to overcome the challenges posed in quantifying tRFs, their interactions with other molecules, and the exact mechanism of function. In this review, we are abridging the current understanding of tRFs, including their biogenesis, function, relevance in clinical therapies, and potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of these neurological disorders.
