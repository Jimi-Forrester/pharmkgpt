30597615|a|Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases risk of dementia, a relationship that may be mediated by amyloid-beta (Abeta) and downstream Alzheimer disease pathology. We previously showed that OSA may impair Abeta clearance and affect the relationship between slow wave activity (SWA) and Abeta. In this study, SWA and CSF Abeta were measured in participants with OSA before and 1 to 4 months after treatment. OSA treatment increased SWA, and SWA was significantly correlated with lower Abeta after treatment. Greater improvement in OSA was associated with greater decreases in Abeta. We propose a model whereby OSA treatment may affect both Abeta release and clearance. Ann Neurol 2018 ANN NEUROL 2019;85:291-295.
