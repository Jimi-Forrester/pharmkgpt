37529150|t|Impact of Abrupt Interruption of Home Psychotropic Medications at ICU Admission.
37529150|a|Background: Abrupt discontinuation of home psychotropic medications is common among critically ill patients but may precipitate clinically significant withdrawal. Objective: To determine the percent of patients with interruptions in home psychotropic medications upon intensive care unit (ICU) admission and to identify outcomes associated with these interruptions. Methods: This was an institutional review board-approved, single-center, retrospective study of critically ill patients with a history of mental illness taking an antipsychotic or antidepressant medication. The primary outcome was the percent of patients with interruption in at least one home psychotropic medication for >=24 hours upon ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included time to psychotropic re-initiation, percent of home psychotropic medications restarted in the ICU, ICU length of stay (LOS), delirium, withdrawal-related complications, need for acute antipsychotics or benzodiazepines, and reasons for psychotropic interruption. Results: Among 183 patients, 93 (50.8%) had interruptions in home psychotropic therapy for >=24 hours upon ICU admission. Mean time to reinitiation of at least one psychotropic agent was 1.4 days, and 16.4% of patients did not have any home psychotropics restarted. Patients with psychotropic interruption had a longer ICU LOS (P = 0.01) and greater incidence of ICU delirium (P < 0.01). Withdrawal-related complications were similar between groups. Acute antipsychotic use was greater in patients with psychotropic interruption (P < 0.01). Acute benzodiazepine use was not different between groups (P = 0.87). Most patients did not have a documented reason for therapy interruption. Conclusion and Relevance: Unless contraindicated, clinicians should attempt to restart home psychotropic medications as soon as possible in critically ill patients.
