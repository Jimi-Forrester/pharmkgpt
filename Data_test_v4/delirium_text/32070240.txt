32070240|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative brain disorder. It is characterized by the presence of extracellular aggregated fibrillary form of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles caused by the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. Monomeric form of Abeta peptide in alpha-conformation is not toxic but it can undergo self-aggregation to form beta-conformation which is neurotoxic. The most promising approach to combat AD is to prevent the self-aggregation of Abeta peptide. Recently, it has been reported that C-terminal (CTerm) of human albumin (HA) binds to the Abeta1-42 peptide and impairs the Abeta1-42 aggregation and promotes disassembly of Abeta1-42 aggregates. In this work, using potential of mean force (PMF) and binding free energy (BFE) calculations, we have demonstrated the effect of CTerm of HA on the dimerization of Abeta1-42 peptide. From the PMF profile, we noticed Abeta1-42-CTerm Heterodimer (10.99 kcal mol - 1) complex to have higher disassociation energy than Abeta1-42-Abeta1-42 homodimer (2.23 kcal mol - 1) complex. And also from the BFE calculations, we found that the binding affinity between Abeta1-42 peptide and CTerm (DeltaGbind = -32.27 kcal mol - 1 from MM-GBSA and DeltaGbind = -2.83 kcal mol - 1 from MM-PBSA (molecular mechanics-Poisson - Boltzmann surface area)) to be stronger than the Abeta1-42 peptide and another Abeta1-42 peptide (DeltaGbind = -16.20 kcal mol - 1 from MM-GBSA and DeltaGbind = -1.95 kcal mol - 1 from MM-PBSA). In this study, our findings from PMF and BFE analysis of the two complexes provide salient structural, binding and unbinding features and thermodynamics that support the ability of CTerm of HA in affecting the dimerization of Abeta1-42.
