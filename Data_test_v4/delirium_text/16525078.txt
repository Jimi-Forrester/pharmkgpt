16525078|t|Frequency of delirium in a neurological emergency room.
16525078|a|The authors present a cross-sectional survey designed to evaluate the presence of delirium in patients with neurological emergencies. Two hundred and two patients were included in the study: 14.9% of subjects had delirium; 62.4% had no arousal disturbances; and 22.7% presented a coma or stupor state. Findings revealed that the presence of a cerebral infection, the presence of multiple etiologies, and the location of lesions in the frontal and temporal lobes were all associated with delirium. Results substantiate that delirium is a frequent occurrence in neurological patients and that the presence of multiple etiologies must be investigated in each patient.
