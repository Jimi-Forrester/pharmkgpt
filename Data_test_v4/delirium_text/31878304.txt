31878304|t|Combining Chalcones with Donepezil to Inhibit Both Cholinesterases and Abeta Fibril Assembly.
31878304|a|The fact that the number of people with Alzheimer's disease is increasing, combined with the limited availability of drugs for its treatment, emphasize the need for the development of novel effective therapeutics for treating this brain disorder. Herein, we focus on generating 12 chalcone-donepezil hybrids, with the goal of simultaneously targeting amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides as well as cholinesterases (i.e., acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE)). We present the design, synthesis, and biochemical evaluation of these two series of novel 1,3-chalcone-donepezil (15a-15f) or 1,4-chalcone-donepezil (16a-16f) hybrids. We evaluate the relationship between their structures and their ability to inhibit AChE/BChE activity as well as their ability to bind Abeta peptides. We show that several of these novel chalcone-donepezil hybrids can successfully inhibit AChE/BChE as well as the assembly of N-biotinylated Abeta(1-42) oligomers. We also demonstrate that the Abeta binding site of these hybrids differs from that of Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB).
