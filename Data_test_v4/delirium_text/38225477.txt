38225477|t|The Association Between Intraoperative Compromised Intestinal Integrity and Postoperative Complications in Cancer Patients.
38225477|a|BACKGROUND: Because of perioperative splanchnic hypoperfusion, the gut wall becomes more permeable for intraluminal microbes to enter the splanchnic circulation, possibly contributing to development of complications. Hypoperfusion-related injured enterocytes release intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) into plasma, which is used as proxy of intestinal integrity. This study investigates the occurrence of intestinal integrity loss during oncologic surgery, measured by I-FABP change. Secondary the relationship between compromised intestinal integrity, and related variables and complications were studied. METHODS: Patients undergoing oncologic surgery from prospective cohort studies were included. Urine I-FABP samples were collected preoperatively (T0) and at wound closure (T1), and in a subgroup on Day 1 (D1) and Day 2 (D2) postoperatively. I-FABP dynamics were investigated and logistic regression analyses were performed to study the association between I-FABP levels and patient-related, surgical variables and complications. RESULTS: A total of 297 patients were included with median age of 70 years. Median I-FABP value increased from 80.0 pg/mL at T0 (interquartile range [IQR] 38.0-142.0) to 115 pg/mL at T1 (IQR 48.0-198.0) (p < 0.05). Age (odds ratio [OR] 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.08) and anesthesia time (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.25) were related to stronger I-FABP increase. When comparing I-FABP change in patients experiencing any complications versus no complications, relative I-FABP change at T1 was 145% of T0 (IQR 86-260) versus 113% (IQR 44-184) respectively (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A significant change in I-FABP levels was seen perioperatively indicating compromised intestinal integrity. Age and anesthesia time were related to higher I-FABP increase. In patients experiencing postoperative complications, a higher I-FABP increase was found.
