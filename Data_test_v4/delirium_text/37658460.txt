37658460|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with pulmonary nodules (PNs) often suffer from the psychological burden of their disease and trap in sleep problems. This is insufficiently identified and addressed in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychological distress and sleep quality among PN patients and identify potential risk or protective factors for sleep quality. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study, which included 731 PN patients who visited the thoracic clinic of Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital. Each participant completed a structured questionnaire consisting of demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The reliability of the HADS (Cronbach's alpha = 0.944) and PSQI (Cronbach's alpha = 0. 0.757) in this study was satisfactory. RESULTS: A total of 328 patients (44.9%) had PSQI global scores > 5, indicating poor quality of sleep. Age >= 50 years (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.35-2.58; P < 0.001), female (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.05-2.33; P = 0.028), detection of nodule for 7-12 months (vs for more than 24 months, OR 2.14, 95%CI 1.18-3.89, P = 0.013), anxiety (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.17-2.71; P = 0.007) and depression (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.16-2.92; P = 0.010) were independent risk factors for impaired sleep quality. A significant correlation revealed that sleep quality was positively correlated with both anxiety and depression (Spearman r = 0.342, P < 0.001 and Spearman r = 0.314, P < 0.001, respectively). All dimensions of the PSQI scale were significantly decreased in both anxiety group and depression group compared to the psychologically normal group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Impaired sleep quality is highly prevalent among patients with PNs and associated with age, gender, time from the date of detection, anxiety and depression. Based on the finding of impaired sleep quality and psychological health, screening for psychological and sleep problems in PN patients will be of great clinical benefit.
