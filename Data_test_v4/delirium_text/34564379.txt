34564379|t|Insecticide Exposure and Risk of Asthmatic Symptoms: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
34564379|a|The incidence of respiratory disease is increasing. In relation to this, in addition to infection, factors associated with working with chemical insecticides are a cause for concern. Some of the chemicals involved have been shown to affect the respiratory system, and consequentially workers are at increased risk of conditions such as asthma. However, medical opinion around this area is still controversial; therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the association between exposure to insecticides and asthma by means of a systematic review of the relevant literature. Relevant literature was identified, and a systematic review was conducted to investigate the association between exposure to insecticides and asthma. A total of five studies (three cross sectional and two cohort) including 45,435 subjects were identified as relevant. The summary odds ratios related to the impact of exposure to specific insecticides on asthma were organophosphates 1.31 (95%CI = 1.17-1.48, I2 = 27%, p = 0.172), carbamates 1.44 (95%CI 1.08-1.92, I2 = 56.7%, p = 0.031) and organochlorines 1.31 (95%CI 1.19-1.64, I2 = 37.3%, p = 0.131). Farmers exposed to certain insecticides may have an increased risk of asthma and asthmatic symptoms, but further research on that issue is urgently needed.
