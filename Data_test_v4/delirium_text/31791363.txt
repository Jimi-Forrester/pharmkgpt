31791363|a|BACKGROUND: Schaaf-Yang syndrome (SYS) is a newly recognized imprinting related syndrome, which is caused by a truncating variant in maternally imprinted MAGEL2 located in 15q11-q13. Yet, precise pathomechanism remains to be solved. We sequenced MAGEL2 in patients suspected Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) to delineate clinical presentation of SYS. We examined 105 patients with clinically suspected PWS but without a specific PWS genetic alteration. Sanger sequencing of the entire MAGEL2 gene and methylation-specific restriction enzyme treatment to detect the parent of origin were performed. Clinical presentation was retrospectively assessed in detail. RESULTS: Truncating variants in MAGEL2 were detected in six patients (5.7%), including a pair of siblings. All truncating variants in affected patients were on the paternally derived chromosome, while the healthy father of the affected siblings inherited the variant from his mother. Patients with MAGEL2 variants shared several features with PWS, such as neonatal hypotonia, poor suck, and obesity; however, there were also unique features, including arthrogryposis and a failure to acquire meaningful words. Additionally, an episode of neurological deterioration following febrile illness was confirmed in four of the six patients, which caused severe neurological sequalae. CONCLUSIONS: SYS can be present in infants suspected with PWS but some unique features, such as arthrogryposis, can help discriminate between the two syndromes. An episode of neurological deterioration following febrile illness should be recognized as an important complication.
