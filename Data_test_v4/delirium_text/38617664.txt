38617664|t|Identification of Novel Quinolone and Quinazoline Alkaloids as Phosphodiesterase 10A Inhibitors for Parkinson's Disease through a Computational Approach.
38617664|a|Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are vital in signal transduction, specifically by hydrolyzing cAMP and cGMP. Within the PDE family, PDE10A is notable for its prominence in the striatum and its regulatory function over neurotransmitters in medium-spiny neurons. Given the dopamine deficiency in Parkinson's disease (PD) that affects striatal pathways, PDE10A inhibitors could offer therapeutic benefits by modulating D1 and D2 receptor signaling. This study was motivated by the successful history of quinazoline/quinazoline scaffolds in the inhibition of PDE10A. This study involved detailed in silico evaluations through docking followed by pharmacological, pharmacophoric, and pharmacokinetic analyses, prioritizing central nervous system (CNS)-active drug criteria. Seven cyclic peptides, those featuring the quinazoline/quinazoline moiety at both termini, exhibited notably enhanced docking scores compared to those of the remaining alkaloids within the screened library. We identified 7 quinolines and 1 quinazoline including Lepadin G, Aspernigerin, CJ-13536, Aurachin A, 2-Undecyl-4(1H)-quinolone, Huajiaosimuline 3-Prenyl-4-prenyloxyquinolin-2-one, and Isaindigotone that followed the standard CNS active drug criteria. The dominant quinoline ring in our study and its related quinazoline were central to our evaluations; therefore, the pharmacophoric features of these scaffolds were highlighted. The top alkaloids met all CNS-active drug properties; while nonmutagenic and without PAINS alerts, many indicated potential hepatotoxicity. Among the compounds, Huajiaosimuline was particularly significant due to its alignment with lead-likeness and CNS-active criteria. Aspernigerin demonstrated its affinity for numerous dopamine receptors, which signifies its potential to alter dopaminergic neurotransmission that is directly related to PD. Interestingly, the majority of these alkaloids had biological targets primarily associated with G protein-coupled receptors, critical in PD pathophysiology. They exhibit superior excretion parameters and toxicity end-points compared to the standard. Notably, selected alkaloids demonstrated stability in the binding pocket of PDE10A according to the molecular dynamic simulation results. Our findings emphasize the potential of these alkaloids as PDE10A inhibitors. Further experimental studies may be necessary to confirm their actual potency in inhibiting PDE10A before exploring their therapeutic potential in PD.
