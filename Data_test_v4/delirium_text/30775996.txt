We examined differences in neuropathological diagnoses of 423 deceased participants with dementia from three ethnoracial groups (35 Black, 28 Hispanic, and 360 non-Hispanic White) evaluated at the University of California Davis Alzheimer's Disease Center. We used novel applications of bootstrap resampling and logistic regression standardization to project neuropathological diagnostic rates for non-Hispanic Whites to minority sample characteristics to improve inference of findings. Alzheimer's disease (AD) without significant cerebrovascular disease (CVD) or other dementia-related pathologies (AD (non-mixed)) was present in 15 Black (43%), 4 Hispanic (14%), and 156 (43%) non-Hispanic Whites. CVD sufficient to contribute to dementia was confirmed in 14 Black (40%), 15 Hispanic (54%), and 101 (28%) non-Hispanic White decedents. The observed CVD prevalence of 40% in Blacks exceeded the predicted 29% [95% CI: 22%-36%]. Despite being outside the 95% confidence interval, the difference between observed and predicted was not statistically significant after bootstrap testing. Conversely, for Hispanics, the observed proportion at 54% exceeded significantly the predicted prevalence of 24% from non-Hispanic Whites [95% CI: 16%-34%], avg. p = 0.008). An identical analysis using AD (non-mixed) as the outcome predicted AD (non-mixed) in Blacks averaging 41% [95% CI: 34%-48%], nearly equal to observed prevalence. For Hispanics, however, the observed proportion at 14%, was well below predictions (mean = 42%, 95% CI: 32%-53%], avg. p = 0.008). We conclude mixed diagnoses and CVD are more common in Hispanic and Black decedents than Non-Hispanic Whites with dementia in our cohort. The increased prevalence of vascular co-morbidity may be a potential opportunity to intervene more effectively in dementia treatment of those individuals.
