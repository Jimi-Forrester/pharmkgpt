38144372|a|Background: Postoperative delirium (POD) presents as a serious neuropsychiatric syndrome in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCABG) surgery. This is correlated with higher mortality, cognitive decline, and increased costs. The Age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (ACCI) is recognized as an independent predictor for mortality and survival rate. The purpose of our study is to estimate the predictive value of the ACCI on the POD in patients undergoing OPCABG surgery. Methods: This prospective cohort study enrolled patients undergoing OPCABG surgery between December 2020 and May 2021 in Qilu Hospital. Patients were divided into the low-ACCI group (score, 0-3) and the high-ACCI group (score >=4) according to their ACCI scores. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and CAM were used to diagnose POD within 7 days after surgery. The general, laboratory, and clinical data of the patients were recorded and collected. The characteristic ROC curve was applied to further assess the predictive value of the ACCI for POD in patients following OPCABG surgery. Results: A total of 89 patients were enrolled, including 45 patients in the low-ACCI group and 44 patients in the high-ACCI group. The incidence of POD was higher in the high-ACCI group than in the low-ACCI group (45.5% vs. 15.6%, P = 0.003). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that the ACCI (OR, 2.433; 95% CI, 1.468-4.032; P = 0.001) was an independent risk factor for POD. The ACCI accurately predicted POD in patients following OPCABG surgery with an AUC of 0.738, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test yielded X2 = 5.391 (P = 0.145). Conclusion: The high-ACCI group showed a high incidence of POD. The ACCI was an independent factor associated with POD in patients following OPCABG surgery. In addition, the ACCI could accurately predict POD in patients following OPCABG surgery. Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier CHiCTR2100052811.
