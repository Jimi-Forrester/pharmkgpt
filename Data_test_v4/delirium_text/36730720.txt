36730720|t|Transitions: Experiences of younger persons recently diagnosed with Alzheimer-type dementia.
36730720|a|Receiving a diagnosis of dementia before the age of 65 has a huge impact on everyday life. Previously, the disease trajectory has mainly been described from the perspective of older persons. However, young persons with dementia are confronted with specific challenges, influencing the type of life-changing events, or 'critical points' that they may experience. The aim of this study was therefore to describe experiences of persons recently being diagnosed with young-onset dementia. In total, 14 participants with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (10 woman/4 men) with an average age of 59 were included in the study. Interviews were conducted within 2 months after receiving the diagnosis and analyzed using qualitative content analysis with an inductive approach, resulting in three categories: (1) A life changing moment, (2) An ongoing process, and (3) Remaining in control. The findings show that receiving such a diagnosis was experienced by participants as a life changing moment, followed by them seeking to come to terms with the diagnosis and reflecting on its meaning, in which various strategies were adopted to remain in control. The current study highlights three critical points considering the diagnosis of young-onset dementia that warrant special attention and provides insight into factors related to delay in healthy transitioning after receiving the diagnosis, as well as factors that may facilitate successful transitions.
