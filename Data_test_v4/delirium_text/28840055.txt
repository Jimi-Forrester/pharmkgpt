28840055|t|One-Year Readmission Risk and Mortality after Hip Fracture Surgery: A National Population-Based Study in Taiwan.
28840055|a|Early readmission following hip fracture (HFx) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. We conducted a survival analysis of patients with readmission within 1 year after HFx to elucidate the trend and predictors for readmission. We used Taiwan National Health Insurance Database to recruit HFx patients who underwent operations between 2000 and 2009. Patients < 60 years; with pathological fractures; involved in major traffic accidents; with previous pelvis, femur, and hip operations; or who died during the index admission were excluded. We used the Chi-square test, logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazards model to analyze variables, including age, gender, hospital stay duration, index admission time, and comorbidity on readmission. 5,442 subjects (61.2% female) met the criteria with mean age of 78.8 years. Approximately 15% and 43% HFx patients were readmitted within 30 days (early) and between 30 days and 1 year (late) after discharge, respectively. Highest readmission incidence was observed within the first 30 days. Most common causes of readmission in early and late groups were respiratory system diseases and injuries, respectively. Cox model showed male, old age, hospital stay > 9 days, Charlson Comorbidity Index >= 1, index admission during 2000-2003, and internal fixation of HFx were independent predictors of readmission. One-year mortality of the early and the late readmission groups was 44.9% and 32.3%, much higher than overall mortality which was 16.8%. Predictive factors for readmission within 1 year included male, old age, comorbidities, and longer hospital stay. One-year mortality in readmitted patients was significantly higher. HFx patients with these factors need careful follow-up, especially within 30 days after discharge.
