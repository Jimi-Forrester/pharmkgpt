38158488|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an extremely complex, heterogeneous, and multifactorial neurodegenerative disease clinically characterized by progressive memory loss and progressive decline in cognitive function. There is currently no effective treatment for the onset and/or progression of the pathophysiological diseases of AD. The global prevalence of this disease has increased in recent years due to modern lifestyle. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a drug with significant neuroprotective potential. Since plant metabolites, especially polyphenols, have important pharmacological properties acting against beta-amyloid (Abeta), Tau, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress, such phytochemicals were selected in the present research. Using the Schrodinger tool (Maestro V.13.6), the drug potency of these metabolites was studied after installation in the highly configured workstation. Among the 120 polyphenols docked, amygdalin showed notable docking values of - 11.2638, followed by eriocitrin (- 10.9569), keracyanin (- 10.7086), and amaroswerin (- 9.48126). The prominent MM-GBSA values of these molecules were - 62.8829, - 52.1914, - 68.6307, and - 63.1074, respectively. The MM-GBSA energy values demonstrated the drug stability of these molecules for beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1)-causing AD. In the absorption and distribution assessment, these phytochemicals showed significantly better values than the inhibitors CNP520. The chosen phytochemicals have been demonstrated as non-hepatotoxic; however, the BACE1 inhibitor CNP520 is hepatotoxic. In both the molecular docking and ADMET assessments, these natural chemicals have shown optimism as potential drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease. However, in order to understand the detailed biological metabolism of these compounds in AD, they need to be evaluated in in vivo studies to validate its efficacy.
