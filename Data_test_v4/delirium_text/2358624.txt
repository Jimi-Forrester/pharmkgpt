2358624|t|Metals and the liver in Alzheimer's disease. An investigation of hepatic zinc, copper, cadmium, and metallothionein.
2358624|a|Significant alterations of tissue metal levels have been reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because the liver is intimately involved in metabolism and storage of metals, it may provide a useful site for study of these metals in AD. This study compares livers in AD and controls in their concentrations of zinc, copper, cadmium, and metallothionein, a metal-binding protein important in regulation of metal metabolism. Liver tissue was obtained from 17 patients with AD and 17 age- and sex-matched controls within 12 hours of death and stored at -70 degrees C. Neuropathologic confirmation of diagnosis was available in all cases. Liver homogenates (20%) were used for metal analysis by atomic absorption spectroscopy after wet digestion. Cytosolic metallothionein levels were quantitated by the cadmium or silver saturation method. A significant decline in body and liver weight was found in patients with AD, with no significant change in liver protein or DNA concentration. Total hepatic cadmium (P less than .001) and zinc (P less than .030) concentrations were significantly elevated in AD. The Sephadex G75 chromatographic profile was altered in AD with reduction in zinc bound to metallothionein fractions and increased binding to high molecular weight fractions. These data suggest that the metabolism of cadmium and zinc is altered in AD.
