18198981|t|State of confusion: sorting out a complex medication regimen for a 79-year-old woman.
18198981|a|Patients with Alzheimer's disease and without caregiver assistance can often have difficulties in managing their medications, which can result in serious consequences. This case study depicts a 79-year-old woman who lives in an assisted living facility and is referred to a geriatric pharmacy specialist in a community pharmacy for a medication review and assistance in medication adherence. During the initial patient visit, the patient was found to have an extremely complex method for managing her medications. She also had multiple medical providers, several duplicate medications, and medications used to treat the adverse effects of other medications. Consequently, this patient had symptoms suggesting she was experiencing medication-induced delirium. This case study illustrates the valuable role of the consultant pharmacist in assisting the patient's medical providers in formulating a simpler and more efficacious medication regimen.
