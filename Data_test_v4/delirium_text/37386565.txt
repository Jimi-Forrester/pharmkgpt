37386565|a|BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused over 530 million infections to date (June 2022), with a high percentage of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. In this context, relatives have been restricted from visiting their loved ones admitted to hospital. This situation has led to an inevitable separation between patients and their families. Video communication could reduce the negative effects of such phenomenon, but the impact of this strategy on levels of anxiety, depression, and PTSD disorder in caregivers is not well-known. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study (6 October 2020-18 February 2022) at the Policlinico University Hospital in Catania, including caregivers of both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ICU patients admitted during the second wave of the pandemic. Video-calls were implemented twice a week. Assessment of anxiety, depression, and PTSD was performed at 1-week distance (before the first, T1, and before the third, video-call, T2) using the following validated questionnaires: Impact of Event Scale (Revised IES-R), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS: Twenty caregivers of 17 patients completed the study (T1 + T2). Eleven patients survived (n = 9/11 in the COVID-19 and n = 2/6 in the "non-COVID" group). The average results of the questionnaires completed by caregivers between T1 and T2 showed no significant difference in terms of CES-D (T1 = 19.6 +- 10, T2 = 22 +- 9.6; p = 0.17), HADS depression (T1 = 9.5 +- 1.6, T2 = 9 +- 3.9; p = 0.59), HADS anxiety (T1 = 8.7 +- 2.4, T2 = 8.4 +- 3.8; p = 0.67), and IES-R (T1 = 20.9 +- 10.8, T2 = 23.1 +- 12; p = 0.19). Similar nonsignificant results were observed in the two subgroups of caregivers (COVID-19 and "non-COVID"). However, at T1 and T2, caregivers of "non-COVID" patients had higher scores of CES-D (p = 0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively) and IES-R (p = 0.049 and p = 0.02, respectively), while HADS depression was higher only at T2 (p = 0.02). At T1, caregivers of non-survivors had higher scores of CES-D (27.6 +- 10.6 vs 15.3 +- 6.7, p = 0.005) and IES-R (27.7 +- 10.0 vs 17.2 +- 9.6, p = 0.03). We also found a significant increase in CES-D at T2 in ICU-survivors (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results showed that a video-call implementation strategy between caregivers and patients admitted to the ICU is feasible. However, this strategy did not show an improvement in terms of the risk of depression, anxiety, and PTSD among caregivers. Our pilot study remains exploratory and limited to a small sample.
