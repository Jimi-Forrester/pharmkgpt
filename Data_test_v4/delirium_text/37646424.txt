37646424|a|The value of biomarkers, such as acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, for guiding perioperative patients suffering from postoperative delirium and/or (possibly related) postoperative cognitive dysfunction is unclear. Only recently have different biomarkers are being explored to assess postoperative delirium's occurrence and/or course. The aim of this work is to investigate whether acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase can help detect increased risks of the development and course of postoperative delirium in urological patients undergoing surgery. In total, 45 urology patients were screened. During five perioperative time points (meaning preoperative and postoperative), acetylcholinesterase or butyrylcholinesterase concentrations from serum were correlated with three perioperative postoperative delirium and two perioperative postoperative cognitive dysfunction investigations. Results showed neither a significant decline of either acetylcholinesterase or butyrylcholinesterase concentration before and after surgery, nor a significant correlation with postoperative delirium. Furthermore, significant postoperative cognitive dysfunction could not be detected in this perioperative urological collective.
