2879894|t|Somatostatin and Alzheimer's disease: a hypothesis.
2879894|a|Recent data suggest a disturbance of some brain somatostatin neurons in Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, some endocrine activities known to be regulated by somatostatin, such as growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating-hormone, somatomedins, as well as insulin and glucose metabolism, also seem to be affected in some patients. It is speculated that these changes are due to a global CNS and endocrine somatostatin defect in Alzheimer's disease and that the described endocrine imbalance may indirectly be responsible for at least part of the CNS pathology.
