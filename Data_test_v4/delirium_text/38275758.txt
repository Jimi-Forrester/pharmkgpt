38275758|t|Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S)/Polysulfides (H2Sn) Signalling and TRPA1 Channels Modification on Sulfur Metabolism.
38275758|a|Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and polysulfides (H2Sn, n >= 2) produced by enzymes play a role as signalling molecules regulating neurotransmission, vascular tone, cytoprotection, inflammation, oxygen sensing, and energy formation. H2Sn, which have additional sulfur atoms to H2S, and other S-sulfurated molecules such as cysteine persulfide and S-sulfurated cysteine residues of proteins, are produced by enzymes including 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST). H2Sn are also generated by the chemical interaction of H2S with NO, or to a lesser extent with H2O2. S-sulfuration (S-sulfhydration) has been proposed as a mode of action of H2S and H2Sn to regulate the activity of target molecules. Recently, we found that H2S/H2S2 regulate the release of neurotransmitters, such as GABA, glutamate, and D-serine, a co-agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. H2S facilitates the induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation, a synaptic model of memory formation, by enhancing the activity of NMDA receptors, while H2S2 achieves this by activating transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channels in astrocytes, potentially leading to the activation of nearby neurons. The recent findings show the other aspects of TRPA1 channels-that is, the regulation of the levels of sulfur-containing molecules and their metabolizing enzymes. Disturbance of the signalling by H2S/H2Sn has been demonstrated to be involved in various diseases, including cognitive and psychiatric diseases. The physiological and pathophysiological roles of these molecules will be discussed.
