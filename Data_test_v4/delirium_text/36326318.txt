36326318|a|BACKGROUND: Cancer cells express higher levels of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. In this study, we aimed to use memantine as a potential blocker to inhibit the action of the NMDA receptor in cancer cells in vivo in order to investigate the potential chemopreventive effect of memantine in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. METHODS: To determine the potential chemopreventive effect of the compound, mice weights, tumor volumes, spleen IL-6, and tumor DNA methylation levels were investigated. A total of 26 Balb/c female mice were allocated into three groups. G1 (n = 6): tumor control group, G2 (n = 10): low dose (5mg/kg) memantine group, G3: high dose (10 mg/kg) memantine group (n = 10). G1 was inoculated with 4T1 cells without any memantine treatment. G2 and G3 were pretreated with 5 and 10 mg/kg memantine daily intraperitoneal (ip) injection (weekend off) for 10 days, respectively. Both G2 and G3 were subdivided into two groups as G2a (n = 4) and G3a (n = 4): tumor free groups and G2b (n = 6) and G3b (n = 6) tumor bearing groups. RESULTS: Our results revealed that G3: high dose (10 mg/kg) memantine group, significantly (p = 0.0248) reduced the tumor volumes. We found that spleen IL-6 levels were significantly higher in memantine pretreated tumor free group p = 0.0204 ) We also found that high dose memantine treated tumor free group (G3a) has significantly lower genome-wide DNA methylation levels when compared to tumor control group (G1) p = 0.0012. DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study that highlights a potential chemopreventive effect of memantine in vivo in the mouse 4T1 breast tumor model. But further investigations should be carried out to explore the chemopreventive mechanism of action for memantine in cancer.
