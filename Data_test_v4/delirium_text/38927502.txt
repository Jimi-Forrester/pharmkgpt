38927502|t|The Role of Zinc in the Development of Vascular Dementia and Parkinson's Disease and the Potential of Carnosine as Their Therapeutic Agent.
38927502|a|Synaptic zinc ions (Zn2+) play an important role in the development of vascular dementia (VD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). In this article, we reviewed the current comprehension of the Zn2+-induced neurotoxicity that leads to the pathogenesis of these neuronal diseases. Zn2+-induced neurotoxicity was investigated by using immortalised hypothalamic neurons (GT1-7 cells). This cell line is useful for the development of a rapid and convenient screening system for investigating Zn2+-induced neurotoxicity. GT1-7 cells were also used to search for substances that prevent Zn2+-induced neurotoxicity. Among the tested substances was a protective substance in the extract of Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica), and we determined its structure to be like carnosine (beta-alanylhistidine). Carnosine may be a therapeutic drug for VD and PD. Furthermore, we reviewed the molecular mechanisms that involve the role of carnosine as an endogenous protector and its protective effect against Zn2+-induced cytotoxicity and discussed the prospects for the future therapeutic applications of this dipeptide for neurodegenerative diseases and dementia.
