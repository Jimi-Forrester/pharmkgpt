35127825|t|Functions and Regulation of Translation Elongation Factors.
35127825|a|Translation elongation is a key step of protein synthesis, during which the nascent polypeptide chain extends by one amino acid residue during one elongation cycle. More and more data revealed that the elongation is a key regulatory node for translational control in health and disease. During elongation, elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu, eEF1A in eukaryotes) is used to deliver aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) to the A-site of the ribosome, and elongation factor G (EF-G, EF2 in eukaryotes and archaea) is used to facilitate the translocation of the tRNA2-mRNA complex on the ribosome. Other elongation factors, such as EF-Ts/eEF1B, EF-P/eIF5A, EF4, eEF3, SelB/EFsec, TetO/Tet(M), RelA and BipA, have been found to affect the overall rate of elongation. Here, we made a systematic review on the canonical and non-canonical functions and regulation of these elongation factors. In particular, we discussed the close link between translational factors and human diseases, and clarified how post-translational modifications control the activity of translational factors in tumors.
