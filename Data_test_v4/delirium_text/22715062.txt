22715062|a|Inflammatory cytokines and beta amyloid (Abeta) induce activation of glial cells, leading to both protective and deleterious changes that are relevant for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). We have shown that astrocytes downregulate microglial cell cytotoxic activation through secretion of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta1), and there is evidence that TGFbeta1 modifies Abeta removal through the modulation of microglia. However, inflammatory activation of microglia is increased and Abeta clearance is reduced in AD patients, regardless of the fact that TGFbeta1 is increased in their nervous system. We propose that changes in TGFbeta Smad3 signal transduction could modify the regulation mediated by TGFbeta1. Here we evaluated the participation of the TGFbeta Smad3 pathway in regulation of the expression pattern of scavenger receptors (SR) and activation of microglia through nitric oxide (NO ) secretion and phagocytosis of Abeta. We found that TGFbeta1 increased SR-A by 2.4-fold and decreased SR-BI expression by 79% at 48 hr, whereas it did not change SR-MARCO or CD36 expression. In addition, we observed a 51% increase of Abeta uptake and an 83% decrease of NO  production induced by lipopolysaccharide in microglial cell cultures. Increased expression of SR-A, phagocytosis, and downregulation of NO  by TGFbeta1 were prevented by the inhibition of the TGFbeta Smad3 pathway. Our results indicate that the modulation of microglial cell activation by TGFbeta1, leading to increased clearance of Abeta and reduced cytotoxicity, is at least partially mediated by the Smad pathway.
