36555798|a|Recent studies suggest a pathogenetic association between metabolic disturbances, including type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and cognitive decline and indicate that T2DM may represent a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are a number of experimental studies presenting evidence that ranolazine, an antianginal drug, acts as a neuroprotective drug. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of ranolazine on hippocampal neurodegeneration and astrocytes activation in a T2DM rat model. Diabetes was induced by a high fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ) injection. Animals were divided into the following groups: HFD/STZ + Ranolazine, HFD/STZ + Metformin, HFD/STZ + Vehicle, NCD + Vehicle, NCD + Ranolazine and NCD + Metformin. The presence of neurodegeneration was evaluated in the hippocampal cornus ammonis 1 (CA1) region by cresyl violet staining histological methods, while astrocyte activation was assessed by western blot analysis. Staining with cresyl violet highlighted a decrease in neuronal density and cell volume in the hippocampal CA1 area in diabetic HFD/STZ + Vehicle rats, while ranolazine and metformin both improved T2DM-induced neuronal loss and neuronal damage. Moreover, there was an increased expression of GFAP in the HFD/STZ + Vehicle group compared to the treated diabetic groups. In conclusion, in the present study, we obtained additional evidence supporting the potential use of ranolazine to counteract T2DM-associated cognitive decline.
