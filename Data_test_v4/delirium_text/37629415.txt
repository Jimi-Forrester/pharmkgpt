37629415|t|Real-Life Performance and Clinical Outcomes of Portico Transcatheter Aortic Valve with FlexNav Delivery System: One-Year Data from a Single-Center Experience.
37629415|a|Significant progress has been made in both valves and delivery systems (DSs) for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures. We aimed to present one-year real-life data regarding TAVR procedures using Portico transcatheter heart valves (THVs) with new-generation, low-profile FlexNav DSs. This retrospective, single-center study enrolled 169 consecutive patients (mean age: 75.8 years, 68% females) with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR with Portico THVs and FlexNav DSs between 2020 and 2021. We evaluated safety and efficacy outcomes, following the VARC-3 consensus, periprocedurally and at 30 days and 1 year. Procedural success was observed in 95.9% of cases, and no procedural mortality occurred. At 30 days, the rates of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and neurological events were 4.7%, 3.6%, and 3.0%, respectively. Additionally, major vascular complications, acute kidney injury, and bleeding were recorded at rates of 11.2%, 14.8%, and 7.7%, respectively. The 1-year data showed all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and neurological event rates of 10.7%, 8.3%, and 7.7%, respectively. The moderate paravalvular leak and permanent pacemaker rates at 1 year were 2.6% and 12.2%, respectively. This real-life data provided evidence of positive outcomes and high technical success with Portico THVs and FlexNav DSs. Furthermore, we found low rates of mortality and neurological events, with satisfactory hemodynamic and functional results.
