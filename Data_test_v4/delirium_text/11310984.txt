11310984|a|It is suggested that the fibrillar amyloid beta peptide (A beta) in brain plays a direct role in neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease, probably through activation of reactive oxygen species formation. Free radicals and numerous neurotoxins elicit DNA damage that subsequently activates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP, EC 2.4.2.30). In this study the effect of neurotoxic fragment (25-35) of full length A beta peptide on PARP activity in adult and aged rat hippocampus was investigated. In adult (4 month old) rat hippocampus the A beta 25-35 peptide significantly enhanced PARP activity by about 80% but had no effect on PARP activity in cerebral cortex and in hippocampus from aged (24-27 month old) rats. The effect of A beta peptide was reduced by half by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine. Stimulation of glutamate receptor(s) itself enhanced PARP activity by about 80% in adult hippocampus. However, A beta 25-35 did not exert any additional stimulatory effect. These results indicate that A beta, through NO and probably other free radicals, induces activation of DNA bound PARP activity exclusively in adult but not in aged hippocampus.
