38647314|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that affects learning, memory, and cognition. Current treatments targeting amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau have shown limited effectiveness, necessitating further research on the aggregation and toxicity mechanisms. One of these mechanisms involves the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of tau, contributing to the formation of pathogenic tau aggregates, although their conformational details remain elusive. Another mechanism is ferroptosis, a type of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation-mediated cell death, which has been implicated in AD. There is a lack of therapeutic strategies that simultaneously target amyloid toxicity and ferroptosis. This study aims to explore the potential of polycatechols, PDP and PLDP, consisting of dopamine and L-Dopa, respectively, as multifunctional agents to modulate the pathological nexus between ferroptosis and AD. Polycatechols were found to sequester the labile iron pool (LIP), inhibit Abeta and tau aggregation, scavenge free radicals, protect mitochondria, and prevent ferroptosis, thereby rescuing neuronal cell death. Interestingly, PLDP promotes tau LLPS, and modulates their intermolecular interactions to inhibit the formation of toxic tau aggregates, offering a conceptually innovative approach to tackle tauopathies. This is a first-of-its-kind polymer-based integrative approach that inhibits ferroptosis, counteracts amyloid toxicity, and modulates tau LLPS to mitigate the multifaceted toxicity of AD.
