37511056|t|Synthetic Thioesters of Thiamine: Promising Tools for Slowing Progression of Neurodegenerative Diseases.
37511056|a|Thiamine (vitamin B1) is essential for the brain. This is attributed to the coenzyme role of thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) in glucose and energy metabolism. The synthetic thiamine prodrug, the thioester benfotiamine (BFT), has been extensively studied and has beneficial effects both in rodent models of neurodegeneration and in human clinical studies. BFT has no known adverse effects and improves cognitive outcomes in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. In cell culture and animal models, BFT has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that seem to be mediated by a mechanism independent of the coenzyme function of ThDP. Recent in vitro studies show that another thiamine thioester, O,S-dibenzoylthiamine (DBT), is even more efficient than BFT, especially with respect to its anti-inflammatory potency, and is effective at lower concentrations. Thiamine thioesters have pleiotropic properties linked to an increase in circulating thiamine concentrations and possibly in hitherto unidentified open thiazole ring derivatives. The identification of the active neuroprotective metabolites and the clarification of their mechanism of action open extremely promising perspectives in the field of neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric conditions. The present review aims to summarize existing data on the neuroprotective effects of thiamine thioesters and give a comprehensive account.
