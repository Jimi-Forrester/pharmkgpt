19724721|t|Delirium and antipsychotics: a systematic review of epidemiology and somatic treatment options.
19724721|a|Delirium is a very common medical condition encountered throughout the world and, undoubtedly, is one of the most frequent reasons psychiatrists are consulted by primary care physicians. Recognizing delirium and treating the underlying medical cause are the first steps in the management of this potentially fatal syndrome. The selection of an appropriate medication to target the perceptual, behavioral, and cognitive abnormalities is crucial. In addition to several of the older, typical antipsychotics, which have been found to be effective for the treatment of delirium, some of the newer, atypical antipsychotic agents have been demonstrated to be efficacious. This paper will review both the typical and atypical antipsychotics with the best evidence for efficacy and safety in the treatment of delirium. Finally, environmental treatments are discussed to present the full armamentarium of therapeutic options available to the practicing clinician.
