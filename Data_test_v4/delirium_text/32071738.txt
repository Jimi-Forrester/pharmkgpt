32071738|a|The reaction of N-phenyl-1-(pyridin-2-yl)methanimine with copper chloride dihydrate produced the title neutral complex, [CuCl2(C12H10N2)(H2O)] H2O. The CuII ion is five-coordinated in a distorted square-pyramidal geometry, in which the two N atoms of the bidentate Schiff base, as well as one chloro and a water mol-ecule, form the irregular base of the pyramidal structure. Meanwhile, the apical chloride ligand inter-acts through a strong hydrogen bond with a water mol-ecule of crystallization. In the crystal, mol-ecules are arranged in pairs, forming a stacking of symmetrical cyclic dimers that inter-act in turn through strong hydrogen bonds between the chloride ligands and both the coordinated and the crystallization water mol-ecules. The mol-ecular and electronic structures of the complex were also studied in detail using EPR (continuous and pulsed), FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy, as well as magnetization measurements. Likewise, Hirshfeld surface analysis was used to investigate the inter-molecular inter-actions in the crystal packing.
