A number of key scientific and public-policy needs identified in this document will be incorporated by the Alzheimer Study Group into a broader National Alzheimer's Strategic Plan, which will be presented to the 111th Congress and the Obama administration in March 2009. The Alzheimer's Strategic Plan is expected to include additional recommendations for governance, family support, healthcare, and delivery of social services.
