36610605|t|HSP70 mediates a crosstalk between the estrogen and the heat shock response pathways.
36610605|a|Cells respond to multiple signals from the environment simultaneously, which often creates crosstalk between pathways affecting the capacity to adapt to the changing environment. Chaperones are an important component in the cellular integration of multiple responses to environmental signals, often implicated in negative feedback and inactivation mechanisms. These mechanisms include the stabilization of steroid hormone nuclear receptors in the cytoplasm in the absence of their ligand. Here, we show using immunofluorescence, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and nascent transcripts production that the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) chaperone plays a central role in a new crosstalk mechanism between the steroid and heat shock response pathways. HSP70-dependent feedback mechanisms are required to inactivate the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) after activation. Interestingly, a steroid stimulation leads to faster accumulation of HSF1 in inactive foci following heat shock. Our results further show that in the presence of estrogen, HSP70 accumulates at HSF1-regulated noncoding regions, leading to deactivation of HSF1 and the abrogation of the heat shock transcriptional response. Using an HSP70 inhibitor, we demonstrate that the crosstalk between both pathways is dependent on the chaperone activity. These results suggest that HSP70 availability is a key determinant in the transcriptional integration of multiple external signals. Overall, these results offer a better understanding of the crosstalk between the heat shock and steroid responses, which are salient in neurodegenerative disorders and cancers.
