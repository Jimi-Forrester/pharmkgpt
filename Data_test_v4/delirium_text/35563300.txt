35563300|t|Role of Presenilin-1 in Aggressive Human Melanoma.
35563300|a|Presenilin-1 (PS-1), a component of the gamma (gamma)-secretase catalytic complex, has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in tumorigenesis. Interestingly, AD risk is inversely related to melanoma, suggesting that AD-related factors, such as PS-1, may affect melanomagenesis. PS-1 has been shown to reduce Wnt activity by promoting degradation of beta-catenin (beta-catenin), an important Wnt signaling partner. Since Wnt is known to enhance progression of different cancers, including melanoma, we hypothesized that PS-1 could affect Wnt-associated melanoma aggressiveness. Western blot results showed that aggressive melanoma cells expressed significantly lower levels of both PS-1 and phosphorylated-beta-catenin (P-beta-catenin) than nonaggressive melanoma cells. Immunohistochemistry of human melanoma samples showed significantly reduced staining for PS-1 in advanced stage melanoma compared with early stage melanoma. Furthermore, gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) treatment of aggressive melanoma cells was followed by significant increases in PS-1 and P-beta-catenin levels, suggesting impaired Wnt signaling activity as PS-1 expression increased. Finally, a significant reduction in cell migration was associated with the higher levels of PS-1 and P-beta-catenin in the GSI-treated aggressive melanoma cells. We demonstrate for the first time that PS-1 levels can be used to assess melanoma aggressiveness and suggest that by enhancing PS-1 expression, Wnt-dependent melanoma progression may be reduced.
