31454243|t|Computational Study on Structure and Aggregation Pathway of Abeta42 Amyloid Protofibril.
31454243|a|Amyloid deposits of Abeta protein in neuronal cells are known to be a major symptom of Alzheimer's disease. In particular, Abeta42 shows relatively high toxicity among the different Abeta isoforms, and its toxicity is thought to be because of its structural features. Recent ssNMR and cryo-EM experiments identified that Abeta42 shows an S-shaped triple-beta structure, in contrast to the previously suggested U-shaped beta-arch structure. In order to associate the high toxicity of Abeta42 with its structural features, it is essential to explain the conformational stability and aggregation mechanisms of this triple-beta motif. We utilized several different simulation methods, including extensive straight molecular dynamics simulation, steered molecular dynamics simulation, and replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulation. The S-shaped triple-beta motif showed remarkable structural stability because of its complex residual interactions that form stable hydrophobic cores. The triple-beta structure of Abeta42 is primarily made up of three beta-sheet regions and two hydrophobic cores formed between beta-sheet regions. Our analysis of beta-sheet rupture patterns between adjacent chains showed that its two hydrophobic cores have different degrees of stability, indicating a lock phase mechanism. Our analysis of the docking pathway of monomeric Abeta42 to the fibril motif using REMD simulations showed that each of the three beta-sheet sequences plays a distinct role in the docking process by changing their conformational features. Our results provide an understanding for the stability and consequent high toxicity of the triple-beta structure Abeta42.
