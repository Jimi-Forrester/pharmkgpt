30231520|t|d-Amino Acid Pseudopeptides as Potential Amyloid-Beta Aggregation Inhibitors.
30231520|a|A causative factor for neurotoxicity associated with Alzheimer's disease is the aggregation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide into soluble oligomers. Two all d-amino acid pseudo-peptides, SGB1 and SGD1, were designed to stop the aggregation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been carried out to study the interaction of the pseudo-peptides with both Abeta13-23 (the core recognition site of Abeta) and full-length Abeta1-42. Umbrella sampling MD calculations have been used to estimate the free energy of binding,  G, of these peptides to Abeta13-23. The highest  Gbinding is found for SGB1. Each of the pseudo-peptides was also docked to Abeta1-42 and subjected up to seven microseconds of all atom molecular dynamics simulations. The resulting structures lend insight into how the dynamics of Abeta1-42 are altered by complexation with the pseudo-peptides and confirmed that SGB1 may be a better candidate for developing into a drug to prevent Alzheimer's disease.
