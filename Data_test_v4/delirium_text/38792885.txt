38792885|t|Relationship of Hearing Loss to Parkinson's Disease, Dementia, and APOE Genotype in Adults.
38792885|a|Background: Hearing loss has been recognized as a risk factor for dementia and non-motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD). The apolipoprotein E (APOE) protein contributes to maintenance and repair of neuronal cell membranes, causing age-related disorders. This study aimed to analyze the impact of hearing loss on cognitive impairment, PD severity, and APOE gene expression in these patients. Methods: A total of 72 out-patients diagnosed with either PD or hearing loss were enrolled in this study. The hearing assessment included pure-tone audiometry, speech reception thresholds, and speech discrimination ability. Dementia was assessed by filling out the Clinical Dementia Rating and Mini-Mental State Examination questionnaires. The severity of PD was assessed using the Modified Hoehn and Yahr scale. Blood samples were tested for the gene expression of APOE. Results: Out of the 72 cases, there were 44 males and 28 females, with an average age of 64.4 +- 9.1 years. A total of 41 out of 72 cases had dementia and had a worse hearing threshold than those without dementia (47.1 +- 24.4 vs. 31.7 +- 22.1 dB, p = 0.006). A total of 58 patients were diagnosed with PD, with 14 of them classified as having severe symptoms (Modified Hoehn and Yahr scale > 2). Patients with severe PD were found to have a worse hearing threshold (49.6 +- 28.3 vs. 30.3 +- 17.8 dB, p = 0.028) and higher prevalence of dementia (12/14 vs. 18/44, p = 0.006). Among 10 individuals with the APOE epsilon4 gene, the prevalence of dementia was higher than those without the epsilon4 allele (9/10 vs. 32/62, p = 0.036). Conclusions: Hearing loss is common in severe PD and in dementia patients. Severe PD has a negative impact on the hearing threshold and cognitive dysfunction. Patients with APOE epsilon4 have a higher prevalence of dementia.
