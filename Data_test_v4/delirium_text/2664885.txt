2664885|t|Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and the central nervous system: distribution effects and possible relationship to neurological and psychiatric disorders.
2664885|a|1. NPY is a 36 amino acid tyrosine-rich peptide. It is one of the most abundant and widely distributed neuropeptides known today within the central nervous system with particularly high concentrations in the hypothalamus and in several limbic regions. 2. NPY seems to coexist with other on neurotransmitters like somatostatin, galanin, GABA and the catecholamines noradrenaline and adrenaline in discrete brain regions. 3. NPY binding sites are widely distributed in the brain. However they do not always overlap with the distribution of NPY-like immunoreactivity. 4. NPY is suggested to be involved in a large number of neuroendocrine functions, stress responses, circadian rhythms, central autonomic functions, eating and drinking behaviour, and sexual and motor behaviour. 5. Psychotropic drugs and neurotoxins can alter the NPY concentrations in discrete brain regions. 6. It is possible that NPY is related to various neurological and psychiatric illnesses, like Huntington's chorea, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, eating disorders, and major depressive illness.
