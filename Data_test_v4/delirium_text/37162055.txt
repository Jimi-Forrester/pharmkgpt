37162055|t|Development of Cancer Palliative Care in Turkey.
37162055|a|Palliative care is an important component of integrated, person-centered health care. It can be provided alone or in combination with the patient's medical treatment, not only by the palliative care team but also by the healthcare team caring for the patient. The concept of palliative care was developed in 2010 along with the establishment of the National Cancer Control Program in Turkey, and today there are many palliative care units, especially in metropolitan hospitals, that provide comprehensive palliative care. One-third of patients who come to the palliative care unit for treatment of pain, malnutrition, and respiratory problems are cancer patients. The care needs of all patients presenting to the palliative care unit are assessed, and a multidisciplinary team plans comprehensive palliative care for patients. Theoretical and practical patient care training is provided by palliative care nurses for family members or caregivers. Considering the burden of cancer as well as the increasing life expectancy at birth, it can be stated that the actual need for palliative care in Turkey will be much greater in the near future.
