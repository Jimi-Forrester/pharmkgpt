31023635|t|Validation of the O3DY French Version (O3DY-F) for the Screening of Cognitive Impairment in Community Seniors in the Emergency Department.
31023635|a|BACKGROUND: It is recommended that older patients undergo systematic mental status screening when presenting to the emergency department (ED). However, the tools available are not necessarily adapted to the ED environment, therefore, quicker and easier tools are needed. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to validate the Ottawa 3DY-French (O3DY-F) Scale as a screening tool for delirium and cognitive impairment in a French-speaking cohort. METHOD: This multicenter prospective study was conducted in four hospitals across the province of Quebec. Inclusion criteria were: age >= 65 years, ED stay >= 8 h, awaiting admission to a care unit, and independent or semi-independent in their daily living activities. Cognitive status was assessed during the initial interview using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Screening-modified (TICS-m) and the O3DY-F scale. Comparisons were made between the O3DY-F and the TICS-m and Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the O3DY-F for the detection of cognitive impairment and delirium. RESULTS: A total of 313 patients were included in this study, 139 of which had a positive O3DY-F. When compared with the CAM, the O3DY-F had a sensitivity of 84.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 60.4-96.6) and a specificity of 58.2% (95% CI 52.3-63.9) for the detection of prevalent delirium. The O3DY-F had a sensitivity of 76.2% (95% CI 66.7-84.8) and a specificity of 67.6% (95% CI 61.0-73.6) for cognitive impairment (defined as a TICS-m < 27). CONCLUSION: The O3DY-F is a useful and effective tool to screen for delirium and undetected cognitive impairment among a French-speaking cohort in the ED.
