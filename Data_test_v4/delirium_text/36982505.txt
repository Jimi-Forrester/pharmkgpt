36982505|t|Effect of Ovocystatin on Amyloid beta 1-42 Aggregation-In Vitro Studies.
36982505|a|Amyloid beta peptides (Abeta) aggregating in the brain have a potential neurotoxic effect and are believed to be a major cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD) development. Thus, inhibiting amyloid polypeptide aggregation seems to be a promising approach to the therapy and prevention of this neurodegenerative disease. The research presented here is directed at the determination of the inhibitory activity of ovocystatin, the cysteine protease inhibitor isolated from egg white, on Abeta42 fibril genesis in vitro. Thioflavin-T (ThT) assays, which determine the degree of aggregation of amyloid peptides based on fluorescence measurement, circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have been used to assess the inhibition of amyloid fibril formation by ovocystatin. Amyloid beta 42 oligomer toxicity was measured using the MTT test. The results have shown that ovocystatin possesses Abeta42 anti-aggregation activity and inhibits Abeta42 oligomer toxicity in PC12 cells. The results of this work may help in the development of potential substances able to prevent or delay the process of beta-amyloid aggregation-one of the main reasons for Alzheimer's disease.
