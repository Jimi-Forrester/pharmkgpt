33771616|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) in third ventricular area may become symptomatic relatively rarely, secondary to hemorrhage and growth or rupture into the ventricle, causing obstructive hydrocephalus, during third trimester of pregnancy. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 34+4 weeks pregnant (G4P1A2) lady was admitted to one of our satellite hospitals with one-week history of severe headache, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, and right-sided facial numbness. At presentation, she had sudden decreased level of consciousness with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) equal to 4, and bilateral fixed pupils. A brain computed tomography (CT) showed enlargement of both lateral ventricles with 2.5cm sized round hemorrhagic lesion at the right posterior thalamic region. After medical stabilization and placement of an external ventricular drain (EVD), the patient was referred for neurosurgical intervention. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a cavernous hemangioma adjacent to the right posterior wall of the third ventricle. After cesarean section and anterior interhemispheric trans-callosal approach, the mass was removed totally. However, on third postoperative day, she experienced mild hypoxia and dyspnea with fever. Chest CT-scan of the patient showed bilateral consolidation. Thereafter, COVID-19 was confirmed subsequently with positive nasopharyngeal swab testing for RT-PCR. The patient was treated as COVID-19 infection and symptoms improved on day 10 of the treatment and completely recovered. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 may promote ICH from CCM leading to obstructive hydrocephalous in our patient.
