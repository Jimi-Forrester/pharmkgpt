39214332|a|Galectin-1, a beta-galactosides-binding protein, is widely expressed in various tissues and exhibits diverse biological activities. We previously obtained following findings; 1) Diosgenin, a steroid sapogenin, promoted axonal regeneration in the brain and recovered memory deficits in a model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 5XFAD mouse; 2) Neuron-specific overexpression of Galectin-1 protein in the hippocampus recovered memory impairment and promoted axonal regeneration in the brain in 5XFAD mice; 3) Secernin-1, a counterpart and axonal guidance molecule for Galectin-1-expressing axons, was secreted from the prefrontal cortical neurons to promote axonal guidance from the hippocampus to the prefrontal cortex. However, it has never been elucidated that diosgenin signaling increase Galectin-1 and Secernin-1 or not. Here, we found that diosgenin treatment upregulated the protein level of Galectin-1 in the hippocampus both in primary cultured neurons and in 5XFAD mouse brains. In addition, diosgenin-induced upregulation of Galectin-1 was diminished by treatment of a neutralizing antibody of 1,25D3-membrane-associated rapid response steroid-binding receptor (1,25D3-MARRS), a direct binding receptor for diosgenin. Importantly, knockdown of Galectin-1 in hippocampal neurons inhibited axonal growth activity of diosgenin. Furthermore, the expression level of Secernin-1 was also increased in prefrontal cortical neurons by administration of diosgenin to 5XFAD mice. These findings suggest that diosgenin is a suitable compound to facilitate Galectin-1-Secernin-1-mediated axonal growth in the AD brain.
