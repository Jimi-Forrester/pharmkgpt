7609910|t|Apolipoprotein E allelic frequencies in patients with lobar atrophy.
7609910|a|Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification and restriction digestion of DNA extracted from brain tissues of 26 patients with clinically diagnosed and pathologically verified lobar atrophy (LA) and from blood of a further 22 patients with clinical LA. Brain tissue from 50 patients with pathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease (AD) was also examined. As has been previously reported, the ApoE E4 allele frequency was significantly increased in AD. However, no change in the frequency of ApoE alleles was found in two of the clinical and pathological forms of LA (dementia of frontal type and dementia of frontal type with motor neurone disease) although the ApoE E4 allele frequency was elevated in cases of non-fluent progressive aphasia in accordance with the presence of coincidental Alzheimer-type pathological changes.
