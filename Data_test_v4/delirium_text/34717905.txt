34717905|t|Processed Electroencephalographic Use During Anesthesia and Outcomes: Analysis of The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database.
34717905|a|BACKGROUND: This study assessed associations between processed electroencephalographic (pEEG) use during anesthesia, surgery- and anesthesia-related risk factors, and neurologic outcomes and mortality after cardiac surgery. METHODS: Drawing from The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database and its Adult Cardiac Anesthesiology Section, we identified 42 932 records for elective, urgent, and emergency cardiac surgical procedures between July 1, 2017 and December 31, 2019. Using propensity score-weighted regression analysis, we analyzed the associations between pEEG use during anesthesia on the primary outcome, postoperative delirium (POD), and secondary outcomes of stroke, encephalopathy, coma, and operative mortality. RESULTS: The rate of pEEG use during anesthesia use was 32.8% (n = 14 086), and its use was not associated with decreased odds for POD (odds ratio [OR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78-1.02) or encephalopathy (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.70-1.03). Intraoperative pEEG monitoring use was also not associated with increased odds for stroke (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.97-1.42) or coma (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 0.82-2.52). In contrast, pEEG use during anesthesia was associated with higher odds for operative mortality (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.05-1.44). This association remained significant after adjusting for POD (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.03-1.41), stroke (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.04-1.42), and encephalopathy (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.07-1.52). CONCLUSIONS: This large retrospective database study found no association between pEEG use during cardiac surgery and postoperative neurologic outcomes such as POD, stroke, encephalopathy, or coma. However, patients who underwent pEEG monitoring during anesthesia experienced higher mortality, even after adjustment for neurologic outcomes.
