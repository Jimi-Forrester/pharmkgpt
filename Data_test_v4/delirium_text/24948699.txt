METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was distributed to 9 designated cancer centers, 17 community hospitals and 73 district nurse services across 4 regions in 2008. We used the Palliative Care Knowledge Test, the Palliative Care Difficulty Scale (five-point Likert scale) and the Palliative Care Self-Reported Practices Scale (five-point Likert scale). RESULTS: In total, 2378 out of 3008 nurses (79%) responded. The knowledge, difficulty and self-reported practice scores were 51 +- 20%, 3.2 +- 0.7 and 3.7 +- 0.6, respectively. In the knowledge test, philosophy scored highest (88 +- 26%) and psychiatric problems scored lowest (37 +- 29%). In the difficulty test, alleviating symptoms scored most difficult (3.5 +- 0.8) and providing expert support scored least difficult (2.9 +- 1.3). In the self-reported practice questionnaire, pain and delirium relief were most frequently (4.0 +- 0.8) and least frequently (3.1 +- 0.9) provided, respectively. Knowledge was significantly poorer in community hospitals (P = 0.035); difficulty scores were significantly higher in community hospitals (P < 0.001) and district nurse services (P = 0.013); and self-reported practice scores were significantly poorer in community hospitals (P < 0.001) but superior in district nurse services (P < 0.001) than in designated cancer centers. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge, difficulty and self-reported practice for symptom management, particularly psychological symptoms, were insufficient, particularly in community hospitals. Education, expert support and adequate clinical experiences would help provide quality palliative care.
