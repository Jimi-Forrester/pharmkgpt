36989248|t|Longitudinal trajectories of functional recovery after hip fracture.
36989248|a|BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence regarding predictors of functional trajectories after hip fracture. We aimed to identify groups with different trajectories of functional recovery the first year after hip fracture, and to determine predictors for belonging to such groups. METHODS: This longitudinal study combined data from two large randomized controlled trials including patients with hip fracture. Participants were assessed at baseline, four and 12 months. We used the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living (NEADL) as a measure of instrumental ADL (iADL) and Barthel Index for personal ADL (pADL). A growth mixture model was estimated to identify groups of patients following distinct trajectories of functioning. Baseline characteristics potentially predicting group-belonging were assessed by multiple nominal regression. RESULTS: Among 726 participants (mean age 83.0; 74.7% women), we identified four groups of patients following distinct ADL trajectories. None of the groups regained their pre-fracture ADL. For one of the groups identified in both ADL outcomes, a steep decline in function was shown the first four months after surgery, and none of the groups showed functional recovery between four and 12 months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: No groups regained their pre-fracture ADL. Some of the patients with relatively high pre-fracture function, had a steep ADL decline. For this group there is a potential for recovery, but more knowledge and research is needed in this group. These findings could be useful in uncovering groups of patients with different functioning after a hip fracture, and aid in discharge planning.
