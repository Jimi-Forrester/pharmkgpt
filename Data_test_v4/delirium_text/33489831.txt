33489831|a|CONTEXT: Certain medications have higher chances of causing adverse effects in geriatric age group. Evidence is against prescribing these medications to the elderly. A list of such medications is called Beers criteria, which was revised by the American Geriatrics Society in 2015. AIMS: Using the Beer's list as reference, the researchers intend to find the extent and prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) in geriatric population residing in different settings. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The researchers analyzed prescription pattern of 200 individuals with age >=65 years, 100 individuals from old-age homes (OAHs) and 100 individuals from a tertiary care hospital. After collecting data, the researchers tallied each prescription with list of drugs in Beers criteria to find all the possible PIMs in both the groups. RESULTS: It was found that the average age of residents of OAHs was significantly higher (P < 0.002) than the corresponding group from a tertiary care hospital. The residents of OAHs were also a receiving significantly higher (P < 0.0001) number of PIM than their counterparts from the tertiary care hospital. The average number of PIMs prescribed to females in OAHs was also significantly higher than those in the other group. About 55% of residents of OAHs received at least one PIM, compared to just 26% in the other group. At least 27% of individuals of OAHs received two or more PIMs, compared to just 2% in a tertiary care hospital. Lorazepam was the most commonly prescribed PIM in OAHs, whereas ranitidine was the most common PIM in a tertiary care hospital. Ibuprofen was the second most common PIM, with 15% of OAHs residents receiving this drug, while none of the patients from a tertiary care hospital received ibuprofen. CONCLUSION: All the results point toward a poor prescription pattern in the residents of OAHs compared to those receiving care from a tertiary care hospital.
