38073274|t|Population-Based Characterization of the Pharmacokinetics and Food Effect of ANAVEX3-71, a Novel Sigma-1 Receptor and Allosteric M1 Muscarinic Receptor Agonist in Development for Treatment of Frontotemporal Dementia, Schizophrenia, and Alzheimer Disease.
38073274|a|Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from 28 subjects who received 5-200-mg single ascending doses of ANAVEX3-71, formerly AF710B, were analyzed to characterize the PK of ANAVEX3-71 and its M8 metabolite. PK data from 12 subjects who received 160 mg ANAVEX3-71 under fed and fasted conditions were analyzed to characterize the effect of food on the PK of the drug and its M8 metabolite. PK was characterized using the standard 2-stage approach and the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach. Dose proportionality was determined using the power model. Two- and 3-compartment linear PK models were tested for the characterization of the PK of ANAVEX3-71 and its M8 metabolite. The PK of ANAVEX3-71 is linear, dose proportional, and time invariant. The drug is rapidly eliminated with a mean (standard deviation) apparent terminal elimination half-life of 3.56 (4.09) hours, while the M8 metabolite was eliminated with a mean (standard deviation) apparent terminal elimination half-life of 6.59 (1.64) hours. The population PK model was used to investigate the effects of covariates on the PK of ANAVEX3-71 and M8. Age, weight, and creatinine clearance were not explanatory of the variability in apparent clearance and apparent volume of the central compartment of ANAVEX3-71. Food had no effect on the PK of ANAVEX3-71 and its M8 metabolite.
