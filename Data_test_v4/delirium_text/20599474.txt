20599474|t|Cerebrospinal fluid profile of amyloid beta42 (Abeta42), hTau and ubiquitin in North Indian Alzheimer's disease patients.
20599474|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, and is characterized by the degeneration of neurons and their synapses, and a higher number of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) compared with that found in non-demented individuals. Amyloid-beta-peptides (Abeta) are major components of amyloid plaques in AD brain whereas NFTs are composed of Tau and associated with ubiquitin. The aim of the present study was to analyze the levels of Abeta42, hTau (total Tau) and ubiquitin in CSF of North Indian population. CSF Abeta42, Tau and ubiquitin were measured in CSF of AD patients as well as controls using ELISA assays. Here we report low Abeta42 levels in AD patients (324.24+-76.38pg/ml) as compared to those in non-AD (NAD) (668.34+-43.13pg/ml), neurological controls (NCs) (727.28+-46.49pg/ml) and healthy controls (HCs) (976.47+-124.46pg/ml). In contrast, hTau and ubiquitin levels were significantly high (568.65+-48.89pg/ml and 36.82+-4.34ng/ml, respectively) in AD patients compared to those in NAD, NC and HC. The hTau levels were 267.37+-36.64pg/ml, 167.34+-44.27pg/ml and 107.62+-24.27pg/ml in NAD, NC and HC, respectively. Similarly, ubiquitin levels were 23.57+-2.32ng/ml, 19.76+-3.64ng/ml and 13.24+-4.56ng/ml in NAD, NC and HC, respectively. In conclusion, low Abeta42 and high Tau-ubiquitin levels were found in North Indian AD patients.
