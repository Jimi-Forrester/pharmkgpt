38178143|a|Progressive brain diseases create a huge social and economic burden on modern societies as a major cause of disability and death. Incidence of brain diseases has a significantly increasing trend and merits new therapeutic strategies. At the base of many progressive brain malfunctions is a process of unresolved, chronic inflammation. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor, MIF, is an inflammatory mediator that recently gained interest of neuro-researchers due to its varied effects on the CNS such as participation of nervous system development, neuroendocrine functions, and modulation of neuroinflammation. MIF appears to be a candidate as a new biomarker and target of novel therapeutics against numerous neurologic diseases ranging from cancer, autoimmune diseases, vascular diseases, neurodegenerative pathology to psychiatric disorders. In this review, we will focus on MIF's crucial role in neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and glioblastoma (GBM).
