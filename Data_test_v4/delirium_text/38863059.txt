38863059|a|OBJECTIVE: In gout, monosodium urate crystals are taken up by macrophages, triggering the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the maturation of IL-1beta. This study aimed to investigate the role of integrin CD11b in inflammasome activation in macrophages stimulated by MSU. METHODS: BMDM from WT and CD11b KO mice were stimulated in vitro with MSU crystals. Cellular supernatants were collected to assess the expression of the inflammatory cytokines by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blot methods. The role of integrin CD11b in MSU-induced gouty arthritis in vivo was investigated by intra-articular injection of MSU crystals. Real-time extracellular acidification rate and oxygen consumption rate of BMDMs were measured by Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer. RESULTS: We demonstrate that CD11b-deficient mice developed exacerbated gouty arthritis with increased recruitment of leukocytes in the joint and higher IL-1beta levels in the sera. In macrophages, genetic deletion of CD11b induced a shift of macrophage metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, thus decreasing the overall generation of intracellular ATP. Upon MSU stimulation, CD11b-deficient macrophages showed an exacerbated secretion of IL-1beta. Treating wild-type macrophages with a CD11b agonist, LA1, inhibited MSU-induced release of IL-1beta in vitro and attenuated the severity of experimental gouty arthritis. Importantly, LA1, was also effective in human cells as it inhibited MSU-induced release of IL-1beta by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. CONCLUSION: Our data identified the CD11b integrin as a principal cell membrane receptor that modulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation by MSU crystal in macrophages, which could be a potential therapeutic target to treat gouty arthritis in human patients.
