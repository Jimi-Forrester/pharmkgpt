24478626|t|Pin1, a new player in the fate of HIF-1alpha degradation: an hypothetical mechanism inside vascular damage as Alzheimer's disease risk factor.
24478626|a|Aetiology of neurodegenerative mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still under elucidation. The contribution of cerebrovascular deficiencies (such as cerebral ischemia/stroke) has been strongly endorsed in recent years. Reduction of blood supply leading to hypoxic condition is known to activate cellular responses mainly controlled by hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 (HIF-1). Thus alterations of oxygen responsive HIF-1alpha subunit in the central nervous system may contribute to the cognitive decline, especially influencing mechanisms associated to amyloid precursor protein (APP) amyloidogenic metabolism. Although HIF-1alpha protein level is known to be regulated by von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ubiquitin-proteasome system, it has been recently suggested that glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (Gsk-3beta) promotes a VHL-independent HIF-1alpha degradation. Here we provide evidences that in rat primary hippocampal cell cultures, HIF-1alpha degradation might be mediated by a synergic action of Gsk-3beta and peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (Pin1). In post-ischemic conditions, such as those mimicked with oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD), HIF-1alpha protein level increases remaining unexpectedly high for long time after normal condition restoration jointly with the increase of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) protein expression (70 and 140% respectively). Interestingly the Pin1 activity decreases about 40-60% and Pin1(S16) inhibitory phosphorylation significantly increases, indicating that Pin1 binding to its substrate and enzymatic activity are reduced by treatment. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that HIF-1alpha/Pin1 in normoxia are associated, and that in presence of specific Pin1 and Gsk-3beta inhibitors their interaction is reduced in parallel to an increase of HIF-1alpha protein level. Thus we suggest that in post-OGD neurons the high level of HIF-1alpha might be due to Pin1 binding ability and activity reduction which affects HIF-1alpha degradation: an event that may highlight the relevance of ischemia/HIF-1alpha as a risk factor in AD pathogenesis.
