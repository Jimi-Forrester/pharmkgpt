38840235|a|BACKGROUND: Migraine is a neurological disease with a significant genetic component and is characterized by recurrent and prolonged episodes of headache. Previous epidemiological studies have reported a higher risk of dementia in migraine patients. Neuroimaging studies have also shown structural brain atrophy in regions that are common to migraine and dementia. However, these studies are observational and cannot establish causality. The present study aims to explore the genetic causal relationship between migraine and dementia, as well as the mediation roles of brain structural changes in this association using Mendelian randomization (MR). METHODS: We collected the genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of migraine and its two subtypes, as well as four common types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia. In addition, we collected the GWAS summary statistics of seven longitudinal brain measures that characterize brain structural alterations with age. Using these GWAS, we performed Two-sample MR analyses to investigate the causal effects of migraine and its two subtypes on dementia and brain structural changes. To explore the possible mediation of brain structural changes between migraine and dementia, we conducted a two-step MR mediation analysis. RESULTS: The MR analysis demonstrated a significant association between genetically predicted migraine and an increased risk of AD (OR = 1.097, 95% CI = [1.040, 1.158], p = 7.03 x 10- 4). Moreover, migraine significantly accelerated annual atrophy of the total cortical surface area (-65.588 cm2 per year, 95% CI = [-103.112, -28.064], p = 6.13 x 10- 4) and thalamic volume (-9.507 cm3 per year, 95% CI = [-15.512, -3.502], p = 1.91 x 10- 3). The migraine without aura (MO) subtype increased the risk of AD (OR = 1.091, 95% CI = [1.059, 1.123], p = 6.95 x 10- 9) and accelerated annual atrophy of the total cortical surface area (-31.401 cm2 per year, 95% CI = [-43.990, -18.811], p = 1.02 x 10- 6). The two-step MR mediation analysis revealed that thalamic atrophy partly mediated the causal effect of migraine on AD, accounting for 28.2% of the total effect. DISCUSSION: This comprehensive MR study provided genetic evidence for the causal effect of migraine on AD and identified longitudinal thalamic atrophy as a potential mediator in this association. These findings may inform brain intervention targets to prevent AD risk in migraine patients.
