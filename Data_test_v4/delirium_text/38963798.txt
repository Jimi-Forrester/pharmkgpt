38963798|t|Consideration of T-Cell Profile in the Examination of Statin Efficacy in Inflammatory Diseases, Neurodegeneration, and Neurocognitive Performance.
38963798|a|Statins are a cornerstone in the medical management of cardiovascular disease, yet their efficacy varies greatly between individuals. In this commentary, we outline the evidence for the role of CD4+CD28null T-cell expansion as a critical moderator of the effects of statins in preventing cardiovascular events via the reduction of pathological inflammation. Given this relationship, we argue that T-cell profiles should be considered as a patient characteristic in clinical and preclinical studies examining statin efficacy in other age- and inflammation-related pathologies. We discuss the implications this may have for studies of statin use in numerous disease processes-notably, dementia and neurocognitive dysfunction-and the potential for T-cell profiles to be used as a prognosticator for statin efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis.
