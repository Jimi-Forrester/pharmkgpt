36624432|t|A prospective patient registry to monitor safety, effectiveness, and utilisation of bedaquiline in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in South Korea.
36624432|a|BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) represents a major public health concern, with an ongoing need for new effective treatments. Bedaquiline is an oral diarylquinoline that has shown encouraging treatment success and culture conversion rates in MDR-TB. METHODS: A South Korean patient registry was set up across 19 centres between 2016 and 2018 for the prospective collection of data from patients with MDR-TB who received either a bedaquiline-containing or a non-bedaquiline-containing regimen. Treatment was at the physician's discretion (bedaquiline use requiring approval by special committee) and was based on patient characteristics, disease status, and local treatment guidelines. RESULTS: The safety population included 172 patients (88 bedaquiline and 84 non-bedaquiline). The mean (standard deviation, SD) duration of follow-up was 24.3 (9.5) months. Mean (SD) durations of treatment were 5.4 (1.8) months in bedaquiline-treated patients and 15.7 (6.7) months in the non-bedaquiline group. Treatment success (cured and treatment completed according to WHO 2013 treatment outcome definitions) was achieved by 56.3% of bedaquiline-treated and 45.2% of non-bedaquiline-treated patients. Sputum culture conversion rates were 90.4% and 83.7% with and without bedaquiline, respectively. Diarrhoea and nausea were the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the bedaquiline group (27.3% [24/88] and 22.7% [20/88], respectively). The most frequent bedaquiline-related TEAEs were prolonged QT interval (10.2%; 9/88), and diarrhoea and nausea (9.1% each; 8/88). QT interval prolongation was reported in 19.3% (17/88) of bedaquiline-treated and 2.4% (2/84) of non-bedaquiline-treated patients, but bedaquiline was not discontinued for any patient for this reason. There were 13 (14.7%) and three (3.6%) deaths in the bedaquiline-treated and non-bedaquiline groups, respectively. Review of fatal cases revealed no unexpected safety findings, and no deaths were bedaquiline-related. The most common cause of death was worsening cancer (three patients). Patients in the bedaquiline group tended to have poorer baseline risk profiles than non-bedaquiline patients and were more likely to have relapsed or already failed second-line treatment. Interpretation of mortality data was complicated by high rates of loss to follow-up in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The South Korean registry findings support previous risk/benefit observations and the continued use of bedaquiline as part of combination therapy in patients with MDR-TB.
