36431261|t|Comparison of Prognostic Value of 10 Biochemical Indices at Admission for Prediction Postoperative Myocardial Injury and Hospital Mortality in Patients with Osteoporotic Hip Fracture.
36431261|a|Aim: To evaluate the prognostic impact at admission of 10 biochemical indices for prediction postoperative myocardial injury (PMI) and/or hospital death in hip fracture (HF) patients. Methods: In 1273 consecutive patients with HF (mean age 82.9 +- 8.7 years, 73.5% women), clinical and laboratory parameters were collected prospectively, and outcomes were recorded. Multiple logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic analyses (the area under the curve, AUC) were preformed, the number needed to predict (NNP) outcome was calculated. Results: Age >= 80 years and IHD were the most prominent clinical factors associated with both PMI (with cardiac troponin I rise) and in-hospital death. PMI occurred in 555 (43.6%) patients and contributed to 80.3% (49/61) of all deaths (mortality rate 8.8% vs. 1.9% in non-PMI patients). The most accurate biochemical predictive markers were parathyroid hormone > 6.8 pmol/L, urea > 7.5 mmol/L, 25(OH)vitamin D < 25 nmol/L, albumin < 33 g/L, and ratios gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) to alanine aminotransferase > 2.5, urea/albumin >= 2.0 and GGT/albumin >= 7.0; the AUC for developing PMI ranged between 0.782 and 0.742 (NNP: 1.84-2.13), the AUC for fatal outcome ranged from 0.803 to 0.722, (NNP: 3.77-9.52). Conclusions: In HF patients, easily accessible biochemical indices at admission substantially improve prediction of hospital outcomes, especially in the aged >80 years with IHD.
