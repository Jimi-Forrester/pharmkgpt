23828731|t|Practical Protocol for Implementing Cognitive Stimulation in Persons with Delirium Superimposed on Dementia.
23828731|a|Delirium is common in persons with dementia and often accompanies acute medical or surgical conditions. These individuals are at risk for an accelerated decline in their cognitive and physical function. For this reason, interventions that help resolve delirium are critically needed. We have developed a non-pharmacological intervention for delirium in persons with dementia based on our prior interdisciplinary work on delirium, dementia and cognitive stimulation. The intervention uses recreational activities that are alerting, capture attention, and provide cognitive stimulation that encourages cognitive processing in support of cognitive function. In this paper we describe the practical protocol we have developed for implementing these activities, and present a video that will enhance treatment fidelity for studies that replicate the approach.
