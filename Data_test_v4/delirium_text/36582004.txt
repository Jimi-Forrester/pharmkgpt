36582004|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to report and discuss clinical analysis, including the diagnosis and treatment of 4 cases of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease (NMOSD) with area postrema syndrome (APS) as the first symptom. METHODS: Four patients with intractable nausea, vomiting, and confirmed NMOSD were included in the final analysis. All of these patients were initially misdiagnosed and mismanaged. RESULTS: Among the 4 patients, 3 were admitted to the department of gastroenterology at the onset of the disease, and 2 were not correctly diagnosed and treated promptly due to misdiagnosis. Therefore, their symptoms worsened, and they were transferred to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for life support. No obvious early medulla lesions were found in one patient. One patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone, and plasma exchange, but there was no significant clinical improvement, after which the disease relapsed during the treatment with low-dose rituximab. CONCLUSION: The clinical manifestations of NMOSD are complex and diverse, and the initial symptoms, onset age of the patient, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings can influence the final diagnosis. Early identification of the APS and timely therapy can prevent visual and physical disabilities, even respiratory failure, coma, and cardiac arrest. Therefore, it is necessary to identify specific and sensitive serum and imaging markers for predicting the prognosis and recurrence of the disease.
