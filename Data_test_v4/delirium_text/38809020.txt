38809020|t|RABV induces biphasic actin cytoskeletal rearrangement through Rac1 activity modulation.
38809020|a|Rabies virus (RABV) is highly lethal and triggers severe neurological symptoms. The neuropathogenic mechanism remains poorly understood. Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) is a Rho-GTPase that is involved in actin remodeling and has been reported to be closely associated with neuronal dysfunction. In this study, by means of a combination of pharmacological inhibitors, small interfering RNA, and specific dominant-negatives, we characterize the crucial roles of dynamic actin and the regulatory function of Rac1 in RABV infection, dominantly in the viral entry phase. The data show that the RABV phosphoprotein interacts with Rac1. RABV phosphoprotein suppress Rac1 activity and impedes downstream Pak1-Limk1-Cofilin1 signaling, leading to the disruption of F-actin-based structure formation. In early viral infection, the EGFR-Rac1-signaling pathway undergoes a biphasic change, which is first upregulated and subsequently downregulated, corresponding to the RABV entry-induced remodeling pattern of F-actin. Taken together, our findings demonstrate for the first time the role played by the Rac1 signaling pathway in RABV infection and may provide a clue for an explanation for the etiology of rabies neurological pathogenesis.IMPORTANCEThough neuronal dysfunction is predominant in fatal rabies, the detailed mechanism by which rabies virus (RABV) infection causes neurological symptoms remains in question. The actin cytoskeleton is involved in numerous viruses infection and plays a crucial role in maintaining neurological function. The cytoskeletal disruption is closely associated with abnormal nervous symptoms and induces neurogenic diseases. In this study, we show that RABV infection led to the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton as well as the biphasic kinetics of the Rac1 signal transduction. These results help elucidate the mechanism that causes the aberrant neuronal processes by RABV infection and may shed light on therapeutic development aimed at ameliorating neurological disorders.
