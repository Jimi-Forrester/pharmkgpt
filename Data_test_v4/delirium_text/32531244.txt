32531244|t|The Physiology, Pathology, and Potential Therapeutic Applications of the TREM2 Signaling Pathway.
32531244|a|Alzheimer's disease, obesity-related metabolic syndrome, and cancer are the leading causes of death and among the most costly medical conditions in the Western world. In all three cases, recent discoveries establish the TREM2 receptor as a major pathology-induced immune signaling hub that senses tissue damage and activates robust immune remodeling in response to it. In this review, we summarize and question what is known and remains to be discovered about TREM2 signaling pathway, track the consequences of its activation in physiological niches and pathological contexts, and highlight the promising potential of therapeutic manipulation of TREM2 signaling.
