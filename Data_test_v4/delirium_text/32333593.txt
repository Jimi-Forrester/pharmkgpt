32333593|a|BACKGROUND: Metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance, obesity, and hyperlipidemia occur frequently prior to hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cause mild cognitive impairment (MCI). OBJECTIVE: We investigated the involvement of resistin in these metabolic abnormalities contributes to MCI in patients with T2DM. METHODS: A total of 138 hospitalized patients with T2DM were enrolled and categorized into MCI and non-MCI groups according to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score. Metabolic indicators and cognitive state were assessed, and plasma resistin levels were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: The resistin levels and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) scores of MCI and gender-stratified subgroups were significantly higher than those of controls without MCI (all p < 0.01). Correlation analysis showed that the resistin level was negatively associated with majority of cognitive domains, e.g., MoCA (r = -0.693, p < 0.001) and Mini-Mental State Examination (r = -0.571, p < 0.001), and was related to HOMA-IR (r = 0.667, p < 0.001) but not to obesity and lipid indices. Multivariable regression analysis indicated that resistin (beta= -0.675, p < 0.001) and educational level (beta= 0.177, p = 0.003) were independent risk factors of MoCA in patients with T2DM. CONCLUSIONS: High plasma resistin levels portend the insulin resistance-related susceptibility to early cognitive decline in Chinese patients with T2DM. The involvement of this adipokine in other metabolic disorders leading to diabetic MCI and its clinical value for early disease screening must be further studied.
