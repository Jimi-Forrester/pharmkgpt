33009714|a|OBJECTIVES: In recent years, a growing number of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have compared white matter integrity between patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). However, few studies have examined the pathophysiological significance of different degrees of white matter abnormalities between the two disorders. The present study comprehensively assessed white matter integrity among healthy controls (HC) and euthymic patients with MDD and BD using whole-brain tractography and examined associations between white matter integrity and cognitive functioning. METHODS: We performed neurocognitive examinations and DTI with 30 HCs, 30 patients with MDD, and 30 patients with BD. We statistically evaluated white matter integrity and cognitive function differences across the three groups, assessing associations between white matter integrities and cognitive function. RESULTS: The BD group showed lower fractional anisotropy (FA) for the corpus callosum body, as well as lower, sustained attention and set-shifting scores compared to the other groups. FA for the left body of the corpus callosum was correlated with sustained attention in patients with BD. CONCLUSIONS: The significant reduction of white matter integrity in the corpus callosum in BD, compared to MDD, was associated with an impairment of sustained attention. This result promotes the understanding of the significance of white matter integrity in mood disorders.
