36293881|a|We investigated the effectiveness of virtual-reality-based cognitive training (VRCT) and exercise on the brain, cognitive, physical and activity of older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: This study included 99 participants (70.8 +- 5.4) with MCI in the VRCT, exercise, and control groups. The VRCT consisted of a series of games targeting different brain functions such as executive function, memory, and attention. Twenty-four sessions of VRCT (three days/week) were performed, and each session was 100 min long. Exercise intervention consisted of aerobic and resistance trainings performed in 24 sessions for 60 min (2 times/week for 12 weeks). Global cognitive function was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test. Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) of the neural oscillatory activity in different frequency bands was performed. Physical function was measured using handgrip strength (HGS) and gait speed. RESULTS: After the intervention period, VRCT significantly improved the MMSE scores (p < 0.05), and the exercise group had significantly improved HGS and MMSE scores (p < 0.05) compared to baseline. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of resting-state EEG showed a decreased theta/beta power ratio (TBR) (p < 0.05) in the central region of the brain in the exercise group compared to the control group. Although not statistically significant, the VRCT group also showed a decreased TBR compared to the control group. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) test showed a significant decrease in theta band power in the VRCT group compared to the exercise group and a decrease in delta/alpha ratio in the exercise group compared to the VRCT group. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that VRCT and exercise training enhances brain, cognitive, and physical health in older adults with MCI. Further studies with a larger population sample to identify the effect of VRCT in combination with exercise training are required to yield peak benefits for patients with MCI.
