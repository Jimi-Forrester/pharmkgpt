11927537|t|CLAC: a novel Alzheimer amyloid plaque component derived from a transmembrane precursor, CLAC-P/collagen type XXV.
11927537|a|We raised monoclonal antibodies against senile plaque (SP) amyloid and obtained a clone 9D2, which labeled amyloid fibrils in SPs and reacted with approximately 50/100 kDa polypeptides in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. We purified the 9D2 antigens and cloned a cDNA encoding its precursor, which was a novel type II transmembrane protein specifically expressed in neurons. This precursor harbored three collagen-like Gly-X-Y repeat motifs and was partially homologous to collagen type XIII. Thus, we named the 9D2 antigen as CLAC (collagen-like Alzheimer amyloid plaque component), and its precursor as CLAC-P/collagen type XXV. The extracellular domain of CLAC-P/collagen type XXV was secreted by furin convertase, and the N-terminus of CLAC deposited in AD brains was pyroglutamate modified. Both secreted and membrane-tethered forms of CLAC-P/collagen type XXV specifically bound to fibrillized Abeta, implicating these proteins in beta-amyloidogenesis and neuronal degeneration in AD.
