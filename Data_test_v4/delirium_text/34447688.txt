34447688|a|The novel coronavirus-related coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been relentless in disrupting and overwhelming healthcare the world over. Clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with chronic comorbidities, especially in those with metabolic syndrome, are well documented. Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis patients are a special sub-group, among whom the management of COVID-19 is challenging. Understanding the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension improves our identification of at-risk patients for disease progression that will further help compartmentalize generalized and specialized treatment options in this special patient group. In this exhaustive review, we critically review the impact of COVID-19 on the liver and in chronic liver disease and cirrhosis patients. We further discuss common features associated with the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and cirrhosis, based on the renin-angiotensin system and deliberate current literature on guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 and extrapolate the same to the cirrhosis population to provide a concise and stepwise, evidence-based management for cirrhosis patients with severe and critical COVID-19. There are no specific management guidelines for cirrhosis patients with COVID-19 and current recommendations for treatment are as per guidelines for general population. Nevertheless, specific issues like avoiding corticosteroids in decompensated patients with variceal bleeding, suspected sepsis, high grade hepatic encephalopathy and acute kidney injury, use of early mechanical ventilation strategies in those with severe ascites and hepatopulmonary syndrome, avoidance of remdesivir in advanced liver disease, and application of liver-specific severity scores for prognostication and identification of futility need to be highlighted.
