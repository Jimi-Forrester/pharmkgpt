37505843|a|An 8-year-old, castrated male Shih-tzu dog (Case 1) showing ataxia and gait disorder was referred for neurological examination and magnetic resonance imaging. Through comprehensive examinations, the patient was tentatively diagnosed with meningoencephalitis of unknown origin (MUO) and treatment with prednisolone and cytosine arabinoside was started. The symptoms were improving with immunosuppressive treatment. However, severe bacterial cystitis occurred and we could not avoid tapering off prednisolone. Then, neurological signs recurred. Therefore, we added crisdesalazine, which allowed us to reduce the daily dosage of immunosuppressants easily. In another case, a 4-year-old, spayed female Yorkshire terrier dog (Case 2) was referred to our hospital showing a head tilt, circling, and loss of the menace reflex. The patient was tentatively diagnosed with MUO and treatment with some immunosuppressants was attempted. The clinical symptoms improved, but the alleviation was inadequate. Thus, we added crisdesalazine. The neurological signs then markedly improved. Moreover, the drugs could be tapered off more easily than before. Crisdesalazine is a novel drug that has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action in brain disease and is used particularly for dementia. In this paper, we tried an off-label use of this drug in canine MUO patients, and found that it had, in these two patients, additional therapeutic effects on the MUO.
