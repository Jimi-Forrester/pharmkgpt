17464898|a|Dementias, in particular Alzheimer's disease (AD), are the main reason for availing of nursing home care. In the course of the illness, the clinical picture is affected by cognitive decline and by other psychopathological, "non-cognitive" symptoms such as apathy, depression, delusions or agitation. Little attention has been paid to these symptoms, although they lead to an increase in strain on the patients and their relatives as well as complications in nursing care. Psychopathological symptoms were evaluated by using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory in 145 nursing home residents (age: 85 +/- 7 years, duration of stay: 35 +/- 48 months); the majority of them with moderate to severe dementia (GDS: 5 +/- 2; MMSE: 11 +/- 9). In addition, the Apathy Evaluation Scale was applied. To meet potential regional effects, residents were recruited in nursing homes in the areas around Heidelberg as well as Munster. 87% of the participants showed psychopathological symptoms of an at least moderate degree, depressive mood (52%), apathy (41%) and agitation (38%) being most frequent. General condition, nutritional status and care status were evaluated as 'good', likewise general health care. In contrast, only 27% were treated by psychiatrists. 70% received psychopharmacological treatment, mostly sedatives (44%), while antidementive drugs were used only in 11%. The findings underline the need of further information and advanced training.
