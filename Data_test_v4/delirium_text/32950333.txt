32950333|t|Cerebrovascular pathology in Alzheimer's disease: Hopes and gaps.
32950333|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is recognized as multifactorial and heterogeneous disease with multiple contributors to its pathophysiology, including vascular dysfunction. Given that a revision of the AT(N) classification is expected in the near future, the present work supports the importance to add an additional vascular (V) category to the framework. In particular, we attempt to shed light on the vascular markers and risk factors that are currently ready-to-be-added to the framework: i) lacunes, ii) white matter hyperintensities and iii) microbleeds seen in Flair, T2* weighted imaging and susceptibility images (SWI). Next, we discuss the added value of other types of imaging, such as diffusion-based metrics and advanced perfusion sequences to encompass more subtle vascular dysfunction. Finally, we highlight the importance to add information about the following cardiovascular risk factors to the framework: history of hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. We believe that adding a V category to the AT(N) framework will improve AD classification and foster efforts to apply the right drug(s) at the right time in the right AD subgroups. Brief communication The present work supports the importance to add an additional vascular (V) category to the AT(N) framework and shed light on the vascular MRI markers and risk factors that are currently ready-to-be-added to the framework.
