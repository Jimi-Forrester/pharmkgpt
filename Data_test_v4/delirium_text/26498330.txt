26498330|a|Different genotypic combinations of COMT and DRD2 can generate multiple subgroups with different levels of dopamine signaling. Its modulations on brain properties can be investigated by analyzing the combined gene effects of COMT and DRD2. However, the inherent association between modulation patterns of the dopamine system on structural and functional properties of the brain remains unknown. In 294 healthy young adults, we investigated both additive and non-additive interactions of COMT and DRD2 on gray matter volume (GMV) and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) using a voxel-based analysis. We found a significant non-additive COMT x DRD2 interaction in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), exhibiting an inverted U-shape modulation by dopamine signaling. We also found a significant non-additive COMT x DRD2 interaction in the rsFC between the right dACC and precuneus, displaying a U-shape modulation by dopamine signaling. Moreover, this rsFC was negatively correlated with the GMV of the right dACC. Although the additive interaction did not pass corrections for multiple comparisons, we also found a trend towards an inverse modulation pattern and a negative correlation between the GMV and rsFC of the right inferior frontal gyrus. No genotypic differences were detected in any assessments of the cognition, mood and personality. These findings suggest that healthy young adults without optimal dopamine signaling may maintain their normal behavioral performance via a functional compensatory mechanism in response to structural deficit due to genetic variation.
