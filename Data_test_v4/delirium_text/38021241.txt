38021241|a|Disruptions in the inter-regional connective correlation within the brain are believed to contribute to memory impairment. To detect these corresponding correlation networks in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we conducted three types of inter-regional correlation analysis, including structural covariance, functional connectivity and group-level independent component analysis (group-ICA). The analyzed data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, comprising 52 cognitively normal (CN) participants without subjective memory concerns, 52 individuals with late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) and 52 patients with AD. We firstly performed vertex-wise cortical thickness analysis to identify brain regions with cortical thinning in AD and LMCI patients using structural MRI data. These regions served as seeds to construct both structural covariance networks and functional connectivity networks for each subject. Additionally, group-ICA was performed on the functional data to identify intrinsic brain networks at the cohort level. Through a comparison of the structural covariance and functional connectivity networks with ICA networks, we identified several inter-regional correlation networks that consistently exhibited abnormal connectivity patterns among AD and LMCI patients. Our findings suggest that reduced inter-regional connectivity is predominantly observed within a subnetwork of the default mode network, which includes the posterior cingulate and precuneus regions, in both AD and LMCI patients. This disruption of connectivity between key nodes within the default mode network provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that impairments in brain networks may contribute to memory deficits in AD and LMCI.
