36444286|t|Consequences of anastomotic leaks after minimally invasive esophagectomy: A single-center experience.
36444286|a|Background: Anastomotic leak (AL) after minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) is a well-described source of morbidity for patients undergoing surgical treatment of esophageal neoplasm. With improved early recognition and endoscopic management techniques, the long-term impact remains unclear. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of patients who underwent MIE for esophageal neoplasm between January 2015 and June 2021 at a single institution. Cohorts were stratified by development of AL and subsequent management. Baseline demographics, perioperative data, and post-operative outcomes were examined. Results: During this period, 172 MIEs were performed, with 35 of 172 (20.3%) complicated by an AL. Perioperative factors independently associated with AL were post-operative blood transfusion (leak rate 52.9% versus 16.8%; p = 0.0017), incompleteness of anastomotic rings (75.0% vs 19.1%; p = 0.027), and receiving neoadjuvant therapy (18.5% vs 30.8%; p < 0.0001). Inferior short-term outcomes associated with AL included number of esophageal dilations in the first post-operative year (1.40 vs 0.46, p = 0.0397), discharge disposition to a location other than home (22.9% vs 8.8%, p = 0.012), length of hospital stay (17.7 days vs 9.6 days; p = 0.002), and time until jejunostomy tube removal (134 days vs 79 days; p = 0.0023). There was no significant difference in overall survival between patients with or without an AL at 1 year (79% vs 83%) or 5 years (50% vs 47%) (overall log rank p = 0.758). Conclusions: In this large single-center series of MIEs, AL was associated with inferior short-term outcomes including hospital length of stay, discharge disposition other than to home, and need for additional endoscopic procedures, without an accompanying impact on 1-year or 5-year survival. Key message: In this large, single-center series of minimally invasive esophagectomies, anastomotic leak was associated with worse short-term outcomes including hospital length of stay, discharge disposition other than to home, and need for additional endoscopic procedures, but was not associated with worse long-term survival. The significant association between neoadjuvant therapy and decreased leak rates is difficult to interpret, given the potential for confounding factors, thus careful attention to modifiable pre- and peri-operative patient factors associated with anastomotic leak is warranted.
