37783430|t|The role of N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors in Alzheimer's disease: from pathophysiology to therapeutic approaches.
37783430|a|N-Methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors (NMDARs) are involved in multiple physiopathological processes, including synaptic plasticity, neuronal network activities, excitotoxic events, and cognitive impairment. Abnormalities in NMDARs can initiate a cascade of pathological events, notably in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and even other neuropsychiatric disorders. The subunit composition of NMDARs is plastic, giving rise to a diverse array of receptor subtypes. While they are primarily found in neurons, NMDAR complexes, comprising both traditional and atypical subunits, are also present in non-neuronal cells, influencing the functions of various peripheral tissues. Furthermore, protein-protein interactions within NMDAR complexes has been linked with Abeta accumulation, tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, all of which potentially served as an obligatory relay of cognitive impairment. Nonetheless, the precise mechanistic link remains to be fully elucidated. In this review, we provided an in-depth analysis of the structure and function of NMDAR, investigated their interactions with various pathogenic proteins, discussed the current landscape of NMDAR-based therapeutics, and highlighted the remaining challenges during drug development.
