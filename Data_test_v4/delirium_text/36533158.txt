36533158|a|"Frontotemporal dementia" (FTD) is a clinical syndrome characterized by the focal involvement of the frontal and/or temporal lobes. FTD has three clinical phenotypes: the behavioral variant and two linguistic subtypes, namely, non-fluent/agrammatic primary progressive aphasia (PPA-NF/A) and semantic PPA (PPA-S). FTD is the second most common cause of dementia in individuals under the age of 65 years. This article presents recommendations for the diagnosis of FTD in the Brazilian scenario, considering the three levels of complexity of the health system: primary health care, secondary and tertiary levels. Diagnostic guidelines are proposed, including cognitive testing, behavioral and language assessments, laboratory tests, and neuroimaging.
