31708494|t|ER-depletion lowering the 'hypothalamus-uterus-kidney' axis functions by perturbing the renal ERbeta/Ptgds signalling pathway.
31708494|a|Researchers have long assumed that systematic estrogen fading might contribute to the sustained progression of menopausal degenerate syndromes, although definitive evidence has not been presented. Whether such findings represent a causal contribution or are the result of opportunistic messengers sent from the reproductive system to the brain is also a vital question. We constructed a multiscale network of the ovariectomy (OVX) induced estrogen receptors depletion (ER-depletion) model and integrated targeted proteomic, targeted lipidomic, cytochemical, and histopathological data across three tissues from the ovariectomy rodent model. We found that compared to control rats, OVX rats showed increased renal and uterine prostaglandin D2 synthase (Ptgds) expression and decreased hypothalamic Ptgds expression, abnormal Ptgds metabolites, the degenerate renal function profiles and decreased cognitive ability (learning and memory) in Morris water maze test. Importantly, we observed a regulatory relationship among ER (particularly ERbeta), the degree of the pathological phenotype, learning behavior test and the 'hypothalamus-uterus-kidney (HUK) axis functions. Collectively, this study elucidates that ER depletion promoted HUK aging is mostly attributed to a renal ERbeta/Ptgds signalling imbalance.
