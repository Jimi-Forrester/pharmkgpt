33197703|t|Validation of the 3-minute diagnostic interview for CAM-defined Delirium in Chinese older adults.
33197703|a|Delirium is a common complication among older adults, but it is often unrecognized in routine practice. The 3-Minute Diagnostic Interview for CAM-defined Delirium (3D-CAM) was developed to identify delirium in the general unit. This prospective diagnostic study was conducted to validate the accuracy of the 3D-CAM Chinese version among older adults in the general units. A total of 204 hospitalized older adults from a geriatric hospital were enrolled in the study, of whom 54 were identified as positive for delirium. The sensitivity and specificity of the 3D-CAM Chinese version were 94% and 97%, respectively. The median duration of assessment using the 3D-CAM was about 3 minutes. The 3D-CAM had highly acceptable sensitivity and specificity when it was used by nurse researchers among Chinese older adults.
