9255247|a|PRAGMATIC APPROACH: For patients with schizophrenia, improvement does not simply mean freedom from delirium, but also implies the acquisition of the personal and relational skills needed for durable stabilization. Consequently, behavioral and cognitive therapies have progressively gained a specific role in the treatment of schizophrenia. BASIC PRINCIPLES: Behavior and cognitive techniques proposed for rehabilitating patients with schizophrenia are based on acquisition of social skills which the patients can use to manage their treatment and their daily familial and interpersonal relationships. FAMILY THERAPY: The aim of family therapy is to improve the emotion expressed within a family by improving the family's capacity for intercommunication, coherence and adaptation to the patient's situation. This individual and familial approach to behavior can provide substantial prolonged benefit for the schizophrenic patient. A PRECIOUS CONTRIBUTION TO THERAPEUTICS: The organization of behavioral and cognitive therapy requires long-term adhesion from patients, health cares and family. In combination with adapted drug therapy and with individually designed objectives, behavioral and cognitive therapies can widen the therapeutic spectrum proposed in this chronic and difficult to manage disease.
