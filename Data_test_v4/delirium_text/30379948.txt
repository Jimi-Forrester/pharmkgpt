30379948|a|BACKGROUND: Adults and older people with intellectual disabilities (ID) frequently receive anti-cholinergic drugs in chronic use, but no studies in Italy to date have investigated cumulative anticholinergic exposure and factors associated with high anticholinergic burden in this frail population. AIM: To probe the cumulative exposure to anticholinergics and the demographic, social and clinical factors associated with high exposure. METHODS: The 2012 updated version of the Anticholinergic Burden Score (ACB) was calculated for a multicentre sample of 276 adult and older people over 40 years with ID and associations with factors assessed. RESULTS: Overall, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, anxiolytics, and antidepressants were the most frequent classes contributing to the total ACB score. People living in residential care were more likely exposed to high anticholinergic burden (an ACB score of 3+): both community housing (odds ratio [OR] 4.63, 95%CI 1.08-19.95) and nursing home facility ([OR] 9.99, 95%CI 2.32-43.04). There was also a significant association between an ACB score of 3+ and reporting mental health conditions ([OR] 25.56, 95% CI 8.08-80.89) or a neurological disease ([OR] 4.14, 95%CI 1.32-12.94). Neither demographic characteristics (age and gender) nor other clinical conditions (somatic comorbidity, levels and typology of ID) were associated with higher anticholinergic load. A high burden of anticholinergic was significantly more frequent in laxative users (22.6% ACB3+ vs. 5.1% ACB 0) (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Psychotropics drugs were the highest contributors to the anticholinergic burden in adult and old age ID, especially in those people living in institutional settings with mental health and/or neurological conditions. High anticholinergic load has shown to be associated with the use of laxatives.
