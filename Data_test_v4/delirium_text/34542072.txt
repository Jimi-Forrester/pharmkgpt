34542072|a|BACKGROUND: An amyloid-beta (Abeta) positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET) scan of the human brain could lead to an early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and estimate disease progression. However, Abeta-PET imaging is expensive, invasive, and rarely applicable to cognitively normal subjects at risk for dementia. The identification of blood biomarkers predictive of Abeta brain deposition could help the identification of subjects at risk for dementia and could be helpful for the prognosis of AD progression. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the prognostic accuracy of blood biomarkers in predicting Abeta-PET status along with progression toward AD. METHODS: In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched bibliographic databases from 2010 to 2020. The quality of the included studies was assessed by the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. RESULTS: A total of 8 studies were retrieved. The prognostic accuracy of Abeta-PET status was calculated by obtaining ROCs for the following biomarkers: free, total, and bound Abeta42 and Abeta40; Abeta42/40 ratio; neurofilaments (NFL); total tau (T-tau); and phosphorylated-tau181 (P-tau181). Higher and lower plasma baseline levels of P-tau181 and the Abeta42/40 ratio, respectively, showed consistently good prognostication of Abeta-PET brain accumulation. Only P-tau181 was shown to predict AD progression. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the Abeta42/40 ratio and plasma P-tau181 were shown to predict Abeta-PET status. Plasma P-tau181 could also be a preclinical biomarker for AD progression.
