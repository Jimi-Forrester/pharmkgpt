25378415|t|Abscess formation within a Rathke's cleft cyst.
25378415|a|We report and discuss the rare case of a pituitary abscess forming within a Rathke's cleft cyst (RCC). A 66-year-old gentleman presented with visual deterioration and symptoms suggestive of hypopituitarism. The patient underwent transsphenoidal debulking of the lesion whereupon purulent material was discovered. Histological examination was suggestive of RCC together with numerous neutrophils characteristic of abscess. Microbiological culture of the material grew Staphylococcus aureus. The patient was treated for a RCC abscess and received antibiotics and endocrine replacement therapy. The patient has been followed up for 2 years without recurrence. Although uncommon, we recommend the consideration of RCC abscess as a differential diagnosis of a pituitary mass lesion as clinical presentation and radiological assessment are not specific in identifying these lesions preoperatively.
