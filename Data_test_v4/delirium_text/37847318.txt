37847318|a|During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, stringent measures were implemented in most countries to limit social contact between residents of long-term care facilities (LTCF) and visitors. The objective of this scoping review was to identify and map evidence of direct and indirect consequences of contact restrictions, guided by three conceptual perspectives: (1) stress and learned helplessness (i.e., failure to use coping behaviors even when they are available and actionalble); (2) social contact loss; and (3) 'total institution' (i.e., a facility operates following a fixed plan due to spelled-out rules and norms, controlled by institutional representatives). We used the framework for conducting a scoping review by Arksey and O'Malley; included were peer-reviewed manuscripts reporting on the outcomes of contact restrictions from the beginning of the pandemic until the end of 2020. After removing duplicates, 6,656 records were screened and 62 manuscripts included. Results pertaining to the stress and learned helplessness perspective primarily focused on depressive symptoms, showing substantial increases compared to the pre-pandemic period. Studies examining cognitive and functional decline, as well as non-COVID-19 related mortality, were limited in number and presented mixed findings. The majority of study outcomes related to the social contact loss perspective focused on loneliness, but the study designs did not adequately allow for comparisons with the pre-pandemic status. The evidence concerning outcomes related to the 'total Institution' perspective was inconclusive. Although detrimental effects of social isolation in the long-term care context found support particularly in the negative affect domain, other outcome areas did not allow for definitive conclusions due to considerable variations in findings and, in some cases, insufficient statistical power.
