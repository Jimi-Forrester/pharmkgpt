36070286|a|PURPOSE: More substantial information on recovery after Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission is urgently needed. In a previous retrospective study, the proportion of non-recovery patients was 44%. The aim of this prospective follow-up study was to evaluate changes in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in the first year after ICU-admission. METHODS: Long-stay adult ICU-patients (>= 48 hours) were included. HRQoL was evaluated with the Dutch translation of the RAND-36 item Health Survey (RAND-36) at baseline via proxy measurement, and at three, six, and twelve months after ICU admission. Subsequently, the relation between physical functioning, healthcare utilisation, and work activities was explored. RESULTS: A total of 81 patients were included in this study. Fifty-five percent of patients did not meet criteria for full recovery and were allocated to the Non Recovery (NR)-group (Physical Functioning domain-score: 35 [15-55]). Baseline physical HRQoL differed significantly between the Recovery (R) and NR-group. Patients in the NR-group received home care more often and had higher healthcare utilisation (44 versus 17% in the first three months post-ICU, p = 0.013). Only fourteen percent of NR-patients were able to participate in work activities. Moreover, NR-patients persistently showed impaired overall HRQoL throughout the year after critical illness. CONCLUSIONS: Limited recovery in ICU survivors is reflected in overall impaired HRQoL, as well as in far-reaching consequences for patients' healthcare needs and their ability to reintegrate into society. In our study, baseline HRQoL appeared to be an important predictor of long-term outcomes, but not Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score. And, (proxy-derived) HRQoL may help to identify patients at risk of long-term non-recovery.
