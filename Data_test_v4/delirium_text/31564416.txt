31564416|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease and mitochondrial impairment is a key feature of AD. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) epigenetic mechanism is a relatively new field compared to nuclear DNA. The relationship between mtDNA epigenetic mechanism and AD hasn't been established. So we analyzed the mtDNA methylation in D-loop region and 12 S rRNA gene in the hippocampi in amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice by bisulfite pyrosequencing. Mitochondrial DNA copy number and gene expression were studied by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). We observed a decrease in the displacement loop (D-loop) methylation and an increase in 12 S rRNA gene methylation, while both the mtDNA copy number and the mitochondrial gene expression were reduced in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. In summary, the present finding suggest that mtDNA methylation may play a role in AD pathology, which warrants larger future investigations.
