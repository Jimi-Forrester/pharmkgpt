35883759|a|The clinical potential of Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) in the prevention and/or treatment of retinal degenerative diseases has been widely explored; however, the underlying molecular mechanism is poorly understood. Photoreceptor degeneration is the hallmark of retinal degenerative diseases and leads to vision impairment or loss. In this study, the effect of GBE against white light (WL) illumination-induced photoreceptor degeneration was investigated, as well as its underlying mechanism. To evaluate the in vitro activity of GBE, analysis of cell viability, cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, NOX (NADH oxidase) activity and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), as well as Western blotting and transcriptome sequencing and analysis, were conducted. To evaluate the in vivo activity of GBE, HE staining, electroretinography (ERG), Terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and immunofluorescence analysis were conducted. Our study showed that GBE treatment significantly attenuated WL illumination-induced oxidative damage in photoreceptor 661W cells-a finding that was also verified in C57BL/6J mice. Further molecular study revealed that WL illumination downregulated caveolin-1 (CAV-1) expression, interrupted CAV-1-NOX2 interaction, re-located NOX2 from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm and induced the formation of redoxosomes, which led to cell death. However, these cytotoxic events were significantly alleviated by GBE treatment. Interestingly, CAV-1 overexpression showed a consistent protective effect with GBE, while CAV-1 silencing impacted the protective effect of GBE against WL illumination-induced oxidative damage in in vitro and in vivo models. Thus, GBE was identified to prevent photoreceptor cell death due to CAV-1-dependent redoxosome activation, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from WL illumination. Overall, our study reveals the protective effect of GBE on photoreceptors against WL illumination-induced oxidative damage in in vitro and in vivo models, which effect is mediated through the modulation of CAV-1-redoxosome signaling. Our findings contribute to better understanding the therapeutic effect of GBE in preventing photoreceptor degeneration in retinal degenerative diseases, and GBE may become a novel therapeutic agent that is effective in reducing the morbidity of these diseases.
