33927481|a|Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders are becoming more prevalent as advances in technology and medicine increase living standards and life expectancy. Alzheimer's disease is thought to initiate development early in the patient's life and progresses continuously into old age. This process is characterized molecularly by the amyloid hypothesis, which asserts that self-aggregating amyloid peptides are core to the pathophysiology in Alzheimer's progression. Precise quantification of amyloid peptides in human bodily fluid samples (i.e. cerebrospinal fluid, blood) may inform diagnosis and prognosis, and has been studied using established biosensing technologies like liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and immunoassays. However, existing methods are challenged to provide single molecule, quantitative analysis of the disease-causing aggregation process. Ultra-sensitive nanopore biosensors can step in to fill this role as a dynamic mapping tool. The work in this paper establishes characteristic signals of beta-amyloid 40 monomers, oligomers, and soluble aggregates, as well as a proof-of-concept foundation where a biological nanopore biosensor is used to monitor the extent of in vitro beta-amyloid 40 peptide aggregation at the single molecule level. This foundation allows for future work to expand in drug screening, diagnostics, and aggregation dynamic experiments.
