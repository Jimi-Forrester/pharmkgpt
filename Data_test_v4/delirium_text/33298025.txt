33298025|t|A propensity score matching analysis for cardio metabolic risk of antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia using Japanese claims data.
33298025|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cardio-metabolic risk in schizophrenia patients treated by atypical antipsychotic drugs compared with that in those treated without atypical antipsychotic drugs using a nationwide insurance claims database and medical examination database in Japan. METHODS: Eligible patients were defined as those meeting the following two criteria: (i) A diagnosis of schizophrenia (ICD-10 code: F20) was made between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2017, with data available for at least 6 months before the diagnosis was made (index month), and (ii) health check-up data were available within +-3 months of the index month. The primary endpoint was changes in cardio-metabolic risk based on the Suita score at 1 year, and the secondary endpoints were changes in medical examination data related to cardio-metabolic risk (total cholesterol [TC], triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index [BMI], and hemoglobin A1c) at 1 year. The primary endpoint was evaluated by multivariate analysis, with the cumulative chlorpromazine equivalent amount and the baseline Suita score added as covariates. RESULTS: One-hundred eighty five pairs of propensity score (PS)-matched patients were evaluated. Patients receiving atypical antipsychotic drugs exhibited a greater change in the Suita score and a risk of coronary heart disease based on the Suita score of 0.530 and 0.098%, respectively, than patients not receiving atypical antipsychotic drugs, but there was no significant difference (p = 0.412 and 0.610). The significant changes in TC and BMI were determined as 6.525 mg/dL and 0.380 kg/m2 greater, respectively, in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs (p = 0.037 and 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant increases in changes in the Suita score at 1 year by treatment with atypical antipsychotic drugs compared with treatment without atypical antipsychotic drugs. However, the TC and BMI were significantly higher in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs.
