33062525|a|In the setting of increasingly streamlined surgical techniques and perioperative care, the United States healthcare system is seeing a steady rise in the number of procedures being carried out at ambulatory surgery centers. Concurrently, awareness and diagnosis of both chronic pain conditions and substance use disorders have also improved in recent years. As a result of these two shifts, the demographic characteristics of patients undergoing procedures at ambulatory surgery centers are actively evolving. Chronic pain and substance use disorders are difficult to manage in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and present unique challenges in the context of perioperative planning. Both conditions are associated with worsened postoperative outcomes, including refractory pain, decreased functional status, increased length of stay, increased readmission rates, and increased economic costs. There has been a recent movement to include a preoperative risk stratification calculation for these patients, followed by the implementation of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols in these patient cohorts. Taking a step further, patients benefit when standard ERAS protocols are augmented by integrating designated pain specialists into the ambulatory surgery team. This multimodal and multidisciplinary approach must be assessed in the context of the human and financial resources of a given institution and surgery center, but has been shown to improve the quality and safety of perioperative care effectively.
