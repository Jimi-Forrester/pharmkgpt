37771917|t|Perioperative and Functional Results for Robot-assisted Radical Cystectomy with Totally Intracorporeal Neobladder in Male Patients via the Vesica Patavina (Ves.Pa.) Technique: IDEAL Stage 2a Report.
37771917|a|Background: Robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) offers several advantages over open surgery, but intracorporeal neobladder construction (INC) is a challenging procedure. The vesica patavina (Ves.Pa.) refinement is a modification of the original technique that simplifies the neobladder configuration and reduces the risk of complications. Objective: To present a stage 2a IDEAL (Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment and Long-term follow-up) report on RARC with INC using the Ves.Pa. technique. Design setting and participants: This was a prospective study of consecutive male patients undergoing RARC and Ves.Pa. INC performed by a single surgeon for muscle-invasive or non-muscle-invasive, bacillus Calmette-Guerin-refractory urothelial bladder cancer in a tertiary referral center. Surgical procedure: RARC with INC using the refined Ves.Pa. technique. Measurements: Complications were classified using the Clavien-Dindo scheme, and functional outcomes were assessed using validated questionnaires. Results and limitations: A total of 20 male patients were treated. The median operative time was 382 min, and the median estimated blood loss was 350 ml. The incidence of high-grade complications was extremely low, with only one patient experiencing a grade IIIa complication. All patients had clear surgical margins. At median follow-up of 12 mo, statistically significant differences in all the functional scores measured were observed. Specifically, 6-mo parameters were all significantly worse than at baseline (all p < 0.05). No patients required intermittent catheterization. Severe urinary incontinence was experienced by approximately 25% of the patients. The median number of pad used was 0 during the day and 1 at night. The study is limited by its small sample size, single-center design, and short follow-up. Conclusions: RARC with the refined Ves.Pa. technique for INC is safe, feasible, and replicable. The technique simplifies the procedure and reduces the risk of complications. The study results suggest acceptable oncological and functional outcomes over short-term follow-up. Patient summary: We report our initial experience with robot-assisted removal of the bladder and construction of a new bladder using our modified technique, called Ves.Pa., in patients with bladder cancer. The technique is simple to perform. We observed a low rate of high-grade complications, and patients had surgical margins negative for cancer in all cases and fair functional outcomes at 12-month follow-up.
