34370636|a|The radiation for therapeutic purposes has shown positive effects in different contexts; however, it can increase the risk of many age-related and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). These different outcomes highlight a dose-response phenomenon called hormesis. Prevailing studies indicate that high doses of radiation could play several destructive roles in triggering oxidative stress, neuroapoptosis, and neuroinflammation in neurodegeneration. However, there is a lack of effective treatments in combating radiation-induced neurodegeneration, and the present drugs suffer from some drawbacks, including side effects and drug resistance. Among natural entities, polyphenols are suggested as multi-target agents affecting the dysregulated pathogenic mechanisms in neurodegenerative disease. This review discusses the destructive effects of radiation on the induction of neurodegenerative diseases by dysregulating oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation. We also describe the promising effects of polyphenols and other candidate phytochemicals in preventing and treating radiation-induced neurodegenerative disorders, aiming to find novel/potential therapeutic compounds against such disorders.
