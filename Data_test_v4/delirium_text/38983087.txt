38983087|a|Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) involves degenerative and neovascular alteration in the macular region of the retina resulting in central vision loss. AMD can be classified into dry (dAMD) and wet AMD (wAMD). There is no established treatment for dAMD, and therapies available for wAMD have limited success. Diagnosis in early AMD stages is difficult due to the absence of clinical symptoms. Currently, imaging tests are used in the diagnosis of AMD, but cannot predict the clinical course. The clinical limitations to establishing a diagnosis of AMD have led to exploration for innovative and more sensitive tests to support the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small single-stranded non-coding RNA molecules that negatively regulate genes by post-transcriptional gene silencing. Because these molecules are dysregulated in various processes implicated in the pathogenesis of AMD, they could contribute to the early detection of the disease and monitoring of its progression. Studies of miRNA profiling have indicated several miRNAs as potential diagnostic biomarkers of AMD, but no approved biomarker is available at present for early AMD detection. Thus, understanding the function of miRNAs in AMD and their use as potential biomarkers may lead to future advances in diagnosis and treatment. Here we present a brief review of some of the miRNAs involved in regulating pathological processes associated with AMD and discuss several candidate miRNAs proposed as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for AMD.
