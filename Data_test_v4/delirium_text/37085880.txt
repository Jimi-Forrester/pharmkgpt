37085880|t|TReating Incontinence for Underlying Mental and Physical Health (TRIUMPH): a study protocol for a multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, 3-arm trial to evaluate the multisystem effects of pharmacologic treatment strategies for urgency-predominant urinary incontinence in ambulatory older women.
37085880|a|BACKGROUND: Urgency-type urinary incontinence affects one in four older community-dwelling women and overlaps with other common aging-associated health syndromes such as cognitive impairment, physical mobility impairment, and depression. Observational studies have raised concern about potentially higher rates of delirium and dementia in older adults taking anticholinergic bladder medications, but few prospective data are available to evaluate the effects of these and other pharmacologic treatments for urgency incontinence on cognition and other multisystem functional domains important to older women. METHODS: The TRIUMPH study is a randomized, double-blinded, 3-arm, parallel-group trial comparing the multisystem effects of anticholinergic versus beta-3-adrenergic agonist bladder therapy and versus no active bladder anti-spasmodic pharmacotherapy in older women with urgency incontinence. Women aged 60 years and older (target N = 270) who have chronic urgency-predominant urinary incontinence and either normal or mildly impaired cognition at baseline are recruited from the community by investigators based in northern California, USA. Participants are randomized in equal ratios to take identically encapsulated oral anticholinergic bladder therapy (in the form of tolterodine 2 mg extended release [ER]), oral beta-3 adrenergic agonist bladder therapy (mirabegron 25 mg ER), or placebo daily for 24 weeks, with the option of participant-directed dose titration (to tolterodine 4 mg ER, mirabegron 50 mg ER, or matching placebo daily). Participants also receive patient-oriented information and instructions about practicing first-line behavioral management strategies for incontinence. The primary outcome is change in composite cognitive function over 24 weeks assessed by a comprehensive battery of cognitive tests, with a secondary exploration of the persistence of change at 36 weeks. Secondary outcomes include changes over 24 and 36 weeks in domain-specific cognitive function; frequency, severity, and impact of urgency-associated urinary symptoms; physical function and balance; sleep quality and daytime sleepiness; psychological function; and bowel function. DISCUSSION: The TRIUMPH trial addresses the need for rigorous evidence to guide counseling and decision-making for older women who are weighing the potential multisystem benefits and risks of pharmacologic treatments for urgency incontinence in order to preserve their day-to-day functioning, quality of life, and independence in older age.
