21322828|a|The current criteria for classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have deficiencies that limit drug development, research, and practice. The current standard for the clinical diagnosis of AD, the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (now known as the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke), and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (now known as the Alzheimer's Association) criteria, are nearly 25 years old and have not been revised to incorporate advances in the epidemiology and genetics of AD, studies of clinicopathologic correlations and recent studies of potential diagnostic biomarkers. In a very real sense our ability to diagnose AD with a very high level of certainty has outpaced our current diagnostic criteria. The Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable convened a meeting in April 2009 to discuss new data and technologies that could, with further development, enable improvements in the clinical diagnosis of AD, especially in its earliest and mildest stages. This meeting reviewed the current standards for detecting and defining the clinical presentation of AD and discussed areas that could contribute to earlier and more accurate definitive clinical diagnosis. These included clinical, neuropsychological, and other performance-based assessments, genetic contributions, and biochemical and neuroimaging biomarkers that could reflect AD pathology and lead to better ascertainment of AD, mild cognitive impairment, and presymptomatic AD.
