23324234|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of inhibited alpha7 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) by small interference RNA (siRNA) in SH-SY5Y cells and to explore the connection of these changes with the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: The siRNA of alpha7 nAChR was transfected into SH-SY5Y cells, and the expression of alpha7 nAChR and two subtypes of beta-secretases (BACE1 and BACE2) at mRNA and protein levels was studied by real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. The variation of Abeta(1-42) content was detected by ELISA. RESULTS: As compared with controls, the expression of alpha7 nAChR at mRNA and protein levels in the SH-SY5Y cells transfected with the alpha7 nAChR siRNA were decreased by 84% and 79% (P < 0.01), respectively. The expressions of BACE1 mRNA and protein levels was increased by 527% and 71% (P < 0.01), respectively, while the expression of BACE2 decreased by 58% and 75% (P < 0.01), respectively. The Abeta(1-42) content increased by 208% (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: An inhibited alpha7 nAChR mRNA induced by siRNA may markedly stimulate the production of Abeta through the mechanism of increased expression of BACE1 and inhibited expression of BACE2, which may be related to the pathogenesis of AD.
