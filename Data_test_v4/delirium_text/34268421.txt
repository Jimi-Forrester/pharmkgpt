34268421|t|A narrative review of chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cell therapy for lung cancer.
34268421|a|Lung cancer represents one of the most common and deadliest cancers in the world. Chimeric antigen receptor-T cell (CAR-T) therapy which can recognize antigens in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-independent manner provides a new approach for tumor treatment. However, lung cancer, as a solid tumor, faces several formidable barriers to adoptive cell transfer, which includes inhibition of T-cell localization and suppression of T-cell function. Therefore, lung cancer fails to respond significantly to infusions of CAR-T cells in most trials until now. PubMed was researched using the terms "CAR-T" and "lung cancer" only in English from 2000 through June 2020. We also included results presented in international conferences, such as the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO). Besides, we found new progress in CAR-T therapy for solid tumors as a supplement. To enhance the efficacy and conquer the limitations, we collected some applications in lung cancer. In recent years, there have been some improvements in selecting the proper target and reducing toxicity. CAR-T technology provides an excellent way for tumor treatment, which does not depend on MHC molecules and provides a new method for the utilization of tumor targets. Targeting different antigens and overcoming the solid barrier, there are some improvements in responding significantly and reducing toxicity. CAR-T technology will play a decisive role in the treatment of lung cancer.
