In this study, we assessed the use of plasma metabolites as biomarkers for lung cancer diagnosis. In this work, we used a novel interdisciplinary mechanism, applied for the first time to lung cancer, to detect biomarkers for early lung cancer diagnosis by combining metabolomics and machine learning approaches. RESULTS: In total, 478 lung cancer patients and 370 subjects with benign lung nodules were enrolled from a hospital in Dalian, Liaoning Province. We selected 47 serum amino acid and carnitine indicators from targeted metabolomics studies using LC-MS/MS and age and sex demographic indicators of the subjects. After screening by a stepwise regression algorithm, 16 metrics were included. The XGBoost model in the machine learning algorithm showed superior predictive power (AUC = 0.81, accuracy = 75.29%, sensitivity = 74%), with the metabolic biomarkers ornithine and palmitoylcarnitine being potential biomarkers to screen for lung cancer. The machine learning model XGBoost is proposed as an tool for early lung cancer prediction. This study provides strong support for the feasibility of blood-based screening for metabolites and provide a safer, faster and more accurate tool for early diagnosis of lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes an interdisciplinary approach combining metabolomics with a machine learning model (XGBoost) to predict early the occurrence of lung cancer. The metabolic biomarkers ornithine and palmitoylcarnitine showed significant power for early lung cancer diagnosis.
