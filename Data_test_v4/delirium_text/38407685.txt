38407685|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are common chronic diseases arising from progressive damage to the nervous system. Here, in-house natural product database screening revealed that libertellenone C (LC) obtained from the fermentation products of Arthrinium arundinis separated from the gut of a centipede collected in our Tongji campus, showed a remarkable neuroprotective effect. Further investigation was conducted to clarify the specific mechanism. LC dose-dependently reversed glutamate-induced decreased viability, accumulated reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential loss, and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. Network pharmacology analysis predicted that the targets of LC were most likely directly related to oxidative stress and the regulation of inflammatory factor-associated signaling pathways. Further study demonstrated that LC attenuated nitrite, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta production and decreased inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase expression in lipopolysaccharide-induced BV-2 cells. LC could directly inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation by decreasing the expression levels of NLRP3, ASC, cleaved Caspase-1, and NF-kappaB p65. Our results provide a new understanding of how LC inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia, providing neuroprotection. These findings might guide the development of effective LC-based therapeutic strategies for NDs.
