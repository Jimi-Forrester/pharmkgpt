38026525|t|Functionalized Cerium Dioxide Nanoparticles with Antioxidative Neuroprotection for Alzheimer's Disease.
38026525|a|Background: Oxidative stress induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) in the nervous system are significant contributors to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerium dioxide and manganese oxide are known as to be effective and recyclable ROS scavengers with high efficiency in neuroprotection. Methods: A hollow-structured manganese-doped cerium dioxide nanoparticle (LMC) was synthesized for loading Resveratrol (LMC-RES). The LMC-RES were characterized by TEM, DLS, Zeta potential, and X-ray energy spectrum analysis. We also tested the biocompatibility of LMC-RES and the ability of LMC-RES to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The antioxidant effects of LMC-RES were detected by SH-SY5Y cells. Small animal live imaging was used to detect the distribution of LMC-RES in the brain tissue of AD mice. The cognitive abilities of mice were tested by water maze and nesting experiments. The effects of LMC-RES in reducing oxidative stress and protecting neurons was also explored by histological analysis. Results: The results showed that LMC-RES had good sustained release effect and biocompatibility. The drug release rate of LMC-RES at 24 hours was 80.9 +- 2.25%. Meanwhile, LMC-RES could cross the BBB and enrich in neurons to exert antioxidant effects. In Abeta-induced SH-SY5Y cells, LMC-RES could inhibits oxidative stress through the Nrf-2/HO-1 signaling pathway. In AD model mice, LMC-RES was able to reduce ROS levels, inhibit Abeta-induced neurotoxicity, and protect neurons and significantly improve cognitive deficits of AD mice after drug administration. Conclusion: LMC-RES can effectively across the BBB, reduce oxidative stress, inhibit Abeta aggregation, and promote the recovery of neurological function.
