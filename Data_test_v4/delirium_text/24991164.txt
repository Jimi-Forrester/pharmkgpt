24991164|t|A case of recurrent neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
24991164|a|SUMMARY: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a life-threatening neurologic complication associated with the use of neuroleptic agents and characterized by a distinctive clinical syndrome of fever, rigidity, autonomic nervous system dysfunction and mental status change. This report discusses the clinical presentation, possible etiology, pathogenesis and treatment of one case of recurrent NMS in a middle-aged woman with schizophrenia. NMS occurred after combined treatment with haloperidol and aripiprazole (the first episode) and, four years later, after combined treatment with haloperidol and clozapine (the second episode). This case highlights the need to be particularly cautious in the use of antipsychotic medications in patients with a history of NMS and, whenever possible, to avoid combined treatment with multiple antipsychotic medications in these patients.
