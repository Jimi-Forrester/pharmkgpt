38834986|a|BACKGROUND: Syntaxin6 (STX6) is a SNARE (Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) protein complex located in the trans-Golgi network and endosomes, which is closely associated with a variety of intracellular membrane transport events. STX6 has been shown to be overexpressed in a variety of human malignant tumors such as esophageal, colorectal, and renal cell carcinomas, and participates in tumorigenesis and development. METHODS: Based on clinical public database and clinical liver samples analysis, the expression of STX6 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues was investigated. The effects of STX6 on proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cell in vitro and in vivo were evaluated through gain- and loss-of-function studies. We further performed RNA-seq analysis and protein interactome analysis, to further decifer the detailed mechanisms of STX6 in the regulation of the JAK-STAT pathway in HCC. RESULTS: STX6 expression was upregulated in HCC tissues and its expression was highly correlated with the high histological grade of the tumor. STX6 promoted HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, STX6 mediated tumor progression depending on promoting the activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Receptor for activated protein kinase C (RACK1) as an essential adaptor protein mediating STX6 regulation of JAK-STAT pathway. Specifically, STX6 interacted with RACK1 and then recruited signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) to form a protein-binding complex and activates STAT3 transcriptional activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided a novel concept that STX6 exerted oncogenic effects by activating the STAT3 signaling pathway, and STX6 might be a promising therapeutic target for HCC.
