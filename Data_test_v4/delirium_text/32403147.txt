32403147|a|Growth hormone releasing hormone is a hypothalamic neuropeptide, which regulates the release of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary gland. Growth hormone releasing hormone antagonists are anticancer agents, associated with strong anti-inflammatory activities. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the GHRH antagonist MIA-602 in the integrity of the brain microvascular endothelium in vitro. Our observations suggest that MIA-602 protects against the H2O2-induced breakdown of the brain endothelium and enhances its integrity by inducing P53, deactivating cofilin, and suppressing the RhoA inflammatory pathway. Thus, GHRH antagonists may offer an exciting possibility for the treatment of pathologies related to the blood brain barrier dysfunction, including the Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.
