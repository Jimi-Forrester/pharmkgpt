35527558|t|Association Between Plasma Biomarkers of Amyloid, Tau, and Neurodegeneration with Cerebral Microbleeds.
35527558|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are a common vascular pathology associated with future intracerebral hemorrhage. Plasma biomarkers of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration may provide a screening avenue to identify those with CMBs, but evidence is conflicting. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between plasma biomarkers (Abeta40, Abeta42, t-tau, p-tau181, p-tau217, neurofilament light chain (NfL)) and CMBs in a population-based study of aging and whether these biomarkers predict higher signal on Abeta-PET imaging in patients with multiple CMBs. METHODS: 712 participants from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging with T2* GRE MRI and plasma biomarkers were included. Biomarkers were analyzed utilizing Simoa (Abeta40, Abeta42, t-tau, NfL) or Meso Scale Discovery (p-tau181, p-tau217) platforms. Cross-sectional associations between CMBs, plasma biomarkers and Abeta-PET were evaluated using hurdle models and multivariable regression models. RESULTS: Among the 188 (26%) individuals with>=1 CMB, a lower plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio was associated with more CMBs after adjusting for covariables (IRR 568.5 95% CI 2.8-116,127). No other biomarkers were associated with risk or number CMBs. In 81 individuals with>=2 CMBs, higher plasma t-tau, p-tau181, and p-tau217 all were associated with higher Abeta-PET signal, with plasma p-tau217 having the strongest predictive value (r2 0.603, AIC -53.0). CONCLUSION: Lower plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and higher plasma p-tau217 were associated with brain amyloidosis in individuals with CMBs from the general population. Our results suggest that in individuals with multiple CMBs and/or lobar intracranial hemorrhage that a lower plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio or elevated p-tau217 may indicate underlying cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
