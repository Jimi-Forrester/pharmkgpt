14746126|t|Relationships between families and registered nurses in long-term-care facilities: a critical analysis.
14746126|a|Although much has been written about the relationship between families and nurses, little systematic analysis has been undertaken of this dyadic relationship in long-term care (LTC). Using a critical ethnographic approach, the researchers conducted separate in-depth interviews with 17 family-nurse dyads caring for residents with Alzheimer disease or a related disorder in one LTC setting. Analysis of interview transcripts and fieldnotes revealed 4 types of family-nurse relationships--conventional, competitive, collaborative, and "carative"--each reflecting the roles of nurse and family, negotiating strategies, and consequences. In addition, it became apparent that intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence the development of certain types of relationships. The findings have implications for nursing practice, policy development, and further research within LTC settings.
