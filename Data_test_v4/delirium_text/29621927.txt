29621927|t|Skin Conduction Levels Differentiate Frontotemporal Dementia From Alzheimer's Disease.
29621927|a|Patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) differ in basic emotional tone. Skin conduction levels (SCLs), a measure of sympathetic tone, may be a sensitive test for discriminating these two dementias early in their course. Previous research has shown differences in resting SCLs between patients with bvFTD and AD, but no study has evaluated the discriminability of SCLs during different environmental conditions. The authors compared bvFTD patients (N=8), AD patients (N=10), and healthy control subjects (N=9) on SCL measures pertaining to real-life vignettes or scenarios differing in valence and emotional intensity. The SCLs among the bvFTD patients were decreased across all conditions, whereas the SCLs among the AD patients were increased compared with control participants. On analysis, the SCLs in response to emotional stimuli differentiated bvFTD from AD with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 95.3%. At a cutoff <=0.77 muS, emotional vignettes distinguished bvFTD from AD with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 96%. These preliminary results indicate the potential utility of SCLs for differentiating bvFTD from AD early in their course, regardless of environmental condition.
