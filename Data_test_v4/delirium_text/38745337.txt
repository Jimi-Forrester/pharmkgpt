38745337|a|Diet-induced increase in body weight is a growing health concern worldwide. Often accompanied by a low-grade metabolic inflammation that changes systemic functions, diet-induced alterations may contribute to neurodegenerative disorder progression as well. This study aims to non-invasively investigate diet-induced metabolic and inflammatory effects in the brain of an APPPS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. [18F]FDG, [18F]FTHA, and [18F]GE-180 were used for in vivo PET imaging in wild-type and APPPS1 mice. Ex vivo flow cytometry and histology in brains complemented the in vivo findings. 1H- magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the liver, plasma metabolomics and flow cytometry of the white adipose tissue were used to confirm metaflammatory condition in the periphery. We found disrupted glucose and fatty acid metabolism after Western diet consumption, with only small regional changes in glial-dependent neuroinflammation in the brains of APPPS1 mice. Further ex vivo investigations revealed cytotoxic T cell involvement in the brains of Western diet-fed mice and a disrupted plasma metabolome. 1H-magentic resonance spectroscopy and immunological results revealed diet-dependent inflammatory-like misbalance in livers and fatty tissue. Our multimodal imaging study highlights the role of the brain-liver-fat axis and the adaptive immune system in the disruption of brain homeostasis in amyloid models of Alzheimer's disease.
