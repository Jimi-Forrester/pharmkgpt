32485483|t|Schizophrenia and COVID-19 delirium.
32485483|a|Since its outbreak, coronavirus disease 2019 has been producing atypical manifestations aside from fever, coughing and dysnea. One of the most common is delirium, which, however, is highly overlooked. This has consequences in the treatment of patients and also may lead to underdiagnosing the infection. In this work, we present the case of a man diagnosed with schizophrenia, who had been stable for more than 20 years and that presented with an atypical picture of psychotic and confusional symptoms related to COVID-19 infection.
