35673997|t|Physiological Roles of Monomeric Amyloid-beta and Implications for Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutics.
35673997|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) progressively inflicts impairment of synaptic functions with notable deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) as senile plaques within the extracellular space of the brain. Accordingly, therapeutic directions for AD have focused on clearing Abeta plaques or preventing amyloidogenesis based on the amyloid cascade hypothesis. However, the emerging evidence suggests that Abeta serves biological roles, which include suppressing microbial infections, regulating synaptic plasticity, promoting recovery after brain injury, sealing leaks in the blood-brain barrier, and possibly inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells. More importantly, these functions were found in in vitro and in vivo investigations in a hormetic manner, that is to be neuroprotective at low concentrations and pathological at high concentrations. We herein summarize the physiological roles of monomeric Abeta and current Abeta-directed therapies in clinical trials. Based on the evidence, we propose that novel therapeutics targeting Abeta should selectively target Abeta in neurotoxic forms such as oligomers while retaining monomeric Abeta in order to preserve the physiological functions of Abeta monomers.
