12583925|t|Steroid psychosis: a review.
12583925|a|This review is built upon a time-framed perspective to unfold the growth of evidence and the shifting of focus from primary affective short-term reactions to later findings of cognitive deficits and possible permanent impairment linked to steroid treatment. An incidence related to dosage has been documented and delirium and withdrawal symptoms have been reported in later studies. A hypothesis of sensitization process with multiple course of steroids has been proposed with the reporting of recurrent cases. The issue of individual risk appears unsettled while management of psychiatric reactions to steroids has shifted toward prophylactic use of lithium.
