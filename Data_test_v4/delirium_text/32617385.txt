32617385|t|An automated clinical mass spectrometric method for identification and quantification of variant and wild-type amyloid-beta 1-40 and 1-42 peptides in CSF.
32617385|a|INTRODUCTION: We developed an automated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method for multiplex quantification of wild-type (wt) amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides 1-40 (Abeta40) and 1-42 (Abeta42) and detection of variant Abeta peptides in cerebrospinal fluid. METHODS: The multiplex Abeta HPLC-MS/MS assay was validated in a clinically accredited laboratory following regulatory guidelines, with Abeta42 calibration assigned to the ERM/IFCC certified reference material; sequence variants were additionally multiplexed into the method. RESULTS: Sample preparation was fully automated on a liquid handler. The assay quantified wt-Abeta42 and wt-Abeta40 and detected sequence variants, when present, within the Abeta42 sequence. DISCUSSION: Extension of the HPLC-MS/MS approach for quantification of wt-Abeta42 and wt-Abeta40 to include known sequence variants increases analytical accuracy of the mass spectrometric approach and enables identification of cases of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. Development of an automated workflow and selection of appropriate instrumentation enabled deployment of this method in routine clinical testing.
