34704455|t|The Value of Clock Drawing Process Assessment in Screening for Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Dementia.
34704455|a|Many clock drawing test (CDT) scoring systems focus on drawing results and lack drawing process assessments. This study created a CDT scoring procedure with drawing process assessment and explored its diagnostic value in screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD) from normal control (NC). We used logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to determine a new, sensitive scoring system for AD and MCI patients in a derivation cohort. The new scoring method was then compared to two common scoring systems and externally validated in a second cohort. We developed a new scoring system named CDT5, which contained one process assessment item: remember setting time without asking. Compared with two published scoring systems, CDT5 had better discriminatory power in distinguishing AD patients from NCs in derivation (area under the ROC curve [area under the curve, AUC] = .890) and validation (AUC = .867) cohorts. Three scoring systems had poor diagnostic accuracy at discriminating MCI patients from controls, with CDT5 being the most sensitive (78.57%). Adding the drawing process in CDT helps accurately detect patients with early AD, but its role in identifying patients with MCI needs to be further explored.
