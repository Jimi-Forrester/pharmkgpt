METHOD: Ninety children aged 3 to 6 years who underwent elective strabismus surgery were randomly divided into 3 groups that received 0.5 mg/kg (group S1), 1 mg/kg of esketamine (group S2), and the same volume of normal saline (group C) by nasal spray 10 minutes before surgery. The observation indicators of this test include the Ramsay sedation score, separation anxiety score, mask induction score, and the incidences of postoperative emergence agitation. Patient's heart rate, blood oxygen, post anesthesia care unit stay time, and any adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: The Ramsay sedation score was significantly lower in group C than those in groups S1 and S2 (P < .001). The separation anxiety scores and the mask induction scores were significantly higher in group C than those in groups S1 and S2 (P < .001). The incidences of emergence agitation in groups S1 and S2 were significantly lower than that in C group (P < .001). No obvious clinical complication was observed. CONCLUSION: Preoperative nasal spray esketamine reduced the preoperative separation anxiety and decrease emergence agitation in pediatric strabismus surgery.
