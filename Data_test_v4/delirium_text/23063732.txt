23063732|t|Incidence and predictive factors of delirium in hospitalised neurological patients.
23063732|a|INTRODUCTION: Delirium is a condition with a high prevalence in hospitalised patients (10%-30%), and it has important prognostic implications. There are few prospective studies of the incidence of delirium in Spain, and most of these were carried out in surgical wards or intensive care units. Our objective is to calculate the incidence of delirium in a neurological department and describe characteristics of affected patients. METHODS: Longitudinal descriptive study including all patients admitted to the neurology department in an 8-week period. The CAM score for diagnosing delirium was recorded on the first, second and fifth day of hospitalisation and we recorded demographic data, medical history, analytical data (including inflammatory markers), use of anticholinergic treatments, cognitive and functional state at admission, reason for admission, length of stay, and other events during hospitalisation. RESULTS: We studied 115 patients and found an incidence of delirium of 16.52%. There was a significant correlation between delirium and age, cognitive state at admission according to the Pfeiffer test, functional situation at admission according to the Canadian Neurological Scale, kidney failure, history of stroke, anticholinergic treatment, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein. These patients were also hospitalised for longer periods of time. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm a high incidence of delirium in our geographical area. Although additional studies with larger samples are needed, we would like to emphasise the importance of several risk factors which may enable early detection of patients who are at risk for developing delirium during hospitalisation. This would permit preventive action and early treatment for these patients.
