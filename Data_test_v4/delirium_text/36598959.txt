36598959|a|Hepatic veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS) is a well-recognized complication of allogeneic and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The diagnosis and treatment of VOD/SOS require the involvement of multiple specialists covering a wide range of expertise. Interprofessional team-based medical care is standard practice for patients undergoing HCT and has been shown to improve patient and provider satisfaction, enhance efficiency, and improve patient outcomes, particularly for patients in complex medical situations like those with VOD/SOS post-HCT. Interdisciplinary team-based models focus on the synthesis and harmonization of knowledge and methods from different disciplines to create an integrative approach to patient care that both maximizes the expertise of each involved specialist and encourages thought beyond each specialist's discipline. Multidisciplinary team members provide additive support and work collaboratively with the core team to provide knowledge from their field. The composition of the interdisciplinary HCT team should center on the needs of the patient and institutional resources and involve the expertise of additional multidisciplinary team members based on clinical needs. This review focuses on interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary team-based care of patients with VOD/SOS post-HCT and provides an example of a collaborative VOD/SOS team that includes transplant physicians, nurses, pharmacists, nutrition/dietary specialists, and intensive care teams.
