23919560|t|Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease: an understanding of physiology and pathology.
23919560|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastative neurodegenerative disorder with complex etiology. Neuroinflammation has been found to be an underlying cause of the disease, although it demonstrates significant defensive role and renders the brain immunologically secured. This review focuses on the physiology and pathology of this crucial biological process and the diverse factors involved in and acting in a concerted manner to play a pivotal role either in the physiology or pathology of the disease. We used Pubmed, Pubmed Central, and Medline databases for a period of 3 months. It also summarizes the recent advances in neuroinflammation in both in vitro and in vivo. This review eventually warrants further studies on animal models of AD to unravel the complete pathophysiology of the disease and also accentuates the burgeoning need to protect astrocytes which can become a substantial therapeutic avenue.
