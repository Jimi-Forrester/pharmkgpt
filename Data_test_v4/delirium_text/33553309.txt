33553309|a|BACKGROUND: Oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) is a minimally invasive technique performed through the antero-oblique trajectory to address a wide range of lumbar pathologies. However, it can lead to complications. We reviewed the results of OLIF and discussed the effective methods to avoid such complications. METHODS: Seventy-nine consecutive patients who underwent OLIF between May 2016 and July 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. They were divided into three groups: stand-alone, posterior, and lateral fixation, according to whether they were followed up with auxiliary internal fixation as well as the fixation methods. Preoperative and last follow-up visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were used to assess the improvement in the lower back and leg pain as well as neurological conditions. We analyzed intervertebral disc height (DH), segmental lumbar lordotic angle (SLL), lumbar lordotic angle (LL), pelvic tilt (PT), pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis (PI-LL) mismatch, and the cross-section area (CSA) on axial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image in different groups. Complications, including thigh symptoms, cage subsidence, neurological injury, and vascular injury, were also noted. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were followed up postoperatively for 23.2+-11.5 (range, 12-48) months. Forty-eight (61%) patients underwent stand-alone surgery (without fixation), 15 (19%) patients underwent supplemental percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (posterior fixation), and 16 (20%) patients underwent lateral vertebral instrumentation (lateral fixation). In all three groups, the VAS score and the ODI score had significantly decreased at the final follow-up compared to pre-operation. The DH, SLL, LL, CSA, PT, and PI-LL mismatch had also improved by final follow-up. The most common approach-related complication was thigh symptoms. Of the 79 patients, ipsilateral transient psoas paresis occurred in 9 (11.4%), ipsilateral transient quadriceps weakness in 2 (2.5%), and groin/thigh numbness and pain in 17 (21.5%). Cage subsidence occurred in 8 (10.1%) patients, including five cases of grade 0, one of grade I, and two of grade II. Three (3.8%) patients in this study had a vascular injury. CONCLUSIONS: OLIF is a minimally invasive and effective technique for dealing with degenerative lumbar diseases. However, it should also be noted that this approach carries risks of complications.
