30653772|t|The Life Course Health Development Model: A theoretical research framework for paediatric delirium.
30653772|a|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To create a framework for future research through application and critique of the Life Course Health Development Model to the phenomenon of paediatric delirium. BACKGROUND: Delirium in the paediatric intensive care unit is associated with increased duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay and mortality. Nurses are uniquely positioned at the bedside to identify, prevent and treat delirium. An understanding of the potential long-term consequences of paediatric delirium is necessary to provide impetus for nursing research and practice change. The Life Course Health Development Model is a valuable tool when considering the multiple mechanisms and processes through which the experience of delirium could affect a child's life trajectory. DESIGN: Critical review of the literature through application and critique of the Life Course Health Development Model in the context of paediatric delirium. Gaps in the current understanding of paediatric delirium, as well as future directions for research and practice, are discussed. METHODS: The seven core principles of the model are considered in the context of paediatric delirium. Each of the principles has the potential to further understanding of paediatric delirium and identify areas for future inquiry. This discussion leads to a critique of the ability of the model to lead future research and practice change. CONCLUSIONS: The Life Course Health Development Model depicts a process in which the acute and severe stress of critical illness leads to maladaptive neurologic changes that contribute to the development of delirium and impair a child's life trajectory. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: By emphasising the potential lifelong consequences for critically ill children who experience delirium, this application of the Life Course Health Development Model will stimulate discussion, research and practice change among paediatric clinicians and researchers.
