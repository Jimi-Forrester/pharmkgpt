36915054|a|BACKGROUND: The correlation and influencing factors of preoperative anxiety, postoperative pain, and delirium in elderly patients undergoing gastrointestinal cancer surgery were explored with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) scale, 10-point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and Confusion Assessment Method Chinese Reversion (CAM-CR) scale. METHODS: A total of 120 patients aged 65 years old who receiving gastrointestinal cancer surgery were enrolled in the study. Perioperative anxiety, pain, and delirium were assessed by the BAI scale, VAS scale, and CAM-CR scale, respectively. The correlation and influencing factors of preoperative high anxiety, postoperative high pain, and postoperative delirium were analyzed. RESULTS: Preoperative high anxiety had a moderate positive correlation with postoperative high pain (P < 0.001, r = 0.410), and had a weak positive correlation with postoperative delirium (P = 0.005, r = 0.281). postoperative high pain had a weak positive correlation with postoperative delirium (P = 0.017, r = 0.236). Type of cancer and surgical approach were considered to be independent risk factors of preoperative high anxiety (P = 0.006 and P = 0.021). Preoperative high anxiety was considered to be an independent risk factor of postoperative high pain (P< 0.001). Age and preoperative high anxiety were considered to be independent risk factors of postoperative delirium (P< 0.001 and P = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients undergoing gastrointestinal cancer surgery had a higher incidence of preoperative anxiety, as well as first-day postoperative pain and first-day postoperative delirium. Factors such as type of cancer, surgical approach and preoperative anxiety had been identified as influencing preoperative anxiety levels; preoperative anxiety had been linked to postoperative pain; and age and preoperative anxiety have been identified as influencing factors of postoperative delirium.
