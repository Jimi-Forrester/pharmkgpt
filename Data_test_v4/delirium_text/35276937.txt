35276937|t|The Mediation Role of the Risk of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Relationship between Lutein and Zeaxanthin and Cognitive Functions among Older Adults in the United States.
35276937|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed lutein and zeaxanthin (L and Z) may influence cognitive function by different mechanisms. Our study aimed to be the first to examine whether the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) mediated the possible association between the dietary intake of L and Z and cognitive function. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of participants aged 60 years or over in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014. Multivariable linear regression was used to investigate the association between the dietary intake of L and Z and cognitive function, and structural equation modeling tested the mediation effect. RESULTS: The fatty liver index for the United States population (US FLI) acted as a mediator in the association between the higher intake of L and Z and the Animal Fluency Test, the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and composite score and mediated 13.89%, 17.87%, and 13.79% of the total association in dietary L and Z intake (14.29%, 13.68%, and 10.34% of the total association in total L and Z intake), respectively. CONCLUSION: Our study indicated the potential role of the risk of NAFLD as a mediator of associations between the dietary intake of L and Z and cognitive function in the geriatric American population.
