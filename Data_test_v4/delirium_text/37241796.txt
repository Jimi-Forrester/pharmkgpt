37241796|t|Advances on the Amaryllidacea Alkaloids Collected in South Africa, Andean South America and the Mediterranean Basin.
37241796|a|The alkaloids are one of the most represented family of natural occurring biological active compounds. Amaryllidaceae are also very well known for their beautiful flower and are thus used as ornamental plants in historic and public gardens. The Amaryllidacea alkaloids constitute an important group that is subdivided into different subfamilies with different carbon skeletons. They are well known from ancient times for their long application in folk medicine, and in particular, Narcissus poeticus L. was known to Hippocrates of Cos (ca. B.C. 460-370), who treated uterine tumors with a formulate prepared from narcissus oil. To date, more than 600 alkaloids of 15 chemical groups exhibiting various biological activities have been isolated from the Amaryllidaceae plants. This plant genus is diffused in regions of Southern Africa, Andean South America and the Mediterranean basin. Thus, this review describes the chemical and biological activity of the alkaloids collected in these regions in the last two decades as weel those of isocarbostyls isolated from Amaryllidaceae in the same regions and same period.
