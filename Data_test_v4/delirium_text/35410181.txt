35410181|a|BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal circulation (ECC) is now being increasingly used in critical care settings. Epileptic seizures are a recognized but under reported complication in patients receiving this care. Acute symptomatic post-operative seizures have been described, as well as remote seizure, mostly in the form of convulsive seizures. Epilepsy has also been reported, although with lower frequency and mainly with convulsive seizures, while different seizure semiology is rarely described. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case series of four patients developing epilepsy with homogeneous features following heart surgery with ECC. We present neurophysiological and neuroradiological data and we describe the peculiar characteristics of epilepsies in terms of seizure semiology, frequency, and drug response. The main features are: an insulo-temporal or parieto-occipital semiology, often multifocal and without loss of consciousness or motor manifestations, a high frequency of seizures but with low impact on daily life, and a good response to anti-epileptic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize a pathogenetic mechanism and we discuss the clinical implications of identifying these forms of epilepsy which tend to be often under-recognized.
