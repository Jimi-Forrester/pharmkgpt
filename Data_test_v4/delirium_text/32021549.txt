32021549|t|Prostaglandins as the Agents That Modulate the Course of Brain Disorders.
32021549|a|Neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases are associated with great morbidity and mortality. Prostaglandins (PGs) are formed by sequential oxygenation of arachidonic acid in physiologic and pathologic conditions. For the production of PGs cyclooxygenase is a necessary enzyme that has two isoforms, that are named COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 produces type 1 prostaglandins and on the other hand, COX-2 produces type 2 prostaglandins. Recent studies suggest PGs abnormalities are present in a variety of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. In a disease state, type 2 prostaglandins are mostly responsible and type 1 PGs are not so important in the disease state. In this review, the importance of prostaglandins especially type 2 in brain diseases has been discussed and their possible role in the initiation and outcome of brain diseases has been assessed. Overall the studies suggest prostaglandins are the agents that modulate the course of brain diseases in a positive or negative manner. Here in this review article, the various aspects of PGs in the disease state have discussed. It appears more studies must be done to understand the exact role of these agents in the pathophysiology of brain diseases. However, the suppression of prostaglandin production may confer the alleviation of some brain diseases.
