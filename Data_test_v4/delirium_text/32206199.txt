32206199|a|The task of caring for a family member with dementia is associated with caregiver physical and emotional problems. The patient's decline in health and specific needs contribute directly to this situation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate burden, stress, depression and anxiety symptoms in family caregivers of elderly with Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational and quantitative study was carried out. The sample consisted of 66 family caregivers of elderly with Alzheimer's disease, whom attended the Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology Outpatient Clinic of the Federal University of Sao Carlos, in the city of Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil. RESULTS: Of the caregivers evaluated in the severe AD subgroup, 47.3% had intense burden; 86, 4% exhibited significant stress levels; 57% presented severe anxiety levels and 36.9% presented mild depression symptoms. CONCLUSION: Caring for a family member with Alzheimer's disease generates burden, stress, anxiety and depression. Support groups comprising a multiprofessional team can be set up to assist caregivers. These actions can help caregivers cope with the daily demands and challenges and ensure better care quality in an increasingly aging population.
