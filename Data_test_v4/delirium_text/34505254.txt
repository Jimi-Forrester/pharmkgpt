34505254|t|Evaluation of the impact of cataract surgery on cognitive function in very elderly patients: a prospective, observational study.
34505254|a|AIM: To evaluate the impact of cataract surgery on cognitive function in very elderly patients (>= 85 years). METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized, comparative study of very elderly patients (>= 85 years), and elderly patients (>= 65 < 85 years) scheduled for first time cataract surgery. Cognitive function, quality of life (QoL), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), endothelial cell count (ECC), and central corneal thickness (CCT) were assessed at 90 days before surgery (T0), at surgery (T1), and at 30 (T2) and 90 days (T3) after surgery. Macular thickness (MT) was evaluated at T2. Six-item cognitive impairment test (6CIT) was used to evaluate cognitive function while the Catquest-9SF test was used to assess QoL. The confusion assessment method (CAM) was used to evaluate the presence of delirium episodes at within 48 h from T1. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients (very elderly n = 24, elderly n = 54) were enrolled; average age 80.3 +- 6.2 years old. Significant improvements for cognitive function, BCVA, QoL (p < 0.01) during the observational period were observed among the cohort. A greater improvement in cognitive function was observed in the very elderly patients between T1 and T2 (p = 0.02), while there was no difference in BCVA and QoL between the groups. There were no significant differences in ECC and CCT changes between the groups. No delirium episodes or significant macular abnormalities were registered. CONCLUSIONS: Cataract surgery in very elderly patients seems to offer a greater improvement in cognitive function as compared to elderly patients, and it is associated with a significant improvement in QoL, without any incidence of postoperative delirium.
