2872139|t|Delirium: recognition and management in the older patient.
2872139|a|The EEG can be an enormous aid in distinguishing between organic and "functional" problems and between acute drug intoxication and other forms of delirium. The characteristic EEG finding in delirium is bilateral diffuse slowing that parallels the severity of the syndrome. The vulnerability of the elderly cannot be overstressed. Their health and nutritional status, borderline cerebral changes, and sensory deprivation due to impaired vision or hearing are all predisposing factors for delirium.
