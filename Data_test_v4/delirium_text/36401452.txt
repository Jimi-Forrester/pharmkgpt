36401452|a|The incidence and mortality rates of stroke in China are higher than the world average, seriously endangering the public's health and quality of life. It is important to predict the incidence of stroke, identify the high-risk factors in the region, and raise the risk awareness of high-risk groups. This study sought to investigate and analyze the distribution of stroke population and the main risk factors for stroke occurrence in a Chinese population, and to predict the probability of stroke occurrence in high-risk groups with risk factors, so as to provide a scientific basis for the comprehensive prevention and treatment of stroke. A whole-group sampling method was used to investigate 1009 participants in Jingzhou city in central China, and a uniform questionnaire survey and related medical examinations were conducted. The risk factors for stroke in the area were analyzed by univariate analysis, and a multifactorial logistic regression prediction model was established based on the results of univariate analysis. The results of univariate and multifactorial logistic regression analyses suggested that gender, age, family history of stroke, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and sedentary lifestyle were significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke in the local population (all P < .05). The top 5 risk factors for stroke were atrial fibrillation (odds ratio [OR] = 5.225, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.826-9.663), sedentary lifestyle (OR = 2.701, 95% CI: 1.667-4.376), age (>=65 years) (OR = 2.593, 95% CI: 1.680-4.004), hypertension (OR = 2.106, 95% CI: 1.380-3.216), and gender (male) (OR = 2.099, 95% CI: 1.270-3.471). This study effectively identifies the high risk factors for stroke and provides scientific insights for risk assessment, intervention of risk factors, and decision making of health management departments in the central region of China. The modifable risk factors for stroke such as smoking, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, and sedentary lifestyle were also observed. Our findings further highlight the significant of the primary and secondary prevention for stroke and reveal the potential targets to reduce the heavy stroke burden in China around the world.
