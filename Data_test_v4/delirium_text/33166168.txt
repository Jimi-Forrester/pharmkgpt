33166168|a|Little is known about the association between personality and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, and existing results are inconsistent. We aimed to determine whether personality was associated with beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation in cognitively normal aging. One hundred twenty-nine participants were included in this cross-sectional study. Personality was measured with the Big Five Inventory (BFI) and brain Abeta deposition was assessed with [11C] Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Conscientiousness scores had a negative association with global PiB distribution volume ratio (DVR) in all participants after adjusting for age, sex, education, and vascular risk factors (beta[SE] = -0.19[0.09], 95% confidence interval [CI: -0.35, -0.02], p = .031), while agreeableness, extraversion, neuroticism, and openness had no association with global PiB DVR. Assuming the relative stability of personality traits, these findings suggest that conscientiousness may protect against Abeta accumulation in cognitively normal aging through mechanisms that are as yet unknown.
