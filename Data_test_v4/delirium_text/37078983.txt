37078983|a|BACKGROUND: A modified aortic arch "island anastomosis" with a stent graft technique was used in 33 patients with acute type A aortic dissection. We retrospectively reviewed our experience of this procedure and the short-term follow-up results. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 33 patients with acute type A aortic dissection undergoing the modified aortic arch island anastomosis with stent graft procedure. Postoperatively, computed tomography angiography images were obtained before discharge and at 12 months. RESULTS: All patients underwent successful surgery without intraoperative death. Three patients received dialysis because of postoperative renal insufficiency, 1 patient received tracheotomy because of postoperative respiratory insufficiency, and 5 patients had postoperative delirium. Surgery caused stroke in 1 patient. No paraplegia was found, and no re-exploration for bleeding was performed. One patient died in the hospital due to multiple organ failure, and the other patients were discharged as expected. Only 1 patient had a proximal endoleak, and the patient was stable under close follow-up. The diameter of the descending thoracic aorta was smaller at 12 months postoperatively than preoperatively (34.5+-2.5 mm versus 36.7+-2.9 mm, P<0.05). The average diameter of the true lumen of the descending thoracic aorta was larger at 12 months postoperatively than preoperatively (24.1+-3.1 mm versus 14.9+-2.3 mm, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The modified aortic arch island anastomosis with stent graft technique is a feasible and safety surgical strategy for acute type A aortic dissection. Short-term outcomes are satisfactory.
