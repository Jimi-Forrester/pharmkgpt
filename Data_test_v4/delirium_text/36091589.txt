36091589|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease and our current treatment approach can only delay its course rather than cure it completely. Flavones from Vitis vinifera L. have been reported to promote synaptic plasticity and indirectly affect the expression of cholinergic neurotransmitters in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease. Objective: The aim of the study is to explore the effect of Vitis vinifera L. in APP/PS1 Alzheimer model mice. Methods: APP/PS1 AD mice were used as the research subjects, and the mice were divided into a model group, donepezil group, VTF low-dose group, VTF medium-dose group, and VTF high-dose group. C57BL/6 mice served as a control group. The autophagosomes were observed by a transmission electron microscope, and the expressions of LC3I, LC3IIand Beclin-1 were determined by Western blotting. The results of qRT-PCR are consistent with Western blotting. Results: VTF can exert a positive regulatory effect on AD mice by inhibiting autophagy. Conclusion: Our study supports that intragastrically administration of VTF is effective and operable in Alzheimer's disease mice, and that inhibition of excessive autophagy may be one of the potential reasons why VTF exerts a therapeutic effect on AD.
