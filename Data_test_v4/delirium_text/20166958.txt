20166958|t|5-HT6 receptor antagonists as potential therapeutics for cognitive impairment.
20166958|a|Cognitive impairment (CI) has been recognized as a core feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia. The 5-HT(6) receptor is an attractive target for the development of cognitive enhancers due to its unique localization and pharmacology. 5-HT(6) receptor antagonists have been shown to modulate multiple neurotransmitter systems and therefore enhance cognition in preclinical studies. This premise translated into the clinical efficacy of the 5-HT(6) receptor antagonist SB-742457 in mild-to-moderate AD patients. Advances in the understanding of the structure-activity-relationship, the design of novel 5-HT(6) receptor ligands and their potential application for the treatment of CI are reviewed.
