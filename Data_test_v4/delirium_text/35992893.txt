35992893|t|Identification of individuals at risk for postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD).
35992893|a|Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is common, occurring in around 10-54% of individuals within first few weeks after surgery. Although the majority of POCD is less commonly persistent later than 3 months following surgery, the condition increases length of stay (LOS), mortality and long-term cognitive decline, raising the need for a broad screening to identify individuals at risk for POCD during the perioperative period. In this narrative review, we summarize preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative risk factors for POCD reported in last 5 years and discuss neuropsychological tools and potential biomarkers and time points for assessment that might be suitable for clinical use. We aim to provide crucial information for developing a strategy of routine screening for POCD, which may assist with better identification of at-risk individuals for early interventions. Very importantly, the utilization of a standardized strategy may also allow higher consistency and comparability across different studies.
