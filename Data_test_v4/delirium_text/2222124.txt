2222124|a|A follow-up study after one or two years of treatment was carried out on 107 AIDS patients who were seen by the Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Unit of the Ramon y Cajal Hospital. The sample was reduced to 52 patients (49%) mainly due to the lack of check-ups in 43% and to the death of 8% of the cases. 36% of patients suffered from Delirium or Dementia and these had the greater mortality rate. Grade IV patients and those with a diagnosis of Adjustment Disorders came to the check-ups most frequently.
