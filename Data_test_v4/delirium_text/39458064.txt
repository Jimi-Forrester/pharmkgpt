39458064|a|Background: There is still limited evidence on the results of prehabilitation in very old frail patients. The aim of this study is to analyze the outcomes and course of octogenarian and nonagenarian patients undergoing prehabilitation before surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods: a prospective study was conducted in a tertiary hospital from 2018 to 2022. All patients diagnosed with CRC over 80 years old and proposed for surgery were included. A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) for frailty detection was performed, and the therapeutic decision was taken by the multidisciplinary tumor committee. Prehabilitation led by the geriatric team was performed. The rate of medical and surgical complications, hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, and first-year mortality were recorded. Results: CRC surgery was proposed in 184 patients >80 years. After a multidisciplinary decision, surgery was performed on 126 (68.5%) patients, of whom 12 (0.5%) were nonagenarians. Fifty percent of octogenarians and 86% of nonagenarians were frail. Prehabilitation consisted of the following: adapted physical exercise (100%); oral nutritional supplementation (73.8%); anemia treatment (59.5%); delirium prevention (5.6%); antidepressant treatment (15.9%); vitamin D supplementation (21.4%); and pharmacological deprescription (38.1%). The post-surgical complication rate was low (4.3% surgical and 29.4% medical complications), and in-hospital mortality was very low (3.2%). Nonagenarian patients had a higher rate of complications compared to octogenarians (OR 4.0 (95% CI 1.13-14.12))-mainly heart failure (OR 4.68 (95% CI 1.21-18.09))-but there were no differences in hospital stay or first-year mortality. Conclusions: prehabilitation in very old patients with CRC surgery is possible and provides good results.
