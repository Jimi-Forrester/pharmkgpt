24059786|t|Propofol infusion syndrome resuscitation with extracorporeal life support: a case report and review of the literature.
24059786|a|We report a case of propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS) in a young female treated for status epilepticus. In this case, PRIS rapidly evolved to full cardiovascular collapse despite aggressive supportive care in the intensive care unit, as well as prompt discontinuation of the offending agent. She progressed to refractory cardiac arrest requiring emergent initiation of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). She regained a perfusing rhythm after prolonged (>8 hours) asystole, was weaned off ECMO and eventually all life support, and was discharged to home. We also present a review of the available literature on the use of ECMO for PRIS.
