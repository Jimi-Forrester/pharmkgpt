38346720|a|PURPOSE: The number of studies conducted on the role of neuroinflammation in the etiopathogenesis of bipolar disorder has been increasing in recent years. The role of Galectin-1, Galectin-9, and YKL-40, which are considered to play roles in neuroinflammation and the etiopathogenesis of bipolar disorder, and the relationship of these parameters with cognitive functions were investigated in the present study. METHOD: Serum Galectin-1, Galectin-9, and YKL-40 levels were measured with the ELISA Method in 64 bipolar euthymic patients and 64 healthy controls. The Stroop and trail-making tests were administered to assess cognitive functions in all participants. RESULTS: Serum Galectin-1, Galectin-9, and YKL-40 levels were statistically and significantly lower in the patient group when compared to the healthy control group. The scores of the Stroop test and trail-making tests were statistically higher in the patient group than in the healthy control group. There was a weak and positive correlation between serum Galectin-1, Galectin-9, and YKL-40 levels and cognitive performance in all participants. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Statistically significant low levels of serum Galectin-1, Galectin-9, and YKL-40 detected in the patient group suggest that these parameters have important roles in neuroinflammation. The statistically higher Stroop and trail-making test scores of the patient group compared to the control group indicates that the cognitive performance of the patient group was weaker. Also, the positive correlation between Galectin-1, Galectin-9, and YKL-40 levels and cognitive performance suggests that these molecules may have a neuroprotective role. We think that the present study will contribute to this field where there is very limited data in the literature.
