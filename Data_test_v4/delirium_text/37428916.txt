37428916|a|Although microglia possess the unique ability to migrate, whether mobility is evident in all microglia, is sex dependent, and what molecular mechanisms drive this, is not well understood in the adult brain. Using longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging of sparsely labeled microglia, we find a relatively small population of microglia (~5%) are mobile under normal conditions. Following injury (microbleed), the fraction of mobile microglia increased in a sex-dependent manner, with male microglia migrating significantly greater distances toward the microbleed relative to their female counterparts. To understand the signaling pathways involved, we interrogated the role of interferon gamma (IFNgamma). Our data show that in male mice, stimulating microglia with IFNgamma promotes migration whereas inhibiting IFNgamma receptor 1 signaling inhibits them. By contrast, female microglia were generally unaffected by these manipulations. These findings highlight the diversity of microglia migratory responses to injury, its dependence on sex and the signaling mechanisms that modulate this behavior.
