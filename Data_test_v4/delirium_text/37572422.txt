37572422|t|A prospective randomized study examining the impact of intravenous versus inhalational anesthesia on postoperative cognitive decline and delirium.
37572422|a|The present prospective randomized study was designed to investigate whether the development of Post Operative Cognitive Decline (POCD) is related to anesthesia type in older adults. All patients were screened for delirium and mental status, received baseline neuropsychological assessment, and evaluation of activities of daily living (ADLs). Follow-up assessments were performed at 3-6 months and 12-18 months. Patients were randomized to receive either inhalation anesthesia (ISO) with isoflurane or total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol for maintenance anesthesia. ISO (n = 99) and TIVA (n = 100) groups were similar in demographics, preoperative cognition, and incidence of post-operative delirium. Groups did not differ in terms of mean change in memory or executive function from baseline to follow-up. Pre-surgical cognitive function is the only variable predictive of the development of POCD. Anesthetic type was not predictive of POCD. However, ADLs were predictive of post-operative delirium development. Overall, this pilot study represents a prospective, randomized study demonstrating that when examining ISO versus TIVA for maintenance of general anesthesia, there is no significant difference in cognition between anesthetic types. There is also no difference in the occurrence of postoperative delirium. Postoperative cognitive decline was best predicted by lower baseline cognition and functional status.
