36349106|a|Artificial catalytic DNA circuits that can identify, transduce and amplify the biomolecule of interest have supplemented a powerful toolkit for visualizing various biomolecules in cancer cells. However, the non-specific response in normal tissues and the low abundance of analytes hamper their extensive biosensing and biomedicine applications. Herein, by combining tumor-responsive MnO2 nanoparticles with a specific stimuli-activated cascade DNA amplifier, we propose a multiply guaranteed and amplified ATP-sensing platform via the successive cancer-selective probe exposure and stimulation procedures. Initially, the GSH-degradable MnO2 nanocarrier, acting as a tumor-activating module, ensures the accurate delivery of the cascade DNA amplifier into GSH-rich cancer cells and simultaneously provides adequate Mn2+ cofactors for facilitating the DNAzyme biocatalysis. Then, the released cascade amplifier, acting as an ATP-monitoring module, fulfills the precise and sensitive analysis of low-abundance ATP in cancer cells where the catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA) is integrated with the DNAzyme biocatalyst for higher signal gain. Additionally, the cascade catalytic amplifier achieved tumor-specific activated photodynamic therapy (PDT) after integrating an activatable photosensitizer into the system. This homogeneous cascade catalytic aptasensing circuit can detect low-abundance endogenous ATP of cancer cells, due to its intrinsically rich recognition repertoire and avalanche-mimicking hierarchical acceleration, thus demonstrating broad prospects for analyzing clinically important biomolecules and the associated physiological processes.
