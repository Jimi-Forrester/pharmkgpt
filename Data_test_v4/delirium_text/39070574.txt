39070574|a|Background: Delirium is a preventable and reversible complication for intensive care unit (ICU) patients, which can be linked to negative outcomes. Early intervention to cope with the risk factors of delirium is necessary. Yet no specific description of the Artificial Intelligence Assisted Prevention and Management for Delirium (AI-AntiDelirium) following the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist was reported. This is the first study to describe a detailed process for the development of an evidence-based delirium intervention. Aims: To describe an individualised delirium intervention which is delivered by an artificial intelligence-assisted system in the ICU for critically ill patients. Methods and results: The TIDieR checklist improved the description of ICU delirium interventions, including several key features for improved implementation of the intervention. This descriptive research describes the AI-assisted ICU delirium interventions for improving cognitive load and adherence of nurses and reducing ICU delirium incidence. Following the TIDieR checklist, we standardised the flow chart of ICU delirium assessment tools; formed an evaluation sheet of ICU delirium risk factors; and translated the evidence-based ABCDEF bundle intervention into practice. Therefore, nurses and researchers would benefit from replicating the interventions for clinical use or experimental research. Conclusions: The TIDieR checklist provided a systematic approach for reporting the complex ICU delirium interventions delivered in a clinical interventional trial, which contributes to the nursing practice policy for the standardisation of interventions.
