35733173|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the safety of direct innominate arterial (IA) cannulation using a pediatric arterial cannula to establish selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) during total arch replacement (TAR) for acute Stanford type A aortic dissection (ATAAD). METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with ATAAD who underwent TAR with the frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique between October 2020 and November 2021. Patients treated with direct IA cannulation using a pediatric arterial cannula for selective anterograde cerebral perfusion were included in the study. RESULTS: Of the 29 patients, 24 (82.8%) were male. The average age was 50.9 +- 9.47 years. Proximal repair included aortic root plasty (27 patients, [93.1%]) and Bentall surgery (2 patients, [6.9%]). Perioperative mortality and stroke rates were 3.4% and 6.9%, respectively. The mean lowest core temperature was 23.8 +- 0.74  C and the mean ACP time was 25 +- 6.4 min. The aortic cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass times were 141 +- 28 and 202 +- 29 min, respectively. There were no cases of IA injuries. CONCLUSION: Direct IA cannulation using a pediatric arterial cannula is a simple, safe, and effective technique for establishing ACP during TAR with the FET technique for ATAAD and can avoid the potential complications of axillary artery cannulation.
