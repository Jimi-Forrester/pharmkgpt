34952243|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological illness that causes dementia mainly in the elderly. The challenging obstacles related to AD has freaked global healthcare system to encourage scientists in developing novel therapeutic startegies to overcome with the fatal disease. The current treatment therapy of AD provides only symptomatic relief and to some extent disease-modifying effects. The current approach for AD treatment involves designing of cholinergic inhibitors, Abeta disaggregation inducing agents, tau inhibitors and several antioxidants. Hence, extensive research on AD therapy urgently requires a deep understanding of its pathophysiology and exploration of various chemical scaffolds to design and develop a potential drug candidate for the treatment. Various issues linked between disease and therapy need to be considered such as BBB penetration capability, clinical failure and multifaceted pathophisiology requires a proper attention to develop a lead candidate. This review article covers all probable mechanisms including one of the recent areas for investigation i.e., lipid dyshomeostasis, pathogenic involvement of P. gingivalis and neurovascular dysfunction, recently reported molecules and drugs under clinical investigations and approved by FDA for AD treatment. Our summarized information on AD will attract the researchers to understand and explore current status and structural modifications of the recently reported heterocyclic derivatives in drug development for AD therapy.
