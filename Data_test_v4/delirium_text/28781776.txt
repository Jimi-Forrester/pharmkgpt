28781776|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder and it is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. Early onset AD is caused by mutations in three genes: Amyloid-beta precursor protein, presenilin 1 (PSEN1) and PSEN2. Late onset AD (LOAD) is complex and apolipoprotein E is the only unanimously accepted genetic risk factor for its development. Various genes implicated in AD have been identified using advanced genetic technologies, however, there are many additional genes that remain unidentified. The present review highlights the genetics of early and LOAD and summarizes the genes involved in different signaling pathways. This may provide insight into neurodegenerative disease research and will facilitate the development of effective strategies to combat AD.
