37964035|a|The clinical course of Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) is highly variable. Delayed diagnosis and treatment still remain actual challenges. Moreover, there is a lack of studies analyzing the factors associated with different LNB syndromes. We aimed to analyze clinical and epidemiological features of LNB in hospitalized adults in eastern Lithuania. A retrospective study was performed for patients presenting in the years 2010-2021. A total of 103 patients were included in the study, 100 with early, and three with late LNB. Patients with early LNB most often presented polyradiculitis [75/100, (75%)], which was also the most common initial neurological syndrome. Peripheral facial palsy was diagnosed in 53/100 (53%) patients, in 16/53 (30.2%) cases both facial nerves were affected. Encephalitis or myelitis was diagnosed in 14% of patients with LNB. A total of 76/103 (73.8%) patients were discharged with residual symptoms or signs. One patient presenting encephalomyelitis died because of bacterial complications. The absence of observed erythema migrans (EM) was the predictor of peripheral facial palsy, while female sex and EM untreated with antibiotics were predictors of isolated polyradiculitis. A fever of >= 38    C and pleocytosis of >= 300 x 106/l were associated with the development of encephalitis or myelitis in patients with early LNB.
