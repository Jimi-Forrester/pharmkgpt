10893746|a|INTRODUCTION: Form part of the clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease. These disorders may present in varying degrees: whilst in some patients a clinical picture of dementia is seen, in others there are only specific symptoms. DEVELOPMENT: In this article we consider three of the most controversial aspects currently dominating study of the neuropsychology of Parkinson's disease. The first relates to the pathophysiological basis and neurotransmitters involved. The second deals with the distinction between subcortical-type and Alzheimer-type dementia, and the third with the pathophysiological basis underlying the cognitive profile of the subgroups of patients with Parkinson's disease who do not present dementia. CONCLUSION: The relation between the factors causing the disease, neuropathology, individual variables and the presence of these subgroups requires precise systematic investigation of the neuropsychology shown by patients with Parkinson's disease.
