Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most practical method for diagnostic purposes in AD. The aim of the study was to determine the volume of the hippocampus and intracranial structures in AD using MRI. METHODS: A total of 102 patients with AD were classified based on the mini mental test scores as early, moderate, and advanced stage. The control group included 35 healthy subjects. MRI were compared between the patients and control groups based on the calculations made utilizing volBrain software. Intracranial volumetric parameters were also compared between the three stages of AD. RESULTS: The white matter volumes, total hippocampus, total cerebrum, right cerebrum, left cerebrum, truncus encephalic, total nucleus caudatus and total corpus amygdaloideum were significantly increased in the AD. The white matter volumes, right hippocampus, left hippocampus, total cerebrum, left cerebrum, and right cerebellum were significantly increased in the patients in the early stage compared to the patients in the advanced stage AD. DISCUSSION: The most efficient volumetric study in AD could be performed by obtaining long-term periodic morphometric data of an early diagnosed and regularly followed-up patient population.
