33761656|a|ABSTRACT: Older adults are the leading users of medications, where this can be associated with a high number of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) and of potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) and consequent harm to health. No Brazilian study evaluating potentially inappropriate prescribing in older patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) was found. This study determined and analyzed the prevalence of PIP and PIM prescribed for older people with AD.A cross-sectional study was carried out at the Specialty Drugs Pharmacy in the city of Sorocaba, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The MEDEX system provided the register in older people with AD and data were collected during interviews with patients and/or caregivers between June and September 2017. The PIMs were identified according to the 2019 Beers Criteria. The association between PIMs and independent variables was analyzed by Poisson regression.This study included 234 older patients with AD. The prevalence of PIP prescribed was 66.7% (n = 156). Of the 1073 medications prescribed, 30.5% (n = 327) were inappropriate with most affecting the central nervous system or cardiovascular, particularly quetiapine (12.8%) and acetylsalicylic acid (11.6%), respectively. Around 45.2% of the PIMs should be avoided in older people, especially sertraline (14.2%) and clonazepam (7.4%). After adjusted analysis, the PIMs were associated with the diagnosis of depression (P = 0.010) and the number of comorbidities (P = 0.005).There was a high number of PIMs among older people, a substantial number of which should have been avoided in this population. Health care professionals can apply these findings to improve safety in the use of medications for treating patients with AD.
