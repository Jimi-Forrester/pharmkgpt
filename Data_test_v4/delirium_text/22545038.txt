22545038|a|BACKGROUND: Subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD) has been proposed as the most frequent subtype of vascular cognitive impairment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Chinese (Cantonese) Montreal Cognitive Assessment (CC-MoCA) in patients with SIVD in the Guangdong Province of China. METHODS: 71 SIVD patients and 60 matched controls were recruited for the CC-MoCA, Mini Mental State Examination and executive clock drawing tasks. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses were performed to determine optimal sensitivity and specificity of the CC-MoCA total score in differentiating mild vascular dementia (VaD) patients from moderate VaD patients and controls. RESULTS: The mean CC-MoCA scores of the controls, and mild and moderate VaD patients were 25.2 +- 3.8, 16.4 +- 3.7, and 10.0 +- 5.1, respectively. In our study, the optimal cutoff value for the CC-MoCA to be able to differentiate patients with mild VaD from controls is 21/22, and 13/14 to differentiate mild VaD from moderate VaD. CONCLUSION: The CC-MoCA is a useful cognitive screening instrument in SIVD patients.
