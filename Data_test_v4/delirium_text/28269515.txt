28269515|t|Measures of the brain functional network that correlate with Alzheimer's neuropsychological test scores: An fMRI and graph analysis study.
28269515|a|Neural degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to structural topology deformation that in turn changes brain functionality. The main aim of the present study is to find the brain's functional connectivity network (FCN) correlates of Alzheimer's psychological test scores. To this end, the brain's FCN is extracted from the resting state functional magnetic resonance images (rs-fMRI) of healthy controls and patients with AD and represented as a graph. Then, network measures are calculated from the graphs. The correlations between the brain network measures and five AD psychological assessment test scores are evaluated. The results show positive correlation between the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and nodal strength in the left insula and negative correlation between the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score and local efficiency of left olfactory cortex and also eigenvector centrality of left supramarginal cortex. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) also seems to be correlated with network measures of the left superior parietal gyrus. Moreover, notable decreased continuity are spotted in the limbic system. These measures can be used to provide an objective tool for AD diagnosis.
