32183741|a|BACKGROUND: Antimuscarinics are often used for treatment of overactive bladder (OAB), but exposure to medications such as antimuscarinics that have anticholinergic properties has been linked to adverse cognitive effects. A phase 4 placebo-controlled study (PILLAR; NCT02216214) described the efficacy and safety of mirabegron, a beta3-adrenoreceptor agonist, for treatment of wet OAB in patients aged >=65 years. This pre-planned analysis aimed to measure differences in cognitive function between mirabegron and placebo, using a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive impairment: the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). METHODS: Outpatients aged >=65 years with wet OAB were randomized 1:1 to mirabegron or placebo, stratified by age (<75/>=75 years). There were no exclusion criteria regarding cognitive status. Patients randomized to mirabegron initially received 25 mg/day with an optional increase to 50 mg/day after week 4/8 based on patient/investigator discretion. The MoCA was administered at baseline and end of treatment (EoT, week 12). The study protocol was Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board-approved. RESULTS: Of the 887 randomized patients who received >=1 dose of study drug, 72.3% were female, 79.5% were white, and 28.1% were aged >=75 years. All patients had >=1 comorbidity and 94.3% were receiving >=1 concomitant medication. One third of patients had a history of psychiatric disorders, the most common being depression (17.2%), insomnia (15.7%), and anxiety (11.4%). Baseline mean (standard error, SE) MoCA total scores were 26.9 (0.1) and 26.8 (0.1) in the mirabegron and placebo groups, respectively. Among patients with MoCA data available at baseline/EoT, 27.1% (115/425) and 25.8% (106/411) of mirabegron and placebo group patients, respectively, had impaired cognitive function at baseline (MoCA total score <26). There was no statistically significant change in adjusted mean (SE) MoCA total score from baseline to EoT in the mirabegron group (-0.2 [0.1]) or the placebo group (-0.1 [0.1]). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with mirabegron for 12 weeks did not contribute to drug-related cognitive side effects in patients aged >=65 years, as measured by the MoCA. Furthermore, the pattern of change in cognition over time in an older OAB trial population does not appear to differ from that of subjects receiving placebo.
