39465829|t|A case report of effective treatment of intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis treated with the integration of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine.
39465829|a|RATIONALE: Intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) represents a prevalent global cause of stroke, posing a notably higher risk of stroke recurrence than other stroke etiologies. Herein, we report a case of a 39-year-old male patient diagnosed with ICAS, treated through an integrated approach incorporating Chinese and Western medicine with significant efficacy and satisfied clinical safety. PATIENT CONCERNS: This patient presented with 1 transient ischemic attack and prolonged headache, dizziness and poor sleep quality. In addition, the patient refused to undergo surgery due to the high cost and postoperative risks. DIAGNOSES: Diagnostic methods used to identify ICAS include conventional cerebral angiography, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), CT angiography (CTA), transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD), and High-Resolution Magnetic resonance imaging. Considering the cost and risks associated with conventional angiography, noninvasive imaging has emerged as the method of choice for diagnosing ICAS. After a series of noninvasive examinations (CTA, TCD, and HR-MRI), the patient was diagnosed with ICAS. INTERVENTIONS: The western medical regimen includes antiplatelet coagulation, blood pressure control, lipid regulation, plaque stabilization, and lifestyle modifications such as exercise, weight loss, and adherence to low-salt, low-fat diets. Complementing this, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment was guided by the principle of strengthening the spleen, resolving dampness, nourishing blood and harmonizing ying, resolving blood stasis and clearing collaterals. This involved the administration oral Chinese medicine such as modified Shenling Baizhu powder and modified Si Wu decoction. OUTCOMES: The efficacy of the treatment was assessed by evaluating the degree of luminal stenosis and peak systolic blood flow velocity in the M1 segment of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) before and after the intervention. Encouragingly, posttreatment results demonstrated the disappearance of the plaque in the left MCA-M1 segment, with no significant lumen stenosis observed. Moreover, a notable and smooth reduction in blood flow velocity was achieved in the left MCA, indicating positive outcomes from the integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine approach. CONCLUSION: This case report shows that a combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine is safe and effective in the treatment of ICAS and is worthy of promotion in the clinic.
