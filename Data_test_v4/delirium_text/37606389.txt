37606389|t|Myc beyond Cancer: Regulation of Mammalian Tissue Regeneration.
37606389|a|Myc is one of the most well-known oncogenes driving tumorigenesis in a wide variety of tissues. From the brain to blood, its deregulation derails physiological pathways that grant the correct functioning of the cell. Its action is carried out at the gene expression level, where Myc governs basically every aspect of transcription. Indeed, in addition to its role as a canonical, chromatin-bound transcription factor, Myc rules RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcriptional pause-release, elongation and termination and mRNA capping. For this reason, it is evident that minimal perturbations of Myc function mirror malignant cell behavior and, consistently, a large body of literature mainly focuses on Myc malfunctioning. In healthy cells, Myc controls molecular mechanisms involved in pivotal functions, such as cell cycle (and proliferation thereof), apoptosis, metabolism and cell size, angiogenesis, differentiation and stem cell self-renewal. In this latter regard, Myc has been found to also regulate tissue regeneration, a hot topic in the research fields of aging and regenerative medicine. Indeed, Myc appears to have a role in wound healing, in peripheral nerves and in liver, pancreas and even heart recovery. Herein, we discuss the state of the art of Myc's role in tissue regeneration, giving an overview of its potent action beyond cancer.
