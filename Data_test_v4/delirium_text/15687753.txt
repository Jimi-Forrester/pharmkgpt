15687753|a|Lithuania, like many European countries, is facing the problem of ageing population. The ageing society is accompanied by an increase in the prevalence of the disorders that are characteristic for old age. This article presents an overview of the current situation with respect to care of patients with dementia in Lithuania. Calculations based on epidemiological studies in other countries reveal that at least 31,000 persons may be suffering from dementia in Lithuania, with 6407 new cases occurring each year. Management of persons with dementia is mainly conducted by psychiatrists and neurologists with a few geriatricians. Mental health centers with interdisciplinary teams assure medical treatment, primary diagnosis of dementia, family consultations, managing of social and psychological problems and visits to homes when needed. Institutional services and home help services for persons with dementia are scarce and underdeveloped. Our future priorities in developing care for people with dementia are to improve the timely diagnosis and comprehensive management of dementia with the establishment of a continuity of high quality social services with special emphasis on home help and the support of family members.
