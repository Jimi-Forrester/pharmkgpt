31450785|t|Mutant Huntingtin Affects Diabetes and Alzheimer's Markers in Human and Cell Models of Huntington's Disease.
31450785|a|A higher incidence of diabetes was observed among family members of individuals affected by Huntington's Disease with no follow-up studies investigating the genetic nature of the observation. Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS), RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis and western blotting of Rattus norvegicus and human, we were able to identify that the gene family of sortilin receptors was affected in Huntington's Disease patients. We observed that less than 5% of SNPs were of statistical significance and that sortilins and HLA/MHC gene expression or SNPs were associated with mutant huntingtin (mHTT). These results suggest that ST14A cells derived from R. norvegicus are a reliable model of HD, since sortilins were identified through analysis of the transcriptome in these cells. These findings help highlight the genes involved in mechanisms targeted by diabetes drugs, such as glucose transporters as well as proteins controlling insulin release related to mHTT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first GWAS using RNA-Seq data from both ST14A rat HD cell model and human Huntington's Disease.
