38501034|t|An Intelligent Classification System for Cancer Detection Based on DNA Methylation Using ML and Semantic Knowledge in Healthcare.
38501034|a|To consistently assess a patient's internal and external wellness and diagnose chronic conditions like cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and cardiovascular disease, wearable sensing devices are being used. Wearable technologies and networking websites have become incredibly common in the medical sector in recent times. The condition of a patient's health can be influenced by a number of factors, including psychological response, emotional stability, and anxiety levels, which can be evaluated using social network analysis based on graph theory-based techniques and these ideas, known as "social network analysis" (SNA) are used to study relationship phenomena. Therefore, numerous uses for SNA in health research are possible, ranging from social science to exact science. For example, it can be used to research cooperative networks of healthcare providers and hazard-prone behaviors, infectious disease transmission, and the spread of initiatives for health promotion and prevention. Recently, a number of machine learning-based healthcare solutions have been proposed to track chronic illnesses utilizing data from social networks and wearable monitoring devices. In our suggested approach, we are using an intelligent system with the assistance of wearable sensors for the classification of cancer based on DNA methylation, an important epigenetic process in the human genome that controls gene expression and has been connected to a number of health issues. A mixed-sampling imbalanced data ensemble classification technique is created with the help of biomedical sensors to address the problem of class imbalance and high dimensionality in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) massive data. This technique is based on the Intelligent Synthetic Minority Oversampling (SMOTE) algorithm. The false-negative rate significantly rises as a result of this, to give a larger data set, a new minority class sample will be first obtained. The noise created during the sample expansion process is actually any data that has been acquired, preserved, or altered in a way that prevents the system that initially conceived it from accessing or utilizing it. Noisy data boosts the amount of space needed excessively and can also drastically influence the findings of any data collection investigation and therefore can also affect the sample sets of one or the other class, resulting in the class imbalance which acts as a common problem in ML datasets. The Tomek Link method is then used to eliminate this noise, producing a reasonably balanced data set. Each layer selects two random forest structures using the cascading forest structure of the deep forest (GC-Forest) algorithm to increase the generalization ability of the model and create the final classification model. Experiments using DNA methylation data collected by employing biosensors from six tumor patients reveal that the mixed-sampling unbalanced data ensemble classification technique may increase the sensitivity to the minority class while maintaining the majority class's classification accuracy.
