38689332|a|BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been a worldwide problem for neurosurgeons. Patients with severe TBI may undergo craniotomy. These patients often require sedation after craniotomy. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) has been used in patients receiving anesthesia and in intensive care units. Not much is known about the postoperative effect of DEX in patients with severe TBIs undergoing craniotomy. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of postoperative DEX administration on severe TBI patients who underwent craniotomy. METHODS: Patients who underwent craniectomy for severe TBI at our hospital between January 2019 and February 2022 were included in this study. The patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after surgery to receive sedative medication. The patients were then divided into DEX and control groups. We analyzed the sedation, hemodynamics, and other conditions of the patients (hypoxemia, duration of ventilation during endotracheal intubation, whether tracheotomy was performed, and the duration in the ICU) during their ICU stay. Other conditions, such as delirium after the patients were transferred to the general ward, were also analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 122 patients were included in this study. Among them, 53 patients received DEX, and the remaining 69 did not. The incidence of delirium in the general ward in the DEX group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The incidence of bradycardia in the control group was significantly lower than that in the DEX group (P < 0.05). Other data from the DEX group and the control group (hypotension, hypoxemia, etc.) were not significantly different (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The use of DEX in the ICU can effectively reduce the incidence of delirium in patients who return to the general ward after craniotomy. DEX had no adverse effect on the prognosis of patients other than causing bradycardia.
