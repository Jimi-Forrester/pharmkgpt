35204564|a|The COVID-19 disease, caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, rapidly transformed into a pandemic following its emergence, and it continues to affect the population at a global level. This disease is associated with high mortality rates and mainly affects the pulmonary spectrum, with signs of interstitial pneumonia or other pathological modifications. Signs indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be observed using pulmonary radiography or computed tomography scans and are closely linked to acute respiratory distress; however, there is accumulating evidence that the virus affects the central nervous system. Several symptoms, such as headaches, cough, fatigue, myalgia, ageusia, and anosmia, have also been reported along with neurological syndromes such as stroke, encephalopathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, convulsions, and coma; the most frequent associated complication is ischemic stroke. Diagnosis of infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus is based on a positive RT-PCR test. Imaging investigations, such as thoracic computed tomography scans, are not used to diagnose COVID-19, monitor for pulmonary disease, or follow dynamic disease evolution, but they may be used in the case of a negative RT-PCR test. This paper presents the research performed on a group of 150 cases of patients affected by neurological disorders and that were subsequently confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, which was carried out over a period of 10 months within the Neurology Department and Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance Imaging of "Sf. Andrei" Emergency Hospital in Constanta. The collected data are observational and provide perspectives on the neurological pathology associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and on the frequently associated risk factors, associated comorbidities, and the ages of patients who were affected by the virus, as well as the clinical and paraclinical manifestations of the patients admitted to the hospital's neurology department.
