23826281|t|Temporal Discounting Is Associated with an Increased Risk of Mortality among Community-Based Older Persons without Dementia.
23826281|a|BACKGROUND: Temporal discounting is an important determinant of many health and financial outcomes, but we are not aware of studies that have examined the association of temporal discounting with mortality. METHODS: Participants were 406 older persons without dementia from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a longitudinal cohort study of aging. Temporal discounting was measured using standard preference elicitation questions. Individual discount rates were estimated using a well-established hyperbolic function and used to predict the risk of mortality during up to 5 years of follow-up. RESULTS: The mean estimate of discounting was 0.45 (SD = 0.33, range: 0.08-0.90), with higher scores indicating a greater propensity to prefer smaller immediate rewards over larger but delayed ones. During up to 5 years of follow-up (mean = 3.6 years), 62 (15% of 406) persons died. In a proportional hazards model adjusted for age, sex, and education, temporal discounting was associated with an increased risk of mortality (HR = 1.103, 95% CI 1.024, 1.190, p = 0.010). Thus, a person with the highest discount rate (score = 0.90) was about twice more likely to die over the study period compared to a person with the lowest discount rate (score = 0.08). Further, the association of discounting with mortality persisted after adjustment for the level of global cognitive function, the burden of vascular risk factors and diseases, and an indicator of psychological well being (i.e., purpose in life). CONCLUSION: Temporal discounting is associated with an increased risk of mortality in old age after accounting for global cognitive function and indicators of physical and mental health.
