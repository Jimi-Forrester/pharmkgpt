30077089|t|Derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells TUSMi006 from an 87-year old Chinese Han Alzheimer's disease patient carrying GRINB and SORL1 mutations.
30077089|a|A 87-year old Alzheimer's Disease(AD) male patient donated his Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The non-integrating episomal vector system was used to reprogram PBMCs with the human OKSM transcription factors. The pluripotency of transgene-free iPSCs was confirmed by immunocytochemistry for pluripotency markers and by the ability of the iPSCs to differentiate spontaneously into 3 germ layers in vitro. In addition, the iPSC line displayed a normal karyotype. Our model might offer a good platform to further study the pathological mechanisms, to identify early biomarkers, and also for drug testing studies in AD.
