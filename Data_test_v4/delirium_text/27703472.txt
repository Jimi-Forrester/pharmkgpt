27703472|t|Physical Fitness in Older People Recently Diagnosed with Cognitive Impairment Compared to Older People Recently Discharged from Hospital.
27703472|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: There is evidence of an association between cognitive function and physical fitness. The aim of this study was to compare physical fitness in patients with cognitive impairment with a group of older people recently discharged from hospital. METHODS: A cross-sectional study with 98 patients recently diagnosed with cognitive impairment and 115 patients recently discharged from hospital. Associations between the study group variable and different components in the Senior fitness test were examined, controlling for demographic factors and comorbidity. RESULTS: The group recently diagnosed with cognitive impairment indicated poorer results on three of six physical fitness components (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Older adults with cognitive impairment are in need of individually tailored physical activity programs to increase the level of physical fitness.
