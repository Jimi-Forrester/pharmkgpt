38561709|t|Knowledge, attitudes, and practice toward postoperative cognitive dysfunction among anesthesiologists in China: a cross-sectional study.
38561709|a|BACKGROUND: To investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) toward postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) among anesthesiologists in China. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted nationwide among Chinese anesthesiologists between December 2022 and January 2023. The demographic information and KAP scores of the respondents were collected using a web-based questionnaire. The mean KAP dimension scores >= 60% were considered good. RESULTS: This study enrolled 1032 anesthesiologists (51.2% male). The mean total scores of knowledge, positive attitude, and positive practice were 9.3 +- 1.2 (max 12), 34.8 +- 3.3 (max 40), and 30.6 +- 6.7 (max 40), respectively. The knowledge items with correctness scores < 60% were "the anesthetic drugs that tend to cause POCD" (23.3%) and "Treatment of POCD" (40.3%). Multivariable analysis showed that >= 40 years old, master's degree or above, intermediate professional title (i.e., attending physician), senior professional title (i.e., chief physician), and working in tertiary hospitals were independently associated with adequate knowledge. Multivariable analysis showed that the attitude scores, middle professional title, and >= 16 years of experience were independently associated with good practice. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Chinese anesthesiologists have good knowledge, favorable attitudes, and good practice toward POCD. Still, some points remain to be improved (e.g., the drugs causing POCD and managing POCD) and should be emphasized in training and continuing education. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR2200066749.
