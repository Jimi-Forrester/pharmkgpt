16914856|a|In this volume we commemorate the centennial of Alois Alzheimer's discovery of what was later known as Alzheimer's disease, named by Alzheimer's mentor, Emil Kraepelin. In a much more low level, our group remember in this issue a paper published twenty years ago. In that paper it was described that tau can self-polymerize and, at that time, it suggested that tau was not only a component of Alzheimer paired helical filaments, as indicated some months earlier during that year, 1986, but that it was the main component of Alzheimer paired helical filaments.
