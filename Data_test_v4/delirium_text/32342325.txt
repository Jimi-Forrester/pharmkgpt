32342325|a|INTRODUCTION: The GLORIA registry included 375 advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and evaluated the efficacy and safety of a 24-month levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) treatment in routine medical care. This analysis focuses on the Italian population, 60 patients treated with LCIG in 7 specialised PD care centres. METHODS: Hours of "Off" and "On" time were assessed with a modified version of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part IV items 39 and 32. Motor fluctuations, dyskinesia, non-motor symptoms, quality of life and safety were evaluated. RESULTS: Overall, 42 (70%) out of 60 patients completed the registry. LCIG treatment reduced "Off" time (- 3.3 +- 2.7 h at month 24 (M24), P < 0.0001), increased "On" time with dyskinesia (- 2.6 +- 5.2 h at M12, P = 0.0160), and improved UPDRS II and UPDRS III total scores at M24 (- 4.5 +- 10.6, P = 0.0333 and - 4.9 +- 11.7, P = 0.0229, respectively), Non-Motor Symptom Scale (NMSS) total score (- 21.8 +- 28.5, P < 0.0001) and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-8 item (PDQ-8) total score (- 12.5 +- 23.9, P = 0.0173) versus previous oral therapy. Adverse drug reactions (ADR) possibly or probably related to treatment were reported in 16 (28.6%) patients. Decreased weight (7.1%), polyneuropathy (7.1%) and abdominal pain (5.4%) were the most frequent ADRs while device malfunction (5.4%) and medical device change (5.4%) were the most reported device complaints. CONCLUSIONS: LCIG improved motor fluctuations, non-motor symptoms and quality of life over 24 months while tolerability was consistent with the established safety profile.
