34448953|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss and provide evidence-based data on dietary supplements as part of treating diabetic neuropathy RECENT FINDINGS: Few randomized controlled trials are available, but some have shown beneficial efficacy of various dietary supplements on objective primary endpoints including nerve conduction velocities and axon potentials as well as subjective patient-reported outcomes. No medical cure for diabetic neuropathy exists, and prevention is therefore crucial. Tight glucose control slows the progression of nerve damage in diabetes, but an unmet clinical need for effective interventions is warranted. Consequently, a growing number of patients turn to dietary supplements proposed to possess neuroprotective properties. However, the postulated effects are often not evidence-based as they have not been tested scientifically. Taken together, this review will focus on dietary supplements investigated in clinical trials for their potential capabilities in targeting the molecular mechanisms involved in the underlying pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy.
