35400734|t|Glial changes in schizophrenia: Genetic and epigenetic approach.
35400734|a|Background: Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe mental illness that affects one percent of the population, affecting how people think, feel, and behave. Evidence suggests glial cell alteration and some researchers have found genetic risk loci and epigenetic marks that may regulate glia-related genes implicated in SCZ. Aim: The aim of this study is to identify genetic and epigenetic changes that have been reported in glial cells or glial-associated genes in SCZ. Materials and Methods: We searched the articles from PubMed, PubMed Central, Medline, Medscape, and Embase databases up to December 2020 to identify relevant peer-reviewed articles in English. The titles and abstracts were screened to eliminate irrelevant citations. Results: Twenty-four original articles were included in the review. Studies were categorized into the following four thematic via: (1) oligodendrocytes, (2) microglia, (3) astrocytes, and (4) perspectives. Conclusion: This study is the first of its kind to review research on genetic variants and epigenetic modifications associated with glia-related genes implicated in SCZ. Epigenetic evidence is considerably less than genetic evidence in this field. Understanding the pathways of some risk genes and their genetic and epigenetic regulation allows us to understand and find potential targets for future interventions in this mental illness.
