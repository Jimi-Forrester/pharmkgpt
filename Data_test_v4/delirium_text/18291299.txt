The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of the Confusion Assessment Method Diagnostic Algorithm (CAM algorithm) and the bilingual version of Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC) among geriatric inpatients in a Chinese population. METHODS: Between January and March 2007, 100 newly admitted geriatric patients were assessed by physician and bedside nurses, using the CAM algorithm and bilingual version of Nu-DESC, respectively. The two instruments were compared with a gold standard, the psychiatrist's DSM-IV-based diagnosis. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used in conjunction with sensitivity and specificity measures to assess the performance of the tools. RESULTS: The prevalence of delirium was 25%. The ROC curve of Nu-DESC showed at the optimal cutoff of >0 a sensitivity of 0.96 and specificity of 0.79. CAM had a sensitivity of 0.76 and specificity of 1. Underlying dementia did not affect the validity of both instruments. Average time of Nu-DESC administration was 1 min/shift and CAM was 10 min. CONCLUSIONS: The bilingual version of Nu-DESC is a sensitive screening tool and the CAM algorithm is an accurate diagnostic instrument for detection of delirium in geriatric inpatient population.
