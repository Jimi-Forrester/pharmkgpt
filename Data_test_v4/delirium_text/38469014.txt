38469014|a|Patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) who are scheduled for elective, noncardiac surgery present a distinctive challenge for perioperative healthcare providers. The use of general anesthesia and neuraxial anesthesia carries the risk of unpredictable hemodynamic changes and potential complications. Regional anesthesia (RA) emerges as a prudent and effective option for HOCM patients. RA provides advantages such as minimizing hemodynamic fluctuations, avoiding intubation, reducing pharmacologic side effects, facilitating enhanced recovery after surgery, and contributing to greater patient satisfaction. We share the case of a 15-year-old individual diagnosed with HOCM and exercise intolerance, undergoing arthroscopic repair for right patellar instability. In this instance, the patient received preoperative peripheral nerve blocks for surgical anesthesia and underwent repair utilizing monitored anesthesia care (MAC) with a dexmedetomidine (DEX) infusion.
