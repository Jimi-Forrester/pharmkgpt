39366841|a|Advances in treatment are changing not only the therapeutic options for patients with Alzheimer's disease; they're also changing their diagnostic options. Technologies to detect amyloid such as PET imaging and blood or CSF testing now have a central role in Alzheimer's disease care. Notably, this role has been made possible by regulatory approval and coverage by payers of therapies. Access to treatments and the diagnostic tests needed to prescribe them is encourageing but it reveals a problem. These tests are tailored to the needs of the therapies, not to the needs of patients. Patients and families need to understand the causes of their impairments and their prognosis. This requires access to the best available diagnostic tests and this access should not depend on the availability of treatments. These tests should be used to their fullest capacity to inform patients of the causes of their cognitive impairments and their prognosis. Unfortunately, compared to diagnostic testing, treatment options are overvalued. We call this problem the tyranny of treatment.
