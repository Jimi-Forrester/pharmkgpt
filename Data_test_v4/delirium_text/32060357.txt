32060357|a|Activity-dependent remodeling of excitatory connections underpins memory formation in the brain. Serotonin receptors are known to contribute to such remodeling, yet the underlying molecular machinery remains poorly understood. Here, we employ high-resolution time-lapse FRET imaging in neuroblastoma cells and neuronal dendrites to establish that activation of serotonin receptor 5-HT4 (5-HT4R) rapidly triggers spatially-restricted RhoA activity and G13-mediated phosphorylation of cofilin, thus locally boosting the filamentous actin fraction. In neuroblastoma cells, this leads to cell rounding and neurite retraction. In hippocampal neurons in situ, 5-HT4R-mediated RhoA activation triggers maturation of dendritic spines. This is paralleled by RhoA-dependent, transient alterations in cell excitability, as reflected by increased spontaneous synaptic activity, apparent shunting of evoked synaptic responses, and enhanced long-term potentiation of excitatory transmission. The 5-HT4R/G13/RhoA signaling thus emerges as a previously unrecognized molecular pathway underpinning use-dependent functional remodeling of excitatory synaptic connections.
