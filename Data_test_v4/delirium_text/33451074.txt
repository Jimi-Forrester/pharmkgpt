33451074|a|Nanoparticles have demonstrated several advantages for biomedical applications, including for the development of multifunctional agents as innovative medicine. Silica nanoparticles hold a special position among the various types of functional nanoparticles, due to their unique structural and functional properties. The recent development of silica nanoparticles has led to a new trend in light-based nanomedicines. The application of light provides many advantages for in vivo imaging and therapy of certain diseases, including cancer. Mesoporous and non-porous silica nanoparticles have high potential for light-based nanomedicine. Each silica nanoparticle has a unique structure, which incorporates various functions to utilize optical properties. Such advantages enable silica nanoparticles to perform powerful and advanced optical imaging, from the in vivo level to the nano and micro levels, using not only visible light but also near-infrared light. Furthermore, applications such as photodynamic therapy, in which a lesion site is specifically irradiated with light to treat it, have also been advancing. Silica nanoparticles have shown the potential to play important roles in the integration of light-based diagnostics and therapeutics, termed "photo-theranostics". Here, we review the recent development and progress of non-porous silica nanoparticles toward cancer "photo-theranostics".
