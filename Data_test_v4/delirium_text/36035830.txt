36035830|t|Effectiveness of Perioperative Comprehensive Evaluation of Hip Fracture in the Elderly.
36035830|a|Objective: The objective is to observe the effect of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) in the perioperative period of hip fracture. Methods: From October 2018 to October 2021, 155 patients over the age of 65 diagnosed with hip fracture and treated with surgery at the Department of Trauma Orthopaedics of General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University were randomly divided into two groups using a prospective research method. A total of 70 cases in the CGA group received a perioperative comprehensive assessment of the geriatric, and 85 cases in the control group received routine medical consultation. Results: Elderly patients with hip fractures have a high comorbidity index. Patients with abnormal daily activity before injury accounted for 55%, the abnormal rate of nutrition was 58.1%, the abnormal rate of cognition, anxiety, and depression was 81.8%, and 77.3% of the patients were in a weak state. There was no significant difference in age, gender, ASA grade, fracture type, and operation mode between the two groups, but there were significant differences in operation rate at 48 h (chi 2 = 22.153; P <= 0.001), preoperative waiting time (Z = -6.387; P <= 0.001), total hospital stay (Z = -11.756; P <= 0.001), and incidence of postoperative delirium (chi 2 = 23.897; P <= 0.001). Conclusions: The implementation of CGA shortened the preoperative waiting time and total hospital stay, increased the 48 h operation rate, and reduced the incidence of postoperative delirium.
