29213681|t|Severe dementia: A review about diagnoses, therapeutic management and ethical issues.
29213681|a|North American data show that in the year 2000 around 4.5 million people had a diagnosis of dementia and more than a half were at moderate or severe stages of the disease. There is inevitable cognitive and functional decline caused by all etiologies of irreversible dementia as well as many behavioral symptoms that compromise the quality of life of both patients and caregivers. Few published studies have investigated issues concerning severe dementia such as predictors of mortality and life expectancy, nutrition, end of life issues and palliative care in terminal dementia, as well as best pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. Due to the complexity that characterizes advanced dementia, it is important that this discussion starts as early as possible allowing some decisions to be taken, preferably when the patients can still express their opinion.
