35163987|t|The Structural and Optical Properties of 1,2,4-Triazolo[4,3-a]pyridine-3-amine.
35163987|a|The structural and spectroscopic properties of a new triazolopyridine derivative (1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]pyridin-3-amine) are described in this paper. Its FTIR spectrum was recorded in the 100-4000 cm-1 range and its FT-Raman spectrum in the range 80-4000 cm-1. The molecular structure and vibrational spectra were analyzed using the B3LYP/6-311G(2d,2p) approach and the GAUSSIAN 16W program. The assignment of the observed bands to the respective normal modes was proposed on the basis of PED calculations. XRD studies revealed that the studied compound crystallizes in the centrosymmetric monoclinic space group P21/n with eight molecules per unit cell. However, the asymmetric unit contains two 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]pyridin-3-amine molecules linked via N-H N hydrogen bonds with a R22(8) graph. The stability of the studied molecule was considered using NBO analysis. Electron absorption and the luminescence spectra were measured and discussed in terms of the calculated singlet, triplet, HOMO and LUMO electron energies. The Stokes shifts derived from the optical spectra were equal to 9410 cm-1 for the triazole ring and 7625 cm-1 for the pyridine ring.
