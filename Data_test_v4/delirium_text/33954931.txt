33954931|a|COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease-19) may present with neurological signs, but whether people already affected by neurological conditions are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 is still not known. We, therefore, aimed to investigate the association of previously diagnosed neurological conditions with COVID-19. 502,536 community-dwelling UK Biobank participants (54.4% male, mean age 56.6 +- 10.3 years) were included. Among these, 57,463 participants had a diagnosis of neurological conditions (11.43%) and a total of 1326 COVID-19-positive cases were identified (0.26%). Neurological conditions were identified through medical history and linkage to data on hospital admissions (ICD-10 code G00-G99). COVID-19 presence was diagnosed using the data provided by Public Health England. The association of previous diagnosis of neurological conditions with COVID-19 was evaluated through logistic regressions, adjusted for potential confounders, reported as odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Nerve, nerve root and plexus disorders (G50-G59) were the most common conditions identified. The presence of COVID-19 was almost doubled in neurological conditions compared to the general population (0.45 vs. 0.24%, p < 0.0001). Previously diagnosed neurological conditions were associated with 60% higher odds of COVID-19 positive in the multivariable-adjusted model (OR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8). Other degenerative diseases of the nervous system, extrapyramidal and movement disorders, polyneuropathies and other disorders of the peripheral nervous system, cerebral palsy and other paralytic syndromes were significantly associated with a higher odds of COVID-19. The presence of neurological conditions was associated with a significantly higher likelihood of COVID-19 compared to the general population.
