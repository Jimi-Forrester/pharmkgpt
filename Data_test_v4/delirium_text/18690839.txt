18690839|a|Statins have been reported to reduce the risk and be of benefit in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individuals enrolling in the randomized controlled trial testing two anti-inflammatory agents for primary prevention of AD (Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial; ADAPT) were allowed the elective use of statins. Our objective was to assess whether statin use is associated with reduced risk of incident AD among ADAPT participants. In primary ADAPT study , participants were assessed annually for cholesterol levels and cognitive status. If impairment in cognition was noted, a dementia evaluation was performed. Onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD was taken as the date of this evaluation. Time-to-onset was analyzed in six-month intervals following enrollment. Without knowledge of primary treatment assignment in ADAPT, participants were grouped by their self-reported use of lipid-lowering agents (LLA). In the current ancillary ADAPT study we found that elective statin use was associated with significantly reduced risk of incident AD after adjustment for age, gender, education and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype. The findings were similar when comparing all LLA use (statin and non-statin LLA) to non-LLA use. Cholesterol levels were lower among statin users compared with non-LLA users, but the MMSE scores were equivalent. The data suggest that statin therapy may be of benefit in reducing the risk of AD.
