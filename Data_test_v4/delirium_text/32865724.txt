32865724|t|High Blood Lead Levels: An Increased Risk for Development of Brain Hyperintensities among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients.
32865724|a|The current study was aimed to ascertain the effect of blood lead level on brain tissues in patients with type 2 diabetes. A total of 300 human participants ages 27 to 60 years with type 2 diabetes (n = 150) and healthy individuals (n = 150) were included in this study. The serum samples were used for measuring HbA1c and fasting blood glucose. Blood lead level was measured using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Magnetic resonance imaging sub-analysis was used to assess the brain hyperintensities. Brain hyperintensities were found in 55% of patients with diabetes and 6% of non-diabetic control group subjects. The deep white matter hyperintensities were observed in 45% of diabetic patients, while the subcortical hyperintensities were noted in 10% of cases. Entorhinal cortex changes (31%) and hippocampus changes (42%) were noted in diabetic patients with brain hyperintensities. Diabetic patients with brain hyperintensities showed higher blood lead levels, HbA1c, and fasting blood sugar (p < 0.0001) as compared with healthy volunteers. A higher correlation (R2 = 0.8922) was found between deep white matter hyperintensities' size and blood lead levels. In nutshell, persistence of high blood lead level in diabetic patients may progress to brain hyperintensities which may consequently lead to cognitive, behavioral changes and Alzheimer's disease.
