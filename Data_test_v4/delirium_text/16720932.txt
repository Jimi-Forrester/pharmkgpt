16720932|t|Pharmacological intervention for cognitive deficits and aggression in frontal lobe injury.
16720932|a|We present a case that promotes early intervention and pharmacological treatment for the neuropsychiatric sequelae (frontal lobe syndrome, including cognitive impairment and aggressive behavior) associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and delirium. The patient, who sustained significant systemic complications related to his trauma, was previously diagnosed with alcohol and drug dependence and antisocial personality disorder. These antecedent conditions and prolonged systemic complications likely played a complicating role in his course of recovery.
