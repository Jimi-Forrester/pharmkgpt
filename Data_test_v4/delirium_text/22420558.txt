22420558|t|Thin-layer chromatography with biodetection in the search for new potential drugs to treat neurodegenerative diseases--state of the art and future perspectives.
22420558|a|This paper summarizes the application of thin-layer chromatography coupled with biodetection for the search of substances characterized with properties relevant to the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The main focus is on the screening of plant extracts for the presence of acetycholinesterase inhibitors as well as direct antioxidants, taking into account the cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease and oxidative stress theory of neurodegeneration. Practical aspects of performing TLC-bioassay tests are discussed and typical problems are addressed. Some practical hints are also given referring to the variety of compound classes that may be analyzed by means of these methods.
