33184771|a|BACKGROUND: The behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) can be severely distressing for both patients and caregivers. AIMS: This study assessed the efficacy of environmental diffusion essential oil therapy (EOT) combined with psychotropic drug therapy (group A) in BPSD management, compared with psychotropic drug therapy alone (group B). The stress responses of attending caregivers were also assessed. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with dementia and BPSD were enrolled. The presence and severity of BPSD were assessed using the Italian version of the NPI-NH scale, which also measures the stress felt by professional caregivers. Global geriatric evaluations were performed to rule out acute diseases that could contribute to delirium and worsen patients' mental status. RESULTS: Following treatment, the average NPI-NH value was significantly reduced in group A compared with group B (p < 0.001). Caregiver distress was also significantly reduced in group A (p < 0.01). DISCUSSION: This pilot study showed that BPSD were better treated using EOT combined with standard pharmacological treatment, compared with standard pharmacological treatment alone. No adverse effects of EOT were observed. Reductions in caregiver distress could be due either to reductions in BPSD severity and frequency resulting in decreased caregiver burden, and/or the emotional benefit for caregivers of exposure to essential oils. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the combined use of EOT and psychotropic drugs in the treatment of BPSD. Essential oils may improve the wellbeing of both patients and caregivers, without adverse effects. Additionally, EOT is easy to administer by environmental diffusion.
