36732687|a|BACKGROUND: For elderly adults undergoing hip arthroplasty, fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) is often used before spinal anesthesia to reduce the pain of posture placement. However, the impact of FICB within 48 h needs further study. METHODS: 89 elderly adults scheduled to undergo arthroplasty for hip fracture were enrolled and randomized into the FICB group (n = 45) and the control group (n = 44). The fascia iliaca on the operated side was located using ultrasound, and a puncture needle was placed under the fascia iliaca. The FICB group was injected with 40 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine, and the control group was injected with 40 ml of normal saline. Spinal anesthesia was performed after 20 min. Our primary outcome measures were: duration of analgesia, muscle strength, and Quality of Recovery (QoR). RESULTS: The duration of analgesia in the FICB group was 403.5 +- 39.6 min, which was longer than that (357.5 +- 35.9 min) of the control group (P = 0.012). There were 19 (42.2%) patients with muscle strength of grade 4 in the FICB group and 36 (81.8%) patients with muscle strength of grade 4 in the control group. FICB group was lower (P < 0.001). QoR-15 at 24 h after surgery was 114.1 +- 8.3 in the FICB group and 104.6 +- 8.4 in the control group (P < 0.001). QoR-15 at 48 h after surgery was 122.7 +- 8.4 in the FICB group and 120.5 +- 9.5 in the control group (P = 0.232). CONCLUSIONS: For elderly adults with hip fractures, FICB provided longer analgesia and improved 24-h QoR, but reduced postoperative muscle strength.
