30240608|t|Soluble Abeta Oligomers Impair Dipolar Heterodendritic Plasticity by Activation of mGluR in the Hippocampal CA1 Region.
30240608|a|Soluble Abeta oligomers (oAbetas) contribute importantly to synaptotoxicity in Alzheimer disease (AD), but the mechanisms related to heterogeneity of synaptic functions at local circuits remain elusive. Nearly all studies of the effects of oAbetas on hippocampal synaptic plasticity have only examined homosynaptic plasticity. Here we stimulated the Schaffer collaterals and then simultaneously recorded in stratum radiatum (apical dendrites) and stratum oriens (basal dendrites) of CA1 neurons. We found that the apical dendrites are significantly more vulnerable to oAbeta-mediated synaptic dysfunction: the heterosynaptic basal dendritic long-term potentiation (LTP) remained unchanged, whereas the homosynaptic apical LTP was impaired. However, the heterosynaptic basal dendritic plasticity induced by either spaced 10-Hz bursts or low-frequency (1-Hz) stimulation was disrupted by oAbetas in a mGluR5-dependent manner. These results suggest that different firing patterns in the same neurons may be selectively altered by soluble oAbetas in an early phase of AD, before frank neurodegeneration.
