32284903|t|Bleeding Risk Associated With Hemodynamically Stable Low-Energy Pelvic Fracture.
32284903|a|INTRODUCTION: Life-threatening hemorrhage associated with low-energy pelvic fracture has been described in single cases in the literature. However, there is limited evidence available on the bleeding risk associated with hemodynamically stable osteoporotic pelvic fractures. The objective of this study was to estimate the bleeding risk associated with low-energy osteoporotic pelvic fractures in the elderly population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of patients aged > 65 years old with pelvic fractures admitted between 2015 and 2018 was performed. Eighty-two patients were identified: 12 males and 70 females with a median age of 86 years. The median Charlson comorbidity index was 6 (interquartile range = 5-7). Eighty-one fractures were classified as lateral compression I or Tile A2, and 1 fracture was classified as lateral compression II or Tile B2. Forty patients were on concurrent anticoagulation treatment. In 4 patients on warfarin, this treatment was reversed on admission. RESULTS: The mean hemoglobin (Hb) level on arrival was 12.36 g/dL (+-1.67 g/dL). There were significant drops in Hb levels on day 1 (Hb = 11.22 +- 1.86 g/dL, P < .001) and day 4 (Hb = 10.97 +- 1.6 g/dL, P < .001). Nine percent of patients required a blood transfusion. The mean baseline Hb level pre-transfusion was 8.33 g/dL (+-1.15). Preexisting anticoagulation treatment did not predispose patients to greater decreases in Hb levels on day 1 (mean difference = 0.16 g/dL, P = .62) or day 4 (mean difference = 0.29 g/dL, P = .48) post-admission. DISCUSSION: An observed mean decrease in Hb level of up to 1.4 g/dL can occur in hemodynamically stable elderly patients with osteoporotic pelvic fractures, reflecting an approximate loss of 1.4 units of packed red blood cells. CONCLUSION: This degree of decrease in Hb may be clinically significant in geriatric patients with chronic anemia and a history of cardiovascular disease.
