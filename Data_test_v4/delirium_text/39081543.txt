39081543|t|Characteristics of Visual Cognition in Patients with Anoxic Encephalopathy: An Eye-tracking Study.
39081543|a|Objectives: : Despite the frequent occurrence of visual cognitive impairment after anoxic encephalopathy, only a few studies have analyzed gaze movements following encephalopathy. This study determined the visual cognitive characteristics of patients with anoxic encephalopathy using an eye-tracking system. Methods: : This study included ten patients with anoxic encephalopathy and ten age/sex-matched controls. Factors for anoxic encephalopathy onset and brain imaging findings were extracted from medical records. An eye-tracking system was used to track eye movements during three visual search tasks (pop-out, serial search, and saliency) in patient and healthy control groups. The average target search time, number of saccades, and number of fixations to salient stimuli were compared. Results: : Stagnant blood flow, observed in six of ten patients, was the most common cause of disease onset, four of whom exhibited hypoperfusion in bilateral occipital or parietal lobes on single-photon emission computed tomography. The patient group required longer search times during all visual search tasks and a higher number of saccades during pop-out and serial search tasks. However, no significant difference was observed between the two groups for the number of fixations to salient stimuli during the saliency task. Conclusions: : Following anoxic encephalopathy, bottom-up (pop-out task) and top-down (serial search task) gaze control were considered impaired because of extensive parieto-occipital lobe damage after blood flow stagnation. Patients exhibited reduced top-down function for finding targets (serial search task) but relatively retain inhibitory function for salient stimuli (saliency task). Gaze analysis can be used to reveal the clinical characteristics of anoxic encephalopathy.
