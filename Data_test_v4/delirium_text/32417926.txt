32417926|a|BACKGROUND: delirium is a common condition associated with hospital admission. Detection and diagnosis is important to identify the underlying precipitating cause and implement effective management and treatment. Quality improvement (QI) methodology has been applied in limited publications. There are even fewer publications of the role of development of the electronic health record (EHR) to enhance implementation. METHODS: we used QI methodology to improve delirium detection in the emergency department (ED). Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) cycles could be broadly categorised into technology, training and education and leadership. As part of the technology PDSA an electronic delirium pathway was developed as part of an NHS England digital systems improvement initiative (NHS England Global Digital Exemplar). The electronic pathway incorporated the 4AT screening tool, the Confusion Assessment Method, the TIME delirium management bundle, investigation order sets and automated coding of delirium as a health issue. RESULTS: development of the EHR combined with education initiatives had benefit in terms of the number of people assessed for delirium on admission to the ED and the total number of people diagnosed with delirium across the organisation. The implementation of a delirium pathway as part of the EHR improved the use of 4AT in those 65 years and over from baseline of 3% completion in October 2017 to 43% in January 2018. CONCLUSION: we showed that enhancement of the digital record can improve delirium assessment and diagnosis. Furthermore, the implementation of a delirium pathway is enhanced by staff education.
