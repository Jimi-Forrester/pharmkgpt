34044684|t|Improving Delirium Care in Hospitalized Older Adults: Impact of Education on Hospital Aides as Sitters.
34044684|a|As one of several hospital team members involved in the management of care for older adults with delirium, hospital aides (HAs) are often relied on to provide direct patient care in the role of a sitter. Yet, many HAs have not received training about delirium, its associated behaviors, or appropriate interventions. As a consequence, there are gaps in quality of care for older adults with delirium and potential missed opportunities for HA sitters to contribute to the interdisciplinary team (IDT) care of these patients. In the current study, a quality improvement project at an urban hospital provided an educational session on delirium to HAs. Accuracy of HA delirium knowledge, delirium behavior recognition, and delivery of care to patients with delirium significantly increased across three postintervention measures (p = <0.001 to 0.016). HAs also reported increased confidence in caring for patients with delirium and in their perceived role on the IDT. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 47(6), 20-26.].
