36134845|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the perceptions of patients' relatives with the perceptions of health professionals regarding a flexible visitation model in intensive care units. METHODS: Cross-sectional study. This study was carried out with patients' relatives and members of the care team of a clinical-surgical intensive care unit with a flexible visitation model (12 hours/day) from September to December 2018. The evaluation of the flexible visitation policy was carried out through an open visitation instrument composed of 22 questions divided into three domains (evaluation of family stress, provision of information, and interference in the work of the team). RESULTS: Ninety-five accompanying relatives and 95 members of the care team were analyzed. The perceptions of relatives regarding the decrease in anxiety and stress with flexible visitation was higher than the perceptions of the team (91.6% versus 58.9%, p < 0.001), and the family also had a more positive perception regarding the provision of information (86.3% versus 64.2%, p < 0.001). The care team believed that the presence of the relative made it difficult to provide care to the patient and caused work interruptions (46.3% versus 6.3%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Family members and staff-intensive care unit teams have different perceptions about flexible visits in the intensive care unit. However, a positive view regarding the perception of decreased anxiety and stress among the family members and greater information and contributions to patient recovery predominates.
