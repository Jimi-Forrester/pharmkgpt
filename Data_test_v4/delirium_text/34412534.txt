34412534|a|The actual standard treatment for mild-to-moderately severe Alzheimer's disease only attacks its symptoms. Masitinib is a potent and selective phenylaminothiazole-type tyrosine kinase inhibitor which is currently in Phase III studies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with the aim of modifying its evolution and with multiple pharmacological targets such as inhibition of mast cells activity, inhibition of microglia activation, modulation of Abeta and Tau protein signaling pathway and prevention of synaptic damage. Here, we review the preclinical and clinical studies that investigated the administration of masitinib treatment in monotherapy in AD. All research studies revealed positive effects concerning the cognitive functions in AD and generally with good safety and tolerability.
