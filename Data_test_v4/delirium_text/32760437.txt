32760437|t|The accuracy of delirium assessment by cardiologists treating heart failure inpatients: a single center retrospective survey.
32760437|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with heart failure (HF) accompanied by delirium are at risk of rehospitalization and death, thus early detection and appropriate treatment is imperative. Palliative care for patients with HF is an important issue, particularly for patients who also have delirium. This retrospective study examined the accuracy of delirium assessment by cardiologists treating patients with HF, identified factors related to the detection of delirium, and recorded the initial treatment. METHODS: This was a retrospective chart survey of 165 patients with HF referred to a consultation liaison (C-L) service during treatment in the cardiology wards of a general hospital over a 6-year period. Diagnosis of delirium by the C-L psychiatrists was based on DSM-IV-TR.Cases in which cardiologists had stated "delirium" in the medical records were classified as an accurate assessment of delirium (Agreement group). Cases in which cardiologists did not state "delirium" were classified as Disagreement. RESULTS: Among 81 patients with delirium (51 [62.9%] male; 74.7 +- 13.3 years old), the ratio of accurate assessment of delirium by cardiologists was 50.6% (n = 41; Agreement group). Age, sex, and HF severity did not differ significantly between the two groups. Although disquietedness was identified most frequently (n = 59, 73%), only 33 of these 59 patients (55.9%) were recognized as having delirium by cardiologists.Inappropriate initial treatments were only noted in the Disagreement group. In both groups, most cases were referred to a C-L service without new medication for psychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: An accurate assessment of the delirium of inpatients with HF by cardiologists was found in only around half of all cases. Accurate detection is important to avoid harmful drug administration and to provide appropriate palliative care.
