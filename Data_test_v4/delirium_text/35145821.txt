35145821|t|Hypercalcemia in a 67-Year-Old Female Following the Use of Calcium Sulfate Beads: A Case Report and Review of Literature.
35145821|a|While the milk-alkali syndrome is traditionally viewed as the sole cause of exogenous hypercalcemia, the wide use of calcium sulfate (CS) in orthopedic procedures introduced another important item to be considered in the differential diagnosis. Calcium sulfate beads are increasingly used as void fillers and prophylactic measures to prevent postoperative hardware infections. However, hypercalcemia secondary to rapid calcium absorption from calcium sulfate beads is generally an underrecognized adverse effect and likely underreported. Furthermore, with calcium sulfate beads, hypercalcemia can dramatically present with alteration in mental status. In this report, we present a case of a 67-year-old female who underwent two orthopedic procedures, where calcium sulfate beads were used in both. The patient, on both occasions, developed significant hypercalcemia, manifested as agitation and suicidal thoughts, with each episode resolving after proper hydration and lowering of serum calcium. Also, in this report, we examined the literature and highlighted the female predominance in the reported cases, often manifesting in postoperative day (POD) 4. Given the acuity and severity of hypercalcemia, it is paramount to anticipate hypercalcemia, monitor serum calcium postoperatively to allow timely interventions, and avoid potentially serious complications.
