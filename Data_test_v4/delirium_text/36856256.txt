36856256|a|Oxidative stress plays a role in the delay of peripheral nerve regeneration after injury. The accumulation of free radicals results in nerve tissue damage and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuronal death. Pinostrobin (PB) is one of the bioflavonoids from Boesenbergia rotunda and has been reported to possess antioxidant capacity and numerous pharmacological activities. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of PB on peripheral nerve regeneration after injury. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups including control, sham, sciatic nerve crush injury (SNC), SNC + 20 mg/kg PB, and SNC + 40 mg/kg PB. Nerve functional recovery was observed every 7 days. At the end of the study, the sciatic nerve and the DRG were collected for histological and biochemical analyses. PB treatment at doses of 20 and 40 mg/kg reduced oxidative stress by up-regulating endogenous glutathione. The reduced oxidative stress in PB-treated rats resulted in increased axon diameters, greater number of DRG neurons, and p-ERK1/2 expression in addition to faster functional recovery within 4 weeks compared to untreated SNC rats. The results indicated that PB diminished the oxidative stress-induced nerve injury. These effects should be considered in the treatment of peripheral nerve injury.
