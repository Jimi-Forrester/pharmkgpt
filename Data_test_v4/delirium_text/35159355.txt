35159355|t|Peripheral Inflammatory Cytokine Signature Mirrors Motor Deficits in Mucolipidosis IV.
35159355|a|BACKGROUND: Mucolipidosis IV (MLIV) is an autosomal recessive pediatric disease that leads to motor and cognitive deficits and loss of vision. It is caused by a loss of function of the lysosomal channel transient receptor potential mucolipin-1 and is associated with an early pro-inflammatory brain phenotype, including increased cytokine expression. The goal of the current study was to determine whether blood cytokines are linked to motor dysfunction in patients with MLIV and reflect brain inflammatory changes observed in an MLIV mouse model. METHODS: To determine the relationship between blood cytokines and motor function, we collected plasma from MLIV patients and parental controls concomitantly with assessment of motor function using the Brief Assessment of Motor Function and Modified Ashworth scales. We then compared these profiles with cytokine profiles in brain and plasma samples collected from the Mcoln1-/- mouse model of MLIV. RESULTS: We found that MLIV patients had prominently increased cytokine levels compared to familial controls and identified profiles of cytokines correlated with motor dysfunction, including IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha2, and IP-10. We found that IP-10 was a key differentiating factor separating MLIV cases from controls based on data from human plasma, mouse plasma, and mouse brain. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that MLIV is characterized by increased blood cytokines, which are strongly related to underlying neurological and functional deficits in MLIV patients. Moreover, our data identify the interferon pro-inflammatory axis in both human and mouse signatures, suggesting that interferon signaling is an important aspect of MLIV pathology.
