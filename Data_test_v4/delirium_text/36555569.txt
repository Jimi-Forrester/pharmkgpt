36555569|t|Novel Algorithm of Network Calcium Dynamics Analysis for Studying the Role of Astrocytes in Neuronal Activity in Alzheimer's Disease Models.
36555569|a|Accumulated experimental data strongly suggest that astrocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The effect of astrocytes on the calcium activity of neuron-astroglia networks in AD modelling was the object of the present study. We have expanded and improved our approach's capabilities to analyze calcium activity. We have developed a novel algorithm to construct dynamic directed graphs of both astrocytic and neuronal networks. The proposed algorithm allows us not only to identify functional relationships between cells and determine the presence of network activity, but also to characterize the spread of the calcium signal from cell to cell. Our study showed that Alzheimer's astrocytes can change the functional pattern of the calcium activity of healthy nerve cells. When healthy nerve cells were cocultivated with astrocytes treated with Abeta42, activation of calcium signaling was found. When healthy nerve cells were cocultivated with 5xFAD astrocytes, inhibition of calcium signaling was observed. In this regard, it seems relevant to further study astrocytic-neuronal interactions as an important factor in the regulation of the functional activity of brain cells during neurodegenerative processes. The approach to the analysis of streaming imaging data developed by the authors is a promising tool for studying the collective calcium dynamics of nerve cells.
