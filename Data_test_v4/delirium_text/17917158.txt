17917158|t|Thiophilic interaction chromatography (TIC) of amyloid-beta protein precursor.
17917158|a|Neuritic plaques, one of the diagnostic characteristics of an AD, contain extracellular deposits of amyloid-beta (Abeta) derived from amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP). The objective of this study was to extract AbetaPP out of HEK293 cells and to purify it. Two procedures were chosen for purification of AbetaPP: Thiophilic Interaction Chromatography (TIC) and molecular sieving. Using Superdex 75, Superose 12, and Fractogel gel matrices, AbetaPP was isolated on HPLC. The chromatograms illustrate the purification of AbetaPP. Our method describes a new and elegant way for the extraction and purification of AbetaPP from HEK293 cell lines using thiophilic interaction chromatography (TIC).
