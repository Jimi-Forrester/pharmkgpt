34679133|t|Period-Prevalence and Risk Factors for Delirium in a Tertiary Referral ICU: A prospective cohort study.
34679133|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is common in intensive care and leads to increases in morbidity, mortality, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay, and hospital length of stay. Certain risk factors predict the appearance of delirium. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the rates of delirium, the rate of risk factors, and their relationship to the occurrence of delirium in an adult ICU. METHODS: Single-centre, prospective, observational study. Demographic and treatment data were collected. The Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAM-ICU) was performed twice daily to assess for delirium continuously during a 3-week period. Statistical analysis was used to determine the relationship between risk factors and the occurrence of delirium. RESULTS: 86 patients were screened, 44 patients were included, and 260 patient-days were analyzed. The incidence of delirium was 42.9%, the prevalence of delirium in ICU was 50%. Urinary catheters and use of opioids were the most common factors with a positive association for occurrence of delirium. Exposure to daylight and sleeping for more than 4 hours at night were the factors most commonly associated with a lack of delirium. CONCLUSION: The rates of delirium in ICU were high and risk factors occurred frequently. Addressing modifiable risk factors, including the promotion of adequate sleep, could improve outcomes.
