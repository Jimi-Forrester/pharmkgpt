38628837|t|Examining the Dominant Presence of Brain Grey Matter in Autism During Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
38628837|a|Introduction: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with symptoms appearing from early childhood. Behavioral modifications, special education, and medicines are used to treat ASD; however, the effectiveness of the treatments depends on early diagnosis of the disorder. The primary approach in diagnosing ASD is based on clinical interviews and valid scales. Still, methods based on brain imaging could also be possible diagnostic biomarkers for ASD. Methods: To identify the amount of information the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reveals on ASD, we reviewed 292 task-based fMRI studies on ASD individuals. This study is part of a systematic review with the registration number CRD42017070975. Results: We observed that face perception, language, attention, and social processing tasks were mainly studied in ASD. In addition, 73 brain regions, nearly 83% of brain grey matter, showed an altered activation between the ASD and normal individuals during these four tasks, either in a lower or a higher activation. Conclusion: Using imaging methods, such as fMRI, to diagnose and predict ASD is a great objective; research similar to the present study could be the initial step.
