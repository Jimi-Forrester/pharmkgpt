32569232|a|The objective was to investigate the association of different hydration doses and its effect on renal function in patients with primary osteoporosis treated with zoledronic acid.The subjects with primary osteoporosis treated with zoledronic acid at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, China, from January 2015 to December 2018 were included in this study. The subjects were classified according to different hydration doses. Renal function indexes before and after treatment were collected and adverse reactions recorded to analyze the changes in renal function associated with different hydration doses.The choice of the hydration dose treated with zoledronic acid deserves attention. The lower hydration dose is, the greater impact on renal function can be caused.
