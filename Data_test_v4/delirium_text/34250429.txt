34250429|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium incidences during hospitalization are an important problem in elderly patients. The problem of delirium episodes in patients with obstructive disease during hospitalization was investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From a total of 37,156 subjects, the following were randomly selected: 32,261 patients with asthma, 4896 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and 5455 without obstructive disease. Their ages ranged from 65-95 years, and they were hospitalized between 2006 and 2015. Delirium incidences were monitored based on the International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 codes and medical documentation. RESULTS: The delirium episodes during all hospitalizations were independently associated with asthma (odds ratio [OR] = 2.91, confidence interval [CI] = 1.62-5.84), with severe type of asthma (OR = 4.24, CI = 1.94-8.93), partim controlled asthma (OR = 3.1, CI = 1.29-8.46), and uncontrolled asthma (OR = 4.88, CI = 2.12-9.42). It was comparable with COPD as follows: all incidences of delirium during hospitalization (OR = 3.17, CI = 1.42-7.23) or severe COPD (III degree OR = 5.15, CI = 2.01-13.69). Elderly patients with asthma with uncontrolled or partially controlled asthma with a coincidence of advanced age, dementia, or smoking had a greater predisposition to delirium episodes, particularly after surgery. Additionally, delirium incidence caused death more frequently in patients with asthma than in those with COPD. CONCLUSION: Elderly patients with asthma have a higher risk of delirium episodes during any hospitalization, and, frequently, it ends in death.
