39126050|t|COVID-19-Associated Sepsis: Potential Role of Phytochemicals as Functional Foods and Nutraceuticals.
39126050|a|The acute manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibit the hallmarks of sepsis-associated complications that reflect multiple organ failure. The inflammatory cytokine storm accompanied by an imbalance in the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory host response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection leads to severe and critical septic shock. The sepsis signature in severely afflicted COVID-19 patients includes cellular reprogramming and organ dysfunction that leads to high mortality rates, emphasizing the importance of improved clinical care and advanced therapeutic interventions for sepsis associated with COVID-19. Phytochemicals of functional foods and nutraceutical importance have an incredible impact on the healthcare system, which includes the prevention and/or treatment of chronic diseases. Hence, in the present review, we aim to explore the pathogenesis of sepsis associated with COVID-19 that disrupts the physiological homeostasis of the body, resulting in severe organ damage. Furthermore, we have summarized the diverse pharmacological properties of some potent phytochemicals, which can be used as functional foods as well as nutraceuticals against sepsis-associated complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The phytochemicals explored in this article include quercetin, curcumin, luteolin, apigenin, resveratrol, and naringenin, which are the major phytoconstituents of our daily food intake. We have compiled the findings from various studies, including clinical trials in humans, to explore more into the therapeutic potential of each phytochemical against sepsis and COVID-19, which highlights their possible importance in sepsis-associated COVID-19 pathogenesis. We conclude that our review will open a new research avenue for exploring phytochemical-derived therapeutic agents for preventing or treating the life-threatening complications of sepsis associated with COVID-19.
