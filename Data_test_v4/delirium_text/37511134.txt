37511134|t|Benefits and Meaning of Lipids Profile in Relation to Oxidative Balance and Brain Morphology in Schizophrenia.
37511134|a|Schizophrenia is characterized by complex metabolic dysregulations and their consequences. Until now, numerous theories have explained its pathogenesis, using a spectrum of available technologies. We focused our interest on lipid profile-periphery high-density cholesterol level and lipoproteins in the human brain and compared magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of patients with schizophrenia and the healthy group. Detailed analysis of biochemical parameters was performed using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our study aimed to reveal correlations between periphery high-density lipoproteins levels and lipoproteins in the brain, depicted in MRI scans, and parameters of peripheral oxidative stress expressed as paraoxonase. Patients with schizophrenia have decreased levels of high-density lipoproteins, low paraoxonase activity, and slightly raised sodium in the blood. Positive significant correlations between serum high-density cholesterol and anterior cingulate cortex, unique brain area for schizophrenia pathophysiology, MR spectroscopy signals, and diffusion have been revealed. To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the effect of an anterior cingulate disorder on high-density cholesterol levels on the development of schizophrenia.
