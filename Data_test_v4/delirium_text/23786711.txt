23786711|t|Syntheses and evaluation of novel isoliquiritigenin derivatives as potential dual inhibitors for amyloid-beta aggregation and 5-lipoxygenase.
23786711|a|A series of new isoliquiritigenin (ISL) derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as dual inhibitors for amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). It was found that all these synthetic compounds inhibited Abeta (1-42) aggregation effectively with their IC50 values ranged from 2.2 +- 1.5 muM to 23.8 +- 2.0 muM. These derivatives also showed inhibitory activity to 5-LO with their IC50 values ranged from 6.1 +- 0.1 muM to 35.9 +- 0.3 muM. Their structure-activity relationships (SAR) and mechanisms of inhibitions were studied. This study provided potentially important information for further development of ISL derivatives as multifunctional agents for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment.
