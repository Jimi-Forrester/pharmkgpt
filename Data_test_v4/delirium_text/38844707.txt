38844707|t|Remimazolam for anesthesia and sedation in pediatric patients: a scoping review.
38844707|a|Anesthetic management of pediatric patients poses several challenges and the optimal anesthetic agent for use in this population is still a matter of debate. We systematically searched PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar from their inception for studies that investigated the role and potential applications of remimazolam, a novel ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine, in pediatric patients. Furthermore, in March 2024, an update of the literature search along with an additional post-hoc search on the EMBASE database were performed. A total of fourteen pertinent studies which spanned the 2021-2023 period explored remimazolam as either the primary or adjuvant hypnotic agent for inducing and/or maintaining general anesthesia or sedation. Preliminary evidence derived from these studies highlighted that remimazolam is a safe and effective option for both sedation and general anesthesia in pediatric patients, particularly those with concurrent mitochondrial disorders, myopathic diseases, or at risk for malignant hyperthermia. Moreover, the current evidence suggested that remimazolam may contribute to reducing preoperative anxiety and postoperative delirium in children. Its favorable pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile demonstrated potential safety, effectiveness, and ease-of-use in various perioperative pediatric contexts, making it suitable for integration into specific protocols, such as intraoperative monitoring of evoked potentials and management of difficult intubation. Notwithstanding these promising findings, further research is essential to determine optimal dosages, establish conclusive evidence of its superiority over other benzodiazepines, and elucidate the impact of genetic factors on drug metabolism.
