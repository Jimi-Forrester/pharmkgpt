38919296|a|Background: We aimed to investigate two polymorphisms, rs8106922 and rs157580 of TOMM40 in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: In the present case-control research, we collected blood samples from 117 AD patients and 130 controls from Alzheimer's Hospital, residents of Tehran, Iran during the winter 2020 to autumn 2022. Following extraction of DNA, Genotyping of TOMM40 polymorphisms rs8106922 and rs157580 were examined by sequencing and ARMS/PCR approaches. We compared distributions of genotypes in both patient and healthy groups using the Chi-Square test. Results: Regarding rs157580, a statistically significant difference was observed in the GA genotype frequency between patient and healthy groups, in both univariate and multivariate modes with these results that have come respectively, and it can be regarded as a protection factor P<0.05).. No significant difference was observed in the frequency of A and G alleles between patient and healthy groups. Besides, concerning rs8106922, the AG genotype frequency in research groups in both univariate and multivariate cases, with these results that have come respectively was significantly different (P=0.003) & (P=0.009). Regarding GG genotype, a statistically significant difference was observed between the patient and healthy groups in both univariate and multivariate cases, respectively (P=0.419) & (P=0.425). Significant differences were observed in the G allele frequency for rs8106922 in the healthy and patient groups (P=0.007), it can be regarded as a potential protective factor. Conclusion: It is possible to consider the TOMM40 gene as one of the potential genes concerning Alzheimer's disease.
