35455583|t|Parents' Time Perspective as a Predictor of Child's Postsurgical Pain, Emergence Delirium, and Parents' Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms after Child's Surgery.
35455583|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to predict children's postsurgical pain, emergence delirium and parents' posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms after a child's surgery based on the parents' time perspective. METHOD: A total of 98 children, aged 2 to 15, and their accompanying parents participated in this study. Measures of parents' time perspective and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were obtained based on questionnaires. The level of children's postsurgical pain and delirium were rated by nurses and anaesthesiologist. RESULTS: Parents' future-negative perspective was a predictor of emergence delirium in the group of children aged 8-15 years. Low parents' past-positive perspective turned out to be a predictor of parents' posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms after child's surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide evidence for associations between parents' time perspective with child's emergence delirium and parents' posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms after child's surgery.
