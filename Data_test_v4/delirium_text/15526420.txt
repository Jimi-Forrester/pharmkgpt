15526420|a|The effects of an antioxidant mixture of mineral ascorbates (MA) on the state of neurons in the temporal area of the cortex and the behavior of mice subjected to bulbectomy (BE) were studied; these mice, as demonstrated previously, are characterized by deficiency of spatial memory and the development of a neurodegenerative process in brain structures showing pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease. One month after BE, there were abnormalities in the cytoarchitectonics of the temporal area of the cortex, with loss of clarity of the boundaries between its layers because of dystrophy of pyramidal neurons and foci of loss of these cells. There were sharp increases in the numbers of neurons showing pyknosis, karyolysis, and vacuolysis on the background of decreases in neuronal density. Three weeks of treatment by addition of MA to the diet prevented the degradation of spatial memory in mice after BE and protected neurons in the temporal area of the cortex from degenerative changes. These results provide evidence for the possibility of prophylaxis of neurodestructive changes of the Alzheimer's type.
