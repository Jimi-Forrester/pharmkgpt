9920657|a|Amyloid plaques that accumulate in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are primarily composed of aggregates of amyloid peptides that are derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Overexpression of APP in cell cultures increases the formation of amyloidogenic peptides and causes neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction in transgenic mice. We now report that activation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptors increases cAMP formation and stimulates overexpression of APP mRNA and holoprotein in primary cultures of cortical astrocytes. Levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein were also increased by PGE2 treatment, suggesting that these cultured astrocytes resemble reactive astrocytes found in vivo. The stimulation by PGE2 of APP synthesis was mimicked or blocked by activators or inhibitors, respectively, of protein kinase A. Actinomycin D or cycloheximide also inhibited the increase in APP holoprotein stimulated by PGE2. Treatment of astrocytes with 8-Bromo-cAMP or forskolin for 24 hr also stimulated APP overexpression in cultured astrocytes. The immunosuppressants cyclosporin A and FK-506 inhibited the increase in APP mRNA and holoprotein levels caused by PGE2 or by other treatments that elevated cellular cAMP levels; the inhibitory effect of FK-506 but not of cyclosporin A was attenuated by rapamycin. These results suggest that prostaglandins produced by brain injury or inflammation can activate APP transcription in astrocytes and that immunosuppressants may be used to prevent APP overexpression and possibly the pathophysiological processes underlying AD.
