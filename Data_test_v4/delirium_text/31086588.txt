31086588|a|Comparison of desflurane and sevoflurane on the postoperative recovery quality after tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy in children was carried out. A retrospective analysis was performed on the medical records of 165 children who underwent tonsil and adenoid radiofrequency ablation under low-temperature plasma and were admitted to the Xuzhou Children's Hospital, Xuzhou Medical University from February 2014 to May 2017. In total, 79 children with sevoflurane anesthesia were in the sevoflurane group, and 86 children with desflurane anesthesia in the desflurane group. The non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) level, the postoperative sedation (Ramsay) scores, the modified objective pain score (MOPS) of children were recorded. The pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium (PAED) scores of children were recorded. Children in the sevoflurane group had longer operation time, anesthesia time, extubation time and coincidence time than those in the desflurane group (P<0.05). At the beginning of operation (t1), 10 min after operation (t2), at the time of entering anesthesia recovery room (t3), at the time of tracheal catheter extubated (t4), 10 min after extubation (t5), and at the time of leaving the anesthesia recovery room (t6), children in the sevoflurane had higher NISBP and NIDBP, lower HR than those in the desflurane group (P<0.05). At the time of the tracheal catheter extubation (c2), 10 min after extubation (c3), 30 min after extubation (c4), children in the sevoflurane group had lower Ramsay scores and higher PAED scores than those in the desflurane group (P<0.05). More suitable as an anesthetic maintenance drug for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy in children, desflurane has a better anesthetic effect and is safer. In addition, children with desflurane anesthesia have high postoperative recovery quality and quick recovery in the short term, with better sedative and analgesic effects. Therefore, it is worthy of promotion in clinic practice.
