36690221|t|Aberrant inflammatory responses in intoxicated burn-injured patients parallel impaired cognitive function.
36690221|a|Burn-injured patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) have increased morbidity and mortality compared to alcohol-abstaining individuals with similar injuries. It is hypothesized that this is due, in part, to alcohol-induced dysregulation of the systemic inflammatory response, leading to worsened clinical outcomes, including increased susceptibility to infection, and heightened cognitive impairment. To examine the effects of alcohol on inflammatory markers after burn injury, we used multiplex assays to measure a panel of 48 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in the plasma of burn patents within 24 h of admission to the University of Colorado Burn Center. Thirty patients were enrolled between July 2018 to February 2020 and were stratified based on presence of AUD and total body surface area (TBSA) burn of >=20% into four groups: [AUD-, TBSA <20%, N = 12], [AUD+, TBSA <20%, N = 3], [AUD-, TBSA >=20%, N = 8], [AUD+, TBSA >=20%, N = 7]. In addition, Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) scores were collected to evaluate patient delirium during the course of hospitalization. Multivariate statistical analysis demonstrated a number of cytokines and other factors that were significantly different between the groups. For example, the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) was dampened in the AUD+, TBSA >=20% cohort with a 75.2% decrease compared to AUD-, TBSA >=20%, and an 83.9% decrease compared to AUD-, TBSA <20% (p = 0.008). Additionally, plasma levels of the pro-inflammatory mediator CXCL12 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12, also known as stromal cell-derived factor 1, SDF-1) was higher in the AUD + groups (p = 0.03) and similarly, IL-18 levels were greater in AUD+, TBSA >=20% (p = 0.009). Eotaxin (also known as cytokine CC motif ligand 11, CCL11) was markedly elevated in the AUD+, TBSA >=20% cohort with a 2.4-fold increase over the AUD-, TBSA >=20%, and a 1.7-fold rise compared to the AUD-, TBSA <20% cohorts (p = 0.04). Interestingly, there was also a marked rise in CAM + delirium scores (85.7%) among the AUD + patients with TBSA >=20% (p = 0.02). Not surprisingly, we found that hospital stays increased with AUD+ and larger burns (p = 0.0009). Our findings reveal that burn patients who misuse alcohol have aberrant inflammatory responses that may lead to greater immune dysregulation and worse clinical outcomes.
