36197132|t|The economic and societal burden of Alzheimer disease: managed care considerations.
36197132|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. Today, more than 6 million Americans are living with AD and that number is expected to increase to 13.8 million by 2060. The progressive debilitating nature of this illness and the absence of disease-modifying treatments contributes to a substantial economic and societal burden on the healthcare system. In 2022, the estimated healthcare costs associated with AD treatment were $321 billion, with costs projected to exceed $1 trillion by 2050. These cost-of-care projections are based on direct healthcare costs and are likely underestimated because indirect costs associated with AD treatment are usually not included. Indirect costs such as loss in productivity, diminished quality of life, and an increasing dependence on informal unpaid care provided by family caregivers augments the economic and societal burden of this disease. As drug development continues to evolve, the emergence of disease-modifying therapy may help to offset the burden associated with AD-related dementia. Managed care organizations are uniquely positioned to mitigate costs and positively impact outcomes through the promotion of disease awareness, early diagnosis, and treatment and disease management programs focused on multidisciplinary care coordination and caregiver support.
