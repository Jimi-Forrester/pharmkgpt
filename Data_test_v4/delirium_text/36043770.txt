36043770|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of age-related dementia, is typified by progressive memory loss and spatial awareness with personality changes. The increasing socioeconomic burden associated with AD has made it a focus of extensive research. Ample scientific evidence supports the role of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in AD pathophysiology, and there is increasing research into the possible role of anti-inflammatory and antioxidative agents as disease modifying therapies. While, the result of numerous preclinical studies has demonstrated the benefits of anti-inflammatory agents, these benefits however have not been replicated in clinical trials, necessitating a further search for more promising anti-inflammatory agents. Current understanding highlights the role of diet in the development of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, as well as the importance of dietary interventions and lifestyle modifications in mitigating them. The current narrative review examines scientific literature for evidence of the roles (if any) of dietary components, nutraceuticals and functional foods in the prevention or management of AD. It also examines how diet/ dietary components could modulate oxidative stress/inflammatory mediators and pathways that are crucial to the pathogenesis and/or progression of AD.
