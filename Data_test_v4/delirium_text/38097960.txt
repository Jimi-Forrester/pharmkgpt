Low protein diets are used for retarding the progression of CKD in clinical practice. Nonetheless, the impact of dietary protein consumption on cognitive function in this population remains uncertain. METHODS: We recruited 2306 participants (>=60 years) from 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). 24-h dietary recall questionnaire was utilized to evaluate protein intake. Cognitive function was measured using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD), Animal Fluency Test (AFT), and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Participants' characteristics were analyzed, and the interaction between protein consumption and CKD on cognitive impairment were analyzed using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: We divided participants into three groups based on CKD stages: no CKD, CKD stage G1 to G2 (19%), and CKD stage G3 to G5 (18%). The average protein intake was 0.97 g/(kg d). In the higher protein intake group, CKD stages G1 to G2 elevated the risk of immediate memory impairment (OR: 2.441, 95% Cl: 1.161-5.132 for protein consumption in 1.0-1.2g/(kg d); OR: 2.225, 95% Cl: 1.015-4.876 for protein consumption in >1.2 g/(kg d)). However, no similar resuts were observed in the lower protein intake group. In addition, the interaction between CKD status and protein intake on immediate memory was statistically significant (p = .041). CONCLUSION: A higher probability of cognitive impairment in the elderly with early-stage CKD may be linked to higher protein intake. Low protein diets may be a potential strategy to release cognitive impairment in the elderly with early-stage CKD.
