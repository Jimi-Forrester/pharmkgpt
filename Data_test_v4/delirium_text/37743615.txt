37743615|a|Vascular dementia (VaD) is characterized by progressive memory impairment, which is associated with microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. Polyphenol-rich natural plants, which possess anti-inflammatory activities, have attracted scientific interest worldwide. This study investigated whether Rubus fruticosus leaf extract (RFLE) can attenuate VaD. Sprague-Dawley rats were separated into five groups: SO, sham-operated and treated with vehicle; OP, operated and treated with vehicle; RFLE-L, operated and treated with low dose (30 mg/kg) of RFLE; RFLE-M, operated and treated with medium dose (60 mg/kg) of RFLE; and RFLE-H, operated and treated with high dose (90 mg/kg) of RFLE. Bilateral common carotid artery and hypotension were used as a modeling procedure, and the RFLE were intraorally administered for 5 days (preoperative 2 and postoperative 3 days). The rats then underwent memory tests including the novel object recognition, Y-maze, Barnes maze, and passive avoidance tests, and neuronal viability and neuroinflammation were quantified in their hippocampi. The results showed that the OP group exhibited VaD-associated memory deficits, neuronal death, and microglial activation in hippocampi, while the RFLE-treated groups showed significant attenuation in all above parameters. Next, using BV-2 microglial cells challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we evaluated the effects of RFLE in dynamics of proinflammatory mediators and the upstream signaling pathway. RFLE pretreatment significantly inhibited the LPS-induced release of nitric oxide, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 and upregulation of the MAPKs/NF-kappaB/iNOS pathway. Collectively, we suggest that RFLE can attenuate the histologic alterations and memory deficits accompanied by VaD, and these roles are, partly due to the attenuation of microglial activation.
