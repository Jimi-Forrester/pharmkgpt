25885307|t|Dexmedetomidine premedication in relevance to ketamine anesthesia: A prospective study.
25885307|a|BACKGROUND: Ketamine-induced hemodynamic pressor response and psychomimetic effects should be attenuated by appropriate premedication. The present study was designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine premedication for balancing the ketamine-induced hemodynamic pressor response and psychomimetic effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 80 normotensive adult consented patients of ASA grade I and II of both genders, aged 21 to 55 years, who met the inclusion criteria for elective surgery under ketamine anesthesia were randomized for this prospective blind study and divided into two treatment groups of 40 patients each. Group I patients received premedication of midazolam and Group II patients received premedication of dexmedetomidine. Anesthetic and surgical techniques were standardized. Both groups were assessed for changes in heart rate and systolic blood pressure intraoperatively and psychomimetic effects with behavioral changes postoperatively. RESULTS: Preoperatively, all patients were awake. Intraoperatively, the heart rate was 116.6+-4.2 in group I versus 76.8+-5.8 in group II (P value 0.0004) and systolic blood pressure was 153.07+-16.05 in group I versus 139.17+-19.9 in group II (P value 0.001). Post-anesthetic psychomimetic responses were not statistically significant between groups. CONCLUSION: The dexmedetomidine premedication effectively attenuated the ketamine induced hemodynamic pressor response and post-anesthetic delirium effects.
