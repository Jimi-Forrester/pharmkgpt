11333423|a|OBJECTIVES: This study aims to examine the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Alzheimer's disease behavioral pathology rating scale (CBehave-AD) and the behavioral profile of Chinese patients with AD. METHODS: Seventy-one subjects with NINCDS-ADRDA diagnosis of probable and possible AD were assessed for validation of the CBehave-AD. A behavioral symptom frequency checklist, the Chinese version of the Blessed Roth dementia scale (CDS) and the Cantonese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (CMMSE) were used for comparison. An extended sample of 120 AD patients was then evaluated with the CBehave-AD. RESULTS: High correlations between the CBehave-AD and checklist scores were found (paranoid and delusional ideation, hallucinations, activity disturbances, aggressiveness and diurnal rhythm disturbances). The scale also demonstrated satisfactory inter-rater and test-retest reliabilities. The mean (SD) CMMSE score of the 120 patients was 9.4 (7.1). Among them, 32% have delusions, 15% had hallucinations, 54% had activity disturbances, 61% had aggressive behavior, 44% had sleep disturbance, 24% had affective disturbances, 19% had anxiety and phobias. Delusional ideation was significantly associated with hallucinations, aggressiveness, and affective disturbances. Diurnal rhythm disturbances were associated with activity disturbances and aggressiveness. CBehave-AD total scores were not significantly correlated with severity of AD, but individual symptom categories showed different pattern of correlation. Delusions, hallucinations, anxiety and phobias were significantly correlated with dementia staging. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the CBehave-AD is a valid assessment tool for behavioral disturbances in patients with AD. Variable associations between different symptom categories and dementia staging suggest a need for further exploration of the complex interactions between behavioral and cognitive disturbances in dementia.
