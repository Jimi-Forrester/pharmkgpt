3587619|t|Lecithin: absence of neurophysiologic effect in Alzheimer's disease by EEG topography.
3587619|a|Ten patients with Alzheimer's disease participated in a 26-week double-blind trial of lecithin. EEG data were recorded at baseline, after administration of the placebo, and after administration of the drug. Topographic maps of EEG spectra were compared when patients were on and off drugs. A direct comparison of drug and nondrug data was not significant. A second approach, comparing differences between drug and nondrug with differences between the two nondrug conditions, also produced no evidence of a drug treatment effect. The data confirm other reports that lecithin has no effect upon spectrally analyzed EEG activity in Alzheimer's disease.
