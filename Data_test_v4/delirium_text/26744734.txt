Thus, lipid metabolites appear to be highly useful as diagnostic substrates for the diagnosis of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in plasma. METHODS: We analyzed plasma samples from controls (n = 35), MCI (n = 33), and AD patients (n = 43) using the AbsoluteIDQ p180 Kit (Biocrates Life Sciences), which included quantitative analysis of 40 acylcarnitines, 21 amino acids, 19 biogenic amines, 15 sphingolipids, 90 glycerophospholipids, and sum of hexoses. RESULTS: We found that individual lipid metabolites can differentiate controls from MCI and AD with relevant significance. However, the ratio between PC aa C34:4 and lysoPC a C18:2 differentiates controls from MCI (P = .0000007) and from AD (P = .0000009) with greater significance. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide evidence that the ratio of these two lipid metabolites is useful for diagnosing MCI and AD with an accuracy of 82%-85%.
