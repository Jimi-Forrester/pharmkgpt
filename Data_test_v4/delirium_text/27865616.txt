27865616|t|Phenylpropanoids from cinnamon bark reduced beta-amyloid production by the inhibition of beta-secretase in Chinese hamster ovarian cells stably expressing amyloid precursor protein.
27865616|a|beta-Amyloid (Abeta) is a substance of Alzheimer disease (AD), which is generated via the amyloidogenic pathway from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase. Inhibition of Abeta production is a potential therapeutic approach to AD. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that cinnamon bark (Cinnamomi Cortex Spissus), the dried bark of Cinnamomum cassia Blume (Lauraceae), and its constituents are beneficial to AD. The methanol extract of cinnamon bark efficiently reduced Abeta40 production in Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells stably expressing APP as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Bioassay-guided isolation of cinnamon bark extract was carried out using open column chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, and the following 6 phenylpropanoids were isolated: syringaresinol (1); medioresinol (2); coumarin (3); 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (4); cryptamygin A (5); and 3',5,7-trimethoxy epicatechin (6). Among these, 4 mug/mL medioresinol and cryptamygin A reduced Abeta40 production by 50% and 60%, respectively, compared with dimethyl sulfoxide-treated control cells. The IC50 values of medioresinol and cryptamygin A for the inhibition of Abeta40 production were 10.8 and 8.2 mug/mL, respectively. Furthermore, treatment of APP-CHO cells with either compound decreased the amount of beta-secretase and sAPPbeta (the proteolytic fragment of APP catalyzed by beta-secretase). These results suggest that the antiamyloidogenic activity of cinnamon bark extract was exerted by medioresinol and cryptamygin A via a reduction in the amount of beta-secretase. The extract of cinnamon bark contains potentially valuable antiamyloidogenic agents for the prevention and treatment of AD.
