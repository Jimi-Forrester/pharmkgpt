36868776|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, representing 80% of the total dementia cases. The "amyloid cascade hypothesis" stablishes that the aggregation of the beta-amyloid protein (Abeta42) is the first event that subsequently triggers AD development. Selenium nanoparticles stabilized with chitosan (Ch-SeNPs) have demonstrated excellent anti-amyloidogenic properties in previous works, leading to an improvement of AD aetiology. Here, the in vitro effect of selenium species in AD model cell line has been study to obtain a better assessment of their effects in AD treatment. For this purpose, mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro-2a) and human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell lines were used. Cytotoxicity of selenium species, such as selenomethionine (SeMet), Se-methylselenocysteine (MeSeCys) and Ch-SeNPs, has been determined by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and flow cytometry methods. Intracellular localisation of Ch-SeNPs, and their pathway through SH-SY5Y cell line, have been evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The uptake and accumulation of selenium species by both neuroblastoma cell lines have been quantified at single cell level by single cell- Inductively Coupled Plasma with Mass Spectrometry detection (SC-ICP-MS), with a previous optimisation of transport efficiency using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) ((69 +- 3) %) and 2.5 mm calibration beads ((92 +- 8) %). Results showed that Ch-SeNPs would be more readily accumulated by both cell lines than organic species being accumulation ranges between 1.2 and 89.5 fg Se cell-1 for Neuro-2a and 3.1-129.8 fg Se cell-1 for SH-SY5Y exposed to 250 muM Ch-SeNPs. Data obtained were statistically treated using chemometric tools. These results provide an important insight into the interaction of Ch-SeNPs with neuronal cells, which could support their potential use in AD treatment.
