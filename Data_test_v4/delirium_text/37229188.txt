37229188|t|Identification and characterization of circular RNA in the model of autism spectrum disorder from PM2.5 exposure.
37229188|a|PM2.5 induces a series of effects on neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), however, the mechanism is not completely clear yet. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of closed-loop structures that can be stably expressed in vivo. In our experiments, rats exposed to PM2.5 exhibited autism-like phenotypes, such as anxiety, and memory loss. To explore the etiology, we performed transcriptome sequencing and found significant differences in the expression of circRNA. A total of 7770 circRNAs were identified between the control and experimental groups, 18 of which were differentially expressed, we selected ten circRNAs and performed qRT-PCR and Sanger sequencing to validate them. By GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, we found differentially expressed circRNAs that were mainly enriched in processes related to placental development and reproduction. Finally, using bioinformatics, we predicted miRNAs and mRNAs that circ-Mbd5 and circ-Ash1l might regulate and constructed circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks involving genes associated with ASD, suggesting that circRNAs might regulate the occurrence of ASD.
