35448516|a|Fatty acids (FAs) have been shown to exhibit a pro-inflammatory response in various cell types, but astrocytes have been mostly overlooked. FAs, both saturated and unsaturated, have previously been shown to induce pro-inflammatory responses in astrocytes at high concentrations of hundreds of microg/mL. SSO (Sulfo-N-succinimidyl Oleate sodium), an inhibitor of FA translocase CD36, has been shown to prevent inflammation in the mouse brain by acting on local microglia and infiltrating monocytes. Our hypothesis was that SSO treatment would also impact astrocyte pro-inflammatory response to FA. In order to verify our assumption, we evaluated the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in normal human astrocyte cell culture pre-treated (or not) with SSO, and then exposed to low concentrations of both saturated (palmitic acid) and unsaturated (oleic acid) FAs. As a positive control for astrocyte inflammation, we used fibrillary amyloid. Neither Abeta 1-42 nor FAs induced CD36 protein expression in human astrocytes in cell culture At low concentrations, both types of FAs induced IL-8 protein secretion, and this effect was specifically inhibited by SSO pre-treatment. In conclusion, low concentrations of oleic acid are able to induce an early increase in IL-8 expression in normal human astrocytes, which is specifically downregulated by SSO.
