29171999|a|Human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters mediate a critical function in the cell, namely the transport of molecules across lipid membranes. Associated to their ubiquitous tissue distribution, they are key players in cellular homeostasis but also potential causative or contributing factors for many pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the central nervous system (CNS), numerous ABC transporters are present throughout the brain parenchyma and especially at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). AD is a neurodegenerative disorder mainly characterized by extracellular deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides and intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated forms of tau protein. Besides being degraded via proteolytic and phagocytic processes mediated by brain parenchymal cells, a major mechanism for eliminating cerebral Abeta is through its transport across the BBB into the peripheral blood. In fact, many AD cases are associated with impaired Abeta clearance. Consistently, several studies have recently uncovered important roles for ABC transporters in AD pathophysiology. Hence, this review focuses on the relevance of ABC transporters in CNS homeostasis by highlighting AD as a strong example of the deleterious consequences that might result from the former's altered expression and/or activity in the brain. The potentiality of human ABC transporters as novel pharmacological targets for both the diagnosis and therapeutics of AD is emphasized.
