35331359|a|OBJECTIVES: The literature on Alzheimer's disease (AD) provides little data about long-term cognitive course trajectories. We identify global cognitive outcome trajectories and associated predictor variables that may inform clinical research and care. DESIGN: Data derived from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set were used to examine the cognitive course of persons with possible or probable AD, a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) of >=10, and complete annual assessments for 5 years. SETTING: Thirty-six Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred and fourteen persons. MEASUREMENTS: We used a hybrid approach comprising qualitative analysis of MMSE trajectory graphs that were operationalized empirically and binary logistic regression analyses to assess 19 variables' associations with each trajectory. MMSE scores of +-3 points or greater were considered clinically meaningful. RESULTS: Five distinct cognitive trajectories were identified: fast decliners (32.6%), slow decliners (30.7%), zigzag stable (15.9%), stable (15.9%), and improvers (4.8%). The decliner groups had three subtypes: curvilinear, zigzag, and late decline. The fast decliners were associated with female gender, lower baseline MMSE scores, a shorter illness duration, or receiving a cognitive enhancer. An early MMSE decline of >=3 points predicted a worse outcome. A higher rate of traumatic brain injury, the absence of an ApoE epsilon4 allele, and male gender were the strongest predictors of favorable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our hybrid approach revealed five distinct cognitive trajectories and a variegated pattern within the decliners and stable/improvers that was more consistent with real-world clinical experience than prior statistically modeled studies. Future investigations need to determine the consistency of the distribution of these categories across settings.
