38258287|t|Cystocerebral Syndrome in a Patient with Altered Mental Status.
38258287|a|BACKGROUND Cystocerebral syndrome is delirium occurring in the elderly that results from urinary retention and acute bladder distension. Urinary retention can cause cerebral issues, such as altered mental status, without having an infection present. The pathophysiology is possibly due to increased catecholamine secretion while attempting to micturate. Due to its presenting symptoms, most physicians begin cerebrovascular workup, performing unnecessary and, often, invasive imaging studies. Although easily overlooked as a differential diagnosis, cystocerebral syndrome is an easily treatable cause of delirium and should be considered during treatment of elderly patients with delirium. CASE REPORT The patient was an 89-year-old man with a medical history of chronic obstructive airway disease, dementia, hypertensive disorder, and gastroesophageal reflux disease who presented with altered mental status secondary to urinary incontinence. The computed tomography scan without contrast showed a large volume of impacted stool in the cecum, with a distended urinary bladder. This case report describes his presentation, medical treatment, and outcome and discusses areas of gap improvement. CONCLUSIONS To date, there are only a handful of published articles on cystocerebral syndrome. This case report aims to add the awareness of bladder distention as an etiology of cystocerebral syndrome to the body of knowledge in the scientific community in the hope that patients will be identified and treated earlier, more safely, and at a reduced cost. Cystocerebral syndrome needs to be extensively addressed in research, and physicians should consider it one of the important differential diagnoses of delirium among elderly men.
