39201704|a|The NACHT-, leucine-rich-repeat-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) is a critical intracellular sensor of the innate immune system that detects various pathogen- and danger-associated molecular patterns, leading to the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome and release of interleukin (IL) 1beta and IL-18. However, the abnormal activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoinflammatory diseases such as cryopyrin-associated autoinflammatory syndromes (CAPS) and common diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and asthma. Recent studies have revealed that pyrin functions as an indirect sensor, similar to the plant guard system, and is regulated by binding to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins. Upon activation, pyrin transitions to its active form. NLRP3 is predicted to follow a similar regulatory mechanism and maintain its inactive form in the cage model, as it also acts as an indirect sensor. Additionally, newly developed NLRP3 inhibitors have been found to inhibit NLRP3 activity by stabilizing its inactive form. Most studies and reviews on NLRP3 have focused on the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review highlights the molecular mechanisms that regulate NLRP3 in its resting state, and discusses how targeting this inhibitory mechanism can lead to novel therapeutic strategies for NLRP3-related diseases.
