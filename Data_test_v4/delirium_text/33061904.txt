33061904|t|Association Between Peripheral Adiponectin and Lipids Levels and the Therapeutic Response to Donepezil Treatment in Han Chinese Patients With Alzheimer's Disease.
33061904|a|Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) including donepezil (DNP) are considered to be the most promising therapeutic possibilities of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The response to DNP in AD patients varies and it is valuable to identify the potential markers that can predict the efficacy. Moreover, DNP has been found to affect bone function, but the exact mechanism is still unclear. Lipids and adipokine may link to AD and DNP directly or indirectly and might be potential biomarkers or therapeutic drug targets. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationships among adiponectin (APN), lipids levels, and the response to DNP, and to identify whether the effect of DNP in AD treatment is related to its effect on the level of APN in systemic circulation. The study recruited 85 AD patients with DNP treatment, of whom 47 were DNP responders and 38 were DNP nonresponders. The Mini-Mental State Examination was performed to evaluate the memory impairment. Plasma APN was measured with ELISA. The genotypes of single nucleotide polymorphisms rs1501299 and rs22417661 in APN for each patient were identified. Plasma lipids were quantified with gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Correlations among APN, lipid metabolomics, and DNP responded were evaluated. APN was significantly decreased in DNP responders. Methyl stearate and glycerol-3-phosphate, used for characterizing adipogenic differentiation, were significantly decreased in DNP responders compared to DNP nonresponders. APN and small-molecule lipids can be used as potential biomarkers to evaluate the efficacy of DNP. The results of metabolomics indicated that there was no change in the metabolic pathway of fatty acid metabolism and glucose metabolism in DNP responders, suggesting that APN-related biological function did not decrease in DNP responders. Our result suggests that more attention should be pay to the sources and biological functions of APN in AD with DNP treatment.
