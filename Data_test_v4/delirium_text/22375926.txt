22375926|t|The relation between serum lipids and lutein and zeaxanthin in the serum and retina: results from cross-sectional, case-control and case study designs.
22375926|a|BACKGROUND: The xanthophyll carotenoids lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z) are found in and around the macula of the primate retina, where they are termed macular pigment (MP). Dietary L and Z are absorbed with fat in the gut and transported on lipoproteins to the retina. Both MP and serum lipoproteins have been related to risk for neurodegenerative diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). L and Z are carried on both HDL (related to reduced risk of AMD) and LDL (related to increased risk). The purpose of this set of studies was to analyze the relation between L and Z in the serum and retina with the circulating lipid profile. METHODS: In all experiments, lipoproteins were measured enzymatically from plasma, and MP optical density (MPOD) was measured using customized heterochromatic flicker photometry. Experiment 1: Relations between serum L and Z, MPOD and lipoprotein levels. 108 young, healthy subjects (M = 23.2, SD = 4.12 years) participated. Lipoprotein levels and MPOD were measured. In a subset of 66 participants, serum L and Z levels were also measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Experiment 2: Relations between lipoprotein levels and MPOD in statin users. 20 subjects (M = 58.05, SD = 11.08 years) taking statin medication and 20 subjects (M = 57.95, SD = 11.03 years) not taking satin were recruited for participation. MPOD and lipoprotein levels were measured. Experiment 3: lowering lipoprotein levels to impact MPOD. One individual (aged 41 years) with high MP density adhered first to an atorvastatin regimen, then, after a wash-out period, to a rosuvastatin regimen. RESULTS: Experiment 1: HDL were significantly (p < 0.05) related to MPOD (r = 0.33), to serum L (r = 0.36) and to serum Z (r = 0.26). MPOD was also significantly related to total cholesterol (r = 0.19). Experiment 2: MPOD was not lower in statin users when compared to matched non-statin users, but MPOD decreased significantly with increased duration of statin use (r = -0.63). Experiment 3: Administration of a statin regimen reduced MPOD with atorvastatin (p < 0.05) but not with rosuvastatin. CONCLUSIONS: Serum xanthophylls, retinal xanthophylls and lipoprotein concentrations are significantly related, and changing lipoprotein levels may impact levels of retinal xanthophylls.
