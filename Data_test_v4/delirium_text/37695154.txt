37695154|a|The Alzheimer's disease - an age-related neurodegenerative disorder leading to a progressive cognitive impairment - is characterized by an intracerebral accumulation of soluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomers, followed by the appearance of abnormally ubiquitinylated neurofibrillary tangles - a process associated with a chronic inflammation. The systematic presence of ubiquitinylated inclusions reflects a decrease in the proteasome activity due to (and contributing to) the presence of Abeta oligomers - a central dysfunction in the etiology of the disease. The involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system opens new therapeutic perspectives for both prevention and treatment.
