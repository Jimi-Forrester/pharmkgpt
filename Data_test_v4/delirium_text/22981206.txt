22981206|a|INTRODUCTION: Alcohol withdrawal delirium (AWD) is one of the most serious complications of alcohol withdrawal. The daily practice of linking activity in addiction shows that this condition is not uncommon. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We extracted from the hospital database patients' admissions for which a diagnosis of AWD (F104) was registered between 2004 and 2009. The review of discharge reports allowed to select the patients for which the medical records were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients admitted for DT were selected. Mean age was 48 years (male 89.7%). A majority of patients (89.7%) were admitted through the emergency department. In about a half of cases (51.3%), blood alcohol concentration was null at admission. The main reasons for the admission were alcohol withdrawal syndrome (17.9%), fall/malaise (15.4%), and generalized seizures (12.8%). Approximately one-third of the patients had a medical history of seizures and 23.1% of AWD. No patient had severe liver failure. Six patients (15.4%) were transferred to intensive care. Two patients developed AWD after surgery. No deaths have been observed. CONCLUSION: Improving medical knowledge of AWD is a way to make this complication even more uncommon.
