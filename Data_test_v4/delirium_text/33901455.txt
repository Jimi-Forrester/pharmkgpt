33901455|t|Dexmedetomidine, Delirium, and Adverse Outcomes: Analysis of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database.
33901455|a|BACKGROUND: We tested the hypothesis that dexmedetomidine was associated with a reduced incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) and adverse outcomes in cardiac surgery patients from The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database including the Adult Cardiac Anesthesiology subsection. METHODS: We identified 55,905 patients in The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database who underwent cardiac surgery between July 2014 and December 2018. Using propensity score-weighted regression analysis, we analyzed the effect of intraoperative dexmedetomidine on the primary (POD) and secondary outcomes (highest pain score on day 3 and at discharge, stroke, prolonged ventilation, postoperative intubation/reintubation, additional postoperative hours ventilated, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and 30-day mortality). In separate propensity score-weighted analyses, we examined the effect of postoperative dexmedetomidine on the highest postoperative pain score at discharge and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: The rate of intraoperative dexmedetomidine use was 25.5% (n = 13,963), and its administration was associated with increased odds for POD (odds ratio, 1.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60-2.13), a small higher average pain score on day 3 (mean difference, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.02-0.14), increased odds for postoperative intubation/reintubation (odds ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12-1.48), and a small lower average pain score at discharge (mean difference, -0.31; 95% CI, -0.21 to-0.41). Postoperative dexmedetomidine was associated with a small higher average pain score at discharge (mean difference, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.21-0.34) and higher odds for 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 1.25, 95% CI, 1.07-1.46). CONCLUSIONS: In this registry of cardiac surgical patients dexmedetomidine administration was associated with POD and adverse outcomes.
