37215742|t|Extraction, bioactive function and application of wheat germ protein/peptides: A review.
37215742|a|The aging population and high incidence of age-related diseases are major global societal issues. Consuming bioactive substances as part of our diet is increasingly recognized as essential for ensuring a healthy life for older adults. Wheat germ protein has a reasonable peptide structure and amino acid ratio but has not been fully utilized and exploited, resulting in wasted wheat germ resources. This review summarizes reformational extraction methods of wheat germ protein/peptides (WGPs), of which different methods can be selected to obtain various WGPs. Interestingly, except for some bioactive activities found earlier, WGPs display potential anti-aging activity, with possible mechanisms including antioxidant, immunomodulatory and intestinal flora regulation. However, there are missing in vitro and in vivo bioactivity assessments of WGPs. WGPs possess physicochemical properties of good foamability, emulsification and water retention and are used as raw materials or additives to improve food quality. Based on the above, further studies designing methods to isolate particular types of WGPs, determining their nutritional and bioactive mechanisms and verifying their activity in vivo in humans are crucial for using WGPs to improve human health.
