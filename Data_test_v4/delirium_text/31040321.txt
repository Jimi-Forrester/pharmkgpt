31040321|a|Non-natively folded variants of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), however the relative toxicities of these variants are controversial. Here, we aimed to decipher the relationships between the different SOD1 variants (aggregated, soluble misfolded, soluble total) and the clinical presentation of ALS in the SOD1G93A mouse. Using a multi-approach strategy, we found that the CNS regions least affected by disease had the most aggregated SOD1. We also found that the levels of aggregated SOD1 in the spinal cord were inversely correlated with the disease progression. Conversely, in the most affected regions, we observed that there was a high soluble misfolded/soluble total SOD1 ratio. Taken together, these findings suggest that soluble misfolded SOD1 may be the disease driver in ALS, whereas aggregated SOD1 may serve to sequester the toxic species acting in a neuroprotective fashion.
