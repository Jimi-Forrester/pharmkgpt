36355957|t|Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration of the Central Nervous System from Air Pollutants: A Scoping Review.
36355957|a|In this scoping review, we provide a selective mapping of the global literature on the effects of air pollution on the life-span development of the central nervous system. Our synthesis first defines developmental neurotoxicants and the model effects of particulate matter. We then discuss air pollution as a test bench for neurotoxicants, including animal models, the framework of systemic inflammation in all affected organs of the body, and the cascade effects on the developing brain, with the most prevalent neurological structural and functional outcomes. Specifically, we focus on evidence on magnetic resonance imaging and neurodegenerative diseases, and the links between neuronal apoptosis and inflammation. There is evidence of a developmental continuity of outcomes and effects that can be observed from utero to aging due to severe or significant exposure to neurotoxicants. These substances alter the normal trajectory of neurological aging in a propulsive way towards a significantly higher rate of acceleration than what is expected if our atmosphere were less polluted. The major aggravating role of this neurodegenerative process is linked with the complex action of neuroinflammation. However, most recent evidence learned from research on the effects of COVID-19 lockdowns around the world suggests that a short-term drastic improvement in the air we breathe is still possible. Moreover, the study of mitohormesis and vitagenes is an emerging area of research interest in anti-inflammatory and antidegenerative therapeutics, which may have enormous promise in combatting the deleterious effects of air pollution through pharmacological and dietary interventions.
