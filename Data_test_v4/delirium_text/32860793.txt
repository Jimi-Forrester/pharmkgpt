32860793|a|The chicken egg vitelline membrane (CEVM) is an important structure for the transmembrane transport of egg yolk components, protection of the blastodisc, and separation of egg white and egg yolk. In this study, the N-glycoproteome of the CEVM was mapped and analyzed in depth. Total protein of the CEVM was digested, and the glycopeptides were enriched by a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography microcolumn and identified by nano liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 435 N-glycosylation sites on 208 N-glycoproteins were identified in CEVM. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis showed that CEVM N-glycoproteins are mainly involved in the regulation of proteinases/inhibitors and transmembrane transport of lipids. Mucin-5B is the primary N-glycoprotein in the CEVM. Comparison of the main N-glycoproteins between the CEVM and other egg parts revealed the tissue specificity of N-glycosylation of egg proteins. The results provide insights into protein N-glycosylation in the chicken egg, CEVM functions and underlying mechanisms.
