33622758|a|Neurological conditions are being more recognised in patients with COVID-19, with encephalopathy being the most prevalent problem. Posterior reversible encephalopathy is suspected to occur due to elevated blood pressure and overproduction of inflammatory markers, both of which have been reported in the setting of COVID-19 infection. Encephalopathy was the main presentation in this case, without respiratory dysfunction initially, and with imaging findings indicative of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome as an aetiology. Follow-up imaging showed resolution of the abnormal results with mental status returning to baseline upon discharge.
