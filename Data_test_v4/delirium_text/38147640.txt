38147640|t|Diagnosis and treatment status of suprasellar optic pathway cavernous malformations.
38147640|a|Cerebral cavernous malformations constitute a subtype of cerebral vascular malformation typically located in the cerebral cortex. However, their occurrence in the suprasellar optic pathway is relatively rare. There is some uncertainty surrounding the clinical diagnostic methods and optimal treatment strategies specific to suprasellar optic pathway cavernous malformations. In this narrative review, we retrospectively analyzed relevant literature related to suprasellar visual pathway cavernous malformations. We conducted a study involving 90 patients who were postoperatively diagnosed with cavernous malformations, including the 16-year-old male patient mentioned in this article. We have summarized crucial clinical data, including the patient age distribution, sex ratio, lesion locations, primary symptoms, and surgical approaches. The comprehensive analysis of this clinical information underscores the critical importance of timely intervention in relieving symptoms and improving neurological deficits in affected patients. These findings provide valuable guidance and insight for clinical practitioners and researchers dealing with this specific medical condition.
