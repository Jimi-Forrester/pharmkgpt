35076604|t|Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Computer-Based Education Platform, Pharmacy5in5, on Pharmacists' Knowledge of Anticholinergic Toxicity Using a Randomized Controlled Trial.
35076604|a|BACKGROUND: Computer-based education has been widely implemented in healthcare professional development education. However, there has been little examination of the potential for computer-based education to enhance pharmacists' knowledge. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of computer-based education on improving pharmacists' knowledge compared to printed education material. METHODS: This study was a web-based randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomly allocated to either an intervention group where they had access to the computer-based education module on Pharmacy5in5.ca or to a control group where they had access to printed educational material. Knowledge gain was assessed using a pre- and post-knowledge test. RESULTS: A total of 120 pharmacists were recruited and 101 completed the post-knowledge test (50/60 in the intervention group; 51/60 in the control group). Both groups showed a significant increase in knowledge gain (intervention group: pre-test mean score 19.35 +- 3.56, post-test mean score 22.42 +- 3.812, p value < 0.001; control group pre-test mean score 19.22 +- 3.45, post-test mean score 23.29 +- 3.087, p value < 0.001). However, the difference in knowledge change was not significant between the two groups (22.42 vs. 23.29, p value = 0.333). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a computer-based education module enhanced pharmacists' knowledge to a similar degree to printed education material. Efforts should be made to provide computer-based education as an option to support pharmacists' professional development.
