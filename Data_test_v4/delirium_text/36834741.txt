36834741|t|Imaging Methods Applicable in the Diagnostics of Alzheimer's Disease, Considering the Involvement of Insulin Resistance.
36834741|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease and the most frequently diagnosed type of dementia, characterized by (1) perturbed cerebral perfusion, vasculature, and cortical metabolism; (2) induced proinflammatory processes; and (3) the aggregation of amyloid beta and hyperphosphorylated Tau proteins. Subclinical AD changes are commonly detectable by using radiological and nuclear neuroimaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Furthermore, other valuable modalities exist (in particular, structural volumetric, diffusion, perfusion, functional, and metabolic magnetic resonance methods) that can advance the diagnostic algorithm of AD and our understanding of its pathogenesis. Recently, new insights into AD pathoetiology revealed that deranged insulin homeostasis in the brain may play a role in the onset and progression of the disease. AD-related brain insulin resistance is closely linked to systemic insulin homeostasis disorders caused by pancreas and/or liver dysfunction. Indeed, in recent studies, linkages between the development and onset of AD and the liver and/or pancreas have been established. Aside from standard radiological and nuclear neuroimaging methods and clinically fewer common methods of magnetic resonance, this article also discusses the use of new suggestive non-neuronal imaging modalities to assess AD-associated structural changes in the liver and pancreas. Studying these changes might be of great clinical importance because of their possible involvement in AD pathogenesis during the prodromal phase of the disease.
