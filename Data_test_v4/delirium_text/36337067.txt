36337067|a|Background: One of the challenges in using stem cells to neural repair is to induce their differentiation into neurons and lack of glial formation. Objectives: Mesenchymal stem cells have revealed great potential for neural reorganization and renewal by taking advantage of differentiation capabilities. Here we explored the potential use of olibanum extract in freeze-dried scaffolds for induction of stem cells differentiation. Materials and Methods: In this study, gelatin/ collagen/olibanum/ graphene oxide (GEL/COL/OL/GO) freeze-dried scaffolds were synthesized and then adult rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) were seeded on scaffolds. The viability of cells was evaluated using MTT test on days 1, 3 and 5. The morphology of the cells seeded on scaffolds was studied using SEM and specific protein expression detected by immunohistochemical analysis. Real-time PCR was applied to detect the expression of Chat, Pax6, Hb-9, Nestin, Islet-1, and neurofilament-H (NF-H). The data were analyzed using Tukey test and one-way ANOVA and the means difference was considered significant at P<0.05, P<0.01, and P<0.001. Results: Showed that the pore size is increased in GEL/COL/OL/GO scaffolds compared with GO-free scaffolds and higher attachment and proliferation of BMMSCs on GEL/COL/OL /1.5% GO scaffolds compared to GEL/COL/OL/3% GO scaffolds. The cell viability results after 5 days of incubation showed the significant biocompatibility of GEL/COL/OL /1.5% GO freeze-dried scaffold. The results of immunohistochemical and PCR analysis revealed positive role of GEL/COL/OL/1.5% GO scaffolds in upregulation of neuron-specific markers. Conclusion: These results reveal the great potential of GEL/COL/OL/GO scaffolds for nerve regeneration. Our data suggested that both OL extract and GO can regulate the MSCs differentiation into neurons.
