6801198|t|Coronary artery bypass in a patient on lithium carbonate prophylaxis.
6801198|a|What is thought to be the first case of coronary artery bypass in a patient on lithium carbonate prophylaxis is presented. A postcardiotomy delirium developed on day 2 and appeared unrelated to the underlying manic-depressive illness. A 2-year follow-up indicated apparent resolution of pre-existing psychological difficulties and no recurrence of somatic symptoms. It is suggested that lithium carbonate prophylaxis be continued with appropriate monitoring during coronary artery bypass procedures.
