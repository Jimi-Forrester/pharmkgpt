38241253|a|OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of early swallowing assessment and rehabilitation on the total oral intake and in-hospital mortality in patients with aspiration pneumonia. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients with aspiration admitted between September 1, 2015, and October 31, 2016. The inclusion criterion was total oral intake before admission. A new protocol-based intervention for appropriate early oral intake was implemented on April 1, 2016. The protocol consisted of two steps. First, a screening test was conducted on the day of admission to detect patients who were not at high risk of dysphagia. Second, patients underwent a modified water swallowing test and water swallowing test. Patients cleared by these tests immediately initiated oral intake. The primary outcome, the composite outcomes of no recovery to total oral intake at discharge, and in-hospital mortality were compared between the patients admitted pre- and post protocol intervention. RESULTS: A total of 188 patients were included in the analysis (pre-, 92; post-, 96). The primary outcome did not differ between the pre- and post-intervention periods (23/92 [25.0%] vs. 18/96 [18.8%], p = 0.30). After adjusting for other variables, the intervention was significantly associated with a lower risk of composite outcomes (odds ratio, 0.22, 95%CI, 0.08-0.61, p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: The new protocol for early swallowing assessment, rehabilitation, and promotion of oral intake in patients admitted with aspiration pneumonia may be associated with the lower risk for the composite outcomes of in-hospital mortality and no recovery to total oral intake.
