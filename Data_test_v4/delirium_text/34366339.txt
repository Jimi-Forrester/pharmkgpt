34366339|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disorder, accompanied by progressive cognitive decline, for which there is no cure. Recently, the close correlation between AD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been noted, and a promising anti-AD strategy is the use of anti-T2DM drugs. OBJECTIVE: To investigate if the novel glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonist DA4-JC shows protective effects in the triple APP/PS1/tau mouse model of AD. METHODS: A battery of behavioral tests were followed by in vivo recording of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, quantified synapses using the Golgi method, and biochemical analysis of biomarkers. RESULTS: DA4-JC improved cognitive impairment in a range of tests and relieved pathological features of APP/PS1/tau mice, enhanced LTP in the hippocampus, increased numbers of synapses and dendritic spines, upregulating levels of post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and synaptophysin (SYP), normalized volume and numbers of mitochondria and improving the phosphatase and tensin homologue induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) - Parkin mitophagy signaling pathway, while downregulating amyloid, p-tau, and autophagy marker P62 levels. CONCLUSION: DA4-JC is a promising drug for the treatment of AD.
