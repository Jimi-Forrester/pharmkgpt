34480749|t|Cannabinoid Formulations and Delivery Systems: Current and Future Options to Treat Pain.
34480749|a|The field of Cannabis sativa L. research for medical purposes has been rapidly advancing in recent decades and a growing body of evidence suggests that phytocannabinoids are beneficial for a range of conditions. At the same time impressing development has been observed for formulations and delivery systems expanding the potential use of cannabinoids as an effective medical therapy. The objective of this review is to present the most recent results from pharmaceutical companies and research groups investigating methods to improve cannabinoid bioavailability and to clearly establish its therapeutic efficacy, dose ranges, safety and also improve the patient compliance. Particular focus is the application of cannabinoids in pain treatment, describing the principal cannabinoids employed, the most promising delivery systems for each administration routes and updating the clinical evaluations. To offer the reader a wider view, this review discusses the formulation starting from galenic preparation up to nanotechnology approaches, showing advantages, limits, requirements needed. Furthermore, the most recent clinical data and meta-analysis for cannabinoids used in different pain management are summarized, evaluating their real effectiveness, in order also to spare opioids and improve patients' quality of life. Promising evidence for pain treatments and for other important pathologies are also reviewed as likely future directions for cannabinoids formulations.
