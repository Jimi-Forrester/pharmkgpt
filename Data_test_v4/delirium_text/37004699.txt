37004699|a|BACKGROUND: Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI) is a common complication of liver surgery, which can lead to extrahepatic metabolic disorders, such as cognitive impairment. Recent observations have emphasized the critical effects of gut microbial metabolites in regulating the development of liver injury. Herein, we investigated the potential contribution of gut microbiota to HIRI-related cognitive impairment. METHODS: HIRI murine models were established by ischemia-reperfusion surgery in the morning (ZT0, 08:00) and evening (ZT12, 20:00), respectively. Antibiotic-induced pseudo-germ-free mice were gavaged with fecal bacteria of the HIRI models. Behavioral test was used to assess cognitive function. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics were used for microbial and hippocampal analysis. RESULTS: Our results established that cognitive impairment caused by HIRI underwent diurnal oscillations; HIRI mice performed poorly on the Y-maze test and the novel object preference test when surgery occurred in the evening compared with the morning. In addition, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from the ZT12-HIRI was demonstrated to induce cognitive impairment behavior. The specific composition and metabolites of gut microbiota were analyzed between the ZT0-HIRI and ZT12-HIRI, and bioinformatic analysis showed that the differential fecal metabolites were significantly enriched in lipid metabolism pathways. After FMT, the hippocampal lipid metabolome between the P-ZT0-HIRI and P-ZT12-HIRI groups was analyzed to reveal a series of lipid molecules with significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that gut microbiota are involved in circadian differences of HIRI-related cognitive impairment by affecting hippocampal lipid metabolism.
