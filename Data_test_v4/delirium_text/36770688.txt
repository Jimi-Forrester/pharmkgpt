36770688|t|Anti-Amyloidogenic Effects of Metasequoia glyptostroboides Fruits and Its Active Constituents.
36770688|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious neurodegenerative brain disease that interferes with daily life. The accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta), along with oxidative stress-inducing neurocellular apoptosis, has been considered one of the causes of AD. Thus, the purpose of this study is to find natural products that can reduce Abeta accumulation. The ethanol extract of Metasequoia glyptostroboides Hu & Cheng fruits (Cupressaceae) significantly reduced the aggregation of Abeta into oligomers and fibrils determined by Thioflavin T (ThT) assay. The solvent-partitioned ethyl acetate layer was further separated based on the bioassay-guided isolation method combined with the ThT assay. As a result, five compounds were isolated and elucidated as taxoquinone (1), sugiol (2), suginal (3), sandaracopimarinol (4), and sandaracopimaradien-19-ol (5) by comparing NMR data with references. All the compounds significantly reduced the aggregation of Abeta and enhanced the disaggregation of pre-formed Abeta aggregates in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the inhibition of Abeta aggregation by the compounds protected PC12 cells from Abeta aggregate-induced toxicity. Among the five compounds, sandaracopimarinol (4) and sandaracopimaradien-19-ol (5) were the most effective. These results suggest that M. glyptostroboides and isolated five compounds have a potential for further study to be developed as anti-AD agents.
