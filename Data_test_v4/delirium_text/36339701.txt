36339701|a|Background: The role of memory in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been an area of research that has yielded mixed results, particularly in prospective memory (PM) functioning. Hence, one objective of the study was to assess PM deficits in patients with OCD. Also, research in this area has been sparse, and most researchers have used questionnaires and people with subclinical symptoms of OCD, which might have impacted the generalizability of the findings. Thus, the second objective was to assess PM functioning using a performance-based task in persons with OCD having clinical symptoms. Methods: This is a cross-sectional comparative study of 30 adults with OCD and 30 adults without psychiatric morbidity. The tools used were Dimensional Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DY-BOCS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ 12), and Cambridge Prospective Memory Test (CAMPROMPT). Results: Event-based PM was significantly poor in the OCD group. In time-based PM, no significant difference was found between the groups. Three subgroups in OCD, predominantly obsessions, predominantly compulsions, and mixed types, did not differ significantly with respect to PM. Conclusion: The result suggested a deficit of event-based PM in OCD, which can help understand the psychopathology of memory deficit in the clinical population and bridge the gap with respect to memory research in this domain.
