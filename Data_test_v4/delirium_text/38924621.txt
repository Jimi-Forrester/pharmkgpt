38924621|t|Relationship between donepezil and fracture risk in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies.
38924621|a|AIM: Patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are at a high risk for falls and fractures. Although cholinesterase inhibitors reportedly are effective in suppressing the progression of cognitive symptoms in DLB patients, their effects on fracture risk remain unclarified. This study aimed to evaluate the association between donepezil use and hip fracture risk in older patients with DLB. METHODS: Using the Japanese insurance claim database, we collected the data of patients aged >=65 years with DLB from April 2012 to March 2019. After propensity score matching, we compared the fracture rate over 3 years between DLB patients receiving donepezil and those not receiving antidementia drugs. RESULTS: Altogether, 24 022 239 individuals aged >=65 years were newly registered from April 2012 to March 2016 and had verifiable information from 6 months before to 3 years after the registration. We identified 6634 pure-DLB patients and analyzed the data of 1182 propensity score-matched pairs. The characteristics, including age, sex, fracture history, osteoporosis, and bone mineral density test rate, of the two groups were well balanced by propensity score matching. The incidence rate of hip fracture was significantly lower in DLB patients receiving donepezil than in those not receiving antidementia drugs (0.60 vs. 1.44/100 person-years, P < 0.001), whereas that of vertebral fractures was the same. CONCLUSIONS: Donepezil administration in Japanese people aged >=65 years with DLB was significantly associated with a decreased risk of hip fracture. Donepezil may provide new benefits to DLB patients. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2024; 24: 782-788.
