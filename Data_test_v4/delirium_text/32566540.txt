32566540|t|Sleep Disturbance Strongly Related to the Development of Postoperative Delirium in Proximal Femoral Fracture Patients Aged 60 or Older.
32566540|a|PURPOSE: Post-fracture sleeping disorders can lead to a deterioration of mental and physical health and delay recovery to pre-fracture status. Here, an analysis was conducted to determine if sleep disturbance is a risk factor for delirium in patients older than 60 years of age with surgically treated proximal femoral fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 316 patients with surgically treated proximal femoral fractures between January 2014 and December 2016; 33 patients were removed from analysis due to exclusion criteria. Confirmation of delirium was made by a neurologist upon consultation for cognitive impairment and sleeping disorders were confirmed by a doctor or nurse based on the Pittsburgh sleep quality index. Potential risk factors other than a sleep disorder (e.g., history of cognitive impairment, medical illness, preoperational levels of albumin and hemoglobin, transfusion) were also analyzed as variables for the development of delirium. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of a sleeping disorder as a risk factor for the development of delirium were 0.75 and 0.76, respectively; the positive and negative predictive values were 0.64 and 0.93, respectively. A sleeping disorder was significantly related to the development of the delirium (odds ratio adjusted for age, sex and body mass index was 5.78, P<0.01). In those with a history of cognitive impairment, the adjusted odds ratio for the development of delirium was 6.03 (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Sleeping disorders occurring after a surgically repaired proximal femoral fracture in patients 60 years of age or older could be an independent predictive factor of delirium.
