15837558|a|Vascular amyloidosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) results in the exposure of red blood cells to beta-amyloid fibrils (A beta). The potential in vivo ramifications of this exposure have been investigated by injecting A beta(1-40) alone or A beta-bound mouse red blood cells into the circulation of C57BL/6 mice. Results indicate that when A beta(1-40) is injected alone, a transient uptake of the fibrils by red blood cells occurs in vivo. When A beta-bound red blood cells were injected, beta-amyloid is rapidly removed from these cells in vivo. Double-labeling experiments indicate that while some of the red blood cells bound to A beta(1-40) are removed from circulation, a major fraction of these cells remain in circulation even after A beta is removed. Immunohistochemistry of murine tissue samples obtained after sacrificing the animals suggests that within 1 h after injection of A beta(1-40) or A beta-bound red blood cells, A beta is found in spleen phagocytes and liver Kupffer cells. Heme staining further indicates that the binding of A beta(1-40) to red blood cells enhances red cell phagocytosis by the spleen.
