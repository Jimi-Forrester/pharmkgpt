28532055|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia in the aged brain. Even though its etiology is unknown, factors such as neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and impaired insulin signaling may play a role. We used a sporadic AD model in rats generated by intracerebroventricular-streptozotocin (i.c.v.-STZ) injection to test the therapeutic effect of gold nanoparticles (GNPs). We tested the null hypothesis that there would be no difference between the STZ+GNPs group and the STZ group in the analyzed markers. We observed that STZ-induced impairment in mitochondrial ATP production, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress were all prevented by GNP treatment. Moreover, while STZ induced deficits in both spatial and recognition memory, GNPs prevented this effect. These results suggest that GNPs may be considered as a potential treatment for dementias.
