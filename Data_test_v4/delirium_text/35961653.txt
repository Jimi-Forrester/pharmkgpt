35961653|t|Signature Effects of Vector-Guided Systemic Nano Bioconjugate Delivery Across Blood-Brain Barrier of Normal, Alzheimer's, and Tumor Mouse Models.
35961653|a|The ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is critical for targeted therapy of the central nerve system (CNS). Six peptide vectors were covalently attached to a 50 kDa poly(beta-l-malic acid)-trileucine polymer forming P/LLL(40%)/vector conjugates. The vectors were Angiopep-2 (AP2), B6, Miniap-4 (M4), and d-configurated peptides D1, D3, and ACI-89, with specificity for transcytosis receptors low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1), transferrin receptor (TfR), bee venom-derived ion channel, and Abeta/LRP-1 related transcytosis complex, respectively. The BBB-permeation efficacies were substantially increased ("boosted") in vector conjugates of P/LLL(40%). We have found that the copolymer group binds at the endothelial membrane and, by an allosterically membrane rearrangement, exposes the sites for vector-receptor complex formation. The specificity of vectors is indicated by competition experiments with nonconjugated vectors. P/LLL(40%) does not function as an inhibitor, suggesting that the copolymer binding site is eliminated after binding of the vector-nanoconjugate. The two-step mechanism, binding to endothelial membrane and allosteric exposure of transcytosis receptors, is supposed to be an integral feature of nanoconjugate-transcytosis pathways. In vivo brain delivery signatures of the nanoconjugates were recapitulated in mouse brains of normal, tumor (glioblastoma), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) models. BBB permeation of the tumor was most efficient, followed by normal and then AD-like brain. In tumor-bearing and normal brains, AP2 was the top performing vector; however, in AD models, D3 and D1 peptides were superior ones. The TfR vector B6 was equally efficient in normal and AD-model brains. Cross-permeation efficacies are manifested through modulated vector coligation and dosage escalation such as supra-linear dose dependence and crossover transcytosis activities.
