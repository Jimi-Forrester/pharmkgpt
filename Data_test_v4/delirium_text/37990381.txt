37990381|a|Intracellular alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) inclusions are a neuropathological hallmark of Lewy body disease (LBD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), both of which are termed synucleinopathy. LBD is defined by Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in neurons, while MSA displays glial cytoplasmic inclusions in oligodendrocytes. Pathological alpha-syn adopts an ordered filamentous structure with a 5-10 nm filament diameter, and this conformational change has been suggested to be involved in the disease onset and progression. Synucleinopathy also exhibits characteristic ultrastructural and biochemical properties of alpha-syn filaments, and alpha-syn strains with distinct conformations have been identified. Numerous experimental studies have supported the idea that pathological alpha-syn self-amplifies and spreads throughout the brain, during which processes the conformation of alpha-syn filaments may drive the disease specificity. In this review, we summarize the ultrastructural features and heterogeneity of alpha-syn filaments in the brains of patients with synucleinopathy and in experimental models of seeded alpha-syn aggregation.
