22152910|a|Lewy body dementia (LBD) is a neurodegenerative disease with well-defined symptoms and established clinical criteria, characterized by the presence of cortical and subcortical dementia, accompanied by some characteristic features such as Parkinsonism, visual hallucinations and fluctuations in alertness and attention, as well as hypersensitivity to neuroleptics. Compared with Alzheimer's disease, LBD seems to have a more rapid clinical course and greater mortality. The differences with Alzheimer's disease may be more apparent in the initial stages of the disease but tend to disappear with disease progression. Because of the greater presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms and the higher degree of dependency in LBD, there is greater caregiver overload and probably greater resource use.
