1650110|t|[Indicators of prostaglandin synthase activity in thrombocytes of patients with schizophrenia with positive and negative disorders].
1650110|a|A study was made of the activity of prostaglandin-synthetase in isolated platelets from the 2 groups of schizophrenic patients: with the predominance of positive (group I) and negative (group II) disorders. It has been demonstrated that the activity of prostaglandin-synthetase in isolated platelets from patients with hallucinatory delirium++ disorders is considerably higher (p less than 0.01) than the activity of prostaglandin-synthetase in isolated platelets from patients with the predominance of negative symptoms. The data obtained once more raise a question of the ++patho-chemical heterogeneity of schizophrenia, which also pertains to prostaglandins. The authors discuss a possibility of the relationship in schizophrenic patients between the regulatory system of prostaglandin synthesis and the central hypothalamohypophyseal mechanism by which homeostasis is regulated.
