35883886|a|Metabolic dysfunctions, such as hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, have been associated to cognitive impairment and dementia regardless of advanced age, although the underlying mechanisms are still elusive. Thus, this study investigates the deleterious effects of metabolic syndrome (MetS) induced by long-term exposure to a high-sucrose diet on motor and cognitive functions of male adult rats and its relationship with hippocampal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Weaned Wistar male rats were fed a high-sucrose diet until adulthood (HSD; 6 months old) and compared to both age-matched (CTR; 6 months old) and middle-aged chow-fed rats (OLD; 20 months old). MetS development, serum redox profile, behavioral, motor, and cognitive functions, and hippocampal gene/protein expressions for ER stress pro-adaptive and pro-apoptotic pathways, as well as senescence markers were assessed. Prolonged exposure to HSD induced MetS hallmarked by body weight gain associated to central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. Furthermore, HSD rats showed motor and cognitive decline similar to that in OLD animals. Noteworthy, HSD rats presented marked hippocampal ER stress characterized by failure of pro-adaptive signaling and increased expression of Chop, p21, and Parp-1 cleavage, markers of cell death and aging. This panorama resembles that found in OLD rats. In toto, our data showed that early and sustained exposure to a high-sucrose diet induced MetS, which subsequently led to hippocampus homeostasis disruption and premature impairment of motor and cognitive functions in adult rats.
