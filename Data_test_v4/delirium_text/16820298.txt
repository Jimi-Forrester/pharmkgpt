16820298|t|Apolipoprotein E structure: insights into function.
16820298|a|Human apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a member of the family of soluble apolipoproteins. Through its interaction with members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family, apoE has a key role in lipid transport both in the plasma and in the central nervous system. Its three common structural isoforms differentially affect the risk of developing atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. Because the function of apoE is dictated by its structure, understanding the structural properties of apoE and its isoforms is required both to determine its role in disease and for the development of therapeutic strategies.
