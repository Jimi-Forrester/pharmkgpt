34377954|a|Central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis critically depends on the interaction between neurons and glia cells. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) recently emerged as versatile messengers in CNS cell communication. EVs are released by neurons and glia in activity-dependent manner and address multiple target cells within and outside the nervous system. Here, we summarize the recent advances in understanding the physiological roles of EVs in the nervous system and their ability to deliver signals across the CNS barriers. In addition to the disposal of cellular components via EVs and clearance by phagocytic cells, EVs are involved in plasticity-associated processes, mediate trophic support and neuroprotection, promote axonal maintenance, and modulate neuroinflammation. While individual functional components of the EV cargo are becoming progressively identified, the role of neural EVs as compound multimodal signaling entities remains to be elucidated. Novel transgenic models and imaging technologies allow EV tracking in vivo and provide further insight into EV targeting and their mode of action. Overall, EVs represent key players in the maintenance of CNS homeostasis essential for the lifelong performance of neural networks and thus provide a wide spectrum of biomedical applications.
