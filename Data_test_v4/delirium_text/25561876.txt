25561876|a|Recent evidence has indicated that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the potential common processes that could explain this relation between AD and T2DM. In the recent decades, an abundance of evidence has emerged demonstrating that chronic inflammatory processes may be the major factors contributing to the development and progression of T2DM and AD. In this article, we have discussed the molecular underpinnings of inflammatory process that contribute to the pathogenesis of T2DM and AD and how they are linked to these two diseases. In depth understanding of the inflammatory mechanisms through which AD and T2DM are associated to each other may help the researchers to develop novel and more effective strategies to treat together AD and T2DM. Several treatment options have been identified which spurn the inflammatory processes and discourage the production of inflammatory mediators, thereby preventing or slowing down the onset of T2DM and AD.
