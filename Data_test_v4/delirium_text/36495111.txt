36495111|t|Factors associated with cognitive impairment at 3, 6, and 12 months after the first stroke among Lebanese survivors.
36495111|a|INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to calculate the rate of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) by evaluating the cognitive domains among Lebanese stroke survivors at 3, 6, and 12 months post-stroke, and to identify the contributing factors including pre- and post-stroke related factors. METHODS: A multicenter longitudinal prospective study was conducted in 10 hospitals from Beirut and Mount Lebanon for a 15-month period. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Short Form Health Survey (SF12), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were used to assess cognitive function, disability degree, Quality of Life (QoL), stroke severity, and levels of anxiety and depression, respectively. Then, univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to identify the predictors of PSCI. RESULTS: Low MMSE scores were found among survivors during the first 3 months post-stroke (74.8%) of whom 53.7% presented with an MMSE <= 17, followed by 46.7% in the 6 months, and 37.6% at 12 months post-stroke. Follow-up comparisons showed a significant increase of MMSE scores over time (p < .001), indicating a 37% improvement of the cognitive function over time. The most affected cognitive domain was the attention and concentration at the three time points. Independent factors that were positively associated with low MMSE scores were as follows: sedentary behavior >= 12 h/day (AOR = 3.062, p = .033), involvement of the left hemisphere (AOR = 2.710, p = .006), HADS >= 11 (AOR = 2.536, p = .049), and high NIHSS scores (AOR = 3, p = .009). Age was the main predictor in the three time periods (AOR   3, p < .05). Inversely, female gender (AOR = 0.09, p = .027), high educational level (AOR = 0.2, p < .02), employment post-stroke (AOR = 0.3, p = .023), high Physical Component Summary (PCS) of Quality of Life (QoL) (AOR = 0.8, p < .001), and the use of anti-diabetic treatment post-stroke (AOR = 0.17, p = .016) improved MMSE scores to > 23. CONCLUSION: The risk of PSCI among Lebanese stroke survivors was high especially in the acute phase, depending on various determinants. Health care providers are invited to implement an emergency rehabilitation program for an appropriate successful management of the risk factors in order to reduce stroke burden and to improve overall cognitive performance.
