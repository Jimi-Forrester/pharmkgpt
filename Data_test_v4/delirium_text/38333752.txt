38333752|a|Objectives: The process of vascular formation, also known as angiogenesis, primarily relies on endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In recent years, it has been discovered that synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) may potentially impact angiogenic processes within the body. We evaluated the impact of the synthetic cannabinoid (R)-5-Fluoro-ADB on the proliferation rate and angiogenesis in Human Cerebral Microvascular Endothelial Cells (hBMECs). Materials and Methods: hBMECs were treated with (R)-5-Fluoro-ADB and investigated for cell viability, migration rate, and tube-like structure formation. Furthermore, angiogenic-related proteins including Angopoitein-1 and -2, and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors (VEGF) were examined on mRNA and protein levels. Results: The results showed a notable rise in the rate of proliferation (P-value<0.0001) of HBMECs induced by (R)-5-Fluoro-ADB. The angiogenic capacity of HBMECs was also enhanced between 0.001 muM to 1 muM (R)-5-Fluoro-ADB. Moreover, an increase in the levels of ANG-1, ANG-2, and VEGF mRNA and protein, as well as elevated phosphorylation rate of GSK-3beta, were observed across various concentrations of (R)-5-Fluoro-ADB. Conclusion: Our results suggest an innovative approach in pharmacology for addressing a range of conditions linked to angiogenesis. This approach involves precise targeting of both cannabinoid receptors type-1 and -2. To achieve this, specific agonists or antagonists of these receptors could be employed based on the particular characteristics of the diseases in question.
