23740112|a|Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to cause several human pathologies. For this reason, antioxidants have gained utmost importance because of their potential as prophylactic and therapeutic agents in many diseases. Examples of their application include their use in diabetic patients, as aging drugs, in cancer diseases, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, autoimmune disorders, and also in inflammation. Antioxidants have limited absorption profiles, therefore low bioavailability and low concentrations at the target site. Efforts have been done towards loading antioxidant molecules in advanced nanoparticulate carriers, e.g., liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, self-emulsifying drug delivery system. Examples of -successful achievements include the encapsulation of drugs and other active ingredients, e.g., coenzyme Q10, vitamin E and vitamin A, resveratrol and polyphenols, curcumin, lycopene, silymarin, and superoxide dismutase. This review focuses on the comprehensive analysis of using nanoparticulate carriers for loading these molecules for oral administration.
