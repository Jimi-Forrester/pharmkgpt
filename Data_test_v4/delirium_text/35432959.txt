35432959|t|Tamjanika, a Balkan native variety of Vitis vinifera L.: Chemical characterization, antibacterial, and anti-dermatomycosis potential of seed oil.
35432959|a|This study was designed to explore functional food properties of edible seed oil obtained from Tamjanika seeds-autochthonous grape variety of Balkan Peninsula. In order to accomplish our goals, seed oil was isolated by Soxhlet apparatus and chemically characterized regarding fatty acids, carotenoids, tocopherols, and tocotrienols. Antimicrobial activity of the isolated oil was tested by microdilution method. For that purposes, six bacterial species were used, belonging to human infectious agents and food contaminants. Furthermore, the activity of the oil was investigated against clinical isolates of dermatomycetes. Our study has shown that oil of Vitis vinifera L. Tamjanika variety was an abundant source of polyunsaturated fatty acids (81.43%) with predominant linoleic acid. HPLC analysis revealed the presence of carotenoid lutein (0.15 mg/100 g). The seed oil was rich in tocotrienols (85.04 mg/100 g) predominating over tocopherols (8.37 mg/100 g). The oil possessed microbicidal activity against all the tested microbes. Bacteria were more sensitive to the effect of the oil (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] 7.7-15.4) when compared with oil effect on tested dermatomycetes (MIC 20-40). Our investigation has shown for the first time that grape oil could be active against wide spectrum of bacteria and clinically isolated dermatomycetes. The significance of this study lies in the fact that it pointed out the functional food properties of grape seed oil that was fully chemically characterized.
