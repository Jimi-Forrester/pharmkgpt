38627483|t|The incidence and predictors of antibiotic-associated encephalopathy: a multicenter hospital-based study.
38627483|a|This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and likelihood of antibiotic-associated encephalopathy (AAE), comparing rates among the classes of antibiotics in monotherapy or in combination therapy. We also investigated the associations between the incidence of AAE and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and electroencephalogram features. Consecutive admissions that used any kind of antibiotics to treat infectious diseases were identified from six hospitals. We classified antibiotics according to three distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms and clinical subtypes. We searched for the incidence of AAE as the primary outcome. A total of 97,433 admission cases among 56,038 patients was identified. Cases that received type 1 antibiotics had significantly more frequent AAE compared to those that received type 2 antibiotics (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.62; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-5.95; P = 0.021). Combined use of type 1 + 2 antibiotics was associated with a significantly higher incidence of AAE compared to the use of type 2 antibiotics alone (adjusted OR, 3.44; 95% CI 1.49-7.93; P = 0.004). Groups with GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 had significantly higher incidence rates of AAE compared to those with GFRs >= 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 among cases that received type 1 + 2 antibiotics. Detection of spike-and-wave or sharp-and-wave patterns on electroencephalogram was significantly more common in the combination therapy group. Combination use of antibiotics was associated with a higher incidence of AAE compared to monotherapy. The incidence of AAE significantly increased as renal function decreased, and epileptiform discharges were more likely to be detected in cases receiving combined antibiotics.
