29804407|a|Objective: To observe whether Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) can improve postoperative delirium in elderly patients. Methods: Eighty elderly patients undergoing tumor surgery at Zhejiang Cancer Hospital and complicated with postoperative delirium(POD) between June 2013 and July 2016 were randomly divided into treatment group (group A) and control group (group B) according to the random number table method. Patients in group A received ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) drops oral treatment (3 times/d, 80 mg each time) in addition to oxygen inhalation and appeasement treatment. Patients in group B underwent routine oxygen inhalation and appeasement treatment. POD assessment was performed twice between the hours of 8: 00 am and 8: 00 pm daily after the diagnosis of POD. Observed indicators include sex ratio, age, body mass index (BMI), educated level, type of surgery, anesthesia method, duration of surgery, intraoperative mean arterial blood pressure, intraoperative blood loss, type of POD, visual analogue scale (VAS) scores when diagnosis of POD, the onset time of POD, initial RASS scores, duration of POD. Results: A total of 80 patients with POD were enrolled, 23 patients were excluded for did not cooperate with the tests of POD or refused to participate in the study. Finally, 57 elderly patients completed the study, 29 patients in the medication group (A group) and 28 patients in the control group (B group). There was no significant difference in sex ratio, age, BMI, education level, operation type, anesthesia method, operation duration, intraoperative mean arterial pressure, intraoperative blood loss, POD type and VAS score (all P>0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in POD onset time and initial RASS score (all P>0.05). The duration of POD in group A and group B was 16 (16)h and 48 (35) h respectively, the difference was statistically significant (U=161.500, P<0.001). Conclusion: Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) can shorten the course of POD in elderly patients.
