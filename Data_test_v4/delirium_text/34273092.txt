34273092|t|Trends in emergency department use by older people during the COVID-19 pandemic.
34273092|a|PURPOSE: Reports suggest that many older people deferred seeking healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic due to fear of contracting COVID-19. The aim of this study was to examine trends of emergency department (ED) use by older people during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous years. METHODS: The study site is a 1000-bed university teaching hospital with annual ED new-patient attendance of > 50,000. All ED presentations of patients aged >= 70 years from March to August 2020, 2019 and 2018 inclusive (n = 13,989) were reviewed and compared for presenting complaint, Manchester Triage Score, and admission/discharge decision. RESULTS: There was a 16% reduction in presentations across the 6 months in 2020 compared to the average of 2018/2019. On average, 4 fewer people aged >= 70 years presented to the ED per day in 2020. Much of this was concentrated in March (33% fewer presentations) and April (31% fewer presentations), when the country was in 'lockdown', i.e. non-essential journeys were banned. There was a 20% reduction in patients presenting with stroke and cardiac complaints. In the 3 months following easing of restrictions, there was a 25% increase in falls and orthopaedic injuries when compared to 2018/2019. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a significant decline in the number of older people presenting to the ED for unscheduled care, including for potentially time-dependent illnesses such as stroke or cardiac complaints. Given the possibility of further lockdowns, it is imperative that we consider enabling strategies to ensure older people access unscheduled care in a timely manner when necessary.
