39455437|a|BACKGROUND: G proteins are a class of important signal transducers in mammalians. G proteins can corpoarated with G proteincoupled receptors (GPCRs) and transmit signals from extracellular stimuli into intracellular response, which will regulate a series of biological functions. G-proteins are heterotrimeric proteins composed of Galpha, Gbeta, and Ggamma subunits. Based on structural and functional similarity of their alpha-subunits, G proteins are typically grouped into four classes (Gi, Gs, Gq/11, and G12/13). The Gq/11 subfamily consists of Gq, G11, G14, and G15/16 proteins. Galphaq is the alpha-subunit of Gq protein and encoded by GNAQ. Our previous studies revealed that Galphaq play an important role in regulating T cell survival and T cell differentiation. Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that play a critical role in modulating innate inflammatory response. NLRP3 inflammasome is currently the most extensively studied inflammasome. METHODS: We found that Galphaq suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophage, Galphaq also suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a LPS-induced sepsis mouse model. Galphaq can locate to mitochondria and Galphaq was required for the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. Galphaq regulated NLRP3 inflammasome activation by modulating mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). RESULTS: We found that Galphaq suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophage, Galphaq also suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a LPS-induced sepsis mouse model. Galphaq can locate to mitochondria and Galphaq was required for the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. Galphaq regulated NLRP3 inflammasome activation by modulating mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that Galphaq regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation by modulating mitochondrial ROS production. Our research provides new mechanistic insight into the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. As it has been proved that NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role in the pathogenesis many diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease, Galphaq might become a novel drug target for these diseases in future.
