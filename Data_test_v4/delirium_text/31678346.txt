31678346|t|Calcium Signaling in Neurons and Glial Cells: Role of Cav1 channels.
31678346|a|Calcium (Ca2+) is an essential component in intracellular signaling of brain cells, and its control mechanisms are of great interest in biological systems. Ca2+ can signal differently in neurons and glial cells using the same intracellular pathways or cell membrane structural components. These types of machinery are responsible for entry, permanence, and removal of Ca2+ from the cellular environment and are of vital importance for brain homeostasis. This review highlights the importance of Ca2+ in neuronal and glial cell physiology as well as aspects of learning, memory, and Alzheimer's disease, focusing on the involvement of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.
