39237682|t|Lysosomal TMEM106B interacts with galactosylceramidase to regulate myelin lipid metabolism.
39237682|a|TMEM106B is an endolysosomal transmembrane protein not only associated with multiple neurological disorders including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and hypomyelinating leukodystrophy but also potentially involved in COVID-19. Additionally, recent studies have identified amyloid fibrils of C-terminal TMEM106B in both aged healthy and neurodegenerative brains. However, so far little is known about physiological functions of TMEM106B in the endolysosome and how TMEM106B is involved in a wide range of human conditions at molecular levels. Here, we performed lipidomic analysis of the brain of TMEM106B-deficient mice. We found that TMEM106B deficiency significantly decreases levels of two major classes of myelin lipids, galactosylceramide and its sulfated derivative sulfatide. Subsequent co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that TMEM106B physically interacts with galactosylceramidase. We also found that galactosylceramidase activity was significantly increased in TMEM106B-deficient brains. Thus, our results suggest that TMEM106B interacts with galactosylceramidase to regulate myelin lipid metabolism and have implications for TMEM106B-associated diseases.
