33436908|a|Dengue is an arboviral infection with high rates of morbidity and mortality throughout the tropics and sub-tropics. This work studied the status of pentraxin (CRP/SAP) protein, ferritin, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels in Dengue patients of different pathophysiological manifestations. Accordingly, clinically confirmed Dengue cases (n = 97) were enrolled and subsequently blood parameters were studied by Haematology cell counter and Biochemistry Autoanalyser. CRP, SAP, ferritin, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta ELISA were done in all the samples by using standard ELISA kits. Statistical Analysis was done in all the experiments. The levels of CRP (p < 0.0001), SAP (p < 0.0001), ferritin (p < 0.0001), TNF-alpha (p < 0.0001) and IL-1beta (p < 0.0001) were high in patients with Severe Dengue as compared to Dengue without warning signs. High levels of SGOT, SGPT and decreased platelet counts were found in severe patients as compared to Healthy donor. CRP/SAP as well as TNF-alpha/IL-1beta were independently associated with both dengue severity and overall disease manifestation. Statistically significant increased CRP, SAP, ferritin, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta titres were correlated in patients with severe clinical manifestations as compared to mild disease forms of dengue. Elevated levels of pentraxin, TNF-alpha/IL-1beta in blood during dengue infection could act as an early predictor in Severe Dengue infection.
