21975314|t|Lentivirus-mediated APP695-RNAi reduces apoptosis in APP transgenic mouse neurons.
21975314|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is thought to be important in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent evidence suggests that Abeta induces neuronal apoptosis in the brain and in primary neuronal cultures. If decreased Abeta whether could reduce the neuronal apoptosis? In this study, APP695-siRNA was delivered to hippocampal and cortical neurons of APP695 transgenic mice (AD model) in vitro using a recombinant lentivirus vector. The results show that lentivirus-mediated RNA interference of the APP695 gene could reduce neuronal apoptosis, possibly through the reduction of caspase-3 activity and the neuronal apoptosis pathway. These results suggest that lentivirus-mediated RNA interference may be a potential therapeutic for AD.
