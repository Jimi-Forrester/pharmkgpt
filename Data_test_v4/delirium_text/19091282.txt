19091282|t|Successful treatment of gastric perforation with thyrotoxic crisis.
19091282|a|Patients with thyrotoxic crisis presenting with another emergency are at a considerable risk. We report the successful treatment of a 55-year-old woman having gastric perforation with thyrotoxic crisis; the principle of treatment was delayed surgery after rapid preoperative restoration of thyroid function and cardiovascular status. The patient was admitted for severe abdominal pain and nausea with delirium, exophthalmos, diffuse goiter, tremulousness, diaphoresis, tabescence, pretibial edema, and atrial fibrillation. Computed tomography revealed free air over the liver surface. She had been diagnosed with uncontrolled hyperthyroidism 3 days before admission, with a free liothyronine (T(3)) of 23.2 pg/mL, a free levothyroxine sodium (T(4)) of greater than 7.78 ng/dL, and thyrotropin of less than 0.01 ng/mL. She was diagnosed with gastroduodenal perforation and thyrotoxic crisis, and we planned nonoperative management comprising nasogastric aspiration, cefmetazole sodium, omeprazole, thiamazole, and Lugol's solution. We also used landiolol, an ultrashort-acting beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, and hydrocortisone. On the third day of admission, her thyroid function had improved with a free T(3) of 4.7 pg/mL and a free T(4) of 2.9 ng/dL; however, perforative peritonitis had worsened, and hence, omental patch repair was performed. She recovered uneventfully and was discharged after radioiodine administration. We discuss the management of a thyrotoxic patient with gastric perforation and focus on the importance of changing the management according to the patient's clinical course considering his thyroid function status and comparing the stress of surgery with that of perforative peritonitis in nonoperative management.
