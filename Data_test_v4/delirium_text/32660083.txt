32660083|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is unclear. It seems that postoperative respiratory problems that may occur in COPD patients, including prolonged mechanical ventilation or respiratory-tract infections, may contribute to the development of delirium. The aim of the study was to identify a relationship between COPD and the occurrence of delirium after cardiac surgery and the impact of these combined disorders on postoperative mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an analysis of data collected from 4151 patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in a tertiary cardiac-surgery center between 2012 and 2018. We included patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria. The primary endpoint was postoperative delirium; Confusion Assessment Method in the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) was used for delirium assessment. RESULTS: Final analysis included 283 patients with COPD, out of which 65 (22.97%) were diagnosed with POD. Delirious COPD patients had longer intubation time (p = 0.007), more often required reintubation (p = 0.019), had significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) three days after surgery (p = 0.009) and were more often diagnosed with pneumonia (p < 0.001). The CRP rise on day three correlated positively with the occurrence of postoperative pneumonia (r = 0.335, p = 0.005). The probability of survival after CABG was significantly lower in COPD patients with delirium (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study confirmed the relationship between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the incidence of delirium after cardiac surgery. The probability of survival in COPD patients undergoing CABG who developed postoperative delirium was significantly decreased.
