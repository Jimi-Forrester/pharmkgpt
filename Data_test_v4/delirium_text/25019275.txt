25019275|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that is the most common form of dementia in the elderly and is characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive dysfunction. Although the pathogenetic mechanism of AD is still unknown, genetic variants play a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD. Increasing evidence has suggested that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) may be associated with the development of AD. A previous study analyzing human single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) at the genome level indicated that a genetic variant, rs7990916, in the lincRNA 01080 (linc01080) may play an important role in the physiology and pathophysiology of the human brain. To determine whether this SNP alters the risk for sporadic AD (SAD) or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) susceptibility, we conducted a case-control study in a Han Chinese population with 106 SAD patients, 67 aMCI patients, and 179 healthy controls. Using the LDR-PCR genotyping method, we found no significant difference in allele or genotype frequency in the SNP rs7990916 between patients and controls (p > 0.05). Our results do not support previous findings, suggesting that further studies by using large-scale association analyses are warranted in Han Chinese populations.
