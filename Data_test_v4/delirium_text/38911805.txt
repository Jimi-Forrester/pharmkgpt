38911805|a|Epidemiological studies predict that chicken eggs contain constituents other than proteins that prevent Alzheimer's disease. This study screened for constituents that inhibit the aggregation of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta)1-42 and elucidated their mechanisms to explore the active components of chicken eggs. Thioflavin T assays and transmission electron microscopy observations showed that arachidonic acid (ARA), lysophosphatidylcholine, lutein (LTN), palmitoleic acid, and zeaxanthin inhibited Abeta aggregation. Among these, ARA and LTN showed the highest activity. Photoinduced cross-linking of unmodified protein assays and infrared absorption spectrometry measurements showed that LTN strongly inhibited highly toxic Abeta1-42 protofibril formation. Furthermore, LTN suppressed Abeta1-42-induced IL 1B and TNF expression in human macrophage-like cells. In summary, LTN plays a crucial role in the AD-preventive effect of chicken eggs by suppressing Abeta1-42 aggregation and Abeta1-42-induced inflammation.
