28294747|t|[Complications After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation].
28294747|a|PURPOSE: to assess rate of complications after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). MATERIAL AND RESULTS: Our study included 99 patients who underwent TAVI. Frequent complications were: bleeding not requiring surgical hemostasis (17.2%), hemopericardium (6%), novel cardiac rhythm disturbances requiring permanent pacemaker implantation (15.1%), delirium in early postoperative period (10.7%), acute kidney injury (8.0%), stroke (7%), ventricular fibrillation (5.1%), myocardial infarction (2%). There were no significant differences in rate and type of complications between transapical and transfemoral TAVI. Comparison of general and local anesthesia showed that rate of ventricular fibrillation was significantly higher among patients subjected to transfemoral TAVI under local anesthesia (p less or equal 0.012).
