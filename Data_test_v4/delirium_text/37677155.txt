37677155|t|Versatile Biodegradable Poly(acrylic acid)-Based Hydrogels Infiltrated in Porous Titanium Implants to Improve the Biofunctional Performance.
37677155|a|This research work proposes a synergistic approach to improve implants' performance through the use of porous Ti substrates to reduce the mismatch between Young's modulus of Ti (around 110 GPa) and the cortical bone (20-25 GPa), and the application of a biodegradable, acrylic acid-based polymeric coating to reduce bacterial adhesion and proliferation, and to enhance osseointegration. First, porous commercially pure Ti substrates with different porosities and pore size distributions were fabricated by using space-holder techniques to obtain substrates with improved tribomechanical behavior. On the other hand, a new diacrylate cross-linker containing a reduction-sensitive disulfide bond was synthesized to prepare biodegradable poly(acrylic acid)-based hydrogels with 1, 2, and 4% cross-linker. Finally, after the required characterization, both strategies were implemented, and the combination of 4% cross-linked poly(acrylic acid)-based hydrogel infiltrated in 30 vol % porosity, 100-200 mum average pore size, was revealed as an outstanding choice for enhancing implant performance.
