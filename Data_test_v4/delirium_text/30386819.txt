30386819|a|INTRODUCTION: We investigated the effect of antihypertensive (aHTN) medications and cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) on the cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and analyzed synergism by chemogenomics systems pharmacology mapping. METHODS: We compared the effect of aHTN drugs on Mini-Mental State Examination scores in 617 AD patients with hypertension, and studied the synergistic effects. RESULTS: The combination of diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers showed slower cognitive decline compared with other aHTN groups (Deltabeta = +1.46, P < .0001). aHTN medications slow down cognitive decline in ChEI users (Deltabeta = +0.56, P = .006), but not in non-ChEI users (Deltabeta = -0.31, P = .53). DISCUSSION: aHTN and ChEI drugs showed synergistic effects. A combination of diuretics, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers, and calcium channel blockers had the slowest cognitive decline. The chemogenomics systems pharmacology-identified molecular targets provide system pharmacology interpretation of the synergism of the drugs in clinics. The results suggest that improving vascular health is essential for AD treatment and provide a novel direction for AD drug development.
