39400823|t|Therapeutic Potentials of Near-Infrared II Photobiomodulation to Treat Cerebrovascular Diseases via Nitric Oxide Signalling.
39400823|a|Endothelial dysfunction featuring insufficient endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and accompanying nitric oxide (NO) deficiency is implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Restoring endothelial NO represents a promising approach to treating cerebrovascular diseases, including stroke. Low-power near-infrared (NIR) light shows diverse beneficial effects, broadly defined as photobiomodulation (PBM). The literature reports that PBM increases bioavailable NO. These lines of evidence indicate that PBM could be used to treat cerebrovascular diseases. Recent investigations revealed that PBM improved stroke outcomes in animal models via augmenting NO signalling and other pathways. However, clinical trials of PBM using NIR light in the NIR-I window (630-900 nm) have yet to demonstrate the beneficial effect of PBM on ischaemic stroke. Since NIR light in the NIR-II window (1000-1700 nm) with the largest penetration depth into tissues compared to NIR I has also been reported to augment NO bioavailability and cerebral blood flow ameliorating stroke injury, PBM using NIR-II light may be suitable for therapeutic use. This new non-pharmacological modality using a physical parameter of NIR-II laser could provide a new avenue for therapeutic strategies for cerebrovascular diseases. Since impaired NO production has been associated with neurological abnormalities, this novel therapeutic approach could be broadly explored to treat various disease conditions such as traumatic brain injury, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease. This review summarises recent findings on PBM in treating stroke and discusses its potential to treat other neurological diseases.
