38188539|t|Randomized trial of ketamine masked by surgical anesthesia in patients with depression.
38188539|a|Ketamine may have antidepressant properties, but its acute psychoactive effects complicate successful masking in placebo-controlled trials. We present a single-center, parallel-arm, triple-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial assessing the antidepressant efficacy of intravenous ketamine masked by surgical anesthesia (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03861988). Forty adult patients with major depressive disorder who were scheduled for routine surgery were randomized to a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (saline) during usual anesthesia. All participants, investigators, and direct patient care staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was depression severity measured by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at 1, 2, and 3 days post-infusion. After all follow-up visits, participants were asked to guess which intervention they received. A mixed-effects model showed no evidence of effect of treatment assignment on the primary outcome (-5.82, 95% CI -13.3 to 1.64, p=0.13). 36.8% of participants guessed their treatment assignment correctly; both groups allocated their guesses in similar proportions. In conclusion, a single dose of intravenous ketamine delivered during surgical anesthesia had no greater effect than placebo in acutely reducing the severity of depressive symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder. This trial successfully masked treatment allocation in moderate-to-severely depressed patients using surgical anesthesia. Although this masking strategy is impractical for most placebo-controlled trials, future studies of novel antidepressants with acute psychoactive effects should make efforts to fully mask treatment assignment in order to minimize subject-expectancy bias.
