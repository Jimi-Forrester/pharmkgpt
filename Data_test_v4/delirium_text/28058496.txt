28058496|a|Recent data show that 20-80% of surgery patients are affected by delirium during inpatient clinical treatment. The medical consequences are often dramatic and include a 20 times higher mortality and treatment expenses of the medical unit increase considerably. At the University Hospital of Munster a multimodal and interdisciplinary concept for prevention and management of delirium was developed: all patients older than 65 years admitted for surgery are screened by a specialized team for the risk of developing delirium and treated by members of the team if there is a risk of delirium. Studies proved that by this multimodal approach the incidence of delirium was lowered and therefore the quality of medical care improved.When surgical treatment of fractures in the elderly is required, limited bone quality as well as pre-existing implants can complicate the procedure. Secondary loss of reduction after osteosynthesis and avulsion of the implant in particular must be prevented. Augmentation of the osteosynthetic implant with bone cement can increase the bone-implant interface and therefore stability can be improved. Additional intraoperative 3D imaging can be necessary depending on the localization of the fracture. In biomechanical studies we could prove greater stability in the osteosynthesis of osteoporotic fractures of the distal femur when using additional bone cement; therefore, the use of bone cement is an important tool, which helps to prevent complications in the surgical treatment of fractures in the elderly. Nevertheless, special implants and technical skills are required and some safety aspects should be considered.
