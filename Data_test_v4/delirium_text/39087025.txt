39087025|a|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal malignancies in the world. With the rapid pace of life and changes in diet structure, the incidence and mortality of CRC increase year by year posing a serious threat to human health. As the most complex and largest microecosystem in the human body, intestinal microecology is closely related to CRC. It is an important factor that affects and participates in the occurrence and development of CRC. Advances in next-generation sequencing technology and metagenomics have provided new insights into the ecology of gut microbes. It also helps to link intestinal flora with CRC, and the relationship between intestinal flora and CRC can be continuously understood from different levels. This paper summarizes the relationship between intestinal flora and CRC and its potential role in the diagnosis of CRC providing evidence for early screening and treatment of CRC.
