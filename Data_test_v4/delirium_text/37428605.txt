37428605|t|Cholesterol Metabolism in Aging and Age-Related Disorders.
37428605|a|All mammalian cell membranes contain cholesterol to maintain membrane integrity. The transport of this hydrophobic lipid is mediated by lipoproteins. Cholesterol is especially enriched in the brain, particularly in synaptic and myelin membranes. Aging involves changes in sterol metabolism in peripheral organs and also in the brain. Some of those alterations have the potential to promote or to counteract the development of neurodegenerative diseases during aging. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of general principles of sterol metabolism in humans and mice, the most widely used model organism in biomedical research. We discuss changes in sterol metabolism that occur in the aged brain and highlight recent developments in cell type-specific cholesterol metabolism in the fast-growing research field of aging and age-related diseases, focusing on Alzheimer's disease. We propose that cell type-specific cholesterol handling and the interplay between cell types critically influence age-related disease processes.
