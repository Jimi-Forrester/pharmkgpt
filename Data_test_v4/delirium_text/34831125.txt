34831125|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia and is pathologically characterized by the presence of parenchymal senile plaques composed of amyloid beta (Abeta) and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The accumulation of Abeta also occurs within the cerebral vasculature in over 80% of AD patients and in non-demented individuals, a condition called cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The development of CAA is associated with neurovascular dysfunction, blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage, and persistent vascular- and neuro-inflammation, eventually leading to neurodegeneration. Although pathologically AD and CAA are well characterized diseases, the chronology of molecular changes that lead to their development is still unclear. Substantial evidence demonstrates defects in mitochondrial function in various cells of the neurovascular unit as well as in the brain parenchyma during the early stages of AD and CAA. Dysfunctional mitochondria release danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that activate a wide range of inflammatory pathways. In this review, we gather evidence to postulate a crucial role of the mitochondria, specifically of cerebral endothelial cells, as sensors and initiators of Abeta-induced vascular inflammation. The activated vasculature recruits circulating immune cells into the brain parenchyma, leading to the development of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in AD and CAA.
