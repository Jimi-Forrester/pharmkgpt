33392919|a|A common feature of neurodegenerative disorders, in particular Alzheimer's disease (AD), is a chronic neuroinflammation associated with aberrant neuroplasticity. Development of neuroinflammation affects efficacy of stem and progenitor cells proliferation, differentiation, migration, and integration of newborn cells into neural circuitry. However, precise mechanisms of neurogenesis alterations in neuroinflammation are not clear yet. It is well established that expression of NLRP3 inflammasomes in glial cells marks neuroinflammatory events, but less is known about contribution of NLRP3 to deregulation of neurogenesis within neurogenic niches and whether neural stem cells (NSCs), neural progenitor cells (NPCs) or immature neuroblasts may express inflammasomes in (patho)physiological conditions. Thus, we studied alterations of neurogenesis in rats with the AD model (intra-hippocampal injection of Abeta1-42). We found that in Abeta-affected brain, number of CD133+ cells was elevated after spatial training in the Morris water maze. The number of PSA-NCAM+ neuroblasts diminished by Abeta injection was completely restored by subsequent spatial learning. Spatial training leads to elevated expression of NLRP3 inflammasomes in the SGZ (subgranular zones): CD133+ and PSA-NCAM+ cells started to express NLRP3 in sham-operated, but not AD rats. Taken together, our data suggest that expression of NLRP3 inflammasomes in CD133+ and PSA-NCAM+ cells may contribute to stimulation of adult neurogenesis in physiological conditions, whereas Alzheimer's type neurodegeneration abolishes stimuli-induced overexpression of NLRP3 within the SGZ neurogenic niche.
