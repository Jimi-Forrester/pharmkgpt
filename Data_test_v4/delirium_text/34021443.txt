34021443|t|Pituitary apoplexy and panhypopituitarism following acute leptospirosis.
34021443|a|Leptospirosis is a common tropical febrile illness which may manifest with the hepatorenal syndrome and systemic hemorrhagic manifestations. Pituitary apoplexy is a rare but life-threatening condition characterized by a hemorrhage within the pituitary gland or a pituitary adenoma. Apoplexy is very rarely associated with some inducing events such as infectious diseases such as dengue hemorrhagic fever, Hantaan virus, Puumala virus have also been reported to cause pituitary apoplexy. We present the first case of pituitary apoplexy in a patient who was being treated for leptospirosis and discuss the possible mechanisms of apoplexy in the scenario presented. We also review other reports of infectious causes that may result in pituitary apoplexy.
