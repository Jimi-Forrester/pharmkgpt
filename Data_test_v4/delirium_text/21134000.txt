21134000|t|An autopsy case of an aged patient with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2.
21134000|a|We report the case of a woman who developed limb clumsiness in her fifties and gait disturbance in her sixties. She was bedridden after bone fractures at age 75 and showed disorientation, slow eye movement, gaze palsy, ataxic speech, muscle atrophy and weakness, and areflexia with pathological reflex. She died of respiratory failure at age 85. This patient was diagnosed genetically as having spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), and the number of expanded CAG repeats was 41. At autopsy, the brain weighed 965 g, and the brainstem, cerebellum, frontal convexity and spinal cord were atrophic. Neuronal loss and gliosis were severe in the pontine nucleus, inferior olivary nucleus, cerebellar cortex, gracile and cuneate nuclei and moderate in the substantia nigra, cerebellar dentate nucleus, anterior horns of the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia. Axonal loss was observed in the middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles, pyramidal tract and posterior column of the spinal cord. Senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) were diffusely found in the cerebrum (plaque stage C; NFT stage IV). Expanded polyglutamine-immunoreactive inclusions in the neuronal cytoplasm were widely distributed in the CNS, and neuronal intranuclear inclusions were observed in the pontine nucleus and cerebral cortex. This patient in this autopsy case is a late-onset and aged patient with SCA2, and this is the first report of SCA2 combined with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Neuropathological findings in this patient, except for AD pathology, were consistent with those of reported SCA2 cases. However, the olivo-ponto-cerebellar system of this patient was relatively preserved and the cerebellar dentate nucleus was more involved as compared with previously reported cases. These results suggest that age at onset or the number of CAG repeat expansions could correlate with the distribution pattern of SCA2 neurodegeneration.
