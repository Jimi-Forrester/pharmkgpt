34885120|t|Complications and Discharge after Radical Cystectomy for Older Patients with Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer: The ELCAPA-27 Cohort Study.
34885120|a|Radical cystectomy is the standard of care for localized bladder cancer but is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates-especially among older patients with comorbidities. The association between geriatric assessment parameters on post-operative complications and discharge has not previously been investigated. The present analysis of the Elderly Cancer Patient (ELCAPA) prospective cohort included all patients aged >=70 having undergone a geriatric assessment and then radical cystectomy for localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer between 2007 and 2018. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with one or more complications in the first 30 days after cystectomy. The secondary endpoints were the length of hospital stay (LOS), the 30-day mortality, and discharge rates. Sixty-two patients (median age: 81; range: 79-83.8) were included. The 30-day complication rate was 73%, and 49% of the patients had experienced a major complication, according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. The 30-day mortality rate was 4%. None of the geriatric, oncological, or laboratory parameters were significantly associated with the occurrence or severity of complications. The median (interquartile range) LOS was 18 days (15-23) overall and was longer in patients with complications (19 days vs. 15 days in those without complications; p = 0.013). Thirty days after cystectomy, 25 patients (53%) had been discharged to home and 22 (47%) were still in a rehabilitation unit. In a univariate analysis, a Geriatric-8 score <= 14, a loss of one point on the Activities of Daily Living Scale, anemia, at least one grade >= 3 comorbidity on the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric, and an inpatient geriatric assessment were associated with a risk of not being discharged to home. In older patients having undergone a geriatric assessment, radical cystectomy is associated with a high complication rate, a longer LOS, and functional decline at 30 days.
