21173851|t|Roles of ADF/cofilin in actin polymerization and beyond.
21173851|a|In collaboration or competition with many other actin-binding proteins, the actin-depolymerizing factor/cofilins integrate transmembrane signals to coordinate the spatial and temporal organization of actin filament assembly/disassembly (dynamics). In addition, newly discovered effects of these proteins in lipid metabolism, gene regulation, and apoptosis suggest that their roles go well beyond regulating the cytoskeleton.
