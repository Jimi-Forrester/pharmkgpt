33632417|a|Hyperpolarised gas lung MRI using xenon-129 can provide detailed 3D images of the ventilated lung airspaces, and can be applied to quantify lung microstructure and detailed aspects of lung function such as gas exchange. It is sensitive to functional and structural changes in early lung disease and can be used in longitudinal studies of disease progression and therapy response. The ability of 129Xe to dissolve into the blood stream and its chemical shift sensitivity to its local environment allow monitoring of gas exchange in the lungs, perfusion of the brain and kidneys, and blood oxygenation. This article reviews the methods and applications of in vivo129Xe MR in humans, with a focus on the physics of polarisation by optical pumping, radiofrequency coil and pulse sequence design, and the in vivo applications of 129Xe MRI and MRS to examine lung ventilation, microstructure and gas exchange, blood oxygenation, and perfusion of the brain and kidneys.
