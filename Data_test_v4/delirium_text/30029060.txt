30029060|t|A novel Abeta epitope vaccine based on bacterium-like particle against Alzheimer's disease.
30029060|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque accumulation in the brain is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Immunotherapy against Abeta was considered a potential strategy for reducing the Abeta load in the brain. However, none of the Abeta immunotherapies have produced clinically meaningful results to date, due to poor safety or lack of efficacy. Thus, we aimed to design a safe and effective vaccine against AD. In this study, we used bacterium-like particles (BLPs) as carriers and different copy numbers of the Abeta 1-6 peptide as epitopes to design four Abeta active immunization vaccines. The epitopes containing different copy numbers of the Abeta 1-6 peptide were specifically loaded on the surface of BLPs via fusion with a peptidoglycan anchoring domain. These four BLP-based Abeta vaccines successfully induced high levels of Abeta42-specific antibodies in mice. However, none of the vaccines induced a T-cell-mediated immune response. Importantly, the antibodies induced by these four vaccines were effective in blocking Abeta42 oligomer toxicity at the cellular level. Among the four vaccines, 6copy-Abeta 1-6 -PA-BLP was the most effective in inducing Abeta-specific antibodies, indicating that a suitable epitope copy number is critical for high immunogenicity of the BLP-based vaccine. Furthermore, high levels of serum Abeta-specific antibodies could still be detected 3 months after the final administration of 6copy-Abeta 1-6 -PA-BLP. Thus, 6copy-Abeta 1-6 -PA-BLP may be a potential therapeutic treatment for AD.
