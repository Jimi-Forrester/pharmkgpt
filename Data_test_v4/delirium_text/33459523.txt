33459523|a|AIMS: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can lead to brain dysfunction and a series of neurological complications. Previous research demonstrated that a novel palmitic acid (5-PAHSA) exerts effect on glucose tolerance and chronic inflammation. Autophagy was important in diabetic-related neurodegeneration. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether 5-PAHSA has specific therapeutic effects on neurological dysfunction in diabetics, particularly with regard to autophagy. METHODS: 5-PAHSA was successfully synthesized according to a previously described protocol. We then carried out a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments using PC12 cells under diabetic conditions, and DB/DB mice, respectively. PC12 cells were treated with 5-PAHSA for 24 h, while mice were administered with 5-PAHSA for 30 days. At the end of each experiment, we analyzed glucolipid metabolism, autophagy, apoptosis, oxidative stress, cognition, and a range of inflammatory factors. RESULTS: Although there was no significant improvement in glucose metabolism in mice administered with 5-PAHSA, ox-LDL decreased significantly following the administration of 5-PAHSA in serum of DB/DB mice (p < 0.0001). We also found that the phosphorylation of m-TOR and ULK-1 was suppressed in both PC12 cells and DB/DB mice following the administration of 5-PAHSA (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01), although increased levels of autophagy were only observed in vitro (p < 0.05). Following the administration of 5-PAHSA, the concentration of ROS decreased in PC12 cells and the levels of CRP increased in high-dose group of 5-PAHSA (p < 0.01). There were no significant changes in terms of apoptosis, other inflammatory factors, or cognition in DB/DB mice following the administration of 5-PAHSA. CONCLUSION: We found that 5-PAHSA can enhance autophagy in PC12 cells under diabetic conditions. Our data demonstrated that 5-PAHSA inhibits phosphorylation of the m-TOR-ULK1 pathway and suppressed oxidative stress in PC12 cells, and exerted influence on lipid metabolism in DB/DB mice.
