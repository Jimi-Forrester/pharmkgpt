37238187|t|Development and Implementation of an Internal Quality Control Sample to Standardize Oligomer-Based Diagnostics of Alzheimer's Disease.
37238187|a|Protein misfolding and aggregation are pathological hallmarks of various neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), soluble and toxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers are biomarker candidates for diagnostics and drug development. However, accurate quantification of Abeta oligomers in bodily fluids is challenging because extreme sensitivity and specificity are required. We previously introduced surface-based fluorescence intensity distribution analysis (sFIDA) with single-particle sensitivity. In this report, a preparation protocol for a synthetic Abeta oligomer sample was developed. This sample was used for internal quality control (IQC) to improve standardization, quality assurance, and routine application of oligomer-based diagnostic methods. We established an aggregation protocol for Abeta1-42, characterized the oligomers by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and assessed their application in sFIDA. Globular-shaped oligomers with a median size of 2.67 nm were detected by AFM, and sFIDA analysis of the Abeta1-42 oligomers yielded a femtomolar detection limit with high assay selectivity and dilution linearity over 5 log units. Lastly, we implemented a Shewhart chart for monitoring IQC performance over time, which is another important step toward quality assurance of oligomer-based diagnostic methods.
