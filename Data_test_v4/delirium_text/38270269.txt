38270269|a|BACKGROUND: We examined the sequences of clinical care leading to diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) using electronic health records from a large academic medical center. METHODS: We included patients aged 65+ with their first ADRD diagnoses from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2019. Using state sequence analysis, care sequences were defined by the ordering of healthcare utilizations occurred in the 2 years before ADRD diagnosis. RESULTS: Of 3621 patients (median age 80), nearly half followed a care sequence of having one primary care visit close to their ADRD diagnosis. Additional care sequences included periodic (n = 322, 8.9%) and multiple (n = 416, 11.5%) outpatient visits to primary care and having one (n = 395, 10.9%), multiple (n = 469, 13.0%), or highly frequent (n = 357, 10.7%) outpatient visits to other specialties. Patients' sociodemographic traits contributed to the variability in care sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Several distinct patterns of care leading to ADRD diagnoses were identified. Integrated care models are needed to promote early identification of ADRD. HIGHLIGHTS: Dementia patients followed distinct care pathways prior to their dementia diagnoses. Key sociodemographic traits contributed to the variation in the sequences of care. Racial differences in the sequencing of care were also found, but only in women.
