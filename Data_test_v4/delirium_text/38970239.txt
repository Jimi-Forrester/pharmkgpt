38970239|a|INTRODUCTION: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a severe neuropsychiatric complication of liver diseases characterized by neuroinflammation. The efficacies of nonabsorbable rifaximin (RIF) and lactulose (LAC) have been well documented in the treatment of HE. [18F]PBR146 is a translocator protein (TSPO) radiotracer used for in vivo neuroinflammation imaging. This study investigated anti-neuroinflammation effect of RIF or/and LAC in chronic HE rats by [18F]PBR146 micro-PET/CT. METHODS: Bile duct ligation (BDL) operation induced chronic HE models, and this study included Sham+normal saline (NS), BDL+NS, BDL+RIF, BDL+LAC, and BDL+RIF+LAC groups. Behavioral assessment was performed to analyze the motor function, and fecal samples were collected after successfully established the chronic HE model (more than 28 days post-surgery). In addition, fecal samples collection and micro-PET/CT scans were performed sequentially. And we also collected the blood plasma, liver, intestinal, and brain samples after sacrificing the rats for further biochemical and pathological analyses. RESULTS: The RIF- and/or LAC-treated BDL rats showed similar behavioral results with Sham+NS group, while the treatment could not reverse the biliary obstruction resulting in sustained liver injury. The RIF or/and LAC treatments can inhibit IFN-gamma and IL-10 productions. The global brain uptake values of [18F]PBR146 in BDL+NS group was significantly higher than other groups (p < .0001). The brain regions analysis showed that the basal ganglia, hippocampus, and cingulate cortex had radiotracer uptake differences among groups (all p < .05), which were consistent with the brain immunohistochemistry results. Sham+NS group was mainly enriched in Christensenella, Coprobacillus, and Pseudoflavonifractor. BDL+NS group was mainly enriched in Barnesiella, Alloprevotella, Enterococcus, and Enterorhabdus. BDL+RIF+LAC group was enriched in Parabacteroides, Bacteroides, Allobaculum, Bifidobacterium, and Parasutterella. CONCLUSIONS: RIF or/and LAC had anti-neuroinflammation in BDL-induced chronic HE rats with gut microbiota alterations. The [18F]PBR146 could be used for monitoring RIF or/and LAC treatment efficacy of chronic HE rats.
