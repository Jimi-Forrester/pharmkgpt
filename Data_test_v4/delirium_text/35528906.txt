35528906|t|Synthesis, human topoisomerase IIalpha inhibitory properties and molecular modeling studies of anti-proliferative curcumin mimics.
35528906|a|3,5-Bis(arylidene)-N-substituted-4-oxo-piperidine-1-carboxamides 24-51 were synthesized as curcumin mimics in a facile pathway through reaction of 3,5-bis(arylidene)-4-piperidones with the appropriate isocyanate in the presence of triethylamine. The 3E,5E'-stereochemical configuration was conclusively supported by single crystal X-ray studies of compounds 25 and 34. Most of the synthesized piperidinecarboxamides showed high anti-proliferative properties with potency higher than that of 5-fluorouracil (clinically approved drug against colon, breast and skin cancers) through in vitro MTT bio-assay. Some of them revealed anti-proliferative properties at sub-micromolar values (IC50 = 0.56-0.70 muM for compounds 29, 30 and 34-38 against HCT116; and IC50 = 0.64 muM for compound 30 against A431 cell lines) with promising inhibitory properties against human DNA topoisomerase IIalpha. The safe profile of the anti-proliferative active agents against the RPE1 normal cell line may prove their selectivity towards carcinoma cells. Robust molecular models (2D-QSAR, 3D-pharmacophore) supported the SAR and validated the observed bio-properties.
