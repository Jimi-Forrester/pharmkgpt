28769785|t|Amyloid beta-Induced Redistribution of Transcriptional Factor EB and Lysosomal Dysfunction in Primary Microglial Cells.
28769785|a|Impaired clearance of Amyloid beta (Abeta) by microglia in the brain may be associated with the senile plaque formation, a pathological hallmark relevant to Alzheimer's disease. Microglial cells in the brain are not able to efficiently degrade Abeta, suggesting that microglial lysosome impairment may occur. However, the mechanism of Abeta-induced impairment of microglia remains poorly understood. We observed the effects of Abeta on the trafficking of nuclear transcriptional factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis, and the expression of a downstream osteoporosis-associated transmembrane protein 1 (OSTM1), a vital molecule involved in lysosome acidification in primary microglial cells. Abeta1-42 but not Abeta42-1 resulted in a significant release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in primary microglia, but the total cellular TFEB was not changed. Further, Abeta induced a dose-dependent reduction of the TFEB in the nucleus of primary microglial cells, coincident with the increase in the plasma, as revealed by Western blot and confocal microscopy. In addition, a dramatic decrease of OSTM1 expression was observed in the Abeta-challenged microglial cells, along with the intracellular pH steady state, indicating the inadequate lysosomal acidification. These data suggest that Abeta might result in a lysosomal dysfunction via inhibiting nuclear TFEB translocation in microglial cells.
