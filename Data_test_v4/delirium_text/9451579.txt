9451579|a|This study used the technique of Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), specifically the component N400, to evaluate semantic functions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). ERPs of 10 patients with probable AD and 10 asymptomatic elderly control subjects were recorded during a semantic categorization task using pictures as stimuli, 50% of the stimuli were congruent and the other 50% were incongruent. Significant differences for the incongruent ERPs, with a diminished N400 component, was observed in the patients group whereas the amplitude of the congruent ERPs was similar in both groups. The characteristics of the N400 in the patients with probable AD suggest that there is a lack of efficiency in accessing information and shows that there are deficient associative connections within the semantic network.
