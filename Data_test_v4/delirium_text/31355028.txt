31355028|t|Slightly Symptomatic Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy-Related Inflammation with Spontaneous Remission in Four Months.
31355028|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation (CAA-ri) is a rare variant of CAA with autoimmune inflammation. A 77-year-old female experienced light-headedness during walking and mild ataxic gait without any other objective neuropsychological deficits. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an area of abnormal signal and mild parenchymal swelling in the right parietal lobe, indicating vasogenic edema. T2*-weighted gradient echo imaging revealed some subcortical microbleeds in the same lesion. Based on the proposed criteria for CAA-ri, she was diagnosed with probable CAA-ri. After 4 months, the spontaneous improvement was noted in the patient's clinical and radiological findings. This report presents a rare and atypical case of CAA-ri in which the diagnosis was established after the patient underwent neuroimaging for only mild neurological symptoms, and the patient's clinical and radiological findings displayed spontaneous improvement. Despite typical and striking MRI findings of CAA-ri, this patient only presented a minimal symptom; this dissociation could highlight the significance of not misinterpreting any new neurological symptoms. Thus, increased availability of MRI and growing awareness of CAA-ri might result in more incidentally diagnosed cases in the future. Furthermore, this case suggests that it would be better to strictly monitor the clinical-radiological findings of patients with probable CAA-ri who only present with minimal symptoms without the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy.
