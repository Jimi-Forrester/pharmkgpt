36193573|t|Brain Energy Metabolism: Astrocytes in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
36193573|a|Astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the brain. They have many important functions in the central nervous system (CNS), including the maintenance of glutamate and ion homeostasis, the elimination of oxidative stress, energy storage in glycogen, tissue repair, regulating synaptic activity by releasing neurotransmitters, and participating in synaptic formation. Astrocytes have special highly ramified structure. Their branches contact with synapses of neurons inwardly, with fine structure and wrapping synapses; their feet contact with blood vessels of brain parenchyma outward, almost wrapping the whole brain. The adjacent astrocytes rarely overlap and communicate with each other through gap junction channels. The ideal location of astrocytes enables them to sense the weak changes of their surroundings and provide the structural basis for the energy supply of neurons. Neurons and astrocytes are closely coupled units of energy metabolism in the brain. Neurons consume a lot of ATPs in the process of neurotransmission. Astrocytes provide metabolic substrates for neurons, maintain high activity of neuron, and facilitate information transmission of neurons. This article reviews the characteristics of glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism of astrocytes. The metabolic interactions between astrocytes and neurons, astrocytes and microglia were also detailed discussed. Finally, we classified analyzed the role of metabolic disorder of astrocytes in the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases.
