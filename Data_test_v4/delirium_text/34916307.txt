34916307|t|Information and communication technologies for the improvement of cognitive function in healthy older adults: a systematic review protocol.
34916307|a|INTRODUCTION: Mild cognitive impairment is one of the consequences of ageing, causing functional disability, a poor quality of life and an increased socioeconomic expenditure. Evidence shows that patients go through a long preclinical stage in which cognitive deficits appear subtly until they reach the threshold of dementia. Non-pharmacological interventions have been gaining ground as prevention of modifiable factors of cognitive decline such as obesity, diabetes, physical inactivity or social isolation. Along these lines, Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) can be a tool for cognitive stimulation, cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation. The main objective of the systematic review will be to review and analyse the use of ICTs for the improvement of cognitive functions in healthy older adult population aged 50 and over, for the prevention of cognitive impairment METHODS: A systematic review will be conducted including randomised clinical trials in adults without diseases or accidents associated with cognitive impairment, and whom have used ICTs for the improvement of cognitive functions between 2010 and 2020 in English or Spanish. The articles that report data on cognitive function by domain, for example, memory or executive functions, or by test will be included. The databases Medline (PubMed), CinahlPlus, Scopus, ISI WoS, CENTRAL and IEEE Xplore will be searched. Studies that meet the inclusion criteria will be analysed according to the Cochrane RoB2 tool for risk of bias assessment. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not necessary as this is a systematic review. The results will be published in scientific journals, as well as in specialised congresses on the subject of study.
