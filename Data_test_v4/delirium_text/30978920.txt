30978920|t|Bioactive beta-Carbolines in Food: A Review.
30978920|a|Harman and norharman, two neuroactive beta-carbolines, are present in several plants and in thermally processed foods. They exhibited a wide spectrum of biological and pharmacological effects, including antioxidant, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory effects. In this article, we review the progress of recent research on the presence of these compounds in food, as well as their various biological and neuroactive properties. Our findings strongly suggest that some foods, especially coffee, can act as a rich source of beta-carbolines, which may possibly be associated with a reduced risk for serious neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.
