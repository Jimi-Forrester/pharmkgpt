3381071|a|Cerebral infection with human immunodeficiency virus can result in the development of symptoms covering a wide spectrum of psychiatric disorders and including adjustment disorders, affective disorders, delirium and dementia. The rapid and insidious nature of the disease requires an approach that relies on differential diagnosis, thorough psychiatric and neurological examination and, when indicated, additional tests such as EEG, LP, CT or MRI. The treatment of psychiatric symptoms is based on traditional pharmacological principles, although at lower doses due to the patients' propensity to develop delirium. Supportive psychotherapy and education of the patient and his family on the special aspects of HIV-associated psychiatric disorders are also cornerstones of treatment.
