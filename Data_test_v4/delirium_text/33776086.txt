33776086|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Appropriate premedication can optimise haemodynamics and hence surgical field visibility during endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). This study aimed to compare the intraoperative effect of gabapentin 1200 mg versus bisoprolol 2.5 mg, given 2 hours before ESS. METHODS: Patients were assigned into one of three groups. Patients of gabapentin group received preoperative oral gabapentin 1200 mg while, patients of bisoprolol and control groups received oral bisoprolol 2.5 mg and placebo respectively 2 hours before ESS. Primary outcome: reduction of blood loss and surgical field quality. Secondary outcome: haemodynamic control. mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded as baseline, before and after induction of anaesthesia, at 1, 5, 10, 15 minutes after intubation and then every 15 minutes until the end of surgery. Data also included Fromm and Boezaart category scale (assessed every 15 min), intraoperative blood loss, surgeon satisfaction score, intraoperative anaesthetic/analgesic and vasoactive medications requirements. RESULTS: Out of 66 eligible patients, 60 patients completed the study. Intraoperative MAP and HR were significantly lower and more stable in gabapentin and bisoprolol groups compared to control group (p < 0.05). The volume of blood loss was significantly lower (p 0.000) and operative field was more visible in gabapentin and bisoprolol groups than those in control group (p 0.000). CONCLUSION: The beneficial effect of gabapentin 1200 mg on intraoperative haemodynamic control and surgical field visibility is comparable to that of bisoprolol 2.5 mg when either of them is given as a single oral dose 2 hours before ESS.
