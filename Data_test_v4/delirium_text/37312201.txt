37312201|t|Preoperative assessment and optimisation prior to planned aortic aneurysm repair: a UK survey examining current practice and attitudes of vascular surgeons and vascular anaesthetists.
37312201|a|BACKGROUND: The majority of those diagnosed with aortic aneurysm in the UK are older, multi-morbid patients. Decision-making as to who may benefit from intervention (open or endovascular aneurysm repair) is highly variable across the NHS (as is the mode of intervention), in part because there are no detailed guidelines or consensus on preoperative assessment. Thus, there is likely to be significant variation in the pre-operative assessment and optimisation of these patients. METHODS: A survey was designed to understand current practice and attitudes of vascular surgeons and vascular anaesthetists in the UK regarding preoperative assessment and optimisation of patients undergoing elective aortic aneurysm repair. The survey was reviewed and validated by an expert panel, then distributed electronically to all vascular surgical and vascular anaesthetic leads in the UK. RESULTS: Overall, the response rate was 68%. The responses were varied between surgeons and anaesthetists, with differences reported in the preoperative assessment and optimisation of patients, the approach to shared decision-making, and the perioperative pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Despite initiatives such as Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, variation still exists between centres with some differences in opinion observed between surgeons and anaesthetists. These differences may be leading to duplication of work in the perioperative pathway, inconsistencies in how risk is assessed and communicated with consequent variation in patient care. Addressing these issues requires awareness and implementation of existing guidelines, transdisciplinary working, efficient data-driven pathways, and structured aortic aneurysm multi-disciplinary team to promote meaningful shared decision-making.
