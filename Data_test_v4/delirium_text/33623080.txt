33623080|a|Chronic wounds show necroptosis from which keratinocytes must be protected to enable appropriate wound re-epithelialization and closure. Poloxamers, a class of synthetic triblock copolymers, are known to be effective against plasma membrane damage (PMD). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a specific poloxamer, surfactant polymer dressing (SPD), which is currently used clinically as wound care dressing, against PMD in keratinocytes. Triton X-100 (TX100) at sub-lytic concentrations caused PMD as demonstrated by the efflux of calcein and by the influx of propidium iodide and FM1-43. TX100, an inducer of necroptosis, led to mitochondrial fragmentation, depletion of nuclear HMGB1, and activation of signaling complex associated with necroptosis (i.e., activation of RIP3 and phosphorylation of MLKL). All responses following exposure of human keratinocytes to TX100 were attenuated by pre- or co-treatment with SPD (100 mg/ml). The activation and translocation of phospho-MLKL to the plasma membrane, taken together with depletion of nuclear HMGB1, characterized the observed cell death as necroptosis. Thus, our findings show that TX100-induced plasma membrane damage and death by necroptosis were both attenuated by SPD, allowing keratinocyte survival. The significance of such protective effects of SPD on keratinocytes in wound re-epithelialization and closure warrant further studies.
