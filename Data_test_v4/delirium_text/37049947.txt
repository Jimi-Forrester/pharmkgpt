37049947|t|Characterization of Cell Death Induced by Imine Analogs of Trans-Resveratrol: Induction of Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Overproduction of Reactive Oxygen Species Leading to, or Not, Apoptosis without the Increase in the S-Phase of the Cell Cycle.
37049947|a|Trans-resveratrol (RSV) is a non-flavonoid polyphenol (stilbene) with numerous biological activities, such as anti-tumor activities. However, RSV is rapidly metabolized, which limits its therapeutic use. The availability of RSV analogues with similar activities for use in vivo is therefore a major challenge. For this purpose, several isomeric analogues of RSV, aza-stilbenes (AZA-ST 1a-g), were synthesized, and their toxicities were characterized and compared to those of RSV on murine N2a neuronal cells using especially flow cytometric methods. All AZA-ST 1a-g have an inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) between 11.3 and 25 microM when determined by the crystal violet assay, while that of RSV is 14.5 microM. This led to the characterization of AZA-ST 1a-g-induced cell death, compared to RSV, using three concentrations encompassing the IC50s (6.25, 12.5 and 25 microM). For AZA-ST 1a-g and RSV, an increase in plasma membrane permeability to propidium iodide was observed, and the proportion of cells with depolarized mitochondria measured with DiOC6(3) was increased. An overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also observed on whole cells and at the mitochondrial level using dihydroethidium and MitoSox Red, respectively. However, only RSV induced a mode of cell death by apoptosis associated with a marked increase in the proportion of cells with condensed and/or fragmented nuclei (12.5 microM: 22 +- 9%; 25 microM: 80 +- 10%) identified after staining with Hoechst 33342 and which are characteristic of apoptotic cells. With AZA-ST, a slight but significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells was only detected with AZA-ST 1b (25 microM: 17 +- 1%) and AZA-ST 1d (25 microM: 26 +- 4%). Furthermore, only RSV induced significant cell cycle modifications associated with an increase in the percentage of cells in the S phase. Thus, AZA-ST 1a-g-induced cell death is characterized by an alteration of the plasma membrane, an induction of mitochondrial depolarization (loss of DeltaPsim), and an overproduction of ROS, which may or may not result in a weak induction of apoptosis without modification of the distribution of the cells in the different phases of the cell cycle.
