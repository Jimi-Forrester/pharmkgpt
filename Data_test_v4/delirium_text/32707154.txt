32707154|a|Iron overload in the brain and iron-induced oxidative damage have been considered to play key roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hepcidin is a peptide that regulates systemic iron metabolism by interacting with iron exporter ferroportin 1 (FPN1). Studies have indicated that the astrocyte hepcidin could regulate brain iron intake at the blood-brain barrier and injection of hepcidin into brain attenuated iron deposition in the brain. However, whether overexpression of hepcidin in astrocytes of APP/PS1 transgenic mice can alleviate AD symptoms by reducing iron deposition has not been evaluated. In this study, we overexpressed hepcidin in astrocytes of APP/PS1 mice and investigated its effects on beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation, neuronal loss, iron deposition and iron-induced oxidative damages. Our results showed that the elevated expression of astrocyte hepcidin in APP/PS1 mice significantly improved their cognitive decline, and partially alleviated the formation of Abeta plaques in cortex and hippocampus. Further investigations revealed that overexpression of hepcidin in astrocytes significantly reduced iron levels in cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, especially iron content in neurons, which led to the reduction of iron accumulation-induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, and finally decreased neuronal cell death in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. This study demonstrated that overexpression of hepcidin in astrocytes of APP/PS1 mice could partially alleviate AD symptoms and delay the pathological process of AD.
