34453296|a|This chapter relates biographic personal and scientific interactions with Rita Levi-Montalcini. It highlights research from our laboratory inspired by Rita's fundamental discovery. This work from studies on potentially neuro-reparative gangliosides, their interactions with NGF, the role of exogenous NGF in the recovery of degenerating cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain to the evidence that endogenous NGF maintains the "day-to-day" cortical synaptic phenotype and the discovery of a novel CNS "NGF metabolic pathway." This brain pathway's conceptual platform allowed the investigation of its status during the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. This revealed a major compromise of the conversion of the NGF precursor molecule (proNGF) into the most biologically active molecule, mature NGF (mNGF). Furthermore, in this pathology, we found enhanced protein levels and enzymatic activity of the proteases responsible for the proteolytic degradation of mNGF. A biochemical prospect explaining the tropic factor vulnerability of the NGF-dependent basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and of their synaptic terminals. The NGF deregulation of this metabolic pathway is evident at preclinical stages and reflected in body fluid particularly in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The findings of a deregulation of the NGF metabolic pathway and its reflection in plasma and CSF are opening doors for the development of novel biomarkers for preclinical detection of AD pathology both in Alzheimer's and in Down syndrome (DS) with "silent" AD pathology.
