35521757|t|Exertional heat stroke: nutritional considerations.
35521757|a|NEW FINDINGS: What is the topic of this review? The potential role of nutrition in exertional heat stroke. What advances does it highlight? Certain nutritional and dietary strategies used by athletes and workers may exert a protective effect the pathophysiological processes of exertional heat stroke, whereas others may be detrimental. While current evidence suggests that some of these practices may be leveraged as a potential countermeasure to exertional heat stroke, further research on injury-related outcomes in humans is required. ABSTRACT: Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is a life-threatening illness and an enduring problem among athletes, military servicemen and -women, and occupational labourers who regularly perform strenuous activity, often under hot and humid conditions or when wearing personal protective equipment. Risk factors for EHS and mitigation strategies have generally focused on the environment, health status, clothing, heat acclimatization and aerobic conditioning, but the potential role of nutrition is largely underexplored. Various nutritional and dietary strategies have shown beneficial effects on exercise performance and health and are widely used by athletes and other physically active populations. There is also evidence that some of these practices may dampen the pathophysiological features of EHS, suggesting possible protection or abatement of injury severity. Promising candidates include carbohydrate ingestion, appropriate fluid intake and glutamine supplementation. Conversely, some nutritional factors and low energy availability may facilitate the development of EHS, and individuals should be cognizant of these. Therefore, the aims of this review are to present an overview of EHS along with its mechanisms and pathophysiology, discuss how selected nutritional considerations may influence EHS risk focusing on their impact on the key pathophysiological processes of EHS, and provide recommendations for future research. With climate change expected to increase EHS risk and incidence in the coming years, further investigation on how diet and nutrition may be optimized to protect against EHS would be highly beneficial.
