Developments of less invasive surgical techniques and advances in perioperative care may also contribute. Postoperative mortality among elderly patients are higher than that in younger patients due to decreased functional reserves of nervous, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic and renal systems. Physiological changes in vital organs of the elderly and their influences in clinical settings are depicted. Postoperative complications in the elderly, including pneumonia, aspiration, myocardial infarction, delirium, cognitive dysfunction and cerebral infarction are described. Management and preventive strategies of postoperative complications are also discussed.
