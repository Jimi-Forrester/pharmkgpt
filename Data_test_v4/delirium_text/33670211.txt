33670211|t|Stress Responses in Down Syndrome Neurodegeneration: State of the Art and Therapeutic Molecules.
33670211|a|Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genomic disorder characterized by the increased incidence of developing early Alzheimer's disease (AD). In DS, the triplication of genes on chromosome 21 is intimately associated with the increase of AD pathological hallmarks and with the development of brain redox imbalance and aberrant proteostasis. Increasing evidence has recently shown that oxidative stress (OS), associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and with the failure of antioxidant responses (e.g., SOD1 and Nrf2), is an early signature of DS, promoting protein oxidation and the formation of toxic protein aggregates. In turn, systems involved in the surveillance of protein synthesis/folding/degradation mechanisms, such as the integrated stress response (ISR), the unfolded stress response (UPR), and autophagy, are impaired in DS, thus exacerbating brain damage. A number of pre-clinical and clinical studies have been applied to the context of DS with the aim of rescuing redox balance and proteostasis by boosting the antioxidant response and/or inducing the mechanisms of protein re-folding and clearance, and at final of reducing cognitive decline. So far, such therapeutic approaches demonstrated their efficacy in reverting several aspects of DS phenotype in murine models, however, additional studies aimed to translate these approaches in clinical practice are still needed.
