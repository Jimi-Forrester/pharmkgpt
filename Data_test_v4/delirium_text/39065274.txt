39065274|t|Comparing Conventional and Advanced Approaches for Heavy Metal Removal in Wastewater Treatment: An In-Depth Review Emphasizing Filter-Based Strategies.
39065274|a|Various industrial activities release heavy metal ions into the environment, which represent one of the major toxic pollutants owing to their severe effects on the environment, humans, and all living species. Despite several technological advances and breakthroughs, wastewater treatment remains a critical global issue. Traditional techniques are dedicated to extracting heavy metal ions from diverse wastewater origins, encompassing coagulation/flocculation, precipitation, flotation, and ion exchange. Their cost, side toxicity, or ineffectiveness often limit their large-scale use. Due to their adaptable design, simple operation, and reasonable cost, membrane filtration and adsorption have proven their efficiency in removing metals from wastewater. Recently, adsorption-based filters have appeared promising in treating water. Within this range, filters incorporating natural, synthetic, or hybrid adsorbents present an appealing alternative to conventional approaches. This review aims to list and describe the conventional and advanced wastewater treatment methods by comparing their efficiency, cost, and environmental impact. Adsorption-based filters were highlighted due to the significant advantages they can provide.
