39793681|a|We reviewed studies that used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography to characterise white matter changes in Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PDD). The search included MEDLINE and EMBASE, and we used a narrative strategy to synthesise the evidence. Data was extracted from 57 studies, of which the majority were considered 'good quality'. Subjects with DLB and PDD had widespread white matter changes compared to healthy controls and Parkinson's disease without cognitive impairment, with a relative sparing of the hippocampus. Compared to subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD), DLB had greater changes in thalamic connectivity and in the nigroputaminal tract, while AD had greater changes in the parahippocampal white matter and fornix. Cognition was associated with widespread white matter changes, visual hallucinations with thalamic and cholinergic connectivity, and parkinsonism with changes in structures involved in motor control. DTI and tractography may therefore be well suited for discriminating DLB and PDD from other types of dementia, and for studying the aetiology of common symptoms.
