23942061|a|There is strong evidence that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology starts decades before clinical onset. Cognitive reserve (CR) and brain reserve can be a good predictive model for AD development. Neuroimaging can help in describing cerebral reserves, as well as in detecting AD brain pathology before the onset of clinical dementia. Education and occupation act as proxies for CR and are associated with a lower risk of AD and delayed onset of symptoms. The apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-epsilon4 allele is a strong risk factor for AD and is associated with lower hippocampal volume even in normal aging. A fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography study of brain metabolism shows different metabolic phenotypes among subjects with different educational levels and ApoE genotypes. More highly educated subjects reach a clinical level when the cerebral areas involved in coping with network disruption are seriously impaired, and the AD-epsilon4 carriers show more global metabolic brain impairment compared with non-epsilon4 carriers. Thus, CR can counteract a genetically unfavorable background, suggesting a possible preventive strategy. AD research findings have already produced results, since recent epidemiological studies report a decreasing incidence of AD in the last years.
