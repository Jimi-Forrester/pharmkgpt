37354655|t|4-Phenylbutyric acid attenuates amyloid-beta proteotoxicity through activation of HSF-1 in an Alzheimer's disease model of the nematode Caenorhabditiselegans.
37354655|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia. The pathogenesis is a complex process, in which the proteotoxicity of amyloid-beta (Abeta) was identified as a major factor. 4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) is an aromatic short-chain fatty acid that may attenuate Abeta proteotoxicity through its already shown properties as a chemical chaperone or by inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs). In the present study, we investigated the molecular effects of 4-PBA on Abeta proteotoxicity using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model. Computer-based analysis of motility was used as a measure of Abeta proteotoxicity in the transgenic strain GMC101, expressing human Abeta1-42 in body wall muscle cells. Abeta aggregation was quantified using the fluorescent probe NIAD-4 to correlate the effects of 4-PBA on motility with the amount of the proteotoxic protein. Furthermore, these approaches were supplemented by gene regulation via RNA interference (RNAi) to identify molecular targets of 4-PBA. 4-PBA improved the motility of GMC101 nematodes and reduced Abeta aggregation significantly. Knockdown of hsf-1, encoding an ortholog essential for the cytosolic heat shock response, prevented the increase in motility and decrease in Abeta aggregation by 4-PBA incubation. RNAi for hda-1, encoding an ortholog of histone deacetylase 2, also increased motility. Double RNAi for hsf-1 and hda-1 revealed a dominant effect of hsf-1 RNAi. Moreover, 4-PBA failed to further increase motility under hda-1 RNAi. Accordingly, the results suggest that 4-PBA attenuates Abeta proteotoxicity in an AD-model of C. elegans through activation of HSF-1 via inhibition of HDA-1.
