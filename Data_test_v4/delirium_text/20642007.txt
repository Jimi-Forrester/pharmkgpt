20642007|a|Benzodiazepines are potent psychoactive drugs used for their sedative and anxiolytic properties (1, 2). There are two types of benzodiazepine receptors, which have been designated as the central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). PBR is also known as the translocator protein (TSPO). CBR is found exclusively in the central nervous system on the membranes of neurons and is coupled with the g-aminobutyric acid receptor/chloride channel (3). In contrast, PBR is a mitochondrial protein found in brain and peripheral tissues (adrenal gland, heart, lung, kidney, and testis) (4). The brain has lower levels of PBR than do peripheral tissues, while both glial cells and macrophages contain high levels of PBR (5-7). Increased PBR expression after brain injury or neuroinflammation is associated with microglial activation, such as occurs with the neuronal damage that accompanies several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer s disease, Wernicke s encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. PBR has been studied <i>in vivo</i> with positron emission tomography (PET) using 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-<i>N</i>-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<i>N</i>-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide ([<sup>11</sup>C]PK11195), an isoquinoline carboxamide with specific PBR antagonistic activity. [<sup>11</sup>C]PK11195 has been developed as a PET agent for non-invasive studies of microglia and macrophage activation in the brain, lung, and heart. However, accumulation of this tracer in the brain is limited with a poor signal/noise ratio. Other ligands displaying better brain kinetics have recently been synthesized and studied. Among them, <i>N,N</i>-diethyl-2-(2-(4-[<sup>11</sup>C]methoxyphenyl)-5,7-dimethyl-pyrazolo(1,5-<i>a</i>)pyrimidin-3-yl)-acetamide ([<sup>11</sup>C]DPA-713), a compound from the family of pyrazolopyrimidines (8), has shown a slightly higher affinity (<i>K</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> = 4.7 nM) for PBR than does [<sup>11</sup>C]PK11195 (<i>K</i><sub><i>i</i></sub><i> =</i> 9.3 nM). <i>N,N</i>-Diethyl-2-(2-(3-[<sup>125</sup>I]iodo-4-methyoxyphenyl)-5,7-dimethyl-pyrazolo(1,5-<i>a</i>)pyrimidin-3-yl)-acetamide ([<sup>125</sup>I]iodoDPA-713), a DPA-713 analog, has been developed for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of PBR in the brain (9).
