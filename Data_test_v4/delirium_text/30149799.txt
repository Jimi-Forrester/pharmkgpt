30149799|t|The role of neutrophil granule proteins in neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's disease.
30149799|a|Neutrophils are the innate immune system's first line of defense. Neutrophils play a critical role in protecting the host against infectious pathogens, resolving sterile injuries, and mediating inflammatory responses. The granules of neutrophils and their constituent proteins are central to these functions. Although neutrophils may exert a protective role upon acute inflammatory conditions or insults, continued activity of neutrophils in chronic inflammatory diseases can contribute to tissue damage. Neutrophil granule proteins are involved in a number of chronic inflammatory conditions and diseases. However, the functions of these proteins in neuroinflammation and chronic neuroinflammatory diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), remain to be elucidated. In this review, we discuss recent findings from our lab and others that suggest possible functions for neutrophils and the neutrophil granule proteins, CAP37, neutrophil elastase, and cathepsin G, in neuroinflammation, with an emphasis on AD. These findings reveal that neutrophil granule proteins may exert both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects. Further research should determine whether neutrophil granule proteins are valid targets for therapeutic interventions in chronic neuroinflammatory diseases.
