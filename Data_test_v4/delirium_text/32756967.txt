32756967|t|Prostatic abscess: an unusual cause of delirium associated with lower urinary tract symptoms.
32756967|a|Our case describes an 80-year-old gentleman who presented with delirium and lower urinary tract symptoms. Initially treated for a urinary tract infection, he became more unwell with features of physiological decompensation secondary to sepsis. A computerized tomography scan was performed in light of the findings of suprapubic tenderness, which on examination revealed a prostatic abscess. On discussion with urology and microbiology colleagues a plan for antibiotics was constructed and the gentleman recovered without the need for invasive interventions. Our case goes on to discuss the merits of imaging for the elderly care physician when the diagnosis is not clear or when the clinical picture is of deterioration despite optimal medical care.
