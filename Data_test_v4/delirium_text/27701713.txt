27701713|t|An Update on Biomedical Application of Nanotechnology for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis and Therapy.
27701713|a|Approximately 35 million people worldwide suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cellular uptake and specific transport of drugs and imaging agents to brain are common issues in the diagnosis and therapy of AD. New advances in nanotechnology have supplied favorable solutions to this issue. Various nanocarriers such as polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles, dendrimers and nanogels have been studied for the delivery of drugs and imaging agents to brain. This review presents a succinct discussion of the applications of nanotechnology for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and therapy.
