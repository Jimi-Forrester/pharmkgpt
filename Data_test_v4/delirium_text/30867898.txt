30867898|t|Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes and Long Noncoding RNAs Associated with Parkinson's Disease.
30867898|a|OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) using a microarray. METHODS: We downloaded the microarray data GSE6613 from the Gene Expression Omnibus, which included 105 samples. We selected 72 samples comprising 22 healthy control blood samples and 50 PD blood samples for further analysis. Later, we used Limma to screen DEGs and differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) and estimated their functions by the Gene Ontology (GO). Besides, the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, including microRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs, was constructed to elucidate the regulatory mechanism. Furthermore, we performed the KEGG pathway enrichment with mRNAs in the ceRNA regulatory network and constructed a final network, including pathways, mRNAs, microRNAs, and lncRNAs. RESULTS: Overall, we obtained 394 DEGs, including 207 upregulated DEGs and 187 downregulated DEGs, and 7 DElncRNAs, including 2 upregulated DElncRNAs and 5 downregulated DElncRNAs. Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) was considerably enriched in the endocytosis pathway. In the ceRNA regulation network, IGF1R was the target of hsa-miR-133b and lncRNAs of XIST, and PART1 could also be the target of hsa-miR-133b. While the upregulated DEGs were enriched in the GO terms of the cytoskeleton, cytoskeletal part, and microtubule cytoskeleton, the downregulated DEGs were enriched in the immune response. PRKACA was markedly enriched in numerous pathways, including the MAPK and insulin signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: IGF1R, PRKACA, and lncRNA-XIST could be potentially involved in PD, and these diverse molecular mechanisms could support the development of the similar treatment for PD.
