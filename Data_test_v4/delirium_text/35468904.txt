35468904|a|Diabetes is a chronic disease leading to memory difficulties and deterioration of learning abilities. The previous studies showed that modulation of inflammatory pathways in the diabetic brain may reduce dysfunction or cell death in brain areas which are important for control of cognitive function. In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective actions of newly synthesized adamantane derivatives on diabetes-induced cognitive impairment in mice. Our study relied on the fact that both vildagliptin and saxagliptin belong to DPP4 inhibitors and, contain adamantanyl group. Efficacy of tested compounds at reversing diabetes-induced different types of memory impairment was evaluated with the use of selected behavioural tests. The following neuroinflammatory indicators were also analyzed: neuroinflammatory indicators and the expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response of brain (Cav1, Bdnf). Our study demonstrated that new adamantane derivatives, similarly to DPP4 inhibitors, can restrict diabetes-induced cognitive deficits. We demonstrated that the overexpression of GLP-1-glucagon-like peptide as well as Bdnf, Cav1 genes translate into central blockade of pro-inflammatory synthesis of cytokines and significantly improvement on memory performance in diabetes mice. Newly synthesized adamantane derivatives might have important roles in prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment by inflammatory events in patients with diabetes or related diseases.
