29940929|a|BACKGROUND: One of the molecular mechanisms involved in upper airway-related diseases is epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Olea europaea (OE) has anti-inflammatory properties and thus, great potential to prevent EMT. This study aimed to investigate the effect of OE on EMT in primary nasal human respiratory epithelial cells (RECs). METHODS: Respiratory epithelial cells were isolated and divided into four groups: control (untreated), treated with 0.05% OE (OE group), EMT induced with 5 ng/ml of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFbeta1 group) and treated with 5 ng/ml TGFbeta1 + 0.05% OE (TGFbeta1 + OE group). The effects of OE treatment on growth kinetics, morphology and protein expression in RECs were evaluated. Immunocytochemistry analysis was performed to quantitate the total percentage of E-cadherin and vimentin expression from day 1 to day 3. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between untreated RECs and OE-treated RECs in terms of their morphology, growth kinetics and protein expression. Induction with TGFbeta1 caused RECs to have an elongated spindle shape, a slower proliferation rate, a higher expression of vimentin and a lower expression of E-cadherin compared with the control. Cells in the TGFbeta1 + OE group had similar epithelial shape to untreated group however it had no significant differences in their proliferation rate when compared to TGFbeta1-induced RECs. Cells treated with TGFbeta1 + OE showed significantly reduced expression of vimentin and increased expression of E-cadherin compared with the TGFbeta1 group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The ability of OE to inhibit EMT in RECs was shown by TGFb1-induced EMT REC morphology, growth kinetics and protein expression markers (E-cadherin and vimentin) upon treatment with OE and TGFbeta1. Therefore, this study could provide insight into the therapeutic potential of OE to inhibit pathological tissue remodelling and persistent inflammation.
