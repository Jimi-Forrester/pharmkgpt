33107693|a|AIM: We assessed the efficacy of buprenorphine replacement taper therapy in a psychiatric hospital in Japan. METHODS: Based on the medical records, a retrospective analysis was performed to evaluate the outcomes of buprenorphine replacement taper therapy in 106 subjects with heroin dependence. RESULTS: We found that replacement and taper therapy with buprenorphine could significantly reduce withdrawal symptoms during detoxification. In addition, the completion rate of detoxification was significantly improved and the length of hospital stay was significantly reduced relative to those who received conventional treatment without buprenorphine. However, the readmission rate increased after the introduction of detoxication therapy with buprenorphine. CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest not only the efficacy and safety of buprenorphine replacement and taper therapy, but also the requirement for maintenance therapy for individuals with heroin dependence.
