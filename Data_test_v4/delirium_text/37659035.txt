37659035|a|Chronic consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) has profound effects on brain aging, which is mainly characterized by cognitive decline, inflammatory responses, and neurovascular damage. Alisol A (AA) is a triterpenoid with therapeutic potential for metabolic diseases, but whether it has a neuroprotective effect against brain aging caused by a HFD has not been investigated. Six-month-old male C57BL6/J mice were exposed to a HFD with or without AA treatment for 12 weeks. Behavioral tasks were used to assess the cognitive abilities of the mice. Neuroinflammation and changes in neurovascular structure in the brains were examined. We further assessed the mechanism by which AA exerts neuroprotective effects against HFD-induced pathological brain aging in vitro and in vivo. Behavioral tests showed that cognitive function was improved in AA-treated animals. AA treatment reduced microglia activation and inflammatory cytokine release induced by a HFD. Furthermore, AA treatment increased the number of hippocampal neurons, the density of dendritic spines, and the expression of tight junction proteins. We also demonstrated that AA attenuated microglial activation by targeting the SIRT3-NF-kappaB/MAPK pathway and ameliorated microglial activation-induced tight junction degeneration in endothelial cells and apoptosis in hippocampal neurons. The results of this study show that AA may be a promising agent for the treatment of HFD-induced brain aging.
