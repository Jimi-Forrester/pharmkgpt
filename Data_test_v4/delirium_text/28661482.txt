28661482|t|Necroptosis in neurodegenerative diseases: a potential therapeutic target.
28661482|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of chronic progressive disorders characterized by neuronal loss. Necroptosis, a recently discovered form of programmed cell death, is a cell death mechanism that has necrosis-like morphological characteristics. Necroptosis activation relies on the receptor-interacting protein (RIP) homology interaction motif (RHIM). A variety of RHIM-containing proteins transduce necroptotic signals from the cell trigger to the cell death mediators RIP3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL). RIP1 plays a particularly important and complex role in necroptotic cell death regulation ranging from cell death activation to inhibition, and these functions are often cell type and context dependent. Increasing evidence suggests that necroptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, small molecules such as necrostatin-1 are thought inhibit necroptotic signaling pathway. Understanding the precise mechanisms underlying necroptosis and its interactions with other cell death pathways in neurodegenerative diseases could provide significant therapeutic insights. The present review is aimed at summarizing the molecular mechanisms of necroptosis and highlighting the emerging evidence on necroptosis as a major driver of neuron cell death in neurodegenerative diseases.
