27406233|t|Evaluation and clinical significance of cyclin-dependent kinase5 expression in cervical lesions: a clinical research study in Guangxi, China.
27406233|a|BACKGROUND: Studies have been reported that cyclin-dependent kinase5 (CDK5) was associated with the development of several cancers. However, the relationship between CDK5 level and clinicopathological factors is still poorly understood in cervical diseases. The aim of the current study was to investigate the expression of CDK5 and its clinical significance in variant cervical lesions. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect CDK5 expression in 54 cases of chronic cervicitis, 42 cases of condyloma acuminate (CA), 38 cases of carcinoma in situ, and 360 cases of cervical cancers [adenocarcinoma, n = 63; squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), n = 263; adenosquamous carcinoma, n = 34]. The clinicopathological characteristics in relation to CDK5 were examined by Pearson's Chi-square test. RESULTS: The positive rates of CDK5 were 27.8, 31.0, 50, 54.0, 58.8, and 62.7 % in chronic cervicitis, CA, carcinoma in situ, adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma and SCC, respectively. Statistically analysis showed that CDK5 expression in cervical cancer tissues was higher than non-cervical cancer tissues (inflammation and CA) (P < 0.001). The overexpression of CDK5 was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (r = 0.317; P < 0.001), histological type (r = 0.198; P < 0.001), FIGO stage (r = 0.358; P < 0.001), TNM stage (r = 0.329; P < 0.001) and pathological grade (r = 0.259; P < 0.001) in cervical lesions evaluated by Pearson's Chi-square test. Furthermore, the positive relationships were found between CDK5 and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001), FIGO stage (P < 0.001), TNM stage (P < 0.001) and pathological grade (P < 0.001) in SCC. CDK5 was positively interrelated to TNM stage (P = 0.017) in adenosquamous carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: CDK5 may play a vital role in the development of cervical cancer, which may be a marker for the diagnosis, therapy and prognosis of cervical cancer.
