30049276|t|Incidence and risk factors of postoperative delirium in the elderly patients with hip fracture.
30049276|a|BACKGROUND: To investigate the incidence and related risk factors of delirium in elderly patients with hip fracture. METHODS: This is a retrospective study, performed in a medical center from October 2014 to February 2017, which enrolled all subjects aged over 65 years who were admitted for hip surgeries (hip arthroplasty, proximal femoral nail fixation). Univariate and multivariate logistic analysis was used to determine the incidence and risk factors of delirium. Delirium was assessed according to the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). RESULTS: Overall, 19.29% of total 306 patients (mean age 81.9 +- 5.4 years) were identified as delirium. The delirium was significantly associated (p < 0.05) with the factors of age, hospitalization, diabetes, preoperative hematocrit (HCT), perioperative protein consumption, transfusion volume, preoperative leukocyte level, albumin level, American Society of Anesthesiologists (NYHA) classification, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, blood loss, coronary heart disease, and cerebral infarction. Multivariate analysis of the variables confirmed that age (> 75 years old), diabetes, and ASA classification (> 2 level) are the independent risk factors of postoperative delirium (POD). In addition, patients in delirium had prolonged hospitalization and high perioperative albumin infusion. CONCLUSION: The elderly patients over the age of 75 years with the history of diabetes or ASA classification > 2 level were at higher risk of POD. Delirium is an important postoperative complication, which had prolonged hospitalization and high perioperative albumin infusion. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.
