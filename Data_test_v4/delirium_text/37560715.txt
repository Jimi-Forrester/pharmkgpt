37560715|a|Introduction: Recent studies have proved the diverse roles of miRs in different cancer-related processes. This study was undertaken to determine the therapeutic implications of miR-325-3p in breast cancer. Material and methods: Expression analysis was carried out by qRT-PCR. Transfections were performed by Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. MTT assay was used for cell viability. Transwell assays were used for cell migration and invasion. Western blot analysis was used for protein expression analysis. Results: Gene expression analysis revealed miR-325 to be significantly suppressed in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Nonetheless, ectopic expression of miR-325 resulted in suppression of the growth and colony development potential of the SK-BR-3 and CAMA-1 cells. Transwell assays showed that miR-325 overexpression also resulted in the decline of the migration and invasion of the SK-BR-3 and CAMA-1 cells. Bioinformatic analysis showed that miR-325 targets lipocalin 15 (LNC15) in breast cancer cells. LNC15 was also overexpressed in the breast cancer tissues and cell lines. However, overexpression of miR-325 caused a significant decline in the LNC15 expression in SK-BR-3 cells. Additionally, silencing of LNC15 resulted in inhibition of the growth, migration and invasion of the SK-BR-3 cells. Rescue assay showed that overexpression of LNC15 could promote the growth, migration and invasion of the miR-325 overexpressing effects. Conclusions: Taken together, the evidence shows that miR-325 acts as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer and may be used in the treatment of breast cancer.
