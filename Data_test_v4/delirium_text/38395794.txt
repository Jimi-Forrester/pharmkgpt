38395794|a|STUDY OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to assess whether continuous intravenous administration of DEX during surgery can be part of the measures to prevent the onset of postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly individuals following regional anesthesia. METHODS: We searched the databases of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (by June 1, 2023) for all available randomized controlled trials assessing whether intravenous application of dexmedetomidine can help with postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction in the elderly with regional anesthesia. Subsequently, we carried out statistical analysis and graphing using Review Manager software (RevMan version 5.4.1) and STATA software (Version 12.0). MAIN RESULTS: Within the scope of this meta-analysis, a total of 18 randomized controlled trials were included. Among them, 10 trials aimed to assess the incidence of postoperative delirium as the primary outcome, while the primary focus of the other 8 trials was on the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. The collective evidence from these 10 studies consistently supports a positive relationship between the intravenous administration of dexmedetomidine and a decreased risk of postoperative delirium (RR: 0.48; 95%CI: 0.37 to 0.63, p < 0.00001, I2 = 0%). The 8 literature articles and experiments evaluating postoperative cognitive dysfunction showed that continuous intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine during the entire surgical procedure exhibited a positive preventive effect on cognitive dysfunction among the elderly population with no obvious heterogeneity (RR: 0.35; 95%CI: 0.25 to 0.49,p < 0.00001, I2 = 0%). CONCLUSION: Administering dexmedetomidine intravenously during surgery can potentially play a significant role in preventing postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction in patients older than 60 years with regional anesthesia according to this meta-analysis.
