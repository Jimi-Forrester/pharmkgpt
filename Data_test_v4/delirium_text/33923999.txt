33923999|a|Diet is a modifiable factor that ensures optimal growth, biochemical performance, improved mood and mental functioning. Lack of nutrients, notably vitamin B, has an impact on human health and wellbeing. The United Arab Emirates is facing a serious problem of micronutrient deficiencies because of the growing trend for bariatric surgery, including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. People undergoing bariatric surgery are at high risk of developing neurological, cognitive, and mental disabilities and cardiovascular disease due to deficiency in vitamin B. Vitamin B is involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, including gamma-aminobutyric acid, serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline. Deficiency of vitamin B increases the risk of depression, anxiety, dementia and Alzheimer's disease. In addition, vitamin B deficiency can disrupt the methylation of homocysteine, leading to hyperhomocysteinemia. Elevated homocysteine levels are detrimental to human health. Vitamin B deficiency also suppresses immune function, increases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and upregulates NF-kappaB. Considering the important functions of vitamin B and the severe consequences associated with its deficiency following bariatric surgery, proper dietary intervention and administration of adequate supplements should be considered to prevent negative clinical outcomes.
