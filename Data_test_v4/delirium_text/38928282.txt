38928282|t|Biotin Homeostasis and Human Disorders: Recent Findings and Perspectives.
38928282|a|Biotin (vitamin B7, or vitamin H) is a water-soluble B-vitamin that functions as a cofactor for carboxylases, i.e., enzymes involved in the cellular metabolism of fatty acids and amino acids and in gluconeogenesis; moreover, as reported, biotin may be involved in gene regulation. Biotin is not synthesized by human cells, but it is found in food and is also produced by intestinal bacteria. Biotin status/homeostasis in human individuals depends on several factors, including efficiency/deficiency of the enzymes involved in biotin recycling within the human organism (biotinidase, holocarboxylase synthetase), and/or effectiveness of intestinal uptake, which is mainly accomplished through the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter. In the last years, administration of biotin at high/"pharmacological" doses has been proposed to treat specific defects/deficiencies and human disorders, exhibiting mainly neurological and/or dermatological symptoms and including biotinidase deficiency, holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency, and biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease. On the other hand, according to warnings of the Food and Drug Administration, USA, high biotin levels can affect clinical biotin-(strept)avidin assays and thus lead to false results during quantification of critical biomarkers. In this review article, recent findings/advancements that may offer new insight in the abovementioned research fields concerning biotin will be presented and briefly discussed.
