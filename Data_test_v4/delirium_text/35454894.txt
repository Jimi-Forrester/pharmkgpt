35454894|t|Treatment of Neuropathic Pain Directly Due to Cancer: An Update.
35454894|a|Neuropathic pain can be defined as pain related to abnormal somatosensory processing in either the peripheral or central nervous system. In this review article, with neuropathic cancer pain (NCP), we refer to pain due to nervous tissue lesions caused by the tumor or its metastases. Nervous tissue damage is the cause of cancer pain in approximately 40% of those experiencing cancer pain. Recognizing a neuropathic pathophysiology in these cases may be difficult and requires specific criteria that are not homogenously applied in clinical practice. The management of this type of pain can be challenging, requiring the use of specific non-opioid adjuvant drugs. The majority of the criteria for NCP diagnosis and management have been based mainly on results from the noncancer population, risking the failure of addressing the specific needs of this population of patients. In this review, we summarize current management options available for NCP and provide some insights on new promising treatments.
