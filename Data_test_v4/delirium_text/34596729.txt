34596729|a|Coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone or CoQ10) is a lipid molecule that acts as an electron mobile carrier of the electron transport chain and also contains antioxidant properties. Supplementation of CoQ10 has been very useful to treat mitochondrial diseases. CoQ10 along with its synthetic analogue, idebenone, is used largely to treat various neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Friedreich's ataxia and additional brain disease condition like autism, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, depression, and bipolar disorder, which are related to mitochondrial impairment. In this article, we have reviewed numerous physiological functions of CoQ10 and the rationale for its use in clinical practice in different brain disorders.
