32275033|a|Background: Upper thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is compared with lower thoracic epidural analgesia for the perioperative pain management and fast tracking in patients undergoing off pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) surgery for the intraoperative hemodynamic, quality of analgesia, incentive spirometry, time to awakening & extubation and intensive care unit (ICU) duration. Materials and Methods: A prospective, randomized comparative clinical study was conducted with total of 60 patients randomized to either Group U: Upper TEA (n = 30) or Group L: Lower TEA (n = 30). Visual analog scale (VAS) was recorded in both the groups during rest and deep breathing at the various time intervals postextubation. Both the groups were also compared for intraoperative hemodynamics, incentive spirometry, time to awakening, and extubation and ICU duration. Statistical analysis was performed using the independent Student's t-test. A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Postextubation VAS score at rest and deep breathing at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h were statistically significant in both groups (P <= 0.05). Incentive spirometry, time to awakening and extubation and duration of ICU stay were also statistically significant (P <= 0.05) between the groups. Conclusion: Lower thoracic epidural was better than upper thoracic epidural in perioperative pain management and fast tracking in OPCAB surgery.
