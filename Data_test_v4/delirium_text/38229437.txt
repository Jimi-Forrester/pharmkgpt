38229437|t|Does Old Age Comprise Distinct Subphases? Evidence from an Analysis of the Relationship between Age and Activities of Daily Living, Comorbidities, and Geriatric Syndromes.
38229437|a|Background: Older individuals are usually treated as a homogenous group despite evidence that old age consists of distinct subphases. This observational study including 493 older patients aimed to identify differences among age subgroups of older persons. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was then applied to identify the optimal age cut-off points to distinguish those age groups. Methods: Data were collected on the demographics of older patients, their medical and medication histories, dependence on activities of daily living (ADLs), and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests) and ROC curves were used for statistical analysis. Results: The 65-79 and 80+-year age groups showed distinct frailty status, comorbidity, and dependency in ADLs. The median age to remain completely independent in IADLs was 76-79 years, while the median age for being free from geriatric syndromes was slightly higher (77-80 years) and reached 82 years for the absence of delirium, falls, and swallowing problems. In the ROC analysis, the optimal cutoff ages for the presence of frailty, cognitive impairment, and dependency in ADLs were 80-82 years. Conclusion: The 65-79 and 80+-year age groups differed significantly in numerous parameters, underscoring the need to address these distinct age groups differently, both for applying medical therapies and interventions, as well as for conducting health research.
