32743497|a|Sjogren's syndrome is characterized by the involvement of exocrine glands, manifesting with xerostomia and xerophthalmia. The objective was to determine the treatment received and identify potentially inappropriate prescriptions by estimating the anticholinergic burden generated by medications in patients with Sjogren's syndrome in Colombia. This cross-sectional study was based on a population database that identified patients with Sjogren's syndrome, comorbidities, pharmacological treatment, and medications with anticholinergic properties. The anticholinergic burden was estimated using the Anticholinergic Drug Scale. A total of 4945 patients with Sjogren's syndrome were identified, with a mean age of 64.6 +- 14.04 years and 75.7% women. A total of 79.0% received a topical lubricant, with hyaluronate being the most prescribed (26.8%), while oral pilocarpine was prescribed for 7.4%. The use of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs was identified in 1.3% of cases. A total of 39.1% (n = 1932) of all patients received cholinergic antagonists, especially codeine (6.5%), prednisolone (5.7%), and furosemide (5.3%). The mean anticholinergic burden was 0.91 +- 1.57 (range: 0-24), 17.2% (n = 850) had a score of 1, 7.7% (n = 381) had a score of 2, and 14.2% (n = 701) >=3 points. Multiple comorbidities were associated with the risk of having cholinergic antagonist medication prescribed. Most patients with Sjogren's syndrome were women whose symptomatic management mainly included ocular lubricants with low use of oral pilocarpine. A large proportion of patients had at least one cholinergic antagonist drug prescribed, increasing its use risk after 40 years of age.
