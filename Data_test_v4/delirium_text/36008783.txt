36008783|t|Non-pharmacological delirium prevention practices among critical care nurses: a qualitative study.
36008783|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is common among critically ill patients, leading to increased mortality, physical dependence, and cognitive impairment. Evidence suggests non-pharmacological delirium prevention practices are effective in preventing delirium. However, only a few studies explore the actual implementation and its associated challenges among critical care nurses. AIM: To explore critical care nurses' perceptions of current non-pharmacological delirium prevention practices in adult intensive care settings, including delirium screening, early mobilisation, sleep promotion, family engagement, and sensory stimulation. METHODS: A qualitative design adopting a thematic analysis approach. Semi-structured interviews with 20 critical care nurses were conducted in ten acute hospitals in mainland China. RESULTS: Three themes emerged: (a) importance of family engagement; (b) influence of organisational factors, and (c) suggestions on implementation. The implementation of non-pharmacological delirium prevention practices was limited by a strict ICU visitation policy, lack of routine delirium screening and delirium training, light and noise disturbances during nighttime hours, frequent resuscitation and new admissions and strict visitation policy. Case-based training, adopting a sensory stimulation protocol, and family engagement may be enablers. CONCLUSION: ICU care routine that lacks delirium assessment and the strict family visitation policy made it challenging to implement the complete bundle of non-pharmacological practices. Resource deficiency (understaffing, lack of training) and ICU environment (frequent resuscitation) also limited the implementation of non-pharmacological practices. Clinicians could implement case-based training and sensory-stimulation programs and improve communication with family caregivers by instructing family caregivers to recognise delirium symptoms and delirium prevention strategies.
