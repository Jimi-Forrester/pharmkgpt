30793584|t|Increased Secondary Nucleation Underlies Accelerated Aggregation of the Four-Residue N-Terminally Truncated Abeta42 Species Abeta5-42.
30793584|a|Aggregation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide into plaques is believed to play a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid plaques consist of fibrils of full length Abeta peptides as well as N-terminally truncated species. beta-Site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) cleaves amyloid precursor protein in the first step in Abeta peptide production and is an attractive therapeutic target to limit Abeta generation. Inhibition of BACE1, however, induces a unique pattern of Abeta peptides with increased levels of N-terminally truncated Abeta peptides starting at position 5 (Abeta5-X), indicating that these peptides are generated through a BACE1-independent pathway. Here we elucidate the aggregation mechanism of Abeta5-42 and its influence on full-length Abeta42. We find that, compared to Abeta42, Abeta5-42 is more aggregation prone and displays enhanced nucleation rates. Abeta5-42 oligomers cause nonspecific membrane disruption to similar extent as Abeta42 but appear at earlier time points in the aggregation reaction. Noteworthy, this implies similar toxicity of Abeta42 and Abeta5-42 and the toxic species are generated faster by Abeta5-42. The increased rate of secondary nucleation on the surface of existing fibrils originates from a higher affinity of Abeta5-42 monomers for fibrils, as compared to Abeta42: an effect that may be related to the reduced net charge of Abeta5-42. Moreover, Abeta5-42 and Abeta42 peptides coaggregate into heteromolecular fibrils and either species can elongate existing Abeta42 or Abeta5-42 fibrils but Abeta42 fibrils are more catalytic than Abeta5-42 fibrils. Our findings highlight the importance of the N-terminus for surface-catalyzed nucleation and thus the production of toxic oligomers.
