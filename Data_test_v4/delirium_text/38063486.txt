38063486|a|Cholinergic signaling plays a crucial role in the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis; however, the mechanisms by which acetylcholine mediates neurogenic effects are not completely understood. Here, we report the expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype M4 (M4 mAChR) on a subpopulation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) in the adult mouse hippocampus, and demonstrate that its pharmacological stimulation promotes their proliferation, thereby enhancing the production of new neurons in vivo. Using a targeted ablation approach, we also show that medial septum (MS) and the diagonal band of Broca (DBB) cholinergic neurons support both the survival and morphological maturation of adult-born neurons in the mouse hippocampus. Although the systemic administration of an M4-selective allosteric potentiator fails to fully rescue the MS/DBB cholinergic lesion-induced decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis, it further exacerbates the impairment in the morphological maturation of adult-born neurons. Collectively, these findings reveal stage-specific roles of M4 mAChRs in regulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis, uncoupling their positive role in enhancing the production of new neurons from the M4-induced inhibition of their morphological maturation, at least in the context of cholinergic signaling dysfunction.
