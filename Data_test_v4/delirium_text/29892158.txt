29892158|a|Recently, toxic alpha-synuclein oligomer, which can mediate cell-to-cell propagation is suggested to cause sporadic Parkinson disease. alpha-Synuclein interacts with membrane lipids especially polyunsaturated fatty acids to stabilize its three-dementional structure. Peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids may reduce their affinity to alpha-synuclein and peroxidation byproducts might modify alpha-synuclein. 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal derived from n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids was reported to modify alpha-synuclein to produce a toxic oligomer. Moreover, the accumulation of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, which could induce oligomeriztion of alpha-synuclein, was found in parkinsonian brains. Docosahexaenoic acid, an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids abundant in the neuronal membrane, was also found to enhance alpha-synuclein oligomerization; however, the precise details of the chemical reaction involved are unclear. Propanoylated lysine, a specific indicator of docosahexaenoic acid oxidation, was increased in neuronal differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing alpha-synuclein. alpha-Synuclein might be modified by the peroxidation products and then, is degraded by the autophagy-lysosome system. In addition, in the cells overexpressing alpha-synuclein, the mitochondrial electrone transfer chain was found to be inhibited. Accumulation of abnormal alpha-synuclein modified by lipid radicals derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids may be not only an indicator of brain oxidative stress but also causative of neurodegeneration such as Parkinson disease by impairing mitochondrial function.
