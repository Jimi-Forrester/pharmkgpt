32189232|a|The study examined the effects of various methods of thermal treatment of Lord cultivar potato tubers on changes in starch, polyphenols, vitamin C, antioxidant activity, and mineral compounds. Following heat treatment in order to determine further transformations of starch, the potatoes were stored at 2  C/24 h. Changes in starch, bioactive compounds and antioxidant properties varied depending on the treatment method. In general, higher retention of bioactive compounds was noted for tubers treated with "dry" methods, such as microwaving or grilling than for tubers treated with "wet" methods, e.g., boiling in water, steam cooking or cooking in a combi oven. These samples were also characterised by a higher resistant starch content. Cold storage resulted in an increase in the proportion of resistant starch. Total phenols content ranged from 210.96 (boiling) to 348.46 mg/100 g DW (grilling) and vitamin C content ranged from 43.79 (boiling) to 68.83 mg/100 g DW (microwaving). DPPH radical scavenging activity was the highest for the grilled tubers. The results indicate microwaving and grilling as the most favourable thermal treatments of potato.
