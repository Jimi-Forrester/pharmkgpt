30483990|t|Drug-drug interactions in patients with acute coronary syndrome across phases of treatment.
30483990|a|The objective of this study is to evaluate potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) and risk factors for pDDIs in three phases of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) treatment: from the point of first medical contact to the coronary angiography (first phase), after coronary angiography to the last day of hospitalization (second phase), and at discharge from hospital (third phase). This retrospective observational cohort clinical study was conducted at the Clinic for Cardiology of the Clinical Centre Kragujevac, a public tertiary care hospital in Kragujevac, Serbia. Micromedex  interaction checker was used to detect pDDIs. This study included 245 ACS patients. All patients were exposed to at least one pDDI in all the phases of treatment. Mean total number of pDDIs was 9.47 +- 6.07, 10.11 +- 6.92, and 6.29 +- 3.66 in first, second, and third phases, respectively. Age, > 6 h from the beginning of the symptoms to admission, primary PCI, STE-ACS, COPD, delirium, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, systolic blood pressure at admission, TIMI risk score at admission, ALT, LDL, number of physicians who prescribed drugs to a single patient, number of prescribed drugs, and various pharmacological classes increased risk of pDDIs. Mechanical ventilation, dementia, and drug allergy noted in the medical documentation protected against them. Effects of heart failure, diabetes, and aPTT depended on phase of treatment and severity of pDDI. In conclusion, physicians should be vigilant to the possibility of pDDIs in patients harbouring factors that may increase their rate.
