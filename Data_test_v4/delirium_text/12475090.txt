12475090|t|Confusion/delirium following cataract surgery: an incidence study of 1-year duration.
12475090|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is frequently observed in clinical practice, particularly in medical and surgical wards and more so among patients at risk, especially elderly with preexisting central nervous system impairments. OBJECTIVE: Despite the severe consequences of delirium, epidemiological data relating to incidence of delirium following "minor" surgery are lacking. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the incidence of delirium following cataract surgery in community-dwelling patients. OUTCOME: For purposes of the present study, the Confusion Rating Scale was used. RESULTS: Of 296 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, 13 (4.4%) had had immediate postoperative delirium. The two variables that significantly differentiated between delirious and nondelirious patients were older age (82.1 vs. 73.06 years; p < .001) and more frequent use of benzodiazepine premedication (69% vs. 39.9%; p < .002). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the incidence of delirium following cataract surgery requires greater awareness, possibly changes in premedication, and a longer observation period in the very old.
