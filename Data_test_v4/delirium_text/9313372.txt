9313372|t|Agitation.
9313372|a|Agitation is a frequent clinical problem that adds significant morbidity to the hospital course. Agitation is usually part of an ambiguous constellation of cognitive and psychiatric symptoms, with a fluctuating clinical course. Observation of vastly different symptoms occurring at different times leads to misdiagnosis or underrecognition of serious underlying disorders. The most common causes of agitation include delirium, dementia, and acute psychosis. Risk factors attributable to hospitalization include pain, anxiety, and stressors endemic to intensive care. Agitated states may have multiple causes, and each potential contributor must be pursued and treated independently. Definitive diagnosis is dependent on a comprehensive history, patient observation, physical examination, and selective diagnostic studies.
