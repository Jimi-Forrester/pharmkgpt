The role of chronic immune inflammation in the pathogenesis of AD is becoming more and more important. AIM: To study the relationship among cognitive dysfunction, abnormal cellular immune function, neuroimaging results and poor prognostic factors in patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 62 hospitalized patients clinical diagnosed with AD who were admitted to our hospital from November 2015 to November 2020. Collect cognitive dysfunction performance characteristics, laboratory test data and neuroimaging data from medical records within 24 h of admission, including Mini Mental State Examination Scale score, drawing clock test, blood T lymphocyte subsets, and neutrophils and lymphocyte ratio (NLR), disturbance of consciousness, extrapyramidal symptoms, electroencephalogram (EEG) and head nucleus magnetic spectroscopy (MRS) and other data. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine independent prognostic factors. the modified Rankin scale (mRS) was used to determine whether the prognosis was good. The correlation between drug treatment and prognostic mRS score was tested by the rank sum test. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that abnormal cellular immune function, extrapyramidal symptoms, obvious disturbance of consciousness, abnormal EEG, increased NLR, abnormal MRS, and complicated pneumonia were related to the poor prognosis of AD patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the decrease in the proportion of T lymphocytes in the blood after abnormal cellular immune function (odd ratio: 2.078, 95% confidence interval: 1.156-3.986, P < 0.05) was an independent risk factor for predicting the poor prognosis of AD. The number of days of donepezil treatment to improve cognitive function was negatively correlated with mRS score (r = 0.578, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The decrease in the proportion of T lymphocytes may have predictive value for the poor prognosis of AD. It is recommended that the proportion of T lymphocytes < 55% is used as the cut-off threshold for predicting the poor prognosis of AD. The early and continuous drug treatment is associated with a good prognosis.
