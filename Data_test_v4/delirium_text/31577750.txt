31577750|t|Epileptiform EEG discharges and sevoflurane in children: Protocol of a systematic review and meta-analysis.
31577750|a|BACKGROUND: Epileptiform discharges in electroencephalogram (EEG) have been frequently reported in children undergoing sevoflurane mask induction. However, the incidence, characteristics and risk factors of these epileptiform patterns during sevoflurane anesthesia in children are poorly understood. The aim of this study is to systematically review the epileptic potential of sevoflurane in children with the EEG monitoring. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library (Central) will be systematically searched from inception to December 2018. The effect of sevoflurane on epileptic EEG patters in children will be studied. The primary outcome will be the incidence of epileptic discharges, the characteristics and risk factors of these epileptic discharges. Meta-analysis will be calculated using R software 3.5.1. RESULTS: This study will offer new evidence of the incidence, characteristics and risk factors of EEG epileptic discharges during sevoflurane anesthesia. CONCLUSION: The conclusion drawn from this systematic review will benefit the children with or without epilepsy undergoing sevoflurane anesthesia. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is unnecessary because data of individual patients will not be included and no privacy will be involved. The results of this review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal or a conference report. Amendments of the basic protocol will be documented in the comprehensive review. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: PROSPERO CRD 42019122008.
