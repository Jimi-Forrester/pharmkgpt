27106901|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline and dementia represent a key problem for public health as they heavily impair social functioning and independent living. The development of new strategies to support recommendations for patients and their caregivers may represent an outstanding step forward. AIMS: To describe the study protocol and methods of "My Mind Project: the effect of cognitive training for elderly" (Grant No. 154/GR-2009-1584108), which investigates, by the use of a multidisciplinary approach, the effects of a comprehensive cognitive training programme on performances in aged subjects with mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment and normal cognitive functioning. METHODS: The study is a prospective randomized intervention for the assessment of cognitive training effects in three groups of elderly subjects with different cognitive status. A total of 321 elderly people were enrolled in Marche Region, Italy. Each subject was randomly assigned to an experimental group or to a control group. Cognitive performances and biochemical blood markers have also been analysed before cognitive training (baseline), immediately after termination (follow-up 1), after 6 months (follow-up 2) and after 2 years (follow-up 3). DISCUSSION: The results will be useful to identify some efficient programmes for the enhancement of cognitive performance in elderly with and without cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: The application of a non-pharmacological approach in the treatment of elderly with cognitive disorders could have a profound impact on National Health Service.
