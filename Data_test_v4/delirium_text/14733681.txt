14733681|t|The last forty-eight hours of life in a Portuguese palliative care unit: does it differ from elsewhere?
14733681|a|The last few days of life have received significant attention in the literature. Reports have shown similarities and differences between programs. As a palliative care service in a cultural context that has not been reported on, we thought that an audit of our own experience in the care of patients in the last 48 hours of life and a comparison with other programs would be important. A prospective audit was designed to record data for four general domains: general demographic information, symptom prevalence, patient performance status, and perceived level of comfort. The inclusion criteria of patients were: older than 15 years of age (an admission criterion for patients of the unit), diagnosis of cancer, no active cancer-direct treatments, and patients who were on the unit for longer than 48 hours. The audit was completed when the 300th eligible patient died in the unit. Twenty-nine of 300 patients (9.6%) required sedation and the most common cause was delirium. Morphine was the most widely prescribed medication (85% of patients). The subcutaneous route was utilized extensively. Only 12% of the patients received parenteral fluids, usually via hypodermoclisis. Death was considered by staff to have been peaceful in 86% of cases. Our practice appears to mirror that of other palliative care groups.
