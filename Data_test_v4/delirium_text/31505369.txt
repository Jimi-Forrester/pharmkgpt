31505369|t|Promoting sleep and circadian health may prevent postoperative delirium: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.
31505369|a|This systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomized clinical trials aimed to clarify the efficacy of sleep and circadian interventions on preventing postoperative delirium. The search and screening identified 13 trials with great heterogeneity in interventions, surgery types as well as methods for evaluating delirium, sleep and circadian rhythms. Meta-analyses revealed that sleep and circadian interventions were associated with decreased incidences of postoperative delirium (pooled relative risk (RR) = 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.29 to 0.78) compared with control. The pooled incidences of delirium for patients receiving interventions and no intervention (control) were 8.6% and 20.7% respectively. Results of the trial sequential analysis supported the interpretation that sleep and circadian interventions significantly diminished delirium compared to control. Subgroup analysis found that interventions that showed positive efficacy on sleep and circadian outcomes (p < 0.001), but not those without improvements (p = 0.114) or without assessments (p = 0.858), were associated with decreased risk of delirium. Dexmedetomidine sedation (p < 0.001) and timed bright light exposure (p = 0.006) appeared to reduce postoperative delirium. In summary, currently only limited evidence suggests strategies targeted at sleep and circadian health as a useful way to prevent postoperative delirium.
