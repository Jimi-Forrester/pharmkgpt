Due to the facts that biological causes of AD are complex in addition to increasing rates of AD worldwide, a deeper understanding of AD etiology is required for AD treatment and diagnosis. METHODS: To identify molecular pathological alterations in AD brains, GSE36980 series containing microarray data samples from temporal cortex, frontal cortex and hippocampus were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and valid gene symbols were subjected to building a gene co-expression network by a bioinformatics tool known as differential regulation from differential co-expression (DCGL) software package. Then, a network-driven integrative analysis was performed to find significant genes and underlying biological terms. RESULTS: A total of 17088 unique genes were parsed into three independent differential co-expression networks. As a result, a small number of differentially co-regulated genes mostly in frontal and hippocampus lobs were detected as potential biomarkers related to AD brains. Ultimately differentially co-regulated genes were enriched in biological terms including response to lipid and fatty acid and pathways mainly signaling pathway such as G-protein signaling pathway and glutamate receptor groups II and III. By conducting co-expression analysis, our study identified multiple genes that may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. CONCLUSION: The study aimed to provide a systematic understanding of the potential relationships among these genes and it is hoped that it could aid in AD biomarker discovery.
