36699527|t|A transfer learning approach for multiclass classification of Alzheimer's disease using MRI images.
36699527|a|Alzheimer's is an acute degenerative disease affecting the elderly population all over the world. The detection of disease at an early stage in the absence of a large-scale annotated dataset is crucial to the clinical treatment for the prevention and early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we propose a transfer learning base approach to classify various stages of AD. The proposed model can distinguish between normal control (NC), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and AD. In this regard, we apply tissue segmentation to extract the gray matter from the MRI scans obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease National Initiative (ADNI) database. We utilize this gray matter to tune the pre-trained VGG architecture while freezing the features of the ImageNet database. It is achieved through the addition of a layer with step-wise freezing of the existing blocks in the network. It not only assists transfer learning but also contributes to learning new features efficiently. Extensive experiments are conducted and results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.
