34775541|t|A Novel Long-Noncoding RNA LncZFAS1 Prevents MPP+-Induced Neuroinflammation Through MIB1 Activation.
34775541|a|Parkinson's disease remains one of the leading neurodegenerative diseases in developed countries. Despite well-defined symptomology and pathology, the complexity of Parkinson's disease prevents a full understanding of its etiological mechanism. Mechanistically, alpha-synuclein misfolding and aggregation appear to be central for disease progression, but mitochondrial dysfunction, dysfunctional protein clearance and ubiquitin/proteasome systems, and neuroinflammation have also been associated with Parkinson's disease. Particularly, neuroinflammation, which was initially thought to be a side effect of Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, has now been recognized as driver of Parkinson's disease exacerbation. Next-generation sequencing has been used to identify a plethora of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) with important transcriptional regulatory functions. Moreover, a myriad of lncRNAs are known to be regulators of inflammatory signaling and neurodegenerative diseases, including IL-1beta secretion and Parkinson's disease. Here, LncZFAS1 was identified as a regulator of inflammasome activation, and pyroptosis in human neuroblast SH-SY5Y cells following MPP+ treatment, a common in vitro Parkinson's disease cell model. Mechanistically, TXNIP ubiquitination through MIB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation in neuroblasts. In contrast, MPP+ activates the NLPR3 inflammasome through miR590-3p upregulation and direct interference with MIB1-dependent TXNIP ubiquitination. LncZFAS overexpression inhibits this entire pathway through direct interference with miR590-3p, exposing a novel research idea regarding the mechanism of Parkinson's disease.
