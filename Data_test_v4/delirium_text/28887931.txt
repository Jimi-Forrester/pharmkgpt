28887931|t|Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Management: Techniques to Liberate from Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation and Manage Post-Intensive Care Unit Issues.
28887931|a|Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a life-saving technique when patients require pulmonary and/or cardiac support for days to weeks for recovery, bridge to decision, or transplantation. Due to complications associated with ECMO, it is best to stay on ECMO as little time as necessary. Foremost is weaning from ECMO, but the post-ECMO period recapitulates the entire field of critical care. Identified issues include (1) potential for systemic inflammatory response syndrome post-decannulation; (2) post-ECMO complications, such as deep vein thrombosis, wounds, renal failure, and stroke; (3) delirium; (4) posttraumatic stress disorder; (5) rehabilitation; and (6) end of life.
