10723170|t|[Clinical manifestation of frontotemporal dementia].
10723170|a|Frontotemporal dementia is a degenerative disease, usually of presenile onset, frequently with positive family history, whose main clinical features are early social and personal behavioral disturbances, cognitive defects mainly in attention, language and executive functions, personality disorders and blunt, unconcerned and subdepressive affect. Anatomic and functional neuroimaging shows atrophy and functional defects in anterior brain regions, and the EEG is persistently normal. Although frontotemporal dementia has been confounded with Alzheimer's disease for long time, it can be identified on clinical grounds in order to perform new therapeutic trials.
