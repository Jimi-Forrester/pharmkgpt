30928873|t|New benzyl pyridinium derivatives bearing 2,4-dioxochroman moiety as potent agents for treatment of Alzheimer's disease: Design, synthesis, biological evaluation, and docking study.
30928873|a|A new series of benzyl pyridinium-2,4-dioxochroman derivatives 7a-o was synthesized and evaluated as new anti-Alzheimer agents. Among the synthesized compounds, the compounds 7f and 7i exhibited the most potent anti-AChE and anti-BuChE activities, respectively. The kinetic study of the compound 7f revealed that this compound inhibited AChE in a mixed-type inhibition mode. Furthermore, the docking study of the compounds 7f and 7i showed that these compounds bound to both the catalytic site (CS) and peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE and BuChE, respectively. The compound 7f also exhibited a greater self-induced Abeta peptide aggregation inhibitory activity in compare to donepezil. Furthermore, the neuroprotective activity of this compound at 20 muM was comparable to that of the standard neuroprotective agent (quercetin).
