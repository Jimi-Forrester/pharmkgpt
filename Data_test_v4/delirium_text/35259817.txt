35259817|a|Graphene and graphene-based materials have the ability to induce stem cells to differentiate into neurons, which is necessary to overcome the current problems faced in the clinical treatment of spinal cord injury. This review summarizes the advantages of graphene and graphene-based materials (in particular, composite materials) in axonal repair after spinal cord injury. These materials have good histocompatibility, and mechanical and adsorption properties that can be targeted to improve the environment of axonal regeneration. They also have good conductivity, which allows them to make full use of electrical nerve signal stimulation in spinal cord tissue to promote axonal regeneration. Furthermore, they can be used as carriers of seed cells, trophic factors, and drugs in nerve tissue engineering scaffolds to provide a basis for constructing a local microenvironment after spinal cord injury. However, to achieve clinical adoption of graphene and graphene-based materials for the repair of spinal cord injury, further research is needed to reduce their toxicity.
