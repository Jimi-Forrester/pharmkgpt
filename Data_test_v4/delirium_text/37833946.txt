37833946|t|Impact of Hypoxia-Hyperoxia Exposures on Cardiometabolic Risk Factors and TMAO Levels in Patients with Metabolic Syndrome.
37833946|a|Along with the known risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) constituting metabolic syndrome (MS), the gut microbiome and some of its metabolites, in particular trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), are actively discussed. A prolonged stay under natural hypoxic conditions significantly and multi-directionally changes the ratio of gut microbiome strains and their metabolites in feces and blood, which is the basis for using hypoxia preconditioning for targeted effects on potential risk factors of CVD. A prospective randomized study included 65 patients (32 females) with MS and optimal medical therapy. Thirty-three patients underwent a course of 15 intermittent hypoxic-hyperoxic exposures (IHHE group). The other 32 patients underwent sham procedures (placebo group). Before and after the IHHE course, patients underwent liver elastometry, biochemical blood tests, and blood and fecal sampling for TMAO analysis (tandem mass spectrometry). No significant dynamics of TMAO were detected in both the IHHE and sham groups. In the subgroup of IHHE patients with baseline TMAO values above the reference (TMAO >= 5 mumol/l), there was a significant reduction in TMAO plasma levels. But the degree of reduction in total cholesterol (TCh), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and regression of liver steatosis index was more pronounced in patients with initially normal TMAO values. Despite significant interindividual variations, in the subgroup of IHHE patients with MS and high baseline TMAO values, there were more significant reductions in cardiometabolic and hepatic indicators of MS than in controls. More research is needed to objectify the prognostic role of TMAO and the possibilities of its correction using hypoxia adaptation techniques.
