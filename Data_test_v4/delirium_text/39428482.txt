39428482|a|Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease with a fatal outcome. There is accumulating evidence of a prominent role of glia in the pathology of HD, and we investigated this by conducting single nuclear RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) of human post mortem brain in four differentially affected regions; caudate nucleus, frontal cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. Across 127,205 nuclei from donors with HD and age/sex matched controls, we found heterogeneity of glia which is altered in HD. We describe prominent changes in the abundance of certain subtypes of astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocyte precursor cells and oligodendrocytes between HD and control samples, and these differences are widespread across brain regions. Furthermore, we highlight possible mechanisms that characterise the glial contribution to HD pathology including depletion of myelinating oligodendrocytes, an oligodendrocyte-specific upregulation of the calmodulin-dependent 3',5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 1 A (PDE1A) and an upregulation of molecular chaperones as a cross-glial signature and a potential adaptive response to the accumulation of mutant huntingtin (mHTT). Our results support the hypothesis that glia have an important role in the pathology of HD, and show that all types of glia are affected in the disease.
