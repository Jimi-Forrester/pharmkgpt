36831039|a|Despite being the most common treatment strategy in the management of atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular disease, classical statin therapy has certain disadvantages, including numerous side effects. In addition, a regimen with daily administration of the drug is hard to comply with. Thus, there is a need for modern and more efficient therapeutic strategies in CVD treatment. There is extensive evidence indicating that PCSK9 promotes atherogenesis through a variety of mechanisms. Thus, new treatment methods can be developed that prevent or alleviate atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by targeting PCSK9. Comprehensive understanding of its atherogenic properties is a necessary precondition for the establishment of new therapeutic strategies. In this review, we will summarize the available data on the role of PCSK9 in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. In the last section, we will consider existing PCSK9 inhibitors.
