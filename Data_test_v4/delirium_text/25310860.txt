25310860|a|Early detection of dementia is crucial because it is the time when intervention is most effective. Therefore, a simple and short test is necessary for primary mass screening in community-based medical facilities. We developed the Cognitive Assessment for Dementia, iPad version (CADi) which consists of 10 simple questions and is self-administered. In this paper we present a revised version which improves the detection of dementia. Two questions of the CADi were replaced in the latest version (CADi2). We examined the validity and reliability of the CADi2 in 27 Alzheimer's disease patients and age-matched healthy controls. The Alzheimer's disease patients had lower CADi2 scores and longer total response times to questions compared to the controls. The CADi2 had high sensitivity (0.85-0.96) and specificity (0.81-0.93), and showed significant correlations with existing standard neuropsychological tests. Cronbach's alpha analysis revealed moderate consistency of the CADi2. These results support the utility of the CADi2 for primary screening for dementia.
