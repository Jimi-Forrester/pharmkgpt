30116976|t|The Effects of Homocysteine on the Skeleton.
30116976|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Homocystinuria is a congenital metabolic disorder in which cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency results in a prominent increase in homocysteine (serum levels > 100 muM), causing mental retardation, atherosclerotic cerebral infarction, and osteoporosis accompanied by fragility fractures. Encountering a case with excessive homocysteinemia such as that seen in hereditary homocystinuria is unlikely during usual medical examinations. However, in individuals who have vitamin B or folate deficiency, serum homocysteine concentrations are known to increase. These individuals may also have a polymorphism in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, MTHFR (C677T: TT type), which regulates homocysteine metabolism. These changes in homocysteine levels may elicit symptoms resembling those of homocystinuria (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, osteoporosis). RECENT FINDINGS: High serum homocysteine has been shown to have detrimental effects on neural cells, vascular endothelial cells, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts. Homocysteine is also known to increase oxidative stress, disrupt cross-linking of collagen molecules, and increase levels of advanced glycation end products, which results in reduced bone strength through a mechanism that goes beyond low bone density and increased bone resorption. Therefore, high serum homocysteine may be regarded as a factor that can reduce both bone mass and impair bone quality. In this review, we outline the epidemiology and pathophysiology of osteoporosis associated with hyperhomocysteinemia.
