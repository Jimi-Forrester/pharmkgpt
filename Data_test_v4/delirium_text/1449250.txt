1449250|a|It has been proposed that early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) have different causes, with FAD due to a single dominant gene with disease onset before the sixth decade, whereas sporadic AD has a later onset and is not associated with a dominant pattern of inheritance. Given these differences, we questioned whether these etiologically distinct forms of AD also differ neuropsychologically. In this study we performed neuropsychological evaluations on patients from two well-documented families with FAD and a group of patients with sporadic AD. The groups were matched on global disease severity at entry. Two groups of education- and age-matched normal controls were recruited for comparison. The groups were analyzed for psychometric findings and pattern of deficits. Both patients with FAD and patients with sporadic AD showed a similar pattern of neuropsychological impairment relative to age-matched controls, i.e., mildly to moderately impaired verbal performance and concentration, severely slowed psychomotor speed, and severely impaired delayed recall of verbal material. There were no differences in pattern suggestive of disproportionately severe anomia, amnesia, agnosia, or apraxia in the early onset FAD group, as has been reported previously.
