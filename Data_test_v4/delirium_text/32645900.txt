32645900|t|Liquid Contact-Selective Potentiometric Sensor Based on Imprinted Polymeric Beads Towards 17beta-Estradiol Determination.
32645900|a|Novel potentiometric devices "ion-selective electrodes (ISEs)" were designed and characterized for the detection of 17beta-estradiol (EST) hormone. The selective membranes were based on the use of man-tailored biomimics (i.e., molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs)) as recognition ionophores. The synthesized MIPs include a functional monomer (methacrylic acid (MAA)) and a cross-linker (ethylene glycol dimethacrylic acid (EGDMA)) in their preparation. Changes in the membrane potential induced by the dissociated 17beta-estradiol were investigated in 50 mM CO32-/HCO3- buffer solution at pH 10.5. The ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) exhibited fast response and good sensitivity towards 17beta-estradiol with a limit of detection 1.5 microM over a linear range starts from 2.5 microM with an anionic response of 61.2 +- 1.2 mV/decade. The selectivity pattern of the proposed ISEs was also evaluated and revealed an enhanced selectivity towards EST over several phenolic compounds. Advantages revealed by the presented sensor (i.e., wide range of assay, enhanced accuracy and precision, low limit of detection, good selectivity, long-term potential stability, rapid response and long life-span and absence of any sample pretreatment steps) suggest its use in routine quality control/quality assurance tests. They were successfully applied to estradiol determination in biological fluids and in different pharmaceutical preparations collected from the local market.
