18597200|a|INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study is to describe the frequency and severity of behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPS) in a group of 125 patients diagnosed of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (DSM-IV-TR and NINCDSADRDA criteria). METHODS: The evaluation of the BPS was carried out using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI; Cummings et al., 1994). The sociodemographic and personal background data of the patients were gathered and the dementia stage was established with the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS Reisberg, 1982). RESULTS: A total of 122 patients (98%) presented BPS, with an average of five symptoms per patient. Frequency of presentation was the following: apathy (75%), irritability (66%), depression (60%), agitation (55%), anxiety (54%), aberrant motor activity (47%), delirium (38%), sleeping disorders (36%), disinhibition (29%), eating disorders (28%), hallucinations (20%) and euphoria (4%). CONCLUSIONS: These results show the high incidence of BPS in AD patients and point to the necessity and importance of treating these disorders appropriately.
