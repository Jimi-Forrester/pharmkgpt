39837723|a|OBJECTIVE: The treatment and prevention of delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) have gained significant importance in patient care in recent years. Some studies have linked delirium with increased risks of mortality, prolonged hospital stay, and more days of mechanical ventilation. This study aims to analyse the use of psychotropic drugs initiated in the ICU and their continuation upon hospital discharge, as well as to evaluate their contribution to polypharmacy and associated adverse clinical effects. METHOD: A multicentre prospective observational case study was designed, focusing on patients over 18 years old admitted to the ICU and treated with psychotropic drugs. Data on demographics, variables related to admission and psychotropic drug treatment, as well as clinical outcomes and adverse effects, will be collected. Among other variables, the frequency of psychotropic treatments initiated in the ICU and continued upon discharge from the ICU and the hospital will be measured. Data collection will be performed through review of electronic medical records and prescription programmes, and IBM SPSS 20.0 statistical package will be used for analysis. DISCUSSION: Delirium is common in ICU patients and is associated with long-term negative consequences. Although antipsychotics are used to treat delirium, their prolonged use can have adverse effects, and their continuation after ICU discharge contributes to polypharmacy. This study aims to provide information on the use of psychotropic drugs initiated in the ICU and their continuation upon discharge, with the goal of identifying opportunities for intervention and reducing unnecessary use of these medications.
