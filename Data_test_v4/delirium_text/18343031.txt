18343031|a|To seek for a new valid biomarker using non-invasive specimens for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we carried out the detection of amyloid beta (Abeta) protein in urine. Ten-millilitre urine samples were first sedimented with trichloroacetic acid, and the pellets were resuspended for further analysis by Western blotting with anti-Abeta antibody. The detection sensitivity of the method was 40pg/ml. Rates of subjects positive for monomeric Abeta according to their clinical dementia rating (CDR) were 11.1% for CDR 0, 62.5% for CDR 0.5, 83.3% for CDR 1, 54.5% for CDR 2 and 0% for CDR 3. A single Abeta band relative to the CDR score reflects an alteration in the production, solubility and clearance of Abeta in the brain. Thus, the method could be used as both a diagnostic and monitoring tool in assessing AD and MCI patients during disease-modifying therapies.
