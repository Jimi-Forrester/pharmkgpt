36834835|t|Zebrafish as a Potential Model for Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Focus on Toxic Metals Implications.
36834835|a|In the last century, industrial activities increased and caused multiple health problems for humans and animals. At this moment, heavy metals are considered the most harmful substances for their effects on organisms and humans. The impact of these toxic metals, which have no biological role, poses a considerable threat and is associated with several health problems. Heavy metals can interfere with metabolic processes and can sometimes act as pseudo-elements. The zebrafish is an animal model progressively used to expose the toxic effects of diverse compounds and to find treatments for different devastating diseases that human beings are currently facing. This review aims to analyse and discuss the value of zebrafish as animal models used in neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly in terms of the benefits of animal models and the limitations that exist.
