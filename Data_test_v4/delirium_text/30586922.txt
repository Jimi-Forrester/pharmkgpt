30586922|t|Oncogenic Role of Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 8 (TNFAIP8).
30586922|a|Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced protein 8 (TNFAIP8) is a founding member of the TIPE family, which also includes TNFAIP8-like 1 (TIPE1), TNFAIP8-like 2 (TIPE2), and TNFAIP8-like 3 (TIPE3) proteins. Expression of TNFAIP8 is strongly associated with the development of various cancers including cancer of the prostate, liver, lung, breast, colon, esophagus, ovary, cervix, pancreas, and others. In human cancers, TNFAIP8 promotes cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, drug resistance, autophagy, and tumorigenesis by inhibition of cell apoptosis. In order to better understand the molecular aspects, biological functions, and potential roles of TNFAIP8 in carcinogenesis, in this review, we focused on the expression, regulation, structural aspects, modifications/interactions, and oncogenic role of TNFAIP8 proteins in human cancers.
