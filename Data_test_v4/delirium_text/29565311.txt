29565311|t|Bioactive Peptides from Cartilage Protein Hydrolysate of Spotless Smoothhound and Their Antioxidant Activity In Vitro.
29565311|a|In the experiment, crude proteins from spotless smoothhound (Mustelus griseus), cartilages were isolated by HCl-Guanidine buffer, and its hydrolysate was prepared using trypsin at pH 8.0, 40  C with a total enzyme dose of 2.5%. Subsequently, three antioxidant peptides were purified from the hydrolysate using membrane ultrafiltration, anion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, and reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequences of isolated peptides were identified as Gly-Ala-Glu-Arg-Pro (MCPE-A); Gly-Glu-Arg-Glu-Ala-Asn-Val-Met (MCPE-B); and Ala-Glu-Val-Gly (MCPE-C) with molecular weights of 528.57, 905.00, and 374.40 Da, respectively, using protein amino acid sequence analyzer and mass spectrum. MCPE-A, MCPE-B and MCPE-C exhibited good scavenging activities on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals (DPPH ) (EC50 3.73, 1.87, and 2.30 mg/mL, respectively), hydroxyl radicals (HO ) (EC50 0.25, 0.34, and 0.06 mg/mL, respectively), 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid radicals (ABTS+ ) (EC50 0.10, 0.05, and 0.07 mg/mL, respectively) and superoxide anion radicals ( O 2 -  ) (EC50 0.09, 0.33, and 0.18 mg/mL, respectively). MCPE-B showed similar inhibiting ability on lipid peroxidation with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) in a linoleic acid model system. Furthermore, MCPE-A, MCPE-B, and MCPE-C could protect H2O2-induced HepG2 cells from oxidative stress by decreasing the content of malonaldehyde (MDA) and increasing the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and glutathione reductase (GSH-Rx). Glu, Gly, Met, and Pro in their sequences and low molecular weight could be attributed to the antioxidant activities of three isolated peptides. These results suggested that GAERP (MCPE-A), GEREANVM (MCPE-B), and AEVG (MCPE-C) from cartilage protein hydrolysate of spotless smoothhound might serve as potential antioxidants and be used in the pharmaceutical and health food industries.
