35645970|t|Mechanisms for Cognitive Impairment in Epilepsy: Moving Beyond Seizures.
35645970|a|There has been a major emphasis on defining the role of seizures in the causation of cognitive impairments like memory deficits in epilepsy. Here we focus on an alternative hypothesis behind these deficits, emphasizing the mechanisms of information processing underlying healthy cognition characterized as rate, temporal and population coding. We discuss the role of the underlying etiology of epilepsy in altering neural networks thereby leading to both the propensity for seizures and the associated cognitive impairments. In addition, we address potential treatments that can recover the network function in the context of a diseased brain, thereby improving both seizure and cognitive outcomes simultaneously. This review shows the importance of moving beyond seizures and approaching the deficits from a system-level perspective with the guidance of network neuroscience.
