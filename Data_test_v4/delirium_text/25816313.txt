25816313|t|alpha7 Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-specific antibody induces inflammation and amyloid beta42 accumulation in the mouse brain to impair memory.
25816313|a|Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) expressed in the brain are involved in regulating cognitive functions, as well as inflammatory reactions. Their density is decreased upon Alzheimer disease accompanied by accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta42), memory deficit and neuroinflammation. Previously we found that alpha7 nAChR-specific antibody induced pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 production in U373 glioblastoma cells and that such antibodies were present in the blood of humans. We raised a hypothesis that alpha7 nAChR-specific antibody can cause neuroinflammation when penetrating the brain. To test this, C57Bl/6 mice were either immunized with extracellular domain of alpha7 nAChR subunit alpha7(1-208) or injected with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 5 months. We studied their behavior and the presence of alpha3, alpha4, alpha7, beta2 and beta4 nAChR subunits, Abeta40 and Abeta42 and activated astrocytes in the brain by sandwich ELISA and confocal microscopy. It was found that either LPS injections or immunizations with alpha7(1-208) resulted in region-specific decrease of alpha7 and alpha4beta2 and increase of alpha3beta4 nAChRs, accumulation of Abeta42 and activated astrocytes in the brain of mice and worsening of their episodic memory. Intravenously transferred alpha7 nAChR-specific-antibodies penetrated the brain parenchyma of mice pre-injected with LPS. Our data demonstrate that (1) neuroinflammation is sufficient to provoke the decrease of alpha7 and alpha4beta2 nAChRs, Abeta42 accumulation and memory impairment in mice and (2) alpha7(1-208) nAChR-specific antibodies can cause inflammation within the brain resulting in the symptoms typical for Alzheimer disease.
