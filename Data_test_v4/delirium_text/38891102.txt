38891102|t|Associations of Plasma Glutamatergic Metabolites with Alpha Desynchronization during Cognitive Interference and Working Memory Tasks in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease.
38891102|a|Electroencephalogram (EEG) studies have suggested compensatory brain overactivation in cognitively healthy (CH) older adults with pathological beta-amyloid(Abeta42)/tau ratios during working memory and interference processing. However, the association between glutamatergic metabolites and brain activation proxied by EEG signals has not been thoroughly investigated. We aim to determine the involvement of these metabolites in EEG signaling. We focused on CH older adults classified under (1) normal CSF Abeta42/tau ratios (CH-NATs) and (2) pathological Abeta42/tau ratios (CH-PATs). We measured plasma glutamine, glutamate, pyroglutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid concentrations using tandem mass spectrometry and conducted a correlational analysis with alpha frequency event-related desynchronization (ERD). Under the N-back working memory paradigm, CH-NATs presented negative correlations (r = ~-0.74--0.96, p = 0.0001-0.0414) between pyroglutamate and alpha ERD but positive correlations (r = ~0.82-0.95, p = 0.0003-0.0119) between glutamine and alpha ERD. Under Stroop interference testing, CH-NATs generated negative correlations between glutamine and left temporal alpha ERD (r = -0.96, p = 0.037 and r = -0.97, p = 0.027). Our study demonstrated that glutamine and pyroglutamate levels were associated with EEG activity only in CH-NATs. These results suggest cognitively healthy adults with amyloid/tau pathology experience subtle metabolic dysfunction that may influence EEG signaling during cognitive challenge. A longitudinal follow-up study with a larger sample size is needed to validate these pilot studies.
