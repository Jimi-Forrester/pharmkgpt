37251243|a|Despite recent encouraging pharmaceutical and technical breakthroughs in neurosurgical critical care, traumatic brain injury (TBI)-related mortality and morbidity remain substantial clinical issues. Medication of statins was revealed to enhance outcomes following TBI in animal research. In addition to their main role of decreasing serum cholesterol, statins decrease inflammation and enhance cerebral blood flow. However, research on the efficacy of statins in TBI is still limited. This systematic review was conducted to determine the efficacy of statins in enhancing the clinical outcomes of TBI individuals, and specifically investigate the optimal dose and form of statins. The databases of PubMed, DOAJ, EBSCO, and Cochrane were extensively researched. The date of publication within the last fifteen years was the inclusion criterion. Meta-analyses, clinical trials, and randomized controlled trials were prioritized forms of research publications. Ambiguous remarks, irrelevant correlations to the main issue, or a focus on disorders other than TBI were the exclusion criteria. Thirteen research were included in this study. Simvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin were the main form of statins discussed in this study. Enhancement of the Glasgow Coma Scale, survival rates, hospital length of stay, and cognitive outcomes were revealed in this study. This study suggests either simvastatin 40 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg, or rosuvastatin 20 mg for 10 days as the optimal therapeutic forms and doses to be applied in the management of TBI. Pre-TBI statin use was linked to lower risk of mortality in TBI individuals compared to nonusers, whereas statin discontinuation was linked to an increase in mortality.
