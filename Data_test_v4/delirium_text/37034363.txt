37034363|t|The Anxiety and Depression in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Treating with Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
37034363|a|Objective: Anxiety and depression are associated with the risk of illness, presence of physical symptoms, and poor health in the COVID-19 epidemic. Our aim is to assess the severity of anxiety and depression in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and methods: The study is a longitudinal, hospital-based survey study including 102 RA patients receiving disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs with a mean of 55,2+-11,9 years. Demographic data, educational status, marital status, employment status, economic status, patients with psychiatric disorders (with the use of prescribed medication for treatment), and medications were recorded. The severity of depression and anxiety were evaluated with the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventory at the first and second visit of the follow-up during the pandemic period. Results: The mean Beck depression inventory score was found to be higher in the conventional synthetic DMARDs group than in biological DMARDs (12,1+-8,2 vs 11,6+-9,2, p=0,554). 46 (65,7%) had mild to severe anxiety symptoms in RA patients treated with conventional synthetic DMARDs, on the first visit. There was no significant difference in anxiety and depression status between the first and second visits. The difference in anxiety and depression symptoms between RA patients receiving conventional synthetic and biological DMARDs does not attain statistical significance. Also, no significant differences were found in anxiety and depression scores in the comparisons for gender, education, marital, working, and economic status. Conclusions: The severity of depression and anxiety were higher in RA patients receiving conventional synthetic DMARDs and biological DMARDs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, RA patients are likely to experience anxiety and depression during the period of the pandemic.
