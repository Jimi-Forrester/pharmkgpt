38334678|t|Glymphatic System Pathology and Neuroinflammation as Two Risk Factors of Neurodegeneration.
38334678|a|The key to the effective treatment of neurodegenerative disorders is a thorough understanding of their pathomechanism. Neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation are mutually propelling brain processes. An impairment of glymphatic system function in neurodegeneration contributes to the progression of pathological processes. The question arises as to how neuroinflammation and the glymphatic system are related. This review highlights the direct and indirect influence of these two seemingly independent processes. Protein aggregates, a characteristic feature of neurodegeneration, are correlated with glymphatic clearance and neuroinflammation. Glial cells cannot be overlooked when considering the neuroinflammatory processes. Astrocytes are essential for the effective functioning of the glymphatic system and play a crucial role in the inflammatory responses in the central nervous system. It is imperative to acknowledge the significance of AQP4, a protein that exhibits a high degree of polarization in astrocytes and is crucial for the functioning of the glymphatic system. AQP4 influences inflammatory processes that have not yet been clearly delineated. Another interesting issue is the gut-brain axis and microbiome, which potentially impact the discussed processes. A discussion of the correlation between the functioning of the glymphatic system and neuroinflammation may contribute to exploring the pathomechanism of neurodegeneration.
