35730702|a|Autophagy is one of the degradation pathways to remove proteins or damaged organelles in cells that plays an important role in neuroprotection. Different stages of autophagy are regulated by autophagy-related genes, and many molecules such as transcription factor EB (TFEB) are involved. The complete autophagy process plays an important role in maintaining the dynamic balance of autophagy and is crucial to the homeostasis of intracellular substance and energy metabolism. Autophagy balance is disrupted in neurodegenerative diseases, accounting for a variety of degeneration disorders. These impairments can be alleviated or treated by the regulation of autophagy through molecules such as TFEB.
