28929833|a|We investigated the expression of the Alzheimer's disease-related metabolic brain pattern (ADRP) in 18F-FDG-PET scans of 44 controls, 27 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who did not convert to Alzheimer's disease (AD) after five or more years of clinical follow-up, 95 MCI patients who did develop AD dementia on clinical follow-up, and 55 patients with mild-to-moderate AD. The ADRP showed good sensitivity (84%) and specificity (86%) for MCI-converters when compared to controls, but limited specificity when compared to MCI non-converters (66%). Assessment of 18F-FDG-PET scans on a case-by-case basis using the ADRP may be useful for quantifying disease progression.
