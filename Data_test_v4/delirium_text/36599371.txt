36599371|t|Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score Is Predictive of Perioperative Adverse Events in Operatively Treated Thoracic and Lumbar Fractures.
36599371|a|STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of patients with surgically treated thoracolumbar fractures. PURPOSE: This study aimed to describe the incidence of adverse events (AEs) after surgical stabilization of thoracolumbar spine injuries and to identify predictive factors for the occurrence of AEs. OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Thoracolumbar spine fractures are frequently present in patients with blunt trauma and are associated with significant morbidity. AEs can occur due to the initial spinal injury or secondary to surgical treatment. There is a lack of emphasis in the literature on the AEs that can occur after operative management of thoracolumbar fractures. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 199 patients with surgically treated thoracolumbar fractures operated between January 2007 and January 2018. The potential risk factors for the development of AEs as well as the development of common complications were evaluated by univariate analysis, and a multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors predictive of the above. RESULTS: The overall rate of AEs was 46.7%; 83 patients (41.7%) had nonsurgical AEs, whereas 24 (12.1%) had surgical adverse events. The most common AEs were urinary tract infections in 43 patients (21.6%), and hospital-acquired pneumonia in 21 patients (10.6%). On multivariate logistic regression, a Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity (TLICS) score of 8-10 (odds ratio [OR], 6.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.33-17.51), the presence of polytrauma (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.17-5.99), and undergoing open surgery (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.09-4.88) were significant risk factors for AEs. The absence of neurological deficit was associated with a lower rate of AEs (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.31-0.70). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests the presence of polytrauma, preoperative American Spinal Injury Association score, and TLICS score are predictive of AEs in patients with surgically treated thoracolumbar fractures. The results might also suggest a role for minimally invasive surgical methods in reducing AEs in these patients.
