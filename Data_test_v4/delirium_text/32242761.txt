32242761|t|Wnt/beta-Catenin Signaling in Neural Stem Cell Homeostasis and Neurological Diseases.
32242761|a|Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs) maintain the ability of self-renewal and differentiation and compose the complex nervous system. Wnt signaling is thought to control the balance of NSC proliferation and differentiation via the transcriptional coactivator beta-catenin during brain development and adult tissue homeostasis. Disruption of Wnt signaling may result in developmental defects and neurological diseases. Here, we summarize recent findings of the roles of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling components in NSC homeostasis for the regulation of functional brain circuits. We also suggest that the potential role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling might lead to new therapeutic strategies for neurological diseases, including, but not limited to, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression.
