35167685|t|What Is an Aging-Related Disease? An Epidemiological Perspective.
35167685|a|There are no established or standardized definitions of aging-related disease. Data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019 were used to model the relationship between age and incidence of diseases. Clustering analysis identified 4 groups of noncommunicable diseases: Group A diseases with an exponential increase in incidence with age; Group B diseases with an exponential increase in incidence that usually peaked in late life which then declined or plateaued at the oldest ages; and Groups C and D diseases with an onset in earlier life and where incidence was stable or decreased in old age. From an epidemiological perspective, Group A diseases are "aging-related diseases" because there is an exponential association between age and incidence, and the slope of the incidence curves remains positive throughout old age. These included the major noncommunicable diseases dementia, stroke, and ischemic heart disease. Whether any of the other diseases are aging-related is uncertain because their incidence either does not change or more often decreases in old age. Only biological studies can determine how the aging process contributes to any of these diseases and this may lead to a reclassification of disease on the basis of whether they are directly caused by or are in continuity with the biological changes of aging. In the absence of this mechanistic data, we propose the term "aging-related disease" should be used with precision based on epidemiological evidence.
