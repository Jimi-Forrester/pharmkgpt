24013702|a|BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. AF incidence increases with age. AF ablation procedures are routinely performed under deep sedation with propofol. The purpose of the study was to evaluate if propofol deep sedation during AF ablation is safe in elderly patients. METHODS: Four hundred one consecutive patients (mean age, 61.4 +- 11.1 years; range, 20-82; 66.3 % men) who were presented to our institution for ablation of symptomatic AF were enrolled. Patients were divided into three groups: Patients in group A were <=50 years old; patients in group B were 51-74 years old; and patients in group C were >=75 years old. Procedures were performed under deep sedation with propofol, midazolam, and piritramide. SaO2, electrocardiogram, arterial blood pressure, and arterial blood gas were monitored throughout the procedure. Sedation-related complications, intraprocedural complications, and other adverse events were evaluated. Fisher exact or chi (2) tests were used for comparison of adverse events and complications among groups. Analysis of variance was used to compare sedation- and procedure-related parameters. RESULTS: Fifty-three (13.2 %) elderly patients were in group C and were compared to 73 (18.2 %) patients in group A and 275 (68.8 %) in group B. No significant differences in sedation-related or intraprocedural complications were seen (group A, 1.4 %; group B, 1.1 %; group C, 3.7 %; p = 0.336). Despite a significantly greater drop in systolic blood pressure in under sedation in group C (group A, 15.5 +- 9.5 mmHg; group B, 18.9 +- 16.3 mmHg; group C, 32.3 +- 15.5 mmHg; p < 0.001), no prolonged hypotension was observed. The rate of other adverse events (delirium, respiratory infection, renal failure) was significantly higher in group C (9.4 %), compared to group A (0 %) and group B (2.2 %; p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Deep sedation with propofol and midazolam during AF ablation did not result in an increased rate in sedation-related complications in elderly patients. Similarly, the rate of procedural complications was not significantly different among the study groups. The rate of respiratory infections and renal failure was significantly higher in the elderly. All adverse events were treated successfully without any remaining sequelae.
