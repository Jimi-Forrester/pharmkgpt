36556188|t|New Strategies to Optimize Hemodynamics for Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy.
36556188|a|Background: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Hemodynamic dysfunction plays a significant role in the incidence and mortality of SAE. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the relationship between hemodynamic indicators and SAE. Methods: 9033 patients with sepsis 3.0 were selected in a prospective study cohort. The LASSO regression model was used to select characteristic variables and remove the collinearity between them. In addition, a generalized additive model was used to find the optimal hemodynamic index value for patients with SAE. Multivariate logistic regression models, propensity matching scores, inverse probability weighting, and doubly robust estimation confirmed the reliability of the study results (i.e., the optimal hemodynamic indicators targeting patients with SAE). Results: A mean arterial pressure >= 65 mmHg, systolic blood pressure >= 90 mmHg, and lactate levels <= 3.5 mmol/L decrease the incidence of SAE, whereas a mean arterial pressure >= 59 mmHg and lactate levels <= 4.5 mmol/L decrease the 28-day mortality in patients with SAE. Conclusions: The hemodynamic indices of patients with SAE should be maintained at certain levels to reduce the incidence and mortality in patients with SAE, such that the mean arterial pressure is >=65 mmHg, lactate levels are <=3.5 mmol/L, and systolic blood pressure is >=90 mmHg. These hemodynamic indicators should be targeted in patients with SAE.
