27853185|t|Phosphorylation induces distinct alpha-synuclein strain formation.
27853185|a|Synucleinopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases associated with alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) aggregation. Recently, increasing evidence has demonstrated the existence of different structural characteristics or 'strains' of alpha-Syn, supporting the concept that synucleinopathies share several common features with prion diseases and possibly explaining how a single protein results in different clinical phenotypes within synucleinopathies. In earlier studies, the different strains were generated through the regulation of solution conditions, temperature, or repetitive seeded fibrillization in vitro. Here, we synthesize homogeneous alpha-Syn phosphorylated at serine 129 (pS129 alpha-Syn), which is highly associated with the pathological changes, and demonstrate that phosphorylation at Ser129 induces alpha-Syn to form a distinct strain with different structures, propagation properties, and higher cytotoxicity compared with the wild-type alpha-Syn. The results are the first demonstration that post-translational modification of alpha-Syn can induce different strain formation, offering a new mechanism for strain formation.
