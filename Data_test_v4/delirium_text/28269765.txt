28269765|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) consist of ARIA-E (with effusion or edema) and ARIA-H (hemosiderin deposits [HDs]). OBJECTIVES: To address accurate ascertainment of ARIA identification, a final magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reading was performed on patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease randomized to bapineuzumab IV or placebo during two Phase III trials (APOE e4 allele carriers or noncarriers). METHODS: Final MRI central review consisted of a systematic sequential locked, adjudicated read in 1,331 APOE e4 noncarriers and 1,121 carriers by independent neuroradiologists. Assessment of ARIA-E, ARIA-H, intracerebral hemorrhages, and age-related white matter changes is described. RESULTS: In the Final Read, treatment-emergent ARIA-E were identified in 242 patients including 76 additional cases not noted previously in real time. Overall, incidence proportion of ARIA-E was higher in carriers (active 21.2%; placebo 1.1%) than in noncarriers (pooled active 11.3%; placebo 0.6%), and was more often identified in homozygote APOE e4 carriers than heterozygotes (34.5% versus 16.9%). Incidence rate of ARIA-E increased with increased dose in noncarriers. Frequency of ARIA-E first episodes was highest after the first and second bapineuzumab infusion and declined after repeated infusions. Incidence of total HDs <10 mm (cerebral microhemorrhages) was higher in active groups versus placebo. CONCLUSION: ARIA was detected more often on MRI scans when every scan was reviewed by trained neuroradiologists and results adjudicated. There was increased incidence of ARIA-E in bapineuzumab-treated carriers who had a microhemorrhage at baseline. ARIA-E was a risk factor for incident ARIA-H and late onset ARIA-E was milder radiologically. Age-related white matter changes did not progress during the study.
