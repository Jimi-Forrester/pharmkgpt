39490400|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are a type of common chronic progressive disorders characterized by progressive damage to specific cell populations in the nervous system, ultimately leading to disability or death. Effective treatments for these diseases are still lacking, due to a limited understanding of their pathogeneses, which involve multiple cellular and molecular pathways. The triggering of an immune response is a common feature in neurodegenerative disorders. A critical challenge is the intricate interplay between neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and immune responses, which are not yet fully characterized. In recent years, the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon gene (STING) pathway, a crucial immune response for intracellular DNA sensing, has gradually gained attention. However, the specific roles of this pathway within cellular types such as immune cells, glial and neuronal cells, and its contribution to ND pathogenesis, remain not fully elucidated. In this review, we systematically explore how the cGAS-STING signaling links various cell types with related cellular effector pathways under the context of NDs for multifaceted therapeutic directions. We emphasize the discovery of condition-dependent cellular heterogeneity in the cGAS-STING pathway, which is integral for understanding the diverse cellular responses and potential therapeutic targets. Additionally, we review the pathogenic role of cGAS-STING activation in Parkinson's disease, ataxia-telangiectasia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We focus on the complex bidirectional roles of the cGAS-STING pathway in Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis, revealing their double-edged nature in disease progression. The objective of this review is to elucidate the pivotal role of the cGAS-STING pathway in ND pathogenesis and catalyze new insights for facilitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
