28663759|t|New challenges of geriatric cardiology: from clinical to preclinical research.
28663759|a|The field of geriatric cardiology reflects the evolving medical approaches tailored to address the needs of the growing population of oldest old with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The burden of CVD is expected to increase particularly for the most common types of chronic heart disease of the elderly including coronary artery disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. In this context of dramatic demographic changes, geriatric cardiologists are facing important challenges. In this review, we outline the basic concepts of geriatric cardiology and describe these challenges as well as the unmet needs around this discipline with also a focus on the translation from basic research.
