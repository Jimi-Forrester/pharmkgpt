37221588|a|BACKGROUND: Survival prediction is important in cancer patients receiving hospice care. Palliative prognostic index (PPI) and palliative prognostic (PaP) scores have been used to predict survival in cancer patients. However, cancer primary site with metastatic status, enteral feeding tubes, Foley catheter, tracheostomy, and treatment interventions are not considered in aforementioned tools. The study aimed to investigate the cancer features and potential clinical factors other than PPI and PaP to predict patient survival. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study for cancer patients admitted to a hospice ward between January 2021 and December 2021. We examined the correlation of PPI and PaP scores with survival time since hospice ward admission. Multiple linear regression was used to test the potential clinical factors other than PPI and PaP for predicting survival. RESULTS: A total of 160 patients were enrolled. The correlation coefficients for PPI and PaP scores with survival time were -0.305 and -0.352 (both p < 0.001), but the predictabilities were only marginal at 0.087 and 0.118, respectively. In multiple regression, liver metastasis was an independent poor prognostic factor as adjusted by PPI (beta = -8.495, p = 0.013) or PaP score (beta = -7.139, p = 0.034), while feeding gastrostomy or jejunostomy were found to prolong survival as adjusted by PPI (beta = 24.461, p < 0.001) or PaP score (beta = 27.419, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Association between PPI and PaP with patient survival in cancer patients at their terminal stages is low. The presence of liver metastases is a poor survival factor independent of PPI and PaP score.
