38300375|a|Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are minute lipid-bilayer sacs discharged by cells, encompassing a diverse array of proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. The identification of EVs as pivotal agents in intercellular communication has sparked compelling research pathways in the realms of cell biology and neurodegenerative diseases. Utilizing EVs for medicinal reasons has garnered interest due to the adaptability of EV-mediated communication. EVs can be classified based on their physical characteristics, biochemical composition, or cell of origin following purification. This review delves into the primary sub-types of EVs, providing an overview of the biogenesis of each type. Additionally, it explores the diverse environmental conditions triggering EV release and the originating cells, including stem cells and those from the Central Nervous System. Within the brain, EVs play a pivotal role as essential mediators of intercellular communication, significantly impacting synaptic plasticity, brain development, and the etiology of neurological diseases. Their potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications in various brain-related conditions are underscored, given their ability to carry specific cargo. Specially engineered EVs hold promise for treating diverse diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. This study primarily emphasizes the diagnostic and potential therapeutic uses of EVs in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease, Huntington's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Prions disease. It also summarizes innovative techniques for detecting EVs in the brain, suggesting that EVs could serve as non-invasive biomarkers for early detection, disease monitoring, and prognosis in neurological disorders.
