32341776|a|BACKGROUND: D-mannose exhibits strong anti-inflammatory properties, but whether it has beneficial effects on preventing and treating osteoporosis remains unknown. METHODS: Female, 12-month-old senile C57BL6/J mice (s-Man group) and 8-week-old ovariectomized C57BL6/J mice (OVX-Man group) were treated with D-mannose in drinking water for 2 months (six mice/group). Microcomputed tomography analysis and hematoxylin and eosin staining were performed to investigate the effect of D-mannose on attenuation of bone loss. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining of tissue sections, flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and gut microbiome biodiversity tests were used to explore the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: D-mannose-induced marked increases in cortical bone volume and trabecular bone microarchitecture in the s-Man and OVX-Man group compared with that in the s-CTRL (senile control) and OVX group, respectively. Moreover, D-mannose downregulated osteoclastogenesis-related cytokines in the bone marrow and expanded regulatory T cells in the spleen of mice. Furthermore, D-mannose reconstructed the gut microbiota and changed the metabolite composition. CONCLUSION: D-mannose attenuated bone loss induced by senility and estrogen deficiency in mice, and this effect may be mediated by D-mannose-induced proliferation of regulatory T cells and gut microbiota-dependent anti-inflammatory effects.
