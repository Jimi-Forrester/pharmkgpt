37899286|t|Relative Risks for Dementia among Individuals with Glaucoma: A Meta-Analysis of Observational Cohort Studies.
37899286|a|Purpose: To investigate the relative risks (RRs) for dementia among individuals with glaucoma. Methods: We conducted a search of PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane databases for observational cohort studies examining the association between glaucoma and dementia until March 2023. Two authors independently screened all titles and abstracts according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Pooled RR and 95% CIs were generated using random-effect models. Results: The meta-analysis included 18 cohort studies conducted in 8 countries and involving 4,975,325 individuals. The pooled RR for the association between glaucoma and all-cause dementia was 1.31 (95% CI, 1.10 - 1.57; I2 = 95%). The pooled RRs for the associations of open-angle glaucoma (OAG) with Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and Parkinson's disease were 1.29 (95% CI, 1.01 - 1.65; I2 = 96%) and 1.23 (95% CI, 0.68 - 2.24; I2 = 73%), respectively. The pooled RRs for the associations of angle-closure glaucoma (ACG) with all-cause dementia and AD were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.75 - 1.28; I2 = 17%) and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.42 - 1.67; I2 = 16%), respectively. No evidence of publication bias was detected in the Begg and Mazumbar adjusted rank correlation test (P = 0.47). Conclusions: Based on current observational cohort studies, there is evidence supporting that glaucoma is a risk factor for dementia in the adult population.
