7435055|t|[Constitutional-somatotopic factors in the clinical picture of alcoholic psychoses and obvious signs of paranoid schizophrenia].
7435055|a|The clinical and anthropometrical methods were used to study the constitutional traits of 240 patients with psychotic forms of alcoholism and 300 patients with paranoid schizophrenia. The somatotypes were assessed by the Rees-Eysenck method. The prepsychotic parameters of alcoholism and the structure of alcoholic delirium were studied in 78 patients, as well as the manifest symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia. The study demonstrated a syndromal modified expressivity in exo- and endogenous processes, depending upon the somatotypical constitution. Simple syndromes were more frequently found in patients with a pyknic somatotype, and complicated in normosthenical and asthenic types of body built. It is suggested that the constitutional and somatotypical factors be included into the multifactorial analysis of the syndrome structure and prognosis in the development of the psychosis.
