23805940|t|Tuning reactivity of diphenylpropynone derivatives with metal-associated amyloid-beta species via structural modifications.
23805940|a|A diphenylpropynone derivative, DPP2, has been recently demonstrated to target metal-associated amyloid-beta (metal-Abeta) species implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). DPP2 was shown to interact with metal-Abeta species and subsequently control Abeta aggregation (reactivity) in vitro; however, its cytotoxicity has limited further biological applications. In order to improve reactivity toward Abeta species and lower cytotoxicity, along with gaining an understanding of a structure-reactivity-cytotoxicity relationship, we designed, prepared, and characterized a series of small molecules (C1/C2, P1/P2, and PA1/PA2) as structurally modified DPP2 analogues. A similar metal binding site to that of DPP2 was contained in these compounds while their structures were varied to afford different interactions and reactivities with metal ions, Abeta species, and metal-Abeta species. Distinct reactivities of our chemical family toward in vitro Abeta aggregation in the absence and presence of metal ions were observed. Among our chemical series, the compound (C2) with a relatively rigid backbone and a dimethylamino group was observed to noticeably regulate both metal-free and metal-mediated Abeta aggregation to different extents. Using our compounds, cell viability was significantly improved, compared to that with DPP2. Lastly, modifications on the DPP framework maintained the structural properties for potential blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Overall, our studies demonstrated that structural variations adjacent to the metal binding site of DPP2 could govern different metal binding properties, interactions with Abeta and metal-Abeta species, reactivity toward metal-free and metal-induced Abeta aggregation, and cytotoxicity of the compounds, establishing a structure-reactivity-cytotoxicity relationship. This information could help gain insight into structural optimization for developing nontoxic chemical reagents toward targeting metal-Abeta species and modulating their reactivity in biological systems.
