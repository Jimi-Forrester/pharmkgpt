28649579|t|Computerized vs. Paper-Pencil Assessment of Cognitive Change following Acute Ischemic Stroke.
28649579|a|IMPORTANCE: Cognitive impairment is common among patients with stroke and early recognition can optimize patient care. OBJECTIVE: To determine the validity of computerized cognitive testing in an adult population with acute ischemic stroke. DESIGN: Validation study comparing computerized vs paper-pencil assessments at two time points three months apart in a stroke unit. MAIN OUTCOME: Correlation analyses between computerized (using CogState Brief Battery) and paper-pencil testing (using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment) both at study entry and follow-up visits. RESULTS: We found moderate to strong significant correlations between the two instruments at study entry and follow-up sessions. Executive dysfunctions were the main cognitive changes. Test-retest correlations were strong. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The CogState Brief Battery is a valid alternative for clinicians who wish to measure cognitive skills following acute ischemic stroke. Limitations of computerized testing are discussed.
