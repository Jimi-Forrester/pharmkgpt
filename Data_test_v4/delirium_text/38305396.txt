38305396|t|Marine-Derived Compounds: A Powerful Platform for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
38305396|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating form of dementia that primarily affects cholinergic neurons in the brain, significantly reducing an individual's capacity for learning and creative skills and ultimately resulting in an inability to carry out even basic daily tasks. As the elderly population is exponentially increasing, the disease has become a significant concern for society. Therefore, neuroprotective substances have garnered considerable interest in addressing this universal issue. Studies have shown that oxidative damage to neurons contributes to the pathophysiological processes underlying AD progression. In AD, tau phosphorylation and glutamate excitotoxicity may play essential roles, but no permanent cure for AD is available. The existing therapies only manage the early symptoms of AD and often come with numerous side effects and toxicities. To address these challenges, researchers have turned to nature and explored various sources such as plants, animals, and marine organisms. Many historic holy books from different cultures emphasize that adding marine compounds to the regular diet enhances brain function and mitigates its decline. Consequently, researchers have devoted significant time to identifying potentially active neuroprotective substances from marine sources. Marine-derived compounds are gaining recognition due to their abundant supply of diverse chemical compounds with biological and pharmacological potential and unique mechanisms of action. Several studies have reported that plants exhibit multitarget potential in treating AD. In light of this, the current study focuses on marine-derived components with excellent potential for treating this neurodegenerative disease.
