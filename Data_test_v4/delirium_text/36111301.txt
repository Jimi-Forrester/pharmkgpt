36111301|a|Objectives: N-linoleyltyrosine (NITyr) showed mild effects in preclinical studies. The research discussed the effect of NITyr on a high-fat diet (HFD) induced obese (DIO) mice, and preliminarily explored its mechanism. Methods: The DIO mice were established by feeding an HFD for 12 weeks and subsequently administrated orally with NITyr (30, 60 and 100 mg/kg) for four weeks. The indexes of serum and liver samples were determined by ELISA kit. The pathological status of adipose and liver were detected by HE staining. The factors related to energy and lipid metabolism were measured via western blot. Results: NITyr at 60 and 100 mg/kg/day suppressed the weight gain without affecting water and food intake. Accordingly, NITyr reduced adipose weight and the area of individual adipocytes and increased the number of adipocytes. Moreover, NITyr didn't affect the appetite-related indexes such as ghrelin, peptide YY and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Besides, NITyr didn't affect other organ coefficients except for the liver. Correspondingly, NITyr reduced alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, yet didn't influence IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels, and the liver injury. The levels of triacylglycerol (TG), total cholesterol (TC), glucose, insulin, adiponectin and leptin in serum were assessed to evaluate the effect of NITyr on glucose and lipid metabolism. NITyr decreased the levels of TG, TC and glucose, and didn't affect insulin, adiponectin and leptin levels. Meanwhile, NITyr up-regulated p-AMPK and the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) expressions, and down-regulated PPAR, FAS and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) expressions.Overall, NITyr suppressed lipid accumulation via improving lipid and glucose metabolism involving CB1 and CB2 receptors.
