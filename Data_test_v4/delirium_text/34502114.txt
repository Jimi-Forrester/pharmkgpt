34502114|t|Gender-Dependent Deregulation of Linear and Circular RNA Variants of HOMER1 in the Entorhinal Cortex of Alzheimer's Disease.
34502114|a|The HOMER1 gene is involved in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Recent studies show that circular RNA derived from HOMER1 (circHOMER1) expression is altered in some Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain regions. In addition, HOMER1 messenger (mRNA) levels have been associated with beta-Amyloid (Abeta) deposits in brain cortical regions. Our aim was to measure the expression levels of HOMER1 circRNAs and their linear forms in the human AD entorhinal cortex. First, we showed downregulation of HOMER1B/C and HOMER1A mRNA and hsa_circ_0006916 and hsa_circ_0073127 levels in AD female cases compared to controls by RT-qPCR. A positive correlation was observed between HOMER1B/C, HOMER1A mRNA, and hsa_circ_0073128 with HOMER1B/C protein only in females. Global average area of Abeta deposits in entorhinal cortex samples was negatively correlated with HOMER1B/C, HOMER1A mRNA, and hsa_circ_0073127 in both genders. Furthermore, no differences in DNA methylation were found in two regions of HOMER1 promoter between AD cases and controls. To sum up, we demonstrate that linear and circular RNA variants of HOMER1 are downregulated in the entorhinal cortex of female patients with AD. These results add to the notion that HOMER1 and its circular forms could be playing a female-specific role in the pathogenesis of AD.
