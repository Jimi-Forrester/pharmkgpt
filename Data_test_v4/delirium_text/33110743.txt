33110743|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019, which was declared a pandemic virus by the world health organization on March 11 in 2020. COVID-19 is an infectious disease and almost leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, the virus epidemic is a big problem for humanity healthy and can lead die in special people with background diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, chronic heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and kidney failure. Different medical, social, and engineering methods have been proposed to face the disease include treatment, detection, prevention, and prediction approaches. METHODS: We propose a taxonomy tree to investigate the disease confronting methods and their negative and positive effects. Our work consists of a case study and systematic literature review (SLR) to evaluate the proposed methods against the virus outbreak and disease epidemic. RESULTS: Our experimental results and observations demonstrate the impact of the proposed medical, prevention, detection, prediction, and social methods for facing the spread of COVID-19 from December 2019 to July 2020. CONCLUSION: Our case study can help people have more information about the disease and its impact on humanity healthy and illustrate effective self-caring methods and therapies.
