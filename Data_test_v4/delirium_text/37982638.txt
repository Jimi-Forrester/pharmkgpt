37982638|t|Steroid sulfatase inhibitors and sulfated C19 steroids for proteotoxicity-related diseases: a patent spotlight.
37982638|a|Aging and proteotoxicity go hand in hand. Inhibiting proteotoxicity has been proposed to extend lifespan. This invention describes a new strategy to limit proteotoxicity and to extend the lifespan. Loss of function of sul-2, the Caenorhabditis elegans steroid sulfatase, elevates the pool of sulfated steroid hormones, increases longevity and ameliorates protein aggregation diseases. The present invention provides a group of molecules for use in the prevention of aging-associated proteotoxicity caused by protein aggregation diseases and/or to increase the lifespan of a eukaryotic organism. These molecules are either steroid sulfatase inhibitors or sulfated C19 steroids, both of which reproduce the phenotype of sul-2 mutants. One particular representative example is STX-64. Potential applications of the claims have been demonstrated in animal models of Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease.
