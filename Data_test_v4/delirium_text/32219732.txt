32219732|t|Estimation of the Incremental Cumulative Cost of HIV Compared with a Non-HIV Population.
32219732|a|OBJECTIVE: There are limited real-world data comparing cumulative incremental healthcare costs in people living with HIV (PLWH) and those without HIV. This study evaluated all-cause cumulative and incremental costs in PLWH in the US using a matched-cohort design. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective, multi-year, cross-sectional analysis evaluated annual costs from 2013 to 2017, and projected cumulative costs of HIV from age 25 to 69 years. IQVIA's commercial adjudicated claims database was used to identify patients with HIV and match them with patients without HIV (controls). Cumulative all-cause costs were derived from the health plan-allowed costs incurred from ages 25-69 years. Undiscounted, discounted, and incremental costs between PLWH and non-HIV populations were reported in 2017 US dollars (US$), and annual all-cause costs were estimated for each year by 10-year age bands. RESULTS: A total of 25,261, 24,134, 31,654, 35,374, and 29,039 PLWH and 75,783, 72,402, 94,962, 106,122, and 87,117 matched controls were identified in the years 2013 through 2017, respectively. The mean undiscounted cumulative costs were $1,840,554 for PLWH and $285,065 for controls, an incremental cost difference of $1,555,489, while the mean discounted cumulative cost for PLWH was $983,897 compared with $133,340 for controls, an incremental cost difference of $850,557. Mean all-cause annual and cumulative costs were up to seven times higher for PLWH compared with controls. There was a trend for costs to increase each year with increasing age. LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: While cumulative all-cause cost estimates only approximate total cost burden for any given patient, and the results of this study may not be generalizable to all population subgroups, this is one of the first US studies to examine annual and cumulative costs in a real-world cohort of commercially insured PLWH compared with a population without HIV. In this large, representative sample of commercially insured US adults with HIV, PLWH had substantially higher all-cause cumulative costs than individuals without HIV.
