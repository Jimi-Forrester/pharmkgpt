35345251|a|BACKGROUND: Respiratory failure is one of the most common complications following cardiac surgery. Although noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has been an effective treatment, it has a high rate of intolerance. Both remifentanil and dexmedetomidine are used as sedatives in cardiac surgery (CS) patients with NIV intolerance. However, no randomized controlled trials have compared the effects of these drugs in relieving the intolerance. METHODS: REDNIVI will be a multicenter, prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial carried out in six clinical sites in China. Subjects with NIV intolerance will be randomized to receive remifentanil or dexmedetomidine in a ratio of 1:1. Primary outcomes of intolerance remission rate at different timings (15 minutes, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 hours after initiation of treatment) and 72 h average remission rate will be determined. In addition, secondary outcomes such as mortality, duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, duration of mechanical ventilation (MV), the need for endotracheal intubation, hemodynamic changes, and delirium incidence will also be determined. CONCLUSIONS: This trial will provide evidence to determine the effects of remifentanil and dexmedetomidine in patients with NIV intolerance after cardiac surgery. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study has been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04734418).
