30149948|a|INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a change in the management of the risk of delirium in an orthogeriatric unit. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective, comparative, non-randomised study of two cohorts of patients. One cohort (control group) treated with standard therapy with tramadol rescue and diazepam and another cohort (experimental group) treated with rescue with morphine at low doses and short half-life benzodiazepines as well as preventive treatment with neuroleptics in patients at high risk. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were included (42 in the control group and 43 in the experimental group). Mean age: 85 (71-105). Twenty-nine patients (34%) had an episode of delirium during the current admission, 16 patients (38%) in the control group and 13 patients (30%) in the experimental group respectively (P=.498). The mean duration of delirium in the 29 patients who presented it was 5.3 days. This duration in the control group was 6.6 days and in the experimental group 3.8 days (P=.031). In the group of patients who had previous delirium, a lower incidence of delirium was seen during the current admission in the experimental group (80% vs 17% P=.036). CONCLUSIONS: Experimental treatment has been effective since a trend to a lower incidence of delirium has been observed. In the patients who have suffered an episode of delirium, the treatment served to decrease its duration with statistically significant differences.
