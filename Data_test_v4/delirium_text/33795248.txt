33795248|t|Update on medical management of acute hip fracture.
33795248|a|Morbidity and mortality rates associated with acute hip fracture remain high. Over the past decade, the management of hip fracture has shifted to emphasize prompt surgical treatment, multimodal analgesia to reduce opioid use, and incorporation of enhanced recovery pathways. Preoperative evaluation focuses on acutely correctable problems, with the understanding that delaying surgery may worsen the outcome. Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism, treatment of preoperative anemia and acute kidney injury, and cardiac stabilization are important measures to reduce morbidity. Multimodal analgesia incorporating regional anesthesia techniques may help prevent delirium and facilitate early participation in physical therapy to reduce complications.
