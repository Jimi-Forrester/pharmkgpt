39048031|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, which is characterized by the accumulation and aggregation of amyloid in brain. Neuronostatin (NST) is an endogenous peptide hormone that participates in many fundamental neuronal processes. However, the metabolism and function of NST in neurons of AD mice are not known. In this study, by combining the structural analyses, primary cultures, knockout cells, and various assessments, the behavior, histopathology, brain-wide expression and cellular signaling pathways in the APP/PS1 mice were investigated. It was found that NST directly bound to GPR107, which was primarily expressed in neurons. NST modulated the neuronal survivability and neurite outgrowth induced by Abeta via GPR107 in neurons. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of NST attenuated learning and memory abilities, reduced the synaptic protein levels of hippocampus, but improved amyloid plaques in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. NST modulated glucose metabolism of hypothalamus-hippocampus-cortex axis in APP/PS1 mice and decreased ATP levels via the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in response to Abeta, suppressed energetic metabolism, and mitochondrial function in neurons via GPR107/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway. In summary, our findings suggest that NST regulates neuronal function and brain energetic metabolism in AD mice via the GPR107/PKA signaling pathway, which can be a promising target for the treatment of AD.
