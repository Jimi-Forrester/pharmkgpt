28423675|a|Morphine tolerance is a clinical challenge in pain management. Emerging evidence suggests that microRNA (miRNA) plays a regulatory role in the development of morphine tolerance. miR-219-5p (miR-219) targets calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II gamma (CaMKIIgamma) to activate central pain sensitization via N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-219-5p attenuates morphine tolerance by targeting CaMKIIgamma. We found that the expression of miR-219-5p was decreased significantly after chronic morphine treatment. Overexpression of miR-219-5p by lentivirus injection prevents the development of morphine tolerance. CaMKIIgamma, the target gene of miR-219-5p was downregulated by overexpression of miR-219-5p both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we found that lentiviral-mediated miR-219-5p decreased the expression of NMDA receptor subunit 1 (NR1), leading to attenuation of morphine tolerance. Overall, the data demonstrate that miR-219-5p plays a crucial role in alleviating morphine tolerance by inhibiting the CaMKII/NMDA receptor pathway. Overexpression of miR-219-5p may be a potential strategy to ameliorate morphine tolerance.
