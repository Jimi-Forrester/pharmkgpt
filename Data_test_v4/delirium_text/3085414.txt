3085414|t|[Various indices of immunity in patients with alcoholic delirium].
3085414|a|Seventy-four patients with alcoholic delirium were studied for the parameters of the T- and B-system of immunity and natural resistance. The patients versus normal donors presented a statistically significant decrease in the number and proliferative activity of T-lymphocytes, an increase in IgA, as well as a reduction in levels of lysozyme, complement and bactericidal activity of the serum. The presence of immunological shifts after the completion of detoxifying therapy suggests that treatment should be continued even after the disappearance of psychic disturbances.
