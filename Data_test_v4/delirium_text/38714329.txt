38714329|a|End-of-life (EOL) care has been a common option for patients with terminal medical conditions such as cancers. However, the utilization of EOL care in Alzheimer disease and other dementing conditions have become available relatively recently. As the end-stage dementia approaches, the clinicians and caregivers become faced with numerous clinical challenges-delirium, neuropbehavioral symptoms, the patient's inability to communicate pain and associated discomfort, food refusal, and so on. In addition to providing quality clinical care to the EOL patients, clinicians should pay special attention to their families, assuring that their loved ones will receive supportive measures to improve quality of life (QOL).
