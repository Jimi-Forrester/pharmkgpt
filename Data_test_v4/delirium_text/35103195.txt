35103195|t|Monitored Anesthesia Care and Soft-Tissue Infiltration With Local Anesthesia for Short Cephalomedullary Nailing in Medically Complex Patients: A Technique Guide.
35103195|a|Hip fractures are increasingly common and often occur in patients with complex medical comorbidities. There remains a need for a safer anesthetic option for these patients for the operative repair of their injury other than general or neuraxial anesthesia. At our institution, for medically complex and physiologically tenuous patients, we perform Monitored Anesthesia Care and Soft-Tissue Infiltration of Local Anesthetic (MAC-STILA) when performing percutaneous fixation techniques for hip fractures. We describe our technique here.
