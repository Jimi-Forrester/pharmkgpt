29226942|a|BACKGROUND: Several randomized trials have demonstrated superiority of memantine-cholinesterase inhibitor combination therapy in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, yet a recent publication reported no additional benefit of add-on memantine therapy compared to donepezil alone. OBJECTIVES: In this post hoc analysis, we sought to re-evaluate the results from the DOMINO study using common statistical tools and to apply the statistical models used in the DOMINO study to a pooled data set of 24- to 28-week randomized trials of memantine in patients with moderate to severe AD in order to explore the robustness of the primary findings from the DOMINO study. DESIGN: DOMINO study: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Current Controlled Trial number, ISRCTN49545035); Memantine Clinical Trial Program: Pooled analysis from four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. SETTING: DOMINO study: United Kingdom; Memantine Clinical Trial Program: Multinational. PARTICIPANTS: DOMINO study: 295 participants enrolled during the period of February 2008 to March 2010; Memantine Clinical Trial Program: 1417 participants enrolled between August 1998 and January 2008. MEASUREMENTS: In the DOMINO study, the co-primary outcome measures were scores on the Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination and the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale; Neuropsychiatric Inventory was a secondary measure. In the Memantine Clinical Trial Program, outcome measures included the Severe Impairment Battery, the 19-item Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living scale, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and a 4-Domain Composite Index (Z-score; a post hoc assessment). RESULTS: Both the pooled analysis of the Memantine Clinical Trial Program and the re-assessment of the DOMINO study with common statistical tools showed that adding memantine to donepezil therapy is associated with benefits across multiple clinical domains. CONCLUSIONS: The current analyses suggest that the results of the DOMINO study do not contradict previous studies which investigated the combined effects of memantine-cholinesterase inhibitor treatment.
