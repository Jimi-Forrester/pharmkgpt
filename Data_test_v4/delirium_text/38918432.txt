38918432|a|In this study, we analyzed the factors influencing the development of delayed encephalopathy in patients with acute carbon monoxide poisoning (ACOP) (DEACMP) following conventional treatment such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). Between January 2012 and January 2022, we retrospectively analyzed 775 patients with ACOP, who were admitted to the Second Department of Rehabilitation Medicine and received HBOT in the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University. These patients were divided into the non-DEACMP and DEACMP groups based on their follow-up; we then compared the general data, clinical characteristics, admission examination, and treatment between the two groups to identify risk factors for the development of DEACMP. The DEACMP group comprised of 168 cases, while the non-DEACMP group consisted of 607 cases. Univariate analysis showed that there were 20 possible prognostic factors in the non-DEACMP and DEACMP groups. The results of multivariable regression analyses suggested that the occurrence of DEACMP was significantly correlated with advanced age, the combination of multiple medical histories, the duration of CO exposure, the duration of coma, poisoning degree, the Interval between ACOP and the first HBOT, the total number of HBOTs, and the combination with rehabilitation treatment. DEACMP patients who are older, have more comorbidities, prolonged CO exposure, prolonged coma, severe intoxication, long intervals between ACOP and the first HBOT, fewer HBOT treatments, and who are not treated with a combination of rehabilitative therapies have a poor prognosis.
