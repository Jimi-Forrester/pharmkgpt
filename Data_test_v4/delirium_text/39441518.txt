39441518|t|Survey on current clinical practice in geriatric oncology: the individual experience in five European Cancer Centers.
39441518|a|PURPOSE: To gather information from clinicians on how geriatric oncology models of care have emerged in different European countries and describe current practice in this clinical area. METHODS: A semi-structured online interview was performed, exploring aspects related to implementation, perceived quality of care, and professional satisfaction. RESULTS: The centers participating in this interview showed significant differences in terms of resource allocation, team members, components of the comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), and CGA-driven interventions. High levels of professional satisfaction were expressed by all participants. This was deemed a consequence of a perception of increased quality in the provision of care and enhanced educational and academic opportunities. CONCLUSION: Interdisciplinary models of care in geriatric oncology, regardless of implementation details, seem to provide grounds for increased professional satisfaction and perception of better provision of quality of care. These characteristics could support promoting and further developing similar collaborations on a wider scale.
