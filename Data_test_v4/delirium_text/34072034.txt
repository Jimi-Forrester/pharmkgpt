34072034|t|Discovery of Association Rules Patterns and Prevalence of Comorbidities in Adult Patients Hospitalized with Mental and Behavioral Disorders.
34072034|a|The objectives of this study were to identify the prevalence of comorbidities of mental and behavioral disorders and to identify the association rules related to comorbidities as a way to improve patient management efficiently. We extracted comorbidities of 20,690 patients (>=19 years old) whose principal diagnosis was a mental disorder from the Korean National Hospital Discharge In-depth Injury Survey (KNHDS) between 2006 and 2016. Association rules analysis between comorbid diseases using the Apriori algorithm was used. The prevalence of comorbidities in all patients was 61.98%. The frequent comorbidities of mental and behavioral disorders were analyzed in the order of hypertensive diseases (11.06%), mood disorders (8.34%), diabetes mellitus (7.98%), and diseases of esophagus, stomach, and duodenum (7.04%). Nine major association pathways were analyzed. Significant pathways were analyzed as diabetes mellitus and hypertensive diseases (IS scale = 0.386), hypertensive diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases (IS scale = 0.240). The association pathway of diabetes mellitus and hypertensive diseases was common in subgroups of mental and behavioral disorders, excluding mood disorders and disorders of adult personality and behavior. By monitoring related diseases based on major patterns, it can predict comorbid diseases in advance, improve the efficiency of managing patients with mental and behavioral disorders, and furthermore, it can be used to establish related health policies.
