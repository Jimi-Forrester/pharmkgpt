39125925|t|Activity of N-Chlorotaurine against Periodontal Pathogens.
39125925|a|Dental plaque bacteria play an important role in the pathogenicity of periodontitis and peri-implantitis. Therefore, antimicrobial agents are one means of treatment. N-chlorotaurine (NCT) as an endogenous well-tolerated topical antiseptic could be of advantage for this purpose. Accordingly, its microbicidal activity against some dental plaque bacteria was investigated at therapeutic concentrations in vitro. In quantitative killing assays, the activity of NCT against planktonic bacteria and against biofilms grown for 48 h on implantation screws was tested. Electron microscopy was used to demonstrate the formation of biofilm and its morphological changes. The killing of planktonic bacteria of all tested species, namely Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus cristatus, Rothia aeria, and Capnocytophaga ochracea, was shown within 10-20 min by 1% NCT in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline at 37  C. Bacteria grown on screws for 24 h were inactivated by 1% NCT after 15-20 min as well, but the formation of biofilm on the screws was visible in electron microscopy not before 48 h. The killing of biofilms by 1% NCT was demonstrated after 30 min (streptococci) and 40 min (R. aeria). As expected, NCT has broad activity against dental plaque bacteria as well and should be further investigated on its clinical efficacy in periodontitis and peri-implantitis.
