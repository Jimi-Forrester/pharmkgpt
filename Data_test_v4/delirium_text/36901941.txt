36901941|a|Increased angiogenesis, especially the pathological type, has been documented in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains, and it is considered to be activated due to a vascular dysfunction-mediated hypoxic condition. To understand the role of the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide in angiogenesis, we analyzed its effects on the brains of young APP transgenic AD model mice. Immunostaining results revealed that Abeta was mainly localized intracellularly, with very few immunopositive vessels, and there was no extracellular deposition at this age. Solanum tuberosum lectin staining demonstrated that compared to their wild-type littermates, the vessel number was only increased in the cortex of J20 mice. CD105 staining also showed an increased number of new vessels in the cortex, some of which were partially positive for collagen4. Real-time PCR results demonstrated that placental growth factor (PlGF) and angiopoietin 2 (AngII) mRNA were increased in both the cortex and hippocampus of J20 mice compared to their wild-type littermates. However, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA did not change. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the increased expression of PlGF and AngII in the cortex of the J20 mice. Neuronal cells were positive for PlGF and AngII. Treatment of a neural stem cell line (NMW7) with synthetic Abeta1-42 directly increased the expression of PlGF and AngII, at mRNA levels, and AngII at protein levels. Thus, these pilot data indicate that pathological angiogenesis exists in AD brains due to the direct effects of early Abeta accumulation, suggesting that the Abeta peptide regulates angiogenesis through PlGF and AngII expression.
