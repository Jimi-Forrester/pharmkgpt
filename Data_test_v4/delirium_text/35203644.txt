35203644|t|The Spectrum of Acute Cerebrovascular Disease in Patients with COVID-19.
35203644|a|(1) Background: COVID-19 infection is responsible for the ongoing pandemic and acute cerebrovascular disease (CVD) has been observed in COVID-19 patients. (2) Methods: We conducted a retrospective, observational study of hospitalized adult patients admitted to our hospital with SARS-CoV-2 and acute cerebrovascular disease. All clinical data were reviewed including epidemiology, clinical features, laboratory data, neuroradiological findings, hospital management and course from 32 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 management with acute cerebrovascular disease. (3) Results: Acute CVD with COVID-19 was associated with higher NIH stroke scale on discharge compared to non-COVID-19 CVDs. Seizures complicated the hospital course in 16% of COVID-19 patients with CVD. The majority of the acute CVDs were ischemic (81%) in nature followed by hemorrhagic (22%). Acute CVD with COVID-19 resulted in average hospital stays greater than twice that of the control group (13 days in COVID-19, 5 days in control). Acute CVD with COVID-19 patients had worse clinical outcomes with 31% patient deaths and 6% discharged to hospice. In the control group, 6% of patients died. (4) Conclusions: Acute CVD associated with COVID-19 tends to be more complicated with unique and adverse clinical phenotype, longer hospital admissions, and worse clinical outcomes.
