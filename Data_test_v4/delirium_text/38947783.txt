38947783|a|Improving the sensitivity of the fluorescence method for the detection of bioactive molecules is crucial in biochemical analysis. In this work, an ultrasensitive sensing strategy was constructed for the detection of ascorbic acid (AA) using high-quality 3-mercaptopropionic acid-capped CdSe/CdS/ZnS quantum dots (MPA-CdSe/CdS/ZnS QDs) as the fluorescent probe. The prepared water-soluble QDs exhibited a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) of up to 96%. Further, the fluorescence intensity of the QDs was intensively quenched through the dynamic quenching of Ag+ ions due to an efficient photoinduced electron transfer progress. While the existence of AA before adding Ag+ ions, Ag+ ions were reduced. Thus, the interaction of the QDs and Ag+ ions was destroyed, which led to the fluorescence distinct recovery. The detection limit of AA could be as low as 0.2 nM using this sensing system. Additionally, most relevant small molecules and physiological ions had no influence on the analysis of AA. Satisfactory results were obtained in orange beverages, showing its great potential as a meaningful platform for highly sensitive and selective AA sensing for clinical analysis.
