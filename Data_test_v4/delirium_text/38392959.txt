38392959|t|The Effects of Intensive Rehabilitation Combined with Thiamine Treatment on Cognitive Recovery in a Case of Non-Alcoholic Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome.
38392959|a|Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome (WKS) is a severe neurological disorder resulting from thiamine deficiency, commonly associated with alcohol consumption but also stemming from dietary imbalances or other clinical conditions. Cognitive deficits, affecting memory and executive functions, pose a serious concern, with partial recovery often not complete. A 28-year-old woman underwent surgery for acute necrotizing hemorrhagic pancreatitis, leading to admission for post-acute intensive treatment due to prolonged bed rest syndrome. Clinical examinations revealed sensory-motor neuropathy, denervation in the active phase, mammillary body hyperintensity, and cognitive impairment. The patient exhibited poor orientation, lacked awareness of her clinical condition, and experienced impaired nonverbal memory, practical constructive issues, and planning difficulties-consistent with WKS. The patient received high-dose thiamine (300 mg TDS), coupled with daily physiokinesitherapy and occupational therapy. A final neuropsychological evaluation three months later showed substantial remission of executive and memory difficulties, improved spatial-temporal orientation, and enhanced awareness. The complex case required timely multidisciplinary intervention for accurate diagnosis and effective rehabilitation. The patient experienced rapid clinical improvement and cognitive recovery with high-dose thiamine and physiotherapy.
