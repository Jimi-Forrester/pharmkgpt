34102650|t|Trends of complications in patients with Parkinson's disease in seven major cities of China from 2016 to 2019.
34102650|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder involving both motor and nonmotor symptoms. Multimorbidity acts synergistically to heighten the risk of adverse outcomes for patients with PD. Its complications have a major impact on the clinical management of PD. The present retrospective and multicenter study was first performed to describe the epidemiological characteristics of PD patients and assess the incidence of complications. The outpatient prescriptions for PD therapy were collected from hospitals in Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Tianjin and Zhengzhou of China over a 40-day period per year, from the first half of 2016 to that of 2019. The survey covered the characteristics and representative complications of the study population. A total of 103 674 outpatient prescriptions for PD treatment from different graded hospitals of China were collected for final data analysis. It showed that 78.15% of PD patients were prescribed in the neurology department. 95.05% of the outpatient prescriptions were from general hospitals. We found that the overall PD prevalence was 0.47%, among which 52.96% of them were men. In addition, 82.10% of PD suffers were older than 60 years and 83.70% of them had complications. The top five highest frequencies of nonmotor complications in PD patients were sleep disorders, Alzheimer's disease, depression, lower urinary tract symptoms and constipation, with the proportions of 6.79, 3.87, 3.72, 3.32 and 2.40%, respectively. Meanwhile, the proportions of sleep disorders, Alzheimer's disease, and constipation were gradually increasing from 2016 to 2019. The characteristics of PD patients and the incidence of its complications were evaluated in the present prescription survey. These updated data provide evidence for further implementation of PD management.
