33827488|a|BACKGROUND: Hospital anxiety caused by strabismus surgery has an unpleasant and disturbing feeling for both children and their parents. This study aimed to determine the effect of viewing a self-produced audio-visual animation introduction on preoperative anxiety and emergence agitation of pediatric patients undergoing strabismus surgery. METHODS: In this prospective randomized study, 1 hundred children scheduled for strabismus surgery with aged 3 ~ 6 years. The children were randomly divided into 2 groups (n = 50 for each), Group A: using a self-produced audio-visual animation introduction; Group C: controlled group without audio-visual animation introduction. Children's preoperative anxiety was determined by the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS) at different time points: the night before surgery(T1), at pre-anesthetic holding room(T2), and just before anesthesia induction(T3). The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to record the anxiety of parents at T1,T2 and T3. The incidence and the degree of emergence agitation were recorded. RESULTS: The mYPAS scores at T2 and T3 were higher than T1(p < 0.05) in both groups. The average score of mYPAS in Group A was significantly lower than in Group C at T2 and T3(p < 0.05). The STAI scores in Group A at T2 and T3 were significantly lower than in Group C(p < 0.05). The incidence of agitation in Group A was lower than that in Group C(p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings, viewing a self-produced audio-visual animation can effectively alleviate the preoperative anxiety for both children and their parents in pediatric strabismus surgery, and it was effective for reducing emergence agitation as well. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was prospectively registered before patient enrollment at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (Clinical Trial Number: ChiCTR1900025116 , Date: 08/12/2019).
