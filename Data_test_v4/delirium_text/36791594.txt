36791594|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common distressing symptom observed in patients with terminal respiratory diseases and is treated with antipsychotic medications such as haloperidol. Its management is difficult, especially in palliative home care, because its administration is limited to oral or injection methods. Recently, the blonanserin transdermal patch was developed as the first antipsychotic percutaneous agent. After it became available, we recognized its potential for the management of delirium and the alleviation of uncontrolled dyspnea in clinical practice. Thus, this study aimed to assess its efficacy in patients with terminal respiratory diseases. METHODS: This retrospective study included 113 patients with respiratory diseases who were cared for at home. The efficacy was evaluated through the prevalence of terminal delirium before and after its treatment initiation for uncontrolled dyspnea. RESULTS: Blonanserin transdermal patch treatment for uncontrolled dyspnea improved the prevalence and severity of terminal delirium (from 70.4% to 16.3%, p < 0.001) and reduced the number of doctors' visits to patients' homes within a week before their death (from 4.0 to 3.0, p = 0.086). A sub-group analysis of 23 patients with interstitial pneumonia revealed that the treatment prevented dyspnea progression by inhibiting terminal delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Blonanserin transdermal patch performed similarly to haloperidol, as previously reported, for managing terminal delirium. Our study suggests that a blonanserin transdermal patch potentially prevents terminal delirium and alleviates uncontrolled dyspnea in patients with respiratory diseases. Our findings encourage clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of blonanserin transdermal patches for patients with terminal illnesses.
