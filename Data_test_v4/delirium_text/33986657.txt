33986657|a|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements of neurogranin (Ng) have emerged as a promising biomarker for cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE epsilon4) allele is by far the most consistent genetic risk factor for AD. However, it is not known whether the pathophysiological roles of Ng in MCI or AD are related to APOEepsilon4. We stratified 250 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database into cognitively normal (CN) epsilon4 negative (CN epsilon4-), CN epsilon4 positive (CN epsilon4+), MCI epsilon4 negative (MCI epsilon4-), MCI epsilon4 positive (MCI epsilon4+), AD epsilon4 negative (AD epsilon4-), and AD epsilon4 positive (AD epsilon4+). CSF Ng levels were significantly increased in APOE epsilon4 carriers compared to APOE epsilon4 non-carriers with MCI. In addition, CSF Ng identified MCI epsilon4+ versus CN epsilon4-, but not MCI epsilon4- versus CN epsilon4-. Similarly, CSF Ng negatively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores at baseline in the MCI epsilon4+ group. Our findings support the use of CSF Ng as a biomarker of synaptic pathology for AD. We propose that the roles of CSF Ng in the pathophysiology of MCI may be related to APOE epsilon4.
