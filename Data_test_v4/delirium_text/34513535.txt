34513535|t|Paradoxical Reactions to Midazolam in a Term Parturient After Intravenous Sedation During Cesarean Section.
34513535|a|Propofol and midazolam are commonly used drugs in procedural sedation. Midazolam is widely used for its five principal pharmacologic effects: anxiolysis, sedation and hypnosis, anticonvulsant actions, spinal cord-mediated skeletal muscle relaxation, and anterograde amnesia. Increased talkativeness, emotional release, excitement, and excessive movement are the common paradoxical reactions to all kinds of benzodiazepines, which are reported since the introduction of chlordiazepoxide (Librium), the first benzodiazepine in 1955. In the United States, sedation with a combination of midazolam with opioids accounts for approximately 75% of routine procedural sedations. Most cases are distinctive. However, some data indicate that these reactions are due to serotonin imbalance, a central cholinergic effect, or a reflection of genetically determined variability in benzodiazepine receptor density or affinity (isoreceptors) throughout the brain. The idea of isoreceptors is comparable to that of isoenzymes like genetic variants of pseudocholinesterase. We report a case in which midazolam administration resulted in paradoxical reactions, which manifested as profound delirium with extrapyramidal symptoms after cessation of propofol sedation in a term parturient during cesarean section. This case report describes paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines in a term parturient promptly reversed with a small dose of flumazenil. Even though paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines have low prevalence and are not life-threatening, they have to be treated promptly with flumazenil. Therefore, anesthesiologists performing procedural sedation should be aware of untoward reactions and be prepared to manage them promptly.
