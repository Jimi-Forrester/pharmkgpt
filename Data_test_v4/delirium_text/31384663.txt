METHODS: This pilot randomized controlled trial included pretest and posttest measures using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale and the Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist. The intervention (n = 30) group participated in a culturally tailored, 4-week Vietnamese-language cognitive-behavioral skills evidenced-based program (Our Family Journey); caregivers in the control condition (n = 30) received dementia-related educational materials (education control condition). RESULTS: Our Family Journey caregivers showed significantly lower somatic scores on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale and reported lower frequency of care recipients' disruptive behaviors. However, they also reported being more stressed by their care recipients' depressive symptoms on the Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist compared to caregivers in the education control condition. DISCUSSION: These promising results suggest that a culturally adapted program can benefit Vietnamese dementia caregivers. Additional research is needed to develop and evaluate stronger, more impactful interventions for this underserved group.
