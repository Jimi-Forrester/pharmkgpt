33149775|a|The immune system consists of a complex biological and psychological network designed for fighting against infections and to protect the body from pathogen factors, including the internal ones. In the past, for a long time inflammation and infectious diseases were thought to be only the result of the genetic heritage and the biological functioning of the body, when the pathogenic factors acted within the body. Studies in recent decades stressed the importance of psychological balance and mental health on the body immunity. Psychoneuroimmunology studies indicated the thoughts and emotional patterns, and the psychological dynamics are strongly interrelated with the immune response. Moreover, the immunological mechanisms not only regulates the health of the person, but they are also an important part of the individual adaptive process in the environment. In various studies, the results of each treatment modality (drug interventions and psychosocial interventions) were observed and compared in patients with mental health problems associated with immune reactions (inflammation). Psychosocial interventions suggest increased efficiency in reducing inflammation and improving immune system function.
