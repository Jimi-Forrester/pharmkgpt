18591206|a|For the present research, a 1-year follow-up study was conducted on elderly group-home residents with dementia (n = 13). This research compared the cognitive function and behavioral disorders of the elderly group-home residents with dementia with a control group (n = 13) of elderly patients with dementia in a dementia care ward. Thirteen residents of a group home were observed for 1 year, following the establishment of the group home in January 2003. The subjects in the control group were matched for the sex and dementia type of the group-home residents. The present results suggest that cognitive function among elderly group-home residents was maintained in comparison with elderly patients in a dementia ward. In addition, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia were not observed in either group. Furthermore, these findings suggest that behavioral disorders significantly improved in the group-home residents because of the incorporation of activities combining basic and instrumental activities of daily living.
