4014265|t|Neurogenic bladder. New clinical finding in Legionnaires' disease.
4014265|a|Legionnaires' disease presents with a spectrum of organ involvement including pulmonary, hepatic, gastrointestinal, metabolic, and renal dysfunction. Known neurologic manifestations include hallucinations, delirium, cerebral and cerebellar disturbance, and encephalomyelitis. Clinical and subclinical peripheral neuropathy has been described. This report describes a 51-year-old man with legionnaires' disease complicated by cerebral and persistent cerebellar and brainstem dysfunction, without evidence of direct bacterial invasion of the nervous system. Of particular interest was the development of a flaccid neurogenic bladder, a clinical manifestation not previously described.
