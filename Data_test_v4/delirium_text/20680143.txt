20680143|t|A case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome induced by olanzapine in postpartum period.
20680143|a|Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a life-threatening medical complication that occurs as a result of dopaminergic receptor blockage in nigrostriatal pathways. This syndrome is mainly accepted to be an idiosyncratic reaction for antipsychotic medications. Incidence of NMS induced by olanzapine - an atypical antipsychotic - is extremely rare. However, there has been contradiction on postpartum period as a risk factor for NMS. This case is of interest due to the fact that it happens on postpartum period and is induced by olanzapine. We aimed in this study to evaluate the successfully cured case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome induced by olanzapine in postpartum period with the literature view.
