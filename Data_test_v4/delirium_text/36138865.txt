36138865|t|Autoimmune Encephalitis: A Physician's Guide to the Clinical Spectrum Diagnosis and Management.
36138865|a|The rapidly expanding spectrum of autoimmune encephalitis in the last fifteen years is largely due to ongoing discovery of many neuronal autoantibodies. The diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis can be challenging due to the wide spectrum of clinical presentations, prevalence of psychiatric features that mimic primary psychiatric illnesses, frequent absence of diagnostic abnormalities on conventional brain MR-imaging, non-specific findings on EEG testing, and the lack of identified IgG class neuronal autoantibodies in blood or CSF in a subgroup of patients. Early recognition and treatment are paramount to improve outcomes and achieve complete recovery from these debilitating, occasionally life threatening, disorders. This review is aimed to provide primary care physicians and hospitalists who, together with neurologist and psychiatrists, are often the first port of call for individuals presenting with new-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms, with up-to-date data and evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and management of individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders of suspected autoimmune origin.
