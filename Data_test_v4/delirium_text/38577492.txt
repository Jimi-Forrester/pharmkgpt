With the critical importance of astrocytes to neuronal health and functioning, we hypothesized that alterations in astrocyte expression of aging-associated markers p16INK4a (p16) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) with age would correlate with increased rates of neurodegeneration, as measured by FluoroJade C (FJC) staining. Methods: To test this hypothesis, 19 rhesus macaques at the Tulane National Primate Research Center were selected based on the following criteria: archival FFPE CNS tissue available to use, no noted neuropathology, and an age range of 5-30 years. Tissues were cut at 5 mum and stained for GFAP, p16, SIRT1, and FJC, followed by whole-slide imaging and HALO  image analysis for percentage of marker-positive cells and relative intensity of each stain. Results: We found the percentage of p16+ cells increases with age in total cells and astrocytes of the frontal (p = 0.0021, p = 0.0012 respectively) and temporal (p = 0.0226, p = 0.0203 respectively) lobes, as well as the relative intensity of p16 staining (frontal lobe: p = 0.0060; temporal lobe: p = 0.0269). For SIRT1, we found no correlation with age except for an increase in the relative intensity of SIRT1 in the temporal lobe (p = 0.0033). There was an increase in neurodegeneration, as measured by the percentage of FJC+ cells in the frontal lobe with age (p = 0.0057), as well as in the relative intensity of FJC staining in the frontal (p = 0.0030) and parietal (p = 0.0481) lobes. Importantly, increased p16 and SIRT1 expression in astrocytes correlated with increasing neurodegeneration in the frontal lobe (p = 0.0009, p = 0.0095 respectively). Discussion: Together, these data suggest that age-associated alterations in astrocytes contribute to neurodegeneration and provide a target for mechanistic studies in the future.
