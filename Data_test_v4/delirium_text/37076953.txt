37076953|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia in the elderly and causes neurodegeneration, leading to memory loss, behavioral disorder, and psychiatric impairment. One potential mechanism contributing to the pathogenesis of AD may be the imbalance in gut microbiota, local and systemic inflammation, and dysregulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA). Most of the AD drugs approved for clinical use today are symptomatic treatments that do not improve AD pathologic changes. As a result, researchers are exploring novel therapeutic modalities. Treatments involving the MGBA include antibiotics, probiotics, transplantation of fecal microbiota, botanical products, and others. However, single-treatment modalities are not as effective as expected, and a combination therapy is gaining momentum. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent advances in MGBA-related pathological mechanisms and treatment modalities in AD and to propose a new concept of combination therapy. "MGBA-based multitherapy" is an emerging view of treatment in which classic symptomatic treatments and MGBA-based therapeutic modalities are used in combination. Donepezil and memantine are two commonly used drugs in AD treatment. On the basis of the single/combined use of these two drugs, two/more additional drugs and treatment modalities that target the MGBA are chosen based on the characteristics of the patient's condition as an adjuvant treatment, as well as the maintenance of good lifestyle habits. "MGBA-based multitherapy" offers new insights for the treatment of cognitive impairment in AD patients and is expected to show good therapeutic results.
