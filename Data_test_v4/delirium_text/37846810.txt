37846810|t|Validation of the Hospital Frailty Risk Score in older adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia.
37846810|a|AIM: Frailty results from age-associated declines in physiological reserve and function and is prevalent in older people. Our aim is to examine the association of the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) with adverse events in older patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hypothesise that frailty is a comparable predictor of outcomes in CAP versus traditional severity indices such as CURB-65. METHODS: Retrospective review of electronic medical records in patients >=65 years with CAP admitted to a tertiary hospital from 1 January to 30 April 2021. Patients were identified using ICD codes for CAP and categorized as high risk (>15), intermediate risk (5-15) and low risk (<5) of frailty using the HFRS. RESULTS: Of 429 patients with CAP, 53.8% male, mean age of 82.9 years, older patients (85 vs. 79.7 years, P < 0.001) were at higher risk of frailty. Using the HFRS, 47.6% were deemed at high risk, 35.9% at intermediate risk, and 16.6% at low risk of frailty. Multivariate logistic regression shows that HFRS was more strongly associated (>=7 days, OR 1.042, CI 1.017-1.069) than CURB-65 (OR 0.995, CI 0.810-1.222) with long hospital length of stay (LOS), while CURB-65 (Confusion, Urea >7mmol/L, Respiratory rate >30, Blood pressure, age => 65 years old) was more strongly associated with mortality at 30, 90 and 365 days, compared with the HFRS. Comparing the values for the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, the HFRS was found to be a better predictor of long LOS, while CURB-65 remains a better predictor of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with high risk of frailty have higher healthcare utilization and HFRS is a better predictor of long LOS than CURB-65 but CURB-65 was a better predictor of mortality.
