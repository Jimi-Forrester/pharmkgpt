36832837|t|Fatty Acid Composition of Northern Pike from an Arctic River (Northeastern Siberia, Russia).
36832837|a|We assayed the fatty acid composition of muscles of the northern pike Esox lucius Linnaeus, 1758 inhabiting the Gyda River, Siberia, Russia using gas-liquid chromatography. Of 43 fatty acids identified in the pike samples, 23 fatty acids accounted for 99.3% of the total content. The most abundant saturated fatty acids (SFA, 31.6%) were palmitic (C16:0, 20.0%) and stearic (C18:0, 7.3%) acids. Among monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA, 15.1%), oleic acid (C18:1n9, 10.2%) and palmitoleic acid (C16:1, 4.1%) demonstrated the highest levels. The most represented polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, 53.3%) were arachidonic acid (C20:4n-6, 7.6%), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5n-3, 7.3%), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6n-3, 26.3%). The fatty acid profile of specimens from the Gyda River was different in comparison to profiles found in other pike populations, most likely due to different diets. Pike flesh has good nutrition quality in terms of a low n-6/n-3 ratio (0.36), low atherogenic (0.39), and thrombogenic (0.22) indices, and a high ratio of hypocholesterolemic to hypercholesterolemic fatty acids (2.83), and this species can be recommended as a replacement or alternative to other fish sources in traditional diets.
