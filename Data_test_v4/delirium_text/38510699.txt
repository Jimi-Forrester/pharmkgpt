38510699|a|Introduction: Iron accumulation in the brain has been linked to diabetes, but its role in subcortical structures involved in motor and cognitive functions remains unclear. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) allows the non-invasive quantification of iron deposition in the brain. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined magnetic susceptibility measured by QSM in the subcortical nuclei of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared with controls. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched [following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines] for studies reporting QSM values in the deep gray matter (DGM) regions of patients with T2DM and controls. Pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) for susceptibility were calculated using fixed-effects meta-analysis models, and heterogeneity was assessed using I2. Sensitivity analyses were conducted, and publication bias was evaluated using Begg's and Egger's tests. Results: Six studies including 192 patients with T2DM and 245 controls were included. This study found a significant increase in iron deposition in the subcortical nuclei of patients with T2DM compared to the control group. The study found moderate increases in the putamen (SMD = 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.72, p = 0.00) and dentate nucleus (SMD = 0.56, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.85, p = 0.00) but weak associations between increased iron levels in the caudate nucleus (SMD = 0.32, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.52, p = 0.00) and red nucleus (SMD = 0.22, 95% CI 0.00 0.44, p = 0.05). No statistical significance was found for iron deposition alterations in the globus pallidus (SMD = 0.19; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.38; p = 0.06) and substantia nigra (SMD = 0.12, 95% CI -0.10, 0.34, p = 0.29). Sensitivity analysis showed that the findings remained unaffected by individual studies, and consistent increases were observed in multiple subcortical areas. Discussion: QSM revealed an increase in iron in the DGM/subcortical nuclei in T2DM patients versus controls, particularly in the motor and cognitive nuclei, including the putamen, dentate nucleus, caudate nucleus, and red nucleus. Thus, QSM may serve as a potential biomarker for iron accumulation in T2DM patients. However, further research is needed to validate these findings.
