35428817|t|Comparison of intravenous sedation using midazolam versus dexmedetomidine in elderly patients with dementia: a randomized cross-over trial.
35428817|a|Differences between the effects of intravenous sedation with midazolam (MID) and dexmedetomidine (DEX) on the cerebral function of elderly patients with severe dementia are unclear. This study aimed to compare the effects of intravenous sedation with MID or DEX on parameters such as brain waves and cerebral blood flow (CBF). This cross-over study analyzed 12 patients with severe dementia, with each patient receiving both drug treatments. Each drug was administered until a Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) score of 2 was reached. Bispectral index (BIS) and normalized tissue hemoglobin index (nTHI), which reflects CBF using near-infrared spectroscopy, were measured. Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed-rank, and Friedman tests, and multiple regression analysis were performed. While a similar decline in BIS values was observed in both groups (P < 0.030), there was a significant decrease in nTHI up to 11% in the MID group (P = 0.005). In the DEX group, nTHI values did not differ from baseline. When an OAA/S score of 2 was just achieved, CBF in the MID group (- 5%) was significantly lower than in the DEX group (+- 0%). In dementia patients, sedation with MID resulted in a decrease in CBF, while the CBF value was maintained during sedation with DEX.
