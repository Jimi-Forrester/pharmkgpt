36831926|t|Enzyme-Assisted Nucleic Acid Amplification in Molecular Diagnosis: A Review.
36831926|a|Infectious diseases and tumors have become the biggest medical challenges in the 21st century. They are driven by multiple factors such as population growth, aging, climate change, genetic predispositions and more. Nucleic acid amplification technologies (NAATs) are used for rapid and accurate diagnostic testing, providing critical information in order to facilitate better follow-up treatment and prognosis. NAATs are widely used due their high sensitivity, specificity, rapid amplification and detection. It should be noted that different NAATs can be selected according to different environments and research fields; for example, isothermal amplification with a simple operation can be preferred in developing countries or resource-poor areas. In the field of translational medicine, CRISPR has shown great prospects. The core component of NAAT lies in the activity of different enzymes. As the most critical material of nucleic acid amplification, the key role of the enzyme is self-evident, playing the upmost important role in molecular diagnosis. In this review, several common enzymes used in NAATs are compared and described in detail. Furthermore, we summarize both the advances and common issues of NAATs in clinical application.
