36092174|t|EPIDEMIOLOGICAL PROFILE OF PROXIMAL FEMORAL FRACTURES IN OLDER ADULTS AT THE REGIONAL HOSPITAL IN COTIA - SP, BRAZIL.
36092174|a|Objective: To identify the epidemiological profile of older patients with proximal femoral fractures treated at the Hospital Regional de Cotia, SP - Brazil, and describe the nutritional status of these patients. Methods: Data were obtained from the electronic patient medical records from August 2020 to April 2021. The variables studied were age, gender, ethnicity, weight and height (for BMI calculation), and presence of comorbidities. Fracture circumstances were also assessed, including trauma mechanism, anatomical location, and treatment. Moreover, the nutritional profile of patients was assessed using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MAN). Results: Most patients were white women, with a mean age of 80 years and an average BMI of 23.55 kg/m2. Almost all patients suffered the fracture at home and the most common comorbidities were systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and Alzheimer's disease. Most patients were considered to be malnourished or at risk of malnutrition. Conclusion: The nutritional status of older adults seems to be directly related to the risk of proximal fractures of the femur. Level of Evidence II, Retrospective Study.
