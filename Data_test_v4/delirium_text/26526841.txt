26526841|t|Modulation of BAG3 Expression and Proteasomal Activity by sAPPalpha Does Not Require Membrane-Tethered Holo-APP.
26526841|a|Maintenance of intracellular proteostasis is essential for neuronal function, and emerging data support the view that disturbed proteostasis plays an important role in brain aging and the pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). sAPPalpha (sAPPalpha), the extracellularly secreted N-terminal alpha secretase cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), has an established function in neuroprotection. Recently, we provided evidence that membrane-bound holo-APP functionally cooperates with sAPPalpha to mediate neuroprotection via activation of the Akt survival signaling pathway and sAPPalpha directly affects proteostasis. Here, we demonstrate that in addition to its anti-apoptotic function, sAPPalpha has effects on neuronal proteostasis under conditions of proteasomal stress. In particular, recombinant sAPPalpha significantly suppressed MG132-triggered expression of the co-chaperone BAG3 and aggresome formation, and it partially rescued proteasomal activity in a dose-dependent manner in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. In analogy, sAPPalpha was able to inhibit MG132-induced BAG3 expression in primary hippocampal neurons. Strikingly, these sAPPalpha-induced changes were unaltered in APP-depleted SH-SY5Y cells and APP-deficient neurons, demonstrating that holo-APP is not required for this particular function of sAPPalpha. Importantly, recombinant sAPPbeta (sAPPbeta) failed to modulate BAG3 expression and proteostasis in APP-proficient wild-type (wt) cells, indicating that these biological effects are highly selective for sAPPalpha. In conclusion, we demonstrate that modulation of proteostasis is a distinct biological function of sAPPalpha and does not require surface-bound holo-APP. Our data shed new light on the physiological functions of APP and the interplay between APP processing and proteostasis during brain aging.
