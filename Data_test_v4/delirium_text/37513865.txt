37513865|t|(R,R)-BD-AcAc2 Mitigates Chronic Colitis in Rats: A Promising Multi-Pronged Approach Modulating Inflammasome Activity, Autophagy, and Pyroptosis.
37513865|a|Ulcerative colitis is a chronic and incurable form of inflammatory bowel disease that can increase the risk of colitis-associated cancer and mortality. Limited treatment options are available for this condition, and the existing ones often come with non-tolerable adverse effects. This study is the first to examine the potential benefits of consuming (R,R)-BD-AcAc2, a type of ketone ester (KE), and intermittent fasting in treating chronic colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in rats. We selected both protocols to enhance the levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate, mimicking a state of nutritional ketosis and early ketosis, respectively. Our findings revealed that only the former protocol, consuming the KE, improved disease activity and the macroscopic and microscopic features of the colon while reducing inflammation scores. Additionally, the KE counteracted the DSS-induced decrease in the percentage of weight change, reduced the colonic weight-to-length ratio, and increased the survival rate of DSS-insulted rats. KE also showed potential antioxidant activities and improved the gut microbiome composition. Moreover, consuming KE increased the levels of tight junction proteins that protect against leaky gut and exhibited anti-inflammatory properties by reducing proinflammatory cytokine production. These effects were attributed to inhibiting NFkappaB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and restraining pyroptosis and apoptosis while enhancing autophagy as revealed by reduced p62 and increased BECN1. Furthermore, the KE may have a positive impact on maintaining a healthy microbiome. To conclude, the potential clinical implications of our findings are promising, as (R,R)-BD-AcAc2 has a greater safety profile and can be easily translated to human subjects.
