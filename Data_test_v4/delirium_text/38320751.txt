38320751|a|BACKGROUND: Bell's mania was first described in 1849, and other terms have been used to describe this condition, including delirious mania, mania with delirium, and excited delirium. However, no international diagnostic manual has included mania as an independent diagnostic tool. The criteria for delirious mania were proposed by Bond et al. METHODS: We present a case of a man without a personal or family psychiatric history who experienced his first manic episode of delirium and psychosis at 76 years old. CONCLUSIONS: The case described in this study is compatible with mood disorders, the original description of Bell's mania, and Bond's definition of delirious mania. Although rare, extremely late-onset primary mania can occur without personal or family psychiatric history. The initial clinical presentation of delirium requires a thorough medical investigation, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar puncture with neuronal antibodies. The addition of delirious mania to the group of bipolar disorders in future editions of The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) has therapeutic and prognostic implications. The Bond criteria can provide valuable information in this respect. Further investigations are necessary to clarify the pathophysiology and epidemiology of delirious mania.
