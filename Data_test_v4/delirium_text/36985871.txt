36985871|t|Plasma-Assisted Atomic Layer Deposition of IrO2 for Neuroelectronics.
36985871|a|In vitro and in vivo stimulation and recording of neuron action potential is currently achieved with microelectrode arrays, either in planar or 3D geometries, adopting different materials and strategies. IrO2 is a conductive oxide known for its excellent biocompatibility, good adhesion on different substrates, and charge injection capabilities higher than noble metals. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) allows excellent conformal growth, which can be exploited on 3D nanoelectrode arrays. In this work, we disclose the growth of nanocrystalline rutile IrO2 at T = 150  C adopting a new plasma-assisted ALD (PA-ALD) process. The morphological, structural, physical, chemical, and electrochemical properties of the IrO2 thin films are reported. To the best of our knowledge, the electrochemical characterization of the electrode/electrolyte interface in terms of charge injection capacity, charge storage capacity, and double-layer capacitance for IrO2 grown by PA-ALD was not reported yet. IrO2 grown on PtSi reveals a double-layer capacitance (Cdl) above 300 microF cm-2, and a charge injection capacity of 0.22 +- 0.01 mC cm-2 for an electrode of 1.0 cm2, confirming IrO2 grown by PA-ALD as an excellent material for neuroelectronic applications.
