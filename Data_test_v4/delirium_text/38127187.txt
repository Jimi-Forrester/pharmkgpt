38127187|t|Molecular Chaperones as Therapeutic Target: Hallmark of Neurodegenerative Disorders.
38127187|a|Misfolded and aggregated proteins build up in neurodegenerative illnesses, which causes neuronal dysfunction and ultimately neuronal death. In the last few years, there has been a significant upsurge in the level of interest towards the function of molecular chaperones in the control of misfolding and aggregation. The crucial molecular chaperones implicated in neurodegenerative illnesses are covered in this review article, along with a variety of their different methods of action. By aiding in protein folding, avoiding misfolding, and enabling protein breakdown, molecular chaperones serve critical roles in preserving protein homeostasis. By aiding in protein folding, avoiding misfolding, and enabling protein breakdown, molecular chaperones have integral roles in preserving regulation of protein balance. It has been demonstrated that aging, a significant risk factor for neurological disorders, affects how molecular chaperones function. The aggregation of misfolded proteins and the development of neurodegeneration may be facilitated by the aging-related reduction in chaperone activity. Molecular chaperones have also been linked to the pathophysiology of several instances of neuron withering illnesses, enumerating as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Molecular chaperones have become potential therapy targets concerning with the prevention and therapeutic approach for brain disorders due to their crucial function in protein homeostasis and their connection to neurodegenerative illnesses. Protein homeostasis can be restored, and illness progression can be slowed down by methods that increase chaperone function or modify their expression. This review emphasizes the importance of molecular chaperones in the context of neuron withering disorders and their potential as therapeutic targets for brain disorders.
