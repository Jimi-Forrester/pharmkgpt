32061671|a|Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), a regulatory angiogenesis protein and it has been found to be involved in the occurrence and progression of Alzheimer's disease. However, it was still to be addressed the distinctly role and the molecular mechanisms of Ang-1 affects Alzheimer's disease. Our data suggest that Ang-1 aggravated the accumulation of Abeta42 and cognitive decline in APP/PS1 mice. The upregulation of APPbeta is essential for Abeta42 production in N2a cells overexpressing the mutational human APP gene (N2a/APP695 cells), while downregulation of PEN2 could reduce APP expression. Silencing of FOXA2 lead to inhibition of APP expression, as well as decrease of Abeta42 contents. In conclusion, Ang-1 has an accelerative effect on Alzheimer's disease by increasing the secretion of Abeta42 via FOXA2/PEN2/APP pathway.
