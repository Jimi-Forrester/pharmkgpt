37802772|a|The present study aimed to investigate the protective effect and underlying mechanism of Platycladi Semen oil(SP) on Abeta_(25-35)-induced brain injury in mice to provide a theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of Alzheimer's disease(AD). Male Kunming(KM) mice were randomly divided into a control group, a model group(brain injection of Abeta_(25-35), 200 mumol L~(-1), 0.15 muL g~(-1)), a positive drug group(donepezil, 10 mg kg~(-1)), and low-and high-dose SP groups(0.5 and 1 mL kg~(-1)). Learning and memory ability, neuronal damage, levels of Abeta_(1-42)/Abeta_(1-40), p-Tau, related indicators of apoptosis and oxidative stress, and immune cells, and protein and mRNA expression related to the sphingosine kinase 1(SPHK1)/sphingosine-1-phosphate(S1P)/sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 5(S1PR5) signaling pathway of mice in each group were determined. In addition, compounds in SP were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry(GC-MS). The mechanism of SP against AD was investigated by network pharmacology, 16S rDNA gene sequencing for gut microbiota(GM), and molecular docking techniques. The results showed that SP could improve the learning and memory function of Abeta_(25-35)-induced mice, reduce hippocampal neuronal damage, decrease the levels of Abeta_(1-42)/Abeta_(1-40), p-Tau, and indicators related to apoptosis and oxidative stress in the brain, and maintain the homeostasis of immune cells and GM. Network pharmacology and sequencing analysis for GM showed that the therapeutic effect of SP on AD was associated with the sphingolipid signaling pathway. Meanwhile,(Z,Z,Z)-9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid and(Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid, the components with the highest content in SP, showed good binding activity to SPHK1 and S1PR5. Therefore, it is inferred that SP exerts anti-apoptosis and antioxidant effects by regulating GM and inhibiting SPHK1/S1P/S1PR5 pathway, thereby improving brain injury induced by Abeta_(25-35) in mice. Moreover,(Z,Z,Z)-9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid and(Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid may be the material basis for the anti-AD effect of SP.
