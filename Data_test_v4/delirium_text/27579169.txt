27579169|t|Delirium as presenting symptom of neuro-Behcet's disease.
27579169|a|OBJECTIVES: Behcet's disease is a multisystemic disorder. Most of its clinical manifestations are due to thrombosis or vasculitis. There is a predominance of mucocutaneous and ocular lesions; neurological manifestations are minority. However, this could be the first problem that leads a patient to seek medical help. METHODS: We report a 30-year-old female with rapidly progressive headaches and confusion. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral thalamic T2 hyperintense lesions and hemorrhage. Directed inquiry revealed recurrent oral ulcers and three miscarriages. During hospitalization, the patient developed a deep venous thrombosis. RESULTS: After exclusion of other differential diagnoses, the diagnosis of Behcet's disease was established. CONCLUSION: Behcet's disease is a protean disease. Hence it should be in mind in patients with otherwise unexplained signs and symptoms, especially in endemic countries, and treatment decision should not be witheld in critical cases if no alternative diagnosis is plausible.
