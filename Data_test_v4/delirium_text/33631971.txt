33631971|a|This article describes the use of a participatory action research (PAR) approach to developing a self-management resource for persons living with dementia and care partners. Despite growing evidence that persons with dementia are able to contribute in meaningful ways to decision-making about their care and life preferences, few opportunities exist for them to participate in the design of resources and services meant for them. There is also a need to support the self-management of persons living with dementia with the provision of accurate, high quality, user-friendly information. The Living Well with Dementia resource was developed through a partnership with persons with dementia, family members, Alzheimer Society representatives, primary care providers, and researchers. The methods used in the development of this resource are outlined in six steps employed in this process, from establishment of a PAR team to final resource creation. Informed by a whole systems approach, the resource brings together essential components of self-management into a comprehensive system of care and support for living. It empowers users to be active participants in the application of new knowledge to their lives. Better self-management has important implications for access to health care and quality of life for persons with dementia and care partners.
