15068238|a|Although the neuropathological features typical for Down Syndrome obviously result from deregulation of both, cell cycle control and differentiation processes, so far research focused on the latter. Considering the known similarities between the neuropathology of Down Syndrome and Alzheimer's disease and the knowledge, that in Alzheimer's disease neuronal degeneration is associated with the activation of mitogenic signals and cell cycle activation, it is tempting to investigate the consequences of an additional chromosome 21 on mammalian cell cycle regulation. We analysed the distribution of cells in different cell cycle phases on the flowcytometer and the cell size of human amniotic fluid cells with normal karyotypes and with trisomy 21. We could not detect any significant differences suggesting that the presence of an additional copy of the about 225 genes on human chromosome 21 does not trigger cell cycle effects in amniotic fluid cells. These data provide new insights into the cell biology of trisomy 21 cells.
