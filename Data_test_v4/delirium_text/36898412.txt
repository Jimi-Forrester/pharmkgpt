36898412|t|Virtual Fracture Care in Long-Term Care Homes Avoiding Emergency Department Visits.
36898412|a|Long-term care residents with suspected fractures as a result of a fall typically transfer to the emergency department (ED) for diagnostic imaging and care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, transfer to the hospital increased the risk of COVID-19 exposure and resulted in extended isolation days for the resident. A fracture care pathway was developed and implemented to provide rapid diagnostic imaging results and stabilization in the care home, reducing transportation and exposure risk to COVID-19. Eligible residents with a stable fracture would receive a referral to a designated fracture clinic for consultation; fracture care is provided in the care home by long-term care staff. Evaluation of the pathway was completed and demonstrated that 100% of residents did not transfer to the ED and 47% of the residents did not transfer to a fracture clinic for additional care.
