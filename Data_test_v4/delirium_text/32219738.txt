32219738|t|The Impact of New Biomarkers and Drug Targets on Age-Related Disorders.
32219738|a|The increase in the human lifespan has not been paralleled by an increase in healthy life. With the increase in the proportion of the aged population, there has been a natural increase in the prevalence of age-related disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, frailty, and various other disorders. A continuous rise in these conditions could lead to a widespread medical and social burden. There are now considerable efforts underway to address these deficits in preclinical and clinical studies, which include the use of better study cohorts, longitudinal designs, improved translation of data from preclinical models, multi-omics profiling, identification of new biomarker candidates and refinement of computational tools and databases containing relevant information. Such efforts will support future interdisciplinary studies and help to identify potential new targets that are amenable to therapeutic approaches such as pharmacological interventions to increase the human healthspan in parallel with the lifespan.
