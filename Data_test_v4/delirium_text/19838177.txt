19838177|t|Formation and maintenance of Alzheimer's disease beta-amyloid plaques in the absence of microglia.
19838177|a|In Alzheimer's disease, microglia cluster around beta-amyloid deposits, suggesting that these cells are important for amyloid plaque formation, maintenance and/or clearance. We crossed two distinct APP transgenic mouse strains with CD11b-HSVTK mice, in which nearly complete ablation of microglia was achieved for up to 4 weeks after ganciclovir application. Neither amyloid plaque formation and maintenance nor amyloid-associated neuritic dystrophy depended on the presence of microglia.
