35154931|t|Treatment of Basicervical Femoral Fracture With Retractable Talon Hip Compression Screw.
35154931|a|Background Basicervical femoral fractures (BFFs) are rare and biomechanically unstable. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Talon  DistalFix  (Orthopedic Designs North America, Inc., Tampa, FL, USA) nail for the treatment of BFFs with a novel design. Methodology In this retrospective study, 25 patients with BFFs were analyzed between January 2016 and March 2020 at our institute. All patients were treated with the Talon  DistalFix  nail. Patients over the age of 60 years with basicervical fractures caused by low-energy trauma were included in this study. For inclusion into the study, the minimum follow-up time had to be longer than six months. The postoperative radiographic bone union, operative time, tip-apex distance (TAD), sliding distance of the lag screw, quality of fracture reduction, and major complications such as cut-out, non-union of the fracture, femoral head collapse, and cut-through were recorded. The Harris Hip Score was used to evaluate hip function at the end of the follow-up period. Results The mean follow-up period was 22 months (range, 16-28 months), and the mean age was 77.8 years (range, 61-91 years). The average sliding distance of the lag screw was 5.7 mm (range, 0.2-13.1 mm). The mean TAD of immediate postoperative view was 20.8 mm (range, 18.7-23.7 mm), and the TAD was <25 mm in all cases. Radiographic union was confirmed in most cases, and the average time for radiographic union was 18.8 weeks (range, 12-25 weeks). Most fractures (90.5%) had healed with no postoperative mechanical complications (cut-out, cut-thorough, or lateral wall fracture) at the final follow-up, except for two patients. One of the two patients had no evidence of union at six months, and mild varus reduction was observed in the other patient who had shortening of >10 mm. Conclusions According to the clinical and radiological findings of this study, treatment with the Talon  DistalFix  nail showed satisfactory results. Hence, it can be a suitable option in the treatment of BFFs.
