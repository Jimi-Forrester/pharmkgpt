36259581|a|BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota can impact older adults' health, especially in patients with frailty syndrome. Understanding the association between the gut microbiota and frailty syndrome will help to explain the etiology of age-related diseases. Low-grade systemic inflammation is a factor leading to geriatric disorders, which is known as "inflammaging". Intestinal dysbiosis has a direct relationship with low-grade systemic inflammation because when the natural gut barrier is altered by age or other factors, some microorganisms or their metabolites can cross this barrier and reach the systemic circulation. OBJECTIVES: This review had two general goals: first, to describe the characteristics of the gut microbiota associated with age-related diseases, specifically frailty syndrome. The second aim was to identify potential interventions to improve the composition and function of intestinal microbiota, consequently lessening the burden of patients with frailty syndrome. METHODS: A search of scientific evidence was performed in PubMed, Science Direct, and Redalyc using keywords such as "frailty", "elderly", "nutrient interventions", "probiotics", and "prebiotics". We included studies reporting the effects of nutrient supplementation on frailty syndrome and older adults. These studies were analyzed to identify novel therapeutic alternatives to improve gut microbiota characteristics as well as subclinical signs related to this condition. RESULTS: The gut microbiota participates in many metabolic processes that have an impact on the brain, muscles, and other organs. These processes integrate feedback mechanisms, comprising their respective axis with the intestine and the gut microbiota. Alterations in these associations can lead to frailty. We report a few interventions that demonstrate that prebiotics and probiotics could modulate the gut microbiota in humans. Furthermore, other nutritional interventions could be used in patients with frailty syndrome. CONCLUSION: Probiotics and prebiotics may potentially prevent frailty syndrome or improve the quality of life of patients with this disorder. However, there is not enough information about their appropriate doses and periods of administration. Therefore, further investigations are required to determine these factors and improve their efficacy as therapeutic approaches for frailty syndrome.
