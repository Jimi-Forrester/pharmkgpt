38921451|a|The chemical profiles of both Zygophyllum album (Z. album) aerial parts and roots extracts were evaluated with LC-ESI-TOF-MS/MS analysis. Twenty-four compounds were detected. Among them, some are detected in both the aerial parts and the roots extracts, and others were detected in the aerial parts only. The detected compounds were mainly flavonoids, phenolic compounds, triterpenes and other miscellaneous compounds. Such compounds contribute to the diverse pharmacological activities elicited by the Z. album species. This study aimed to elucidate the antiepileptic effect of Z. album aerial parts and roots crude extracts against pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling in mice. Male albino mice were divided into four groups, eight animals each. All groups, except the control group, were kindled with PTZ (35 mg/kg i.p.), once every alternate day for a total of 15 injections. One group was left untreated (PTZ group). The remaining two groups were treated prior to PTZ injection with either Z. album aerial parts or roots crude extract (400 mg/kg, orally). Pretreatment with either extract significantly reduced the seizure scores, partially reversed the histological changes in the cerebral cortex and exerted antioxidant/anti-inflammatory efficacy evinced by elevated hippocampal total antioxidant capacity and SOD and catalase activities, parallel to the decrement in MDA content, iNOS activity and the TXNIB/NLRP3 axis with a subsequent decrease in caspase 1 activation and a release of IL-1beta and IL-18. Moreover, both Z. album extracts suppressed neuronal apoptosis via upregulating Bcl-2 expression and downregulating that of Bax, indicating their neuroprotective and antiepileptic potential. Importantly, the aerial parts extract elicited much more antiepileptic potential than the roots extract did.
