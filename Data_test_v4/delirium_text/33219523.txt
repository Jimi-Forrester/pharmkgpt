33219523|a|Advances in understanding the regulatory functions of the nervous system have revealed neural cholinergic signaling as a key regulator of cytokine responses and inflammation. Cholinergic drugs, including the centrally acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, galantamine, which are in clinical use for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, have been rediscovered as anti-inflammatory agents. Here, we provide a timely update on this active research and clinical developments. We summarize the involvement of cholinergic mechanisms and inflammation in the pathobiology of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia, and the effectiveness of galantamine treatment. We also highlight recent findings demonstrating the effects of galantamine in preclinical and clinical settings of numerous conditions and diseases across the lifespan that are characterized by immunological, neurological, and metabolic dysfunction.
