38144517|a|This work highlights the development of a conductive elastomer (CE) based electrophoretic platform that enables the transfer of charged molecules from a solid-state CE electrode directly to targeted tissues. Using an elastomer-based electrode containing poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) nanowires, controlled electrophoretic delivery of methylene blue (MB) and fluorescein (FLSC) was achieved with applied voltage. Electroactive release of positively charged MB and negatively charged FLSC achieved 33.19 +- 6.47 mug release of MB and 22.36 +- 3.05 mug release of FLSC, a 24 and 20-fold increase in comparison to inhibitory voltages over 1 h. Additionally, selective, and sequential release of the two oppositely charged molecules from a single CE device was demonstrated, showing the potential of this device to be used in multi-drug treatments.
