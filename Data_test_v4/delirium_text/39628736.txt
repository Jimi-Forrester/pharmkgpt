39628736|t|A Rare Case of Statin-Induced Rhabdomyolysis With Severe Acute Kidney Injury After a Decade of Therapy.
39628736|a|Cardiovascular diseases are a major global health concern, with statin therapy playing a significant role in primary and secondary prevention. Statin-associated muscle symptoms typically occur early in treatment, but severe rhabdomyolysis is a rare complication. We present an unprecedented case of a patient who developed severe rhabdomyolysis with acute kidney injury after 10 years of uninterrupted statin therapy. The 10 years of therapy in this case is the longest duration reported in the literature. While several risk factors are associated with its development, including alcohol abuse, our patient's case stands out due to the extended latency of 10 years between statin initiation and rhabdomyolysis onset. Chronic alcohol consumption compounded the diagnostic challenge by masking the symptoms. The pathogenesis involves both muscle toxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction. Timely diagnosis and discontinuation of statin therapy, aggressive hydration, and vigilant monitoring are crucial for managing this life-threatening condition.
