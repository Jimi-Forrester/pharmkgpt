29766074|a|INTRODUCTION: Extubation failure in critically ill patients is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Although predictors of failed extubation have been previously determined in intensive care unit (ICU) cohorts, relatively less attention has been directed toward this issue in patients with trauma. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of extubation failure among patients with trauma in a multidisciplinary ICU setting. METHODS: A prospective observational study of extubation failures (EF) was conducted at an American College of Surgeons level I trauma center over 3 years (2011-2013). Case-control patients (CC) were then compared with the study group (EF) with respect to demographic/clinical characteristics and outcomes. Failure of extubation was defined as reintubation within 72 hours following planned extubation. RESULTS: 7830 patients were admitted to the trauma service and 1098 (14%) underwent mechanical ventilation. 63 patients met inclusion criteria for the EF group and 63 comprised the CC group. The overall rate of extubation failure was 5.7% and mean time to reintubation was 13.0 hours. Groups (EF vs CC) were similar for Injury Severity Score (21 vs 21), Glasgow Coma Scale at extubation (11 vs 10), number of comorbidities (1.5 vs 1.7), injury mechanism (blunt 79% vs 74%), and body mass index (27.9 vs 27.2). In addition, groups were similar with respect to weaning protocol compliance (84% vs 89%, p=0.57). EF group had significantly increased ICU length of stay (LOS) (15.7 vs 7.4 days, p<0.001), ventilator days (13.3 vs 4.8, p<0.001), and mortality (9.5% vs 0%, p=0.03). Multiple regression analysis identified that EF was associated with increased odds of: (1) temperature >38 C at time of extubation (OR 5.9, 95% CI 1.7 to 20.8), and (2) non-surgeon intensivist consultation (OR 24.2, 95% CI 5.5 to 105.9). CONCLUSIONS: Extubation failure is associated with increased LOS, ventilator days, and mortality in patients with trauma. Fever at time of extubation is associated with extubation failure, and the presence of such should give pause in the decision to extubate. Non-surgeon intensivist involvement increases risk of extubation failure, and a surgical critical care service may be most appropriate for the management of ventilated patients with trauma. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, Prognostic and epidemiological.
