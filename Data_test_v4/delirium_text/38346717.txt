38346717|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is prevalent in older adults and has been shown to increase the risk of long-term cognitive decline. Plasma biomarkers to identify the risk for postoperative delirium and the risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias are needed. METHODS: This biomarker discovery case-control study aimed to identify plasma biomarkers associated with postoperative delirium. Patients aged >=65 years undergoing major elective noncardiac surgery were recruited. The preoperative plasma proteome was interrogated with SOMAmer-based technology targeting 1433 biomarkers. RESULTS: In 40 patients (20 with vs. 20 without postoperative delirium), a preoperative panel of 12 biomarkers discriminated patients with postoperative delirium with an accuracy of 97.5%. The final model of five biomarkers delivered a leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy of 80%. Represented biological pathways included lysosomal and immune response functions. CONCLUSION: In older patients who have undergone major surgery, plasma SOMAmer proteomics may provide a relatively non-invasive benchmark to identify biomarkers associated with postoperative delirium.
