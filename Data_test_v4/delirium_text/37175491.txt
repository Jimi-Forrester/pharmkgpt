37175491|t|Inflammaging and Immunosenescence as Part of Skin Aging-A Narrative Review.
37175491|a|Inflammaging and immunosenescence are associated with aging of the human body, but there are key differences between them. Immunosenescence aims to adapt the body systems to aging, while inflammaging is considered a consequence of immunosenescence. There has been much research in the area of immunosenescence and inflammaging recently, yet our understanding of aging and the ability to develop interventions to decrease the harmful effect of aging on the human body is insufficient. This review is focused on immunosenescence and inflammaging processes in the skin. We aimed to identify factors that influence inflammaging, skin aging, and their mechanisms. We discussed the role of triggering factors (e.g., UV radiations, changes in bioavailability of nitric oxide, senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors, and reactive oxygen species) and inhibiting factors that can potentially be used as anti-aging treatments, as well as the idea of geroprotectors and senotherapeutics. We concluded that while knowledge on external factors can help people to improve their health conditions, knowledge on biochemical factors can help researchers to understand inflammaging process and develop interventions to minimize the impact of aging on the human body. Further research is needed to better understand the role of factors that can slow down or accelerate inflammaging.
