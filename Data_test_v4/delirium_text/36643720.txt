36643720|t|Managing Follicular Lymphoma in the Elderly Population.
36643720|a|Follicular lymphoma (FL) is one of the most commonly diagnosed types of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The median age of diagnosis for FL is 65 years old. Although the median life expectancy after diagnosis is approximately 10 years, the incurable disease has a high risk of transformation. This case report focuses on an 80-year-old patient diagnosed with low-grade follicular lymphoma which subsequently transformed leading to the patient's eventual demise as the patient took on the palliative intent. This case report aims to highlight the importance of clinical markers or prognostic factors to identify patients, specifically the elderly population who are at risk of transformation to aggressive forms when their FL remains at stage I-II phases. Currently, elderly patients with FL tend to be quickly dismissed with curative intent with chemotherapy, given their age and comorbidities, despite forming the majority of the population with follicular lymphoma. Age more than 60 years old has been shown to be one of the most powerful yet poor prognostic features in follicular lymphoma international prognostic index (FLIPI)-the main scoring system used for FL. Hence, further studies are required to look into the tailoring treatment for elderly patients with follicular lymphoma after risk stratifying them with appropriate clinical and prognostic markers.
