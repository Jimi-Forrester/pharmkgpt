35528844|a|Background: The classical renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has an important role in the cardiovascular system and water homeostasis in the body. Recently, the existence of RAS with all of its components has been shown in the mammalian brain. RAS participates in many brain activities, including memory acquisition and consolidation. Since the cholinergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus is crucial for these functions, this study aims to evaluate the hippocampal angiotensin receptors (ATs) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) mRNA in the renovascular hypertensive rats in captopril- and losartan-treated hypertensive rats. Methods: The rats were randomly divided into four groups of eight animals; sham, Goldblatt two kidney one clip (2K1C) hypertensive rats and Goldblatt 2K1C hypertensive rats received 5 mg/kg captopril and Goldblatt 2K1C hypertensive rats received 10 mg/kg losartan. After 8 days of treatment, the rats were sacrificed and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), ChAT, AT1, and AT2 receptor mRNAs in the hippocampus of rats were assessed by real-time PCR. The Morris water maze test was applied to measure the cognitive functioning of the rats. Results: Hypertensive rats showed impaired acquisition and memory function in the Morris water maze test. Treatment with ACE inhibitor (captopril) and AT1 receptor antagonist (losartan) reversed the observed acquisition and memory deficit in hypertensive rats. Overexpression of AChE, AT1, and AT2 and low expression of ChAT were noted in the hippocampus of rats with Goldblatt hypertension compared with that of the sham group. Treatment with captopril significantly reversed these changes, while treatment with losartan slightly reduced the mentioned effects. Conclusion: The memory-enhancing effect of captopril in renovascular hypertensive rats might lead to increased hippocampal ChAT expression.
