37947369|t|Single-Molecule Detection of alpha-Synuclein Oligomers in Parkinson's Disease Patients Using Nanopores.
37947369|a|alpha-Synuclein (alpha-Syn) is an intrinsically disordered protein whose aggregation in the brain has been significantly implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). Beyond the brain, oligomers of alpha-Synuclein are also found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood, where the analysis of these aggregates may provide diagnostic routes and enable a better understanding of disease mechanisms. However, detecting alpha-Syn in CSF and blood is challenging due to its heterogeneous protein size and shape, and low abundance in clinical samples. Nanopore technology offers a promising route for the detection of single proteins in solution; however, the method often lacks the necessary selectivity in complex biofluids, where multiple background biomolecules are present. We address these limitations by developing a strategy that combines nanopore-based sensing with molecular carriers that can specifically capture alpha-Syn oligomers with sizes of less than 20 nm. We demonstrate that alpha-Synuclein oligomers can be detected directly in clinical samples, with minimal sample processing, by their ion current characteristics and successfully utilize this technology to differentiate cohorts of PD patients from healthy controls. The measurements indicate that detecting alpha-Syn oligomers present in CSF may potentially provide valuable insights into the progression and monitoring of Parkinson's disease.
