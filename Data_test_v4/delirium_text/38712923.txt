38712923|t|The association of blood biomarkers with cerebral white matter and myelin content in bipolar disorder: a systematic review.
38712923|a|OBJECTIVES: Evidence from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and postmortem studies has demonstrated white-matter (WM) deficits in bipolar disorder (BD). Changes in peripheral blood biomarkers have also been observed; however, studies evaluating the potential relationship between brain alterations and the periphery are scarce. The objective of this systematic review is to investigate the relationship between blood-based biomarkers and WM in BD. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO were used to conduct literature searches. Cross-sectional or longitudinal studies reporting original data which investigated both a blood-based biomarker and WM (by neuroimaging) in BD were included. RESULTS: Of 3,750 studies retrieved, 23 were included. Several classes of biomarkers were found to have a significant relationship with WM in BD. These included cytokines and growth factors (interleukin-8 [IL-8], tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-a], and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 [IGFBP-3]), innate immune system (natural killer cells [NK]), metabolic markers (lipid hydroperoxidase, cholesterol, triglycerides), the kynurenine (Kyn) pathway (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, kynurenic acid [Kyna]), and various gene polymorphisms (serotonin-transporter-linked promoter region). CONCLUSION: This systematic review revealed that blood-based biomarkers are associated with markers of WM deficits observed in BD. Longitudinal studies investigating the potential clinical utility of these specific biomarkers are encouraged.
