36762196|t|Computational investigation on the antioxidant activities and on the Mpro SARS-CoV-2 non-covalent inhibition of isorhamnetin.
36762196|a|In the present work, we report a computational study on some important chemical properties of the flavonoid isorhamnetin, used in traditional medicine in many countries. In the course of the study we determined the acid-base equilibria in aqueous solution, the possible reaction pathways with the  OOH radical and the corresponding kinetic constants, the complexing capacity of copper ions, and the reduction of these complexes by reducing agents such as superoxide and ascorbic anion by using density functional level of theory Density Functional Theory. Finally, the non-covalent inhibition ability of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease enzyme by isorhamnetin was examined by molecular dynamics (MD) and docking investigation.
