36628962|t|High Prevalence of Geriatric Conditions Among Older Adults With Cardiovascular Disease.
36628962|a|As the population ages, the global cardiovascular disease burden will continue to increase, particularly among older adults. Increases in life expectancy and better cardiovascular care have significantly reshaped the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease and have created new patient profiles. The combination of older age, multiple comorbidities, polypharmacy, frailty, and adverse noncardiovascular outcomes is challenging our routine clinical practice in this field. In this review, we examine noncardiovascular factors that statistically interact in a relevant way with health status and quality of life in older people with cardiovascular disease. We focused on specific geriatric conditions (multimorbidity, polypharmacy, geriatric syndromes, and frailty) that are responsible for a major risk of functional decline and have an important impact on the overall prognosis in this patient population.
