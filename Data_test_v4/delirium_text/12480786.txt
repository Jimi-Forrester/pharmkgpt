12480786|a|There is increasing evidence that cerebral hypoperfusion plays a key role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As one ages, cerebral blood flow (CBF) decreases as a direct reflection of a normal aging process. Coupled with this expected drop in CBF are a host of other factors, such as hypertension, stress, smoking, diabetes, cholesterol buildup, etc., which further decrease blood flow to the brain. Maintaining a critical level of CBF is essential if adequate amounts of oxygen and glucose are to be presented to neurons to sustain their cellular energy production (ATP). If CBF drops below a critical flow level, insufficient ATP will be produced and, if this situation is not corrected, neurons will deteriorate and eventually die. When a critical mass of neurons die in areas of the brain involved with cognition and memory, AD will result. Omentum transposition to the brain is a surgical procedure by which a large volume of blood and other biological agents can be delivered to the brain over an indefinite period of time. The omentum gives metabolic support to deteriorating neurons and its presence on the brain has resulted in the reversal of AD symptoms. Additionally, omentum transposition to the brain can markedly reduce senile plaque accumulation, but has no apparent effect on reducing neurofibrillary tangles. Omental transposition may play an important role in the future treatment of AD, especially in early and moderate cases.
