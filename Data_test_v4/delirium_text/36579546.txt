36579546|a|Background: The advances achieved by the available research that focus on understanding memory operation and cognitive functions have helped the development of specific treatment approaches. These can help to maintain or improve the cognitive function and well-being of people with dementia. The use of cognitive stimulation in dementia has a long history. There are multiple studies that have demonstrated its benefits on the cognitive levels of patients with mild to moderate dementia. However, all of the studies on this type of non-pharmacological intervention conclude that there is a need for more clinical trials in order to give more solidity to the evidence already found. The objective of this pilot study was to assess the effects of an occupational therapy cognitive training program on the cognitive function of institutionalized older adults with dementia. Methods: The study was a pilot randomized clinical controlled trial. A total of 58 participants with major neurocognitive disorder or dementia were randomized to the occupational therapy cognitive training program group or to the conventional occupational therapy group twice a week for 5 weeks. The cognitive level was measured with the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) and the Lobo's Cognitive Mini Test (LCMT), which is the Mini-Mental Status Examination in Spanish. Measures were taken at baseline (week 0), after 5 weeks of treatment (week 5), and after 6 weeks of follow up (week 12). A value of p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: There were no statistical differences between groups in the LCMT global scores at baseline or after the intervention at week 5. However, the analysis of the specific cognitive areas assessed in the Lobo's Cognitive Mini Test indicated that that the intervention group significantly improved comprehension of verbal commands and praxis (p = 0.021). At the follow-up measure, the differences obtained in relation to verbal commands and praxis maintained the statistical differences significantly (p = 0.009). Conclusions: Occupational therapy based on cognitive training shows positive effects on the maintenance of the global cognitive state of institutionalized older adults with dementia and improves significantly the comprehension of verbal commands and praxis.
