26247837|a|Recent studies show that the accumulation of redox-active Cu mediates the aggregation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) and conspicuous oxidative damage to the brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the key roles for Tyr 10 in Abeta-Cu(II) complex and its potential biological relevance to AD etiology under oxidative stress, were not stressed enough. Interestingly, our results indicated that Abeta40 (not Abeta16)-Cu(II) complex showed obviously enhanced peroxidase activity than free Cu(II). Although Tyr 10 was not the residue binding Cu(II), the mutation of Tyr 10 residue in Abeta40 decreased the peroxidase activity of Abeta40-Cu(II) complex, and the mutation of Tyr 10 could inhibit Abeta40 aggregation. Under oxidative and nitrative stress conditions, the Abeta-Cu(II) complex caused oxidation and nitration of the Abeta Tyr 10 residue through peroxidase-like reactions, where the formation of Cu(I) and hydroxyl radical (OH) was proposed as a chemical mechanism. We also showed that, when Abeta40 aggregates were bound to Cu(II), they retained peroxidase-like activity. Therefore, Tyr 10 residue is pivotal in Abeta-Cu(II) complex and shows important relevance to oxidative stress, implicating the novel significance of Tyr 10 residue as well as Abeta-Cu(II) complex in the pathology of AD.
