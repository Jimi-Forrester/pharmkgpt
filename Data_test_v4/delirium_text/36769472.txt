36769472|t|Circulating Inflammatory Cytokine Associated with Poor Prognosis in Moyamoya Disease: A Prospective Cohort Study.
36769472|a|Inflammation is a key factor in the development of moyamoya disease. However, the cytokine distribution in moyamoya disease and its impact on prognosis remain unclear. A total of 204 patients with moyamoya disease were enrolled in this study. The peripheral blood was analyzed for baseline data and cytokines, which included IL-6, IL-1beta, IL-2R, IL-8, and TNF-alpha. Patients with the RNF213 mutation and those without the mutation were compared in terms of their differences in cytokines. A mRS score >=2 was defined as a poor prognosis, and a mRS score <2 was described as a good prognosis, and differences in cytokines were compared between the two groups. Regression analysis was performed to identify markers affecting prognosis. TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels were higher in the group without the RNF213 mutation compared to the mutation group. Multivariate stepwise regression analysis indicated that the G3 subgroup of IL-6 and the G4 subgroup of TNF-alpha were the independent risk factors for adverse prognosis in adults with moyamoya disease (OR 3.678, 95% CI [1.491, 9.074], p = 0.005; OR 2.996, 95% CI [1.180, 7.610], p = 0.021). IL-6 and TNF-alpha were associated with poor prognosis in adult patients with moyamoya disease.
