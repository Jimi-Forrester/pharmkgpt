35040583|a|Refractory cerebral autoinflammatory-autoimmune diseases are often associated with dysregulated innate immunity and are targeted by anakinra, an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. We analyzed the therapeutic effect of anakinra in refractory cerebral autoinflammatory response (CAIR) at a single institution from January 2017 to May 2021. In total, 12 patients with various etiologies were sympathetically treated with anakinra (100 mg/day subcutaneously). Four patients showed good responses, and among these patients, three patients had pathologically demonstrated CAIR. The other eight patients were nonresponsive. No patient had a serious adverse effect. Thus, anakinra may be a therapeutic option for refractory cerebral autoinflammatory diseases.
