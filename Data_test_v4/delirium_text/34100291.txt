34100291|t|An Update on the Routes for the Delivery of Donepezil.
34100291|a|Dementia is a significant public health problem in the 21st century. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an essential factor in dementia. Currently, the drugs used for the treatment of AD are mainly acetylcholine inhibitors (AChEIs). As an AChEI, donepezil (DP) can improve patients' cognitive ability with low side effects and has been accepted by most patients and doctors. For AD patients, the dosage regimen is also crucial due to aging and diseases. Although there are DP oral tablets on the market, there are still many problems to be solved. At present, more and more research is conducted to optimize the route of administration of DP to improve the self-administration of patients. The research fields of DP administration include oral administration, injection administration, intranasal administration, and transdermal administration. This Review is to present the development of different DP administrations and evaluates the advantages and limitations of those works, hoping to optimize the DP dosage regimen for AD patients.
