35431908|a|Population aging is an inevitable problem nowadays, and the elderly are going through a lot of geriatric symptoms, especially cognitive impairment. Irisin, an exercise-stimulating cleaved product from transmembrane fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5), has been linked with favorable effects on many metabolic diseases. Recently, mounting studies also highlighted the neuroprotective effects of irisin on dementia. The current evidence remains uncertain, and few clinical trials have been undertaken to limit its clinical practice. Therefore, we provided an overview of current scientific knowledge focusing on the preventive mechanisms of irisin on senile cognitive decline and dementia, in terms of the possible connections between irisin and neurogenesis, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and dementia-related diseases. This study summarized the recent advances and ongoing studies, aiming to provide a better scope into the effectiveness of irisin on dementia progression, as well as a mediator of muscle brain cross talk to provide theoretical support for exercise therapy for patients with dementia. Whether irisin is a diagnostic or prognostic factor for dementia needs more researches.
