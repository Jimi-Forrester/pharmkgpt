25794323|a|INTRODUCTION: An acute discontinuation of tizanidine, an alpha-2-agonistic muscle relaxant, is associated with reflex tachycardia, hypertension, tremor, hypertonicity and anxiety. CASE REPORT: We describe a 53-year-old patient with broken-heart syndrome, who developed serious tizanidine withdrawal symptoms after high-dosed long-term treatment within the framework of stress cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSION: Central muscle relaxants like tizanidine might have an impact on the development of delirium. Tizanidine withdrawal should be considered in patients who manifest signs and symptoms of withdrawal from medications. The drug should be gradually reduced in dosage under observation by a psychiatrist. When prescribing tizanidine, the possible pharmacological side effects and interactions should be taken into careful account.
