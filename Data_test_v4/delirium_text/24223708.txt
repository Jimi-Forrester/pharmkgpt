24223708|t|The involvement of PI3K-mediated and L-VGCC-gated transient Ca2+ influx in 17beta-estradiol-mediated protection of retinal cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis with Ca2+ overload.
24223708|a|Intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) plays an important role in regulating most cellular processes, including apoptosis and survival, but its alterations are different and complicated under diverse conditions. In this study, we focused on the [Ca(2+)]i and its control mechanisms in process of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced apoptosis of primary cultured Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat retinal cells and 17beta-estradiol (betaE2) anti-apoptosis. Fluo-3AM was used as a Ca(2+) indicator to detect [Ca(2+)]i through fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), cell viability was assayed using MTT assay, and apoptosis was marked by Hoechst 33342 and annexin V/Propidium Iodide staining. Besides, PI3K activity was detected by Western blotting. Results showed: a) 100 muM H2O2-induced retinal cell apoptosis occurred at 4 h after H2O2 stress and increased in a time-dependent manner, but [Ca(2+)]i increased earlier at 2 h, sustained to 12 h, and then recovered at 24 h after H2O2 stress; b) 10 muM betaE2 treatment for 0.5-24 hrs increased cell viability by transiently increasing [Ca(2+)]i, which appeared only at 0.5 h after betaE2 application; c) increased [Ca(2+)]i under 100 microM H2O2 treatment for 2 hrs or 10 microM betaE2 treatment for 0.5 hrs was, at least partly, due to extracellular Ca(2+) stores; d) importantly, the transiently increased [Ca(2+)]i induced by 10 microM betaE2 treatment for 0.5 hrs was mediated by the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and gated by the L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels (L-VGCC), but the increased [Ca(2+)]i induced by 100 microM H2O2 treatment for 2 hrs was not affected; and e) pretreatment with 10 microM betaE2 for 0.5 hrs effectively protected retinal cells from apoptosis induced by 100 microM H2O2, which was also associated with its transient [Ca(2+)]i increase through L-VGCC and PI3K pathway. These findings will lead to better understanding of the mechanisms of betaE2-mediated retinal protection and to exploration of the novel therapeutic strategies for retina degeneration.
