34794851|t|Common pathways in dementia and diabetic retinopathy: understanding the mechanisms of diabetes-related cognitive decline.
34794851|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with multiple comorbidities, including diabetic retinopathy (DR) and cognitive decline, and T2D patients have a significantly higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Both DR and AD are characterized by a number of pathological mechanisms that coalesce around the neurovascular unit, including neuroinflammation and degeneration, vascular degeneration, and glial activation. Chronic hyperglycemia and insulin resistance also play a significant role, leading to activation of pathological mechanisms such as increased oxidative stress and the accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). Understanding these common pathways and the degree to which they occur simultaneously in the brain and retina during diabetes will provide avenues to identify T2D patients at risk of cognitive decline.
