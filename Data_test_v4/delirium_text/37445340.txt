37445340|t|An Overview of Systemic Health Factors Related to Rapid Oral Health Deterioration among Older People.
37445340|a|The oral health of older individuals can be negatively impacted by various systemic health factors, leading to rapid oral health deterioration. This paper aims to present an overview of the published evidence on systemic health factors that contribute to rapid oral health deterioration in older individuals, and to explore the implications of these factors for both general healthcare and oral healthcare provision. Older people are at risk of experiencing adverse reactions to medications due to multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Hyposalivation, a significant side effect of some medications, can be induced by both the type and number of medications used. Frailty, disability, sarcopenia, care dependency, and limited access to professional oral healthcare can also compromise the oral health of older people. To prevent rapid oral health deterioration, a comprehensive approach is required that involves effective communication between oral healthcare providers, other healthcare providers, and informal caregivers. Oral healthcare providers have a responsibility to advocate for the importance of maintaining adequate oral health and to raise awareness of the serious consequences of weakened oral health. By doing so, we can prevent weakened oral health from becoming a geriatric syndrome.
