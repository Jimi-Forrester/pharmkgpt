3962611|t|Neurotrophic factor for central cholinergic neurones is present in both normal and Alzheimer brain tissue.
3962611|a|Reaggregate cultures of foetal rat brain grown in a serum-free medium were used to determine the presence or absence of cholinergic neurotrophic factors in Alzheimer's disease brain tissue. These preliminary data show that both normal and Alzheimer's disease brain contain factors which elevate choline acetyltransferase activity in the reaggregate cultures.
