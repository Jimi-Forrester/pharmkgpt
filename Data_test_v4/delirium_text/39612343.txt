39612343|a|Phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCgamma2) plays important roles in cell signaling downstream of various membrane receptors. PLCgamma2 contains a multidomain inhibitory region critical for its regulation, while it has remained unclear how these domains contribute to PLCgamma2 activity modulation. Here we determined three structures of human PLCgamma2 in autoinhibited states, which reveal dynamic interactions at the autoinhibition interface, involving the conformational flexibility of the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain in the inhibitory region, and its previously unknown interaction with a carboxyl-terminal helical domain in the core region. We also determined a structure of PLCgamma2 bound to the kinase domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), which demonstrates the recognition of FGFR1 by the nSH2 domain in the inhibitory region of PLCgamma2. Our results provide structural insights into PLCgamma2 regulation that will facilitate future mechanistic studies to understand the entire activation process.
