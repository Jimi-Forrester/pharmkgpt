31325784|t|Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of hydroxypyridinone-coumarin hybrids as multimodal monoamine oxidase B inhibitors and iron chelates against Alzheimer's disease.
31325784|a|A series of hybrids of hydroxypyridinone and coumarin were rationally designed, synthesized and biologically evaluated for their iron ion chelating and MAO-B inhibitory activities. Most of the compounds displayed excellent iron ion chelating effects and moderate to good anti-MAO-B activities. Compound 27a exhibited the most potent activity against MAO-B, with an IC50 value of 14.7 nM. Importantly, 27a showed good U251 cell protective effect and significantly ameliorated the cognitive dysfunction of scopolamine-induced AD mice. Moreover, molecular docking was performed to elucidate the probable ligand-receptor interaction, and the structure-activity relationships were also summarized.
