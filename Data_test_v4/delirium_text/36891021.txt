36891021|t|Predicting Postoperative Emergence Delirium From the Heart Rate Variability of Patients Undergoing Elective Cardiac Surgery.
36891021|a|Background and objective The complication of postoperative delirium is directly linked to prognosis, leading to prolonged hospital stays and an increase in mortality. Since there is no magic medicine that cures delirium, the prevention of its onset is important, and the development of simple tools that enable the early assessment of the risk is valuable. In the previous study, we hypothesized that postoperative delirium could be predicted from heart rate variability (HRV) measured by using an electrocardiogram (ECG) on the day before elective esophageal cancer surgery. HRV is calculated based on the fluctuation of RR intervals on ECG. The preoperative high-frequency (HF) power in delirium patients was significantly lower than that in non-delirium patients. The HF component is considered a reflection of parasympathetic function. In the current study, we evaluated the hypothesis that parasympathetic nerve activity is low in the resting HRV on the night before surgery in patients who go on to develop postoperative delirium. To that end, we recorded resting HRV in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery on the night before surgery. We then compared the HRV between patients with and without delirium in the postoperative intensive care unit (ICU). The Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) was used to diagnose delirium. Methods This was a prospective observational study involving patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. After obtaining approval from the institutional review board, patients aged 65 years and older were enrolled in the study. The day before surgery, a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was performed. The ECG was used in patients for five minutes. All patients were transferred to the ICU after surgery, and CAM-ICU was measured every eight hours until discharge from the ICU, and positive patients were diagnosed with delirium. Results In this study, 14 patients who developed delirium and 22 patients who did not were included in the analysis. The average MMSE score was 27.4, with no patients diagnosed with preoperative dementia. In the analysis of HRV, the HF component was significantly lower in the group with delirium compared to the group without delirium (Mann-Whitney U test, p<0.05). Conclusion Based on our findings, in patients with postoperative delirium, the activity of parasympathetic nerves was lower than before surgery, and we concluded that it is possible to predict the onset of postoperative delirium based on preoperative ECG measurement.
