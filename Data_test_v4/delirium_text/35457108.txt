35457108|t|Potential Pro-Inflammatory Effect of Vitamin E Analogs through Mitigation of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) Binding to the Cannabinoid 2 Receptor.
35457108|a|Vitamin E acetate, which is used as a diluent of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), has been reported as the primary causative agent of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). Here, we employ in vitro assays, docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations to investigate the interaction of vitamin E with the membrane-bound cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R), and its role in modulating the binding affinity of THC to CB2R. From the MD simulations, we determined that vitamin E interacts with both CB2R and membrane phospholipids. Notably, the synchronized effect of these interactions likely facilitates vitamin E acting as a lipid modulator for the cannabinoid system. Furthermore, MD simulation and trajectory analysis show that when THC binds to CB2R in the presence of vitamin E, the binding cavity widens, facilitating the entry of water molecules into it, leading to a reduced interaction of THC with CB2R. Additionally, the interaction between THC and vitamin E in solution is stabilized by several H bonds, which can directly limit the interaction of free THCs with CB2R. Overall, both the MD simulations and the in vitro dissociation assay results indicate that THC binding to CB2R is reduced in the presence of vitamin E. Our study discusses the role of vitamin E in limiting the effect of THCs and its implications on the reported pathology of EVALI.
