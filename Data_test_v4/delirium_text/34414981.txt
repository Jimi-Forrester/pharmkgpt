34414981|a|ABSTRACT: Postoperative delirium (PD) remains an issue in cardiac surgery despite the constant efforts to reduce its incidence. In this retrospective study, the incidence of PD was evaluated in patients who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) according to different primary anesthetic agents: sevoflurane and dexmedetomidine- versus propofol-based anesthesia.A total of 534 patients who underwent heart-valve surgery or coronary artery bypass graft surgery with CPB between January 2012 and August 2017 were divided into 2 groups according to the main anesthetic agent: sevoflurane with dexmedetomidine (sevo-dex group, n = 340) and propofol (propofol group, n = 194). The incidence of PD was evaluated as the primary outcome. Patient-, surgery-, and anesthesia-related factors and postoperative complications were investigated as secondary outcomes. To reduce the risk of confounding effects between the 2 groups, 194 patients were selected from the sevo-dex group after propensity-score matching.After propensity-score matching, the incidence of PD was not significantly different between the sevo-dex (6.2%) and propofol (10.8%) groups (P = .136). In comparisons of the incidence of each type of PD, only hyperactive PD occurred significantly less frequently in the sevo-dex group (P = .021). Older age, lower preoperative albumin levels, and emergency surgery were significant risk factors for PD.The overall incidence of PD after cardiac surgery with CPB did not differ between patients receiving sevoflurane and dexmedetomidine-based versus propofol-based anesthesia. Only hyperactive PD occurred less frequently in patients receiving sevoflurane and dexmedetomidine-based anesthesia.
