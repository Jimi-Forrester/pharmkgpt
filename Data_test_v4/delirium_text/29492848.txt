29492848|a|The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication network functionally linking the gut and the central nervous system (CNS). Based on this, the rational manipulation of intestinal microbiota represents a novel attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CNS-associated disorders. In this study, we explored the properties of a probiotic formulation (namely SLAB51) in counteracting brain oxidative damages associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, transgenic AD mice (3xTg-AD) were treated with SLAB51 and the effects on protein oxidation, neuronal antioxidant defence and repair systems were monitored, with the particular focus on the role of SIRT1-related pathways. We demonstrated that SLAB51 markedly reduced oxidative stress in AD mice brain by activating SIRT1-dependent mechanisms, thus representing a promising therapeutic adjuvant in AD treatment.
