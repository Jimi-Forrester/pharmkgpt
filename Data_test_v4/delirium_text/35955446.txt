35955446|t|An Association between Insulin Resistance and Neurodegeneration in Zebrafish Larval Model (Danio rerio).
35955446|a|Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus has recently been identified as a mediator of neurodegeneration. However, the molecular mechanisms have not been clearly elucidated. We aimed to investigate insulin resistance associated with neurodegenerative events in zebrafish larvae. Methods: Larvae aged 72 h-post-fertilization (hpf) were induced to insulin resistance by immersion in 250 nM insulin and were then reinduced with 100 nM insulin at 96 hpf. This model was validated by a glucose levels assay, qPCR analysis of selected genes (akt, pepck, zglut3 and claudin-5a) and Oil Red-O (ORO) staining of the yolk sac for lipid distribution. The association of insulin resistance and neurodegeneration was validated by malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) assays, and by integrating next-generation sequencing with database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID). Results: There was a significant increase in glucose levels at 180 min in the insulin-resistant group. However, it decreased at 400 min after the re-challenge. Insulin-signaling mediators, akt and pepck, were showed significantly downregulated up to 400 min after insulin immersion (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, claudin-5a assessed blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and showed significant deterioration after 400 min of post-insulin immersion. ORO staining remarked the increase in yolk sac size in the insulin-resistant group. After the confirmation of insulin resistance, MDA levels increased significantly in the insulin-resistant group compared to the control group in the following parameters. Furthermore, dysregulated MAPK- and Wnt/Ca2+-signaling pathways were observed in the insulin-resistant group, disrupting energy metabolism and causing BBB injury. Conclusions: We conclude that the insulin-resistant zebrafish larvae alter the metabolic physiology associated with neurodegeneration.
