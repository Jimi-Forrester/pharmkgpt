37761041|t|Effect of Wild Strawberry Tree and Hawthorn Extracts Fortification on Functional, Physicochemical, Microbiological, and Sensory Properties of Yogurt.
37761041|a|The composition analyses and health-promoting properties (antioxidant capacity, antidiabetic, and antihypertensive properties) of wild fruit extracts and the effect of the incorporation of strawberry tree (STE) and hawthorn (HTE) extracts on the physicochemical, instrumental textural, microbiological, and sensory parameters of yogurts were evaluated. The incorporation of wild fruit extracts in yogurt increased antioxidant and antidiabetic properties (inhibition of digestive alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, and lipase enzymatic activities) compared to the control, without decreasing their sensory quality or acceptance by consumers. The hawthorn yogurt (YHTE) showed the highest total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant capacity (ABTS and ORAC methods). Yogurts containing wild fruit extracts and dietary fiber achieved high overall acceptance scores (6.16-7.04) and showed stable physicochemical, textural, and microbiological properties. Therefore, the use of wild fruit extracts and inulin-type fructans as ingredients in yogurt manufacture stands as a first step towards the development of non-added sugar dairy foods for sustainable health.
