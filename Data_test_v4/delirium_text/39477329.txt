39477329|a|PURPOSE: Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) reduces postoperative complications (POCs) after colorectal surgery; however, its impact on the management of POCs remains unclear. This study compared the diagnosis and management of POCs before and after implementing our ERAS protocol after laparoscopic or robotic colectomy for cancer and examined the short- and mid-term oncologic impacts. METHODS: This single-center, retrospective study evaluated all consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic or robotic colectomy for cancer between 2012 and 2021, focusing on the incidence of POCs within 90 days. We compared outcomes before (standard group) and after (ERAS group) the implementation of our ERAS protocol in January 2016. RESULTS: Significantly fewer patients in the ERAS group developed POCs (standard vs. ERAS, 136 of 380 patients [35.8%] vs.136 of 660 patients [20.6%]; P<0.01). The ERAS group had a significantly shorter mean total length of stay after POCs (13.1 days vs. 11.4 days, P=0.04), and the rates of life-threatening complications (6.7% vs. 0.7%) and 1-year mortality (7.4% vs. 1.5%) were significantly lower in the ERAS group than in the standard group. Among patients with anastomotic complications, laparoscopic reoperation was significantly more common in the ERAS group than in the standard group (8.3% vs. 75.0%, P<0.01). Among patients with postoperative ileus, the diagnosis and recovery times were significantly shorter in the ERAS group than in the standard group, resulting in a shorter total length of stay (13.5 days vs. 10 days, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The implementation of an ERAS protocol did not eliminate all POCs, but it did accelerate their diagnosis and management and improved patient outcomes.
