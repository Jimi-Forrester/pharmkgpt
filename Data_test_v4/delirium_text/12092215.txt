12092215|a|Cytokines involved in the immune process proof, also, the neurotransmitter role, being synthesized by various cells of the body, with specific genes participation. Cytokines can act on the some membrane receptor like the neurotransmitters, and they can produce diverse biological effects. Pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory or haematopoetic cytokines as those in the central nervous system can be identified by immunoassay and bioassay methods. Recent works show that the cytokines implication in hypothalamo-hypophyso-corticopsuprarenal and gonad axis have consequence on ACTH, corticoids and LH secretion, explaining the ovulatory and gestational disorders. Excessive or insufficient cytokines synthesis, at neuronal level (astrocytes, microglies), explains psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, Alzheimer's disease; cytokines (interferon) long term use for the treatment of some diseases, produce irritability, anxiety, delirium, and confusion etc.
