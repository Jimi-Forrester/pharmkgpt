38291461|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare the analgesic efficacy of transthoracic intercostal nerve block (TINB) and percutaneous intercostal nerve block (PINB) for video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) using a retrospective analysis. METHODS: A total of 336 patients who underwent VATS between January 2021 and June 2022 were reviewed retrospectively. Of the participants, 194 received TINB and were assigned to the T group, while 142 patients received PINB and were assigned to the P group. Both groups received 25 ml of ropivacaine via TINB or PINB at the end of the surgery. The study measured opioid consumption, pain scores, analgesic satisfaction, and safety. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was performed to minimize selection bias due to nonrandom assignment. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, 86 patients from each group were selected for analysis. The P group had significantly lower cumulative opioid consumption than the T group (p < 0.01). The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores were lower for the P group than the T group at 6 and 12 h post-surgery (p < 0.01); however, there was no significant difference in the scores between the two groups at 3, 24, and 48 h (p > 0.05). The analgesic satisfaction in the P group was higher than in the T group (p < 0.05). The incidence of back pain, nausea or vomiting, pruritus, dizziness, and skin numbness between the two groups was statistically insignificant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The study suggests that PINB provides superior analgesia for patients undergoing thoracic surgery compared to TINB without any extra adverse effects.
