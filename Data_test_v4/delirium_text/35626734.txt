35626734|t|Interaction of Cationic Carbosilane Dendrimers and Their siRNA Complexes with MCF-7 Cells Cultured in 3D Spheroids.
35626734|a|Cationic dendrimers are effective carriers for the delivery of siRNA into cells; they can penetrate cell membranes and protect nucleic acids against RNase degradation. Two types of dendrimers (CBD-1 and CBD-2) and their complexes with pro-apoptotic siRNA (Mcl-1 and Bcl-2) were tested on MCF-7 cells cultured as spheroids. Cytotoxicity of dendrimers and dendriplexes was measured using the live-dead test and Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (flow cytometry). Uptake of dendriplexes was examined using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The live-dead test showed that for cells in 3D, CBD-2 is more toxic than CBD-1, contrasting with the data for 2D cultures. Attaching siRNA to a dendrimer molecule did not lead to increased cytotoxic effect in cells, either after 24 or 48 h. Measurements of apoptosis did not show a high increase in the level of the apoptosis marker after 24 h exposure of spheroids to CBD-2 and its dendriplexes. Measurements of the internalization of dendriplexes and microscopy images confirmed that the dendriplexes were transported into cells of the spheroids. Flow cytometry analysis of internalization indicated that CBD-2 transported siRNAs more effectively than CBD-1. Cytotoxic effects were visible after incubation with 3 doses of complexes for CBD-1 and both siRNAs.
