37569815|t|Move Your Body toward Healthy Aging: Potential Neuroprotective Mechanisms of Irisin in Alzheimer's Disease.
37569815|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in older adults, having a significant global burden and increasing prevalence. Current treatments for AD only provide symptomatic relief and do not cure the disease. Physical activity has been extensively studied as a potential preventive measure against cognitive decline and AD. Recent research has identified a hormone called irisin, which is produced during exercise, that has shown promising effects on cognitive function. Irisin acts on the brain by promoting neuroprotection by enhancing the growth and survival of neurons. It also plays a role in metabolism, energy regulation, and glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, irisin has been found to modulate autophagy, which is a cellular process involved in the clearance of protein aggregates, which are a hallmark of AD. Additionally, irisin has been shown to protect against cell death, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, all of which are implicated in AD pathogenesis. However, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms and therapeutic potential of irisin in AD. Despite the current gaps in knowledge, irisin holds promise as a potential therapeutic target for slowing cognitive decline and improving quality of life in AD patients.
