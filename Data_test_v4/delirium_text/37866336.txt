37866336|a|Melatonin, a neurohormone secreted by the pineal gland and regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, is synthesized and directly released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the third ventricle (3rdv), where it undergoes rapid absorption by surrounding tissues to exert its physiological function. The hippocampus, a vital structure in the limbic system adjacent to the ventricles, plays a pivotal role in emotional response and memory formation. Melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that primarily mediate melatonin's receptor-dependent effects. In comparison to the MT1 receptor, the widely expressed MT2 receptor is crucial for mediating melatonin's biological functions within the hippocampus. Specifically, MT2 receptor is implicated in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory processes, as well as neurogenesis and axogenesis. Numerous studies have demonstrated the involvement of MT2 receptors in the pathophysiology and pharmacology of Alzheimer's disease, depression, and epilepsy. This review focuses on the anatomical localization of MT2 receptor in the hippocampus, their physiological function in this region, and their signal transduction and pharmacological roles in neurological disorders. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive review of MT2 receptor ligands used in psychopharmacology and other MT2-selective ligands over recent years. Ultimately, we provide an outlook on future research for selective MT2 receptor drug candidates.
