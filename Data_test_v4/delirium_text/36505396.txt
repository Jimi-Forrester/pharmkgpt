36505396|a|Introduction: Dementia as an inevitable aging consequence has been challenged and underscores the need for investigations of the factors that confer resilience. We examine whether the functionally advantageous KL-VS variant of the putative aging suppressor KLOTHO gene attenuates age-related cognitive decline and deleterious biomolecular changes. Methods: Trajectories of change in memory and executive function (N = 360; 2-12 visits) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers-amyloid beta (Abeta)42, total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau) (N = 112; 2-4 samplings)-were compared between KL-VS non-carriers and heterozygotes in middle-aged and older adults from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention and the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center studies. Results: Memory and executive function declined (p's  <=    0.001) and CSF t-tau, p-tau, t-tau/Abeta42, and p-tau/Abeta42 levels increased (all p's  <=    0.004) with age. The rate of p-tau accumulation was attenuated for KL-VS heterozygotes (p = 0.03). Discussion: KL-VS heterozygosity may confer resilience to AD-associated biomolecular changes.
