36155662|t|Imaging of the optic nerve: technological advances and future prospects.
36155662|a|Over the past decade, ocular imaging strategies have greatly advanced the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with optic neuropathies. Developments in optic nerve imaging have specifically improved the care of patients with papilloedema and idiopathic intracranial hypertension, inflammatory optic neuropathies, and compressive optic neuropathies. For example, optic nerve imaging with optical coherence tomography (OCT) is now widely used as an outcome measure in clinical trials of neurological disorders (eg, demyelinating diseases), and OCT findings could be informative of disease progression in patients with various neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease). In the past 5 years, multimodality optic nerve imaging has expanded to systematically include focused and wide-field colour and autofluorescence fundus photographs; various types of optic nerve, macular, and vascular OCT; and specific MRI techniques. Such multimodality imaging makes the diagnosis of optic neuropathies easier and provides objective information on optic nerve damage, which is useful for prognosis. Non-mydriatic ocular fundus cameras and OCT have become readily available in non-ophthalmic settings and could easily be implemented in neurological clinics and emergency departments, allowing for direct access to optic nerve imaging and enabling teleconsultations. In the future, these imaging studies could be used in association with artificial intelligence deep-learning systems, which are already transforming the field of ocular imaging.
