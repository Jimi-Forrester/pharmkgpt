34682704|a|The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many hospitalized patients and deaths worldwide. Coronavirus patients were isolated from their relatives and visits were banned to prevent contagion. This has brought about a significant change in deeply rooted care habits in Mediterranean and Latin American countries where the family normally accompanies vulnerable hospitalized patients. The aim of this qualitative study was to examine the hospitalization experience of COVID-19 patients and their family members. A phenomenological qualitative approach was used. Data collection included inductive, in-depth interviews with 11 COVID-19 hospitalized patients. The mean age of patients was 55.4 years and 45% were female. Nearly 50% required Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. Ten meaningful statements were identified and grouped in three themes: Positive and negative aspects of the care provided, the patient's perspective, and perception of the experience of the disease. In conclusion, COVID-19 patients, aware of the severity of the pandemic, were very adaptable to the situation and had full confidence in health professionals. Patient isolation was perceived as necessary. Technology has helped to maintain communication between patients and relatives.
