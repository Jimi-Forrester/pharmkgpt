29517685|t|The altered Granger causality connection among pain-related brain networks in migraine.
29517685|a|Numerous fMRI studies have confirmed functional abnormalities in resting-state brain networks in migraine patients. However, few studies focusing on causal relationships of pain-related brain networks in migraine have been conducted. This study aims to explore the difference of Granger causality connection among pain-related brain networks in migraine without aura (MWoA) patients.Twenty two MWoA patients and 17 matched healthy subjects were recruited to undergo resting-state fMRI scanning. Independent component analysis was used to extract pain-related brain networks, and Granger causality analysis to characterize the difference of Granger causality connection among pain-related brain networks was employed.Seven pain-related brain networks were identified, and MwoA patients showed more complex Granger causality connections in comparison with healthy subjects. Two-sample t test results displayed that there was the significant difference between right-frontoparietal network (RFPN) and executive control network (ECN).This study indicates that the specific intrinsic brain Granger causality connectivity among pain-related networks in MwoA patients are affected after long-term migraine attacks.
