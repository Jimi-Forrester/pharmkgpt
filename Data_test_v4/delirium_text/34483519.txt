34483519|t|Does application of complexity theory simplify concepts of psychiatry: Analogies and insights.
34483519|a|Scientific curiosity has not been able to explain the cause of psychiatric illness based on primarily biological or social paradigm. Available literatures were explored to understand causality of psychiatric illness from perspective of physics. Theory of complexity and other relevant theories were extrapolated to address these questions. Mental illness appeared to be a complex interplay of reductionism and emergentism, genetic and epigenetics, stress and the vulnerability or the core and the periphery. Mental illness displayed complex interaction between biological trait and environmental state.
