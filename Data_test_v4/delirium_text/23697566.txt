23697566|a|We have been reviewing the literature on sleep in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, concluding that lack of normal sleep is a common problem. Polysomnography studies have demonstrated sleep deprivation and fragmentation. Delirium commonly coincides with sleep deprivation and shares the same symptoms. Mechanically ventilated patients have traditionally been sedated, making sleep scoring unreliable. There is a need for further studies exploring the relationship between circadian rhythm disturbance, sleep disorders, delirium and sedation in ICU patients.
