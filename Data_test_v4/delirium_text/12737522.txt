12737522|a|Cholesterol has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, both through intracellular effects, and through an extracellular effect due to its physical interaction with plaque associated amyloid. Epidemiology studies have implicated high cholesterol as a risk factor for AD, and have shown that the use of cholesterol reducing agents (statins) can be protective against the disease. We, and others have shown that cholesterol levels modulate the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) both in vivo and in vitro, affecting the accumulation of Abeta (Abeta) peptides which may directly impact the risk of AD. This review describes the biology of sterols, and identifies how cholesterol may exacerbate the pathogenesis of AD. Data from in vivo and in vitro studies will then be presented to describe how treatments aimed at modulating lipid levels may be efficacious in treating AD.
