34732947|a|BACKGROUND: In older adults (aged 60 years and above), mental health problems are gaining public health importance because of the increasing prevalence, disease burden, disability, morbidity, and mortality. Epidemiological studies on major mental health disorders such as depression and dementia in older adults have contributed to a better understanding of the distribution and determinants of these conditions. Identifying potential risk factors has stimulated interventional research on preventing these conditions under the public health framework towards their management. The increasing burden of geriatric mental health conditions like dementia in developing countries like India can contribute to significant challenges if there is no adequate strengthening of the public health response. This includes scaling up the measures of prevention, public awareness, early diagnosis, and quality health and social care equitably available to all sections of the population. The Decade of Healthy Ageing (2021-2030) provides the opportunity for concerted and coordinated initiatives to improve intrinsic capacity (physical and mental) and offer an age-friendly environment to enhance the functional ability of all older adults. METHODS: This article reviews the critical public health issues related to geriatric mental health in India.
