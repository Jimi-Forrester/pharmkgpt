36556445|a|With an incidence of over 1.5 million worldwide per annum, breast cancer continues to be the most common cancer affecting the female population. The main and most effective treatment in over 40% of these patients is a primary neoplasm resection. General anaesthesia, at times in association with loco-regional anaesthetics, is the most commonly used anaesthesia technique for radical mastectomies. Nausea, vomiting, and considerable postoperative pain, which are commonly experienced side effects and complications of general anaesthesia, tend, however, to augment most patients' post-surgical morbidity. A growing body of research has shown that loco-regional anaesthesia often used together with and, in some cases, in the substitution of general anaesthesia can be a safe, effective alternative. This work is a case report regarding a 94-year-old elderly patient who was anaesthetised during a left radical mastectomy using exclusively combined interpectoral and pectoserratus plane blocks.
