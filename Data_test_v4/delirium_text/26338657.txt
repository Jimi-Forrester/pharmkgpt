26338657|a|OBJECTIVES: This study characterized symptoms of acute stress and depression in caregivers present during the hospitalization of a loved one with delirium. METHODS: This is an observational, cross-sectional analysis of caregivers of patients hospitalized with delirium. Standardized questionnaires were used in caregiver interviews to assess psychological reactions to traumatic situations and understanding of medical care. RESULTS: Of the 40 caregivers recruited, half had significant symptoms of acute stress and 12.5% of caregivers were highly symptomatic across all domains related to trauma. Elevated acute stress was positively correlated with both past or current depression and prior mental health treatment (p < 0.028). The caregivers who ranked witnessing delirium as having a negative impact on their lives were also at elevated risk (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers witnessing delirium are at elevated risk for experiencing severe acute traumatic and depressive symptoms, and this response might place them at risk for developing traumatic disorders.
