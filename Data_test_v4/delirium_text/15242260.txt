15242260|t|Alzheimer's disease and oral care.
15242260|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest form of dementia, closely associated with age, but also with other causative factors. AD affects half a million people in the UK, and presents dentists with numerous behavioural and clinical challenges. The aetiology, diagnosis and medical treatment for persons with AD are discussed, together with communication strategies and issues related to families and care-givers. Realistic dental treatment planning for patients in early, moderate and late stage AD is considered in conjunction with relevant ethical issues. Dentists have the potential to improve markedly the quality of life for people with AD.
