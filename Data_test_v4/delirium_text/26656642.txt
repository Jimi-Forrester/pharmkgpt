26656642|t|Cognitive Results of CANTAB Tests and Their Change Due to the First Dose of Donepezil May Predict Treatment Efficacy in Alzheimer Disease.
26656642|a|BACKGROUND Ability to predict the efficacy of treatment in Alzheimer disease (AD) may be very useful in clinical practice. Cognitive predictors should be investigated alongside with the demographic, genetic, and other predictors of treatment efficacy. The aim of this study was to establish whether the baseline measures of CANTAB tests and their changes due to the first donepezil dose are able to predict the efficacy of treatment after 4 months of therapy. We also compared the predictive value of cognitive, clinical, and demographic predictors of treatment efficacy in AD. MATERIAL AND METHODS Seventy-two AD patients (62 treatment-naive and 10 donepezil-treated) and 30 controls were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, rater-blinded, follow-up study. Treatment-naive AD patients were randomized to 2 groups to take the first donepezil dose after the first or second CANTAB testing, separated by 4 hours. Follow-up Test 3 was performed 4 months after the initial assessment. RESULTS The groups were similar in age, education, gender, Hachinski index, and depression. General Regression Models (GRM) have shown that cognitive changes after the first dose of donepezil in PAL (t-values for regression coefficients from 3.43 to 6.44), PRMd (t=4.33), SWM (t=5.85) test scores, and baseline results of PAL (t=2.57-2.86), PRM (t=3.08), and CRT (t=3.42) tests were significant predictors of long-term donepezil efficacy in AD (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The cognitive changes produced by the first donepezil dose in CANTAB PAL, PRM, and SWM test measures are able to predict the long-term efficacy of donepezil in AD. Baseline PAL, PRM, and CRT test results were significant predictors.
