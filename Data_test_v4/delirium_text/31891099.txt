31891099|t|Hybrid Graphene/Conducting Polymer Strip Sensors for Sensitive and Selective Electrochemical Detection of Serotonin.
31891099|a|There is an urgent need for electrochemical sensor materials that exhibit electrochemically compliant properties while also retaining high durability under physiological conditions. Herein, we demonstrate a novel strip-style electrochemical sensor using reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and poly(ethylene dioxythiophene)/poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT/PSS) nanocomposite films. The fabricated rGO-PEDOT/PSS sensor with and without nafion has shown an effective electrochemical response for both selectivity and sensitivity of the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) neurotransmitter. The developed high-performance hybrid graphene/conducting polymer strip sensors are likely to find applications as chip electrochemical sensor devices for patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.
