24089700|a|The 10th Global College of Neuroprotection and Neuroregeneration Annual Conference in collaboration with the 6th International Association of Neurorestoratology VI Intercontinental Hotel, Bucharest, Romania, 4-7 April 2013 The 10th Global College of Neuroproetction and Neuroregeneration Annual Conference together with the International Association of Neurorestoratology VI was held in Bucharest under the auspicious of the Society for the Study of Neuroprotection and Neuroplasticity during 4-7 April 2013. The focus of these unified societies meeting was on neurorestoration, neuroprotection and neuroregeneration in various clinical neurodegenerative diseases; for example, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's disease, stroke and brain or spinal cord injuries. The main aim to enhance healthcare was suggested by the use of stem cells, nanodrug delivery of drugs and stem cells, use of multimodal drugs as well as a combination of different approaches. The meeting was attended by more than 500 delegates including researches, policy makers and healthcare professionals along with several representatives from drug industries from Europe and USA. It appears that future of neuroprotection could be achieved by the use of stem cells and nanodrug delivery in chronic neurological disorders.
