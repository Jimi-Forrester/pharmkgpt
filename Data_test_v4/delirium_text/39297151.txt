39297151|a|Objective: We aimed to develop and validate a novel multimodal framework Hierarchical Multi-task Auxiliary Learning (HiMAL) framework, for predicting cognitive composite functions as auxiliary tasks that estimate the longitudinal risk of transition from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Materials and Methods: HiMAL utilized multimodal longitudinal visit data including imaging features, cognitive assessment scores, and clinical variables from MCI patients in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, to predict at each visit if an MCI patient will progress to AD within the next 6 months. Performance of HiMAL was compared with state-of-the-art single-task and multitask baselines using area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) and precision recall curve (AUPRC) metrics. An ablation study was performed to assess the impact of each input modality on model performance. Additionally, longitudinal explanations regarding risk of disease progression were provided to interpret the predicted cognitive decline. Results: Out of 634 MCI patients (mean [IQR] age: 72.8 [67-78], 60% male), 209 (32%) progressed to AD. HiMAL showed better prediction performance compared to all state-of-the-art longitudinal single-modality singe-task baselines (AUROC = 0.923 [0.915-0.937]; AUPRC = 0.623 [0.605-0.644]; all P < .05). Ablation analysis highlighted that imaging and cognition scores with maximum contribution towards prediction of disease progression. Discussion: Clinically informative model explanations anticipate cognitive decline 6 months in advance, aiding clinicians in future disease progression assessment. HiMAL relies on routinely collected electronic health records (EHR) variables for proximal (6 months) prediction of AD onset, indicating its translational potential for point-of-care monitoring and managing of high-risk patients.
