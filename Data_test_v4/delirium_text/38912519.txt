38912519|a|Excessive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) has been associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinical studies have further proven that elimination of Abeta can be a viable therapeutic option. In the current study, we conceptualized a fusion membrane protein, referred to as synthetic alpha-secretase (SAS), that can cleave amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Abeta specifically at the alpha-site. In mammalian cells, SAS indeed cleaved APP and Abeta at the alpha-site. Overexpression of SAS in the hippocampus was achieved by direct injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) that expresses SAS (AAV9-SAS) into the bilateral ventricles of mouse brains. SAS enhanced the non-amyloidogenic processing of APP, thus reducing the levels of soluble Abeta and plaques in the 5xFAD mice. In addition, SAS significantly attenuated the cognitive deficits in 5xFAD mice, as demonstrated by novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests. Unlike other Abeta-cleaving proteases, SAS has highly strict substrate specificity. We propose that SAS can be an efficient modality to eliminate excessive Abeta from diseased brains.
