32426174|t|One-Year Mortality Rates Following Fracture of the Femoral Neck Treated With Hip Arthroplasty in an Aging Saudi Population: A Trauma Center Experience.
32426174|a|INTRODUCTION: Femoral neck fracture is a common problem in elderly patients, and it is managed with either total hip arthroplasty or hemiarthroplasty with very good outcomes. However, the reported 1-year mortality rate is as high as 33%. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort study. The electronic patient records were searched for all physiologically old patients with displaced femoral neck fractures that were managed with either hemiarthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty. The primary aim of this study was to estimate morbidity and mortality rates at 30 days and 1 year. The secondary outcome was to determine major complications and factors influencing mortality. RESULTS: From January 2017 to December 2018, a total of 99 patients were included in the study. Of those, 57 were female patients. The mortality rate was 15.2%. The significant predictors of death included the age at the time of surgery, readmission within 30 days of initial admission, acute renal impairment, and the need for preoperative medical intervention. Patients treated with total hip arthroplasty had lower mortality rates than those treated with hemiarthroplasty (P = .017). DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study conducted in Saudi Arabia to report detailed perioperative-related complications and outcomes following neck of femur fractures. The results of our study confirm the persistently high morbidity and mortality associated with this patient group. CONCLUSION: Efforts should be aimed at optimizing preoperative medical management, which is vital to ensure early identification of medically unfit patients.
