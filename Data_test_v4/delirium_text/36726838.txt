36726838|t|In Silico Structural and Functional Analyses of NLRP3 Inflammasomes to Provide Insights for Treating Neurodegenerative Diseases.
36726838|a|Inflammasomes are cytoplasmic intracellular multiprotein complexes that control the innate immune system's activation of inflammation in response to derived chemicals. Recent advancements increased our molecular knowledge of activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes. Although several studies have been done to investigate the role of inflammasomes in innate immunity and other diseases, structural, functional, and evolutionary investigations are needed to further understand the clinical consequences of NLRP3 gene. The purpose of this study is to investigate the structural and functional impact of the NLRP3 protein by using a computational analysis to uncover putative protein sites involved in the stabilization of the protein-ligand complexes with inhibitors. This will allow for a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying these interactions. It was found that human NLRP3 gene coexpresses with PYCARD, NLRC4, CASP1, MAVS, and CTSB based on observed coexpression of homologs in other species. The NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain-containing protein 3 is a key player in innate immunity and inflammation as the sensor subunit of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The inflammasome polymeric complex, consisting of NLRP3, PYCARD, and CASP1, is formed in response to pathogens and other damage-associated signals (and possibly CASP4 and CASP5). Comprehensive structural and functional analyses of NLRP3 inflammasome components offer a fresh approach to the development of new treatments for a wide variety of human disorders.
