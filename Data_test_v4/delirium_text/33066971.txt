33066971|a|The widespread use of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) has resulted in its ubiquitous presence in the environment, which has led to serious health concerns. One of these concerns is its possible link to Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common neurodegenerative disease in aged individuals. This study investigated whether early-life and chronic exposure to DEHP affects AD via the toxicity of amyloid-beta (Abeta), which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD, using Caenorhabditis elegans AD models (strains CL4176 and CL2006). We show that early-life DEHP exposure increased Abeta toxicity in C. elegans strains CL4176 and CL2006. Early-life and chronic exposure to DEHP also significantly increased intracellular ROS levels and Abeta deposition in aged CL2006 nematodes. Moreover, it was found that DEHP-induced Abeta toxicity does not require transcription factors DAF-16 or SKN-1, while early-life and chronic exposure to DEHP significantly increased the accumulation of lysosome-related organelles and the mRNA levels of the autophagy-related gene bec-1 in aged CL2006 nematodes. Our findings suggest that early-life and chronic exposure to DEHP enhances Abeta toxicity, which may be associated with the autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathway in C. elegans.
