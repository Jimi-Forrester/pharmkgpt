17088170|t|Preoperative predictors of delirium after cardiac surgery: a preliminary study.
17088170|a|Preoperative risk factors of postoperative delirium were evaluated in 260 patients admitted for open heart surgery. The incidence of delirium was 11.5%. Independent predictors included cognitive impairment, atrial fibrillation, a history of peripheral vascular disease major depression and advanced age. Aforementioned factors might be helpful in predicting delirium following cardiac surgery.
