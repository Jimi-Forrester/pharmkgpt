36674787|t|Sex-Dependent Effect of Chronic Piromelatine Treatment on Prenatal Stress-Induced Memory Deficits in Rats.
36674787|a|Prenatal stress impairs cognitive function in rats, while Piromelatine treatment corrects memory decline in male rats with chronic mild stress. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of chronic treatment with the melatonin analogue Piromelatine on the associative and spatial hippocampus-dependent memory of male and female offspring with a history of prenatal stress (PNS). We report that male and female young adult offspring with PNS treated with a vehicle had reduced memory responses in an object recognition test (ORT). However, the cognitive performance in the radial arm maze test (RAM) was worsened only in the male offspring. The 32-day treatment with Piromelatine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) of male and female offspring with PNS attenuated the impaired responses in the ORT task. Furthermore, the melatonin analogue corrected the disturbed spatial memory in the male offspring. While the ratio of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (pCREB/CREB) was reduced in the two sexes with PNS and treated with a vehicle, the melatonin analogue elevated the ratio of these signaling molecules in the hippocampus of the male rats only. Our results suggest that Piromelatine exerts a beneficial effect on PNS-induced spatial memory impairment in a sex-dependent manner that might be mediated via the pCREB/CREB pathway.
