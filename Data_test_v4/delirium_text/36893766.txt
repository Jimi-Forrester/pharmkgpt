36893766|t|Burden of Illness Among Patients with Psychosis due to Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Other Dementias.
36893766|a|Limited research is available on the real-world experiences of patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). This study evaluated clinical events, healthcare utilization, and healthcare costs of patients with DLB vs other dementia types with psychosis (ODP). Study patients included commercial and Medicare Advantage with Part D enrollees aged >=40 years with evidence of DLB and ODP from 6/01/2015-5/31/2019. Compared with patients with ODP, more patients with DLB had clinical events including anticholinergic effects, neurologic effects, and cognitive decline. Patients with DLB used more healthcare resources with greater dementia-related office and outpatient visits and psychosis-related inpatient stays and office, outpatient, and emergency visits compared with their ODP patient counterparts. Patients with DLB also incurred higher healthcare costs for all-cause and dementia-related office visits and pharmacy fills, and psychosis-related total costs. Understanding the clinical and economic impact of DLB and ODP is important to improve care for patients with dementia.
