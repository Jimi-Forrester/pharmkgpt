Despite recent approvals of anti-amyloid antibodies, there remains a need for disease-modifying and easily accessible therapies. The endocannabinoid system presents a promising target for AD treatment, as it regulates various processes implicated in AD pathogenesis. AIMS: This study assesses the effects of the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 on AD pathology and behavior deficits in aged 5XFAD mice, a well-established AD model. METHODS: Male 9-month-old 5XFAD mice received either 0.2 mg/kg WIN 55,212-2 or a vehicle solution for 42 days. Memory, anxiety, and motor tests were conducted at 10 months to identify potential changes in behavior and cognition following WIN 55,212-2 treatment. Additionally, the effects of prolonged WIN 55,212-2 treatment on Abeta pathology and neuroinflammation in the brain were quantified immunohistochemically. RESULTS: Therapeutic WIN 55,212-2 treatment improved the motor performance of 5XFAD mice on the rotarod and rescued memory deficits in the water maze. However, WIN 55,212-2 treatment did not significantly affect anxiety-like behavior in 5XFAD mice. Additionally, prolonged treatment with WIN 55,212-2 reduced Abeta plaque pathology and astrogliosis in the cortex and hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the therapeutic potential of WIN 55,212-2 in AD by ameliorating cognitive and motor deficits and reducing neuropathology. These findings support a cannabinoid-based therapy as a promising strategy for AD treatment, with WIN 55,212-2 emerging as a potential candidate.
