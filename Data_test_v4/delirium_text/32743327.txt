32743327|t|Utility of Frailty Screening Tools in Older Surgical Patients.
32743327|a|Frailty is a loss of functional reserve that compromises a person's ability to cope with stressors such as surgery. Identifying and quantifying frailty may enable intensive rehabilitation interventions, caregiver support, or consideration of palliative care before surgery. This study describes the characteristics of five frailty screening tools, namely the Geriatric 8, Vulnerable Elders Survey-13, the Groningen Frailty Indicator, Edmonton Frailty Scale (EFS), and Clinical Frailty Scale. We further propose an approach incorporating a frailty scale into preoperative assessment, wherein older patients undergoing elective general surgery are screened using EFS, and frail patients are offered comprehensive geriatric assessment. The expected outcome is an individualized patient-centered care plan that will reduce frailty and optimize the patient's condition before surgery.
