37505522|t|Zinc Phosphide Poisoning: From A to Z.
37505522|a|Zinc phosphide is a rodenticide that is used in agricultural, urban and industrial environments in Mexico. After ingestion, it reacts with hydrochloric acid, hydrolyzing into phosphine. It causes cellular hypoxia via mitochondrial toxicity, resulting in multiple organ dysfunction and death. There is no antidote or specific treatment for zinc phosphide toxicity. We present the case of a 45-year-old female who ingested zinc phosphide with suicidal intent. On arrival at the emergency department, she had multisystemic disorders. Supportive care, decontamination and antidotal therapy were initiated. Subsequently, she evolved to clinical improvement with a resolution of the biochemical abnormalities of tissue hypoperfusion. She was discharged on day 7 without complications. In this review, we provide updated therapeutic options and discuss their specific pathophysiological basis.
