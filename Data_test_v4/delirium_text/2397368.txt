2397368|t|Psychiatric phenomena in Alzheimer's disease. IV: Disorders of behaviour.
2397368|a|Out of a sample of 178 patients with AD, aggression was present in 20%, wandering in 19%, binge-eating in 10%, hyperorality in 6%, urinary incontinence in 48%, and sexual disinhibition in 7%. Behavioural abnormalities were greater in those with more severe dementia. Temporallobe atrophy correlated with aggression, and widening of the third ventricle with hyperorality. Features of the Kluver-Bucy syndrome were commonly seen, but the full syndrome occurred in only one subject. Patients with at least one feature of the Kluver-Bucy syndrome had greater temporal-lobe atropy than those without any of the features.
