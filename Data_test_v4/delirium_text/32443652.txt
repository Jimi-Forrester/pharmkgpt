32443652|t|Novel Class of Chalcone Oxime Ethers as Potent Monoamine Oxidase-B and Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors.
32443652|a|Previously synthesized novel chalcone oxime ethers (COEs) were evaluated for inhibitory activities against monoamine oxidases (MAOs) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Twenty-two of the 24 COEs synthesized, except COE-17 and COE-24, had potent and/or significant selective inhibitory effects on MAO-B. COE-6 potently inhibited MAO-B with an IC50 value of 0.018 microM, which was 105, 2.3, and 1.1 times more potent than clorgyline, lazabemide, and pargyline (reference drugs), respectively. COE-7, and COE-22 were also active against MAO-B, both had an IC50 value of 0.028 microM, which was 67 and 1.5 times lower than those of clorgyline and lazabemide, respectively. Most of the COEs exhibited weak inhibitory effects on MAO-A and AChE. COE-13 most potently inhibited MAO-A (IC50 = 0.88 microM) and also significantly inhibited MAO-B (IC50 = 0.13 microM), and it could be considered as a potential nonselective MAO inhibitor. COE-19 and COE-22 inhibited AChE with IC50 values of 5.35 and 4.39 microM, respectively. The selectivity index (SI) of COE-22 for MAO-B was higher than that of COE-6 (SI = 778.6 vs. 222.2), but the IC50 value (0.028 microM) was slightly lower than that of COE-6 (0.018 microM). In reversibility experiments, inhibitions of MAO-B by COE-6 and COE-22 were recovered to the levels of reference reversible inhibitors and both competitively inhibited MAO-B, with Ki values of 0.0075 and 0.010 microM, respectively. Our results show that COE-6 and COE-22 are potent, selective MAO-B inhibitors, and COE-22 is a candidate of dual-targeting molecule for MAO-B and AChE.
