36108066|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of insomnia symptoms and to examine the associations of body mass index (BMI), chronic diseases, and lifestyle factors with self-reported insomnia symptoms among older people in India. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the baseline wave of the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI) that was collected during 2017-18. A sample of 31,358 older adults aged 60 and above was included in the analyses. Descriptive statistics and bivariate and multivariable analyses were performed to obtain the results. RESULTS: In this study, insomnia symptoms were reported by around 36 percent of older adults aged 60 and above. After controlling for socio-demographic factors, insomnia symptoms were positively associated with the risk of being underweight [AOR: 1.289, CI: 1.211-1.372] and negatively associated with obesity/overweight [AOR: 0.928, CI: 0.872-0.990] as compared to older adults with normal BMI. The odds of insomnia symptoms were higher among those who reported the following chronic conditions, i.e., hypertension [AOR:1.356, CI:1.278-1.438], diabetes [AOR:1.160, CI:1.074-1.254], chronic lung diseases [AOR:1.485, CI:1.351-1.632], bone-related diseases [AOR:1.561, CI:1.458-1.670] and any psychiatric disorders [AOR:1.761, CI:1.495-2.074]. In addition, older adults who were physically active [AOR: 0.850, CI:0.804-0.900] were less likely to report insomnia symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests a high prevalence of insomnia symptoms among the older population in India. Early identification of the signs of insomnia in older population is crucial, as is timely treatment for any kind of sleep problems. In addition, nutrition-based interventions and individual disease-specific management programs may help minimize the stressful situations in later life and develop a good night's sleep for the older population.
