31729181|t|Update of inflammasome activation in microglia/macrophage in aging and aging-related disease.
31729181|a|Aging and aging-related CNS diseases are associated with inflammatory status. As an efficient amplifier of immune responses, inflammasome is activated and played detrimental role in aging and aging-related CNS diseases. Macrophage and microglia display robust inflammasome activation in infectious and sterile inflammation. This review discussed the impact of inflammasome activation in microglia/macrophage on senescence "inflammaging" and aging-related CNS diseases. The preventive or therapeutic effects of targeting inflammasome on retarding aging process or tackling aging-related diseases are also discussed.
