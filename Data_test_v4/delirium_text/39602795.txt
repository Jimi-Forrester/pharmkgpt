39602795|t|The Digital Divide and Cognitive Disparities Among Older Adults: Community-Based Cohort Study in China.
39602795|a|BACKGROUND: The widespread adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs) further deepens disparities in resource access, particularly among the aging population. However, the relationship between these factors and their resulting impact on cognitive abilities remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the potential impact of the digital divide on individuals' cognitive function and its association with the development and reversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: This cohort study used data from Beijing Aging Brain Rejuvenation (BABRI) study applying a multistage cluster sampling design between 2008 and 2020. The digital divide was quantified by the frequency of using ICTs. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), mixed linear models, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to model the association of digital divide and multidomain cognition. RESULTS: Among the 10098 participants, nearly half (n=4941, 48.9%) faced the digital divide, which was associated with a worse performance in processing speed (F10096=10.67; P<.001; effect size r=0.42), rather than memory, executive function, and language. The model indicated that individuals' physical and mental health, combined with their educational and occupational prestige, influenced the resources they attained, which ultimately caused the digital divide. Moreover, longitudinal data revealed that older adults who successfully crossed the digital divide during the tracking process and those who had already done so prior to tracking showed significantly slower rates of decline in processing speed (B=-1.98, P<.05; B=-2.62, P<.01) and general cognitive function (B=3.50, P<.001; B=3.13, P<.01). Additionally, overcoming the digital divide was also associated with a lower risk of developing MCI (hazard ratio [HR] 0.5, 95% CI 0.34-0.74; HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.29-0.62) and a greater probability of reversion from MCI to normal cognition (HR 6, 95% CI 3.77-9.56; HR 9.22, 95% CI 5.63-15.11). CONCLUSIONS: Overcoming the digital divide was significantly associated with improved cognitive function, a slower aging rate in cognitive performance, a reduced risk of developing MCI, and a higher likelihood of reverting from MCI to normal cognition.
