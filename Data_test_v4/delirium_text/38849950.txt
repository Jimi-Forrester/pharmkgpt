38849950|t|Alzheimer's disease and drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier: approaches and challenges.
38849950|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a diverse disease with a complex pathophysiology. The presence of extracellular beta-amyloid deposition as neuritic plaques and intracellular accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated tau as neurofibrillary tangles remain the core neuropathologic criteria for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. Nonetheless, several recent basic discoveries have revealed significant pathogenic roles for other essential cellular and molecular processes. Previously, there were not so many disease-modifying medications (DMT) available as drug distribution through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is difficult due to its nature, especially drugs of polypeptides nature and proteins. Recently FDA has approved lecanemab as DMT for its proven efficacy. It is also complicated to deliver drugs for diseases like epilepsy or any brain tumor due to the limitations of the BBB. After the advancements in the drug delivery system, different techniques are used to transport the medication across the BBB. Other methods are used, like enhancement of brain blood vessel fluidity by liposomes, infusion of hyperosmotic solutions, and local intracerebral implants, but these are invasive approaches. Non-invasive approaches include the formulation of nanoparticles and their coating with polymers. This review article emphasizes all the above-mentioned techniques, procedures, and challenges to transporting medicines across the BBB. It summarizes the most recent literature dealing with drug delivery across the BBB.
