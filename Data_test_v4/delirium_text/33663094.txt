33663094|t|Delirium screening tools in the emergency department: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis.
33663094|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common type of acute brain dysfunction among emergency department (ED) patients. The prevalence of delirium in the ED is up to 40%. Although screening instruments used to identify delirium have been developed, it is unclear which tool is the most accurate in the ED. To address this challenging, we systematically examine the accuracy of delirium screening tools used to assess the ED patients. METHODS: This study has been registered at the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (INPLASY), and the registration number is INPLASY202110041. We will search the PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library. Studies involving patients which compared diagnostic instruments with the criteria in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) as a reference standard will be included. We will use STATA 15.1 and MetaDiSC to make careful analysis of the results. The quality of included studies will be assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 scale. RESULTS: In this study, the accuracy of different screening methods among ED patients is assessed by a high-quality synthesis. The number of tools available for screening delirium in the ED, the information of studies including the countries, the study design, the sample size and the characteristic of studies, the quality of the studies and the results of meta-analysis. The systematic review and meta-analysis will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSION: According to the conclusion of the systematic review, evidence will be provided to judge which screening method is the best for the ED patients. The results will bring better understanding of screening methods in the ED and highlight gaps for future research.
