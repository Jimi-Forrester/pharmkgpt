38250746|t|Examining the Interrelationships Between Social Isolation and Loneliness and Their Correlates Among Older British Adults Before and During the COVID-19 Lockdown: Evidence From Four British Longitudinal Studies.
38250746|a|Background and Objectives: Unprecedented social restrictions during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have provided a new lens for considering the interrelationship between social isolation and loneliness in later life. We present these interrelationships before and during the COVID-19 restrictions and investigate to what extent demographic, socioeconomic, and health factors associated with such experiences differed during the pandemic. Research Design and Methods: We used data from four British longitudinal population-based studies (1946 NSHD, 1958 NCDS, 1970 BCS, and ELSA, N = 12,129). Rates, co-occurrences, and correlates of social isolation and loneliness are presented prior to and during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic and the interrelationships between these experiences are elucidated in both periods. Results: Across the Four studies, prepandemic proportions reporting social isolation ranged from 15% to 54%, with higher rates in older ages (e.g., 32% of individuals aged 70-79 years and 54% of those more than 80). During the pandemic, the percentage of older people reporting both social isolation and loneliness and isolation only slightly increased. The interrelationship between social isolation and loneliness did not change. Associations between sociodemographic and health characteristics and social isolation and loneliness also remained consistent, with greater burden among those with higher economic precarity (females, nonhomeowners, unemployed, illness, and greater financial stress). Discussion and Implications: There were already large inequalities in experiences of social isolation and loneliness and the pandemic had a small impact on worsening extent and inequalities in these. The concepts of loneliness and social isolation are not interchangeable, and clarity is needed in how they are conceptualized, operationalized, and interpreted. Given many older adults experience high levels of social isolation, there should be greater emphasis on reducing social isolation and the inequalities observed in who experiences greater isolation and loneliness.
