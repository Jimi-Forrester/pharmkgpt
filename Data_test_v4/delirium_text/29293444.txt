29293444|a|Epigenetics involves multiple processes such as DNA methylation, histone code modifications, and noncoding RNAs to regulate gene expression. In recent years the implications of epigenetic mechanisms have emerged in the field of neuroscience especially in brain development, memory, learning, and various cognition processes. Epigenetics also plays a pivotal role during the aging process of the brain which has led to various age-related neurodegenerative diseases. This manuscript portrays the findings of various epigenetic mechanisms that play a critical role and their implications in aging as well as  age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease.
