7646599|t|[Encephalopathy following poisoning with an anticholinergic agent].
7646599|a|A 55-year-old chemical laboratory technician developed mydriasis and ocular hypertension, which lasted for 6 weeks, after synthesizing several kilograms of a scopolamine-related test agent with anticholinergic action and then decanting a powdery intermediary substance, the dust of which he may have inhaled. Six weeks later he suddenly had symptoms of an acute intoxication while synthesizing a scopolamine-related substance. The anticholinergic delirium regressed completely within one day requiring no treatment. But subsequently he developed symptoms of a toxic encephalopathy. This only partially regressed over the following 3 years. Its probable cause is thought to have been either the manifestation of an already existing organic cerebral psychiatric syndrome or an as yet unknown effect of the test substance.
