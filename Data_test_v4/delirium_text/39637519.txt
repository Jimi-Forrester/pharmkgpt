39637519|a|The locus coeruleus (LC) is among the first brain structures impacted by Alzheimer's disease (AD), and noradrenergic denervation may contribute to early neurovascular dysfunction in AD. Mechanistic links between the LC and cerebral perfusion have been demonstrated in rodents, but there have been no similar studies in aging humans. Community-dwelling older adults with no history of stroke or dementia (N=66) underwent structural (T1-MPRAGE; T1-FSE) and perfusion (resting pCASL) MRI. Plasma AD biomarkers levels were evaluated for Abeta42/40 ratio (n=56) and pTau181 (n=60). Higher rostral LC structural MRI contrast was associated with lower perfusion in entorhinal and limbic regions but higher perfusion in lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortices. Relationships between LC structure and regional cerebral perfusion were attenuated in older adults with higher plasma pTau levels and lower plasma Abeta42/40 ratios. Previously unstudied links between LC structure and cerebral perfusion are detectible in older adults using MRI and are attenuated in those showing greater AD pathophysiologic change, suggesting an uncoupling of LC-cerebral perfusion relationships in older adults with aggregating AD-related pathophysiology.
