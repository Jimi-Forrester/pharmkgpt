38390941|a|OBJECTIVE: Angelica keiskei is a medicinal and edible plant that has been reported to possess potent antioxidant properties in several in vitro models, but its effectiveness on naturally aging organisms is still lacking. This study explores the antioxidant and health-promoting effects of Angelica keiskei in naturally aging mice. METHODS: We treated 48-week-old mice with Angelica keiskei water extract (AKWE) 30 days, and measured indicators related to aging and antioxidants. In addition, we conducted network pharmacology analysis, component-target molecular docking, real-time PCR, and MTS assays to investigate relevant factors. RESULTS: The results indicated that administration of AKWE to mice led to decrease blood glucose levels, improve muscle fiber structure, muscle strength, gait stability, and increase levels of glutathione and superoxide dismutase in serum. Additionally, it decreased pigmentation of the heart tissues. Angelica keiskei combats oxidative stress by regulating multiple redox signaling pathways, and its ingredients Coumarin and Flavonoids have the potential to bind to SIRT3 and SIRT5. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated the potential of Angelica keiskei as a safe and effective dietary supplement to combat aging and revealed the broad prospects of medicinal and edible plants for addressing aging and age-related chronic diseases.
