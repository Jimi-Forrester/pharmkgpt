35398783|a|BACKGROUND: Pseudomyxoma Peritonei (PMP) is a mucin producing cancer with appendix as primary site. Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS) combined with hyper-thermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is an established form of therapy known to prolong survival in patients with PMP and peritoneal carcinomatosis. Methods/patients In our case series, we present five cases of PMP with synchronous liver and peritoneal metastasis treated with CRS and HIPEC. It is a very rare condition which needs more research to be able to comment on overall survival. RESULTS: However, in our study, we found lower age, female gender and complete cytoreduction in surgery to be favourable predictors for improved morbidity. CONCLUSION: In our experience, CRS/HIPEC seem to be feasible for patients with PMP with synchronous liver and peritoneal metastasis.
