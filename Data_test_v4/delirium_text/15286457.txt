15286457|a|Neuroinflammation is a central feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). C-reactive protein (CRP) is a key molecule of the acute phase of inflammation that has been localized in the two characteristic lesions of AD brain, senile plaque and neurofibrillary tangles. On the other hand, the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a cytokine with multiple biological activities, including the ability to act as potent amyloid beta (A-beta)-binding protein. Two common polymorphisms have been recently detected in the genes encoding for CRP and MIF and have been associated with significant modifications of plasma levels and activity of the corresponding proteins. Following these observations, we hypothesized that CRP and MIF gene polymorphisms might contribute to the development and progression of neurodegenerative disorders and evaluated their association with AD. CRP and MIF gene polymorphisms were examined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme analysis in 116 Italian subjects affected by probable AD and 184 age- and sex-matched controls. We did not find a statistically significant difference in the distribution of CRP and MIF genotypes and alleles between AD subjects and controls. Although these data need further confirmation, they indicate that CRP and MIF gene polymorphisms are not associated with AD.
