31545910|a|Among the main bacteria implicated in the pathology of periodontal disease, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) is well known for causing loss of periodontal attachment and systemic disease. Recent studies have suggested that secreted extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) from several bacteria may be important in periodontitis, although their role is unclear. Emerging evidence indicates that exRNAs circulate in nanosized bilayered and membranous extracellular vesicles (EVs) known as outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) in gram-negative bacteria. In this study, we analyzed the small RNA expression profiles in activated human macrophage-like cells (U937) infected with OMVs from Aa and investigated whether these cells can harbor exRNAs of bacterial origin that have been loaded into the host RNA-induced silencing complex, thus regulating host target transcripts. Our results provide evidence for the cytoplasmic delivery and activity of microbial EV-derived small exRNAs in host gene regulation. The production of TNF-alpha was promoted by exRNAs via the TLR-8 and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Numerous studies have linked periodontal disease to neuroinflammatory diseases but without elucidating specific mechanisms for the connection. We show here that intracardiac injection of Aa OMVs in mice showed successful delivery to the brain after crossing the blood-brain barrier, the exRNA cargos increasing expression of TNF-alpha in the mouse brain. The current study indicates that host gene regulation by microRNAs originating from OMVs of the periodontal pathogen Aa is a novel mechanism for host gene regulation and that the transfer of OMV exRNAs to the brain may cause neuroinflammatory diseases like Alzheimer's.-Han, E.-C., Choi, S.-Y., Lee, Y., Park, J.-W., Hong, S.-H., Lee, H.-J. Extracellular RNAs in periodontopathogenic outer membrane vesicles promote TNF-alpha production in human macrophages and cross the blood-brain barrier in mice.
