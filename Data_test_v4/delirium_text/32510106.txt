We assessed the prevalence, clinical presentation and outcomes of dementia among subjects hospitalized for COVID19 infection. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: COVID wards in Acute Hospital in Brescia province, Northern Italy. PARTICIPANTS: We used data from 627 subjects admitted to Acute Medical wards with COVID 19 pneumonia. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical records of each patients admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of COVID19 infection were retrospectively analyzed. Diagnosis of dementia, modalities of onset of the COVID-19 infection, symptoms of presentation at the hospital and outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Dementia was diagnosed in 82 patients (13.1%). The mortality rate was 62.2% (51/82) among patients affected by dementia compared to 26.2% (143/545) in subjects without dementia (p<0.001, Chi-Squared test). In a logistic regression model age, and the diagnosis of dementia resulted independently associated with a higher mortality, and patients diagnosed with dementia presented an OR of 1.84 (95% CI: 1.09-3.13, p<0.05). Among patients diagnosed with dementia the most frequent symptoms of onset were delirium, especially in the hypoactive form, and worsening of the functional status. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of dementia, especially in the most advanced stages, represents an important risk factor for mortality in COVID-19 patients. The clinical presentation of COVID-19 in subjects with dementia is atypical, reducing early recognition of symptoms and hospitalization.
