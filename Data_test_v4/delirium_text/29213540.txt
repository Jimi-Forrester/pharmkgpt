29213540|t|Cognitive complaints compared to performance on a mental state screening test in elderly outpatients.
29213540|a|Memory and other cognitive complaints are common in the elderly population. However, the clinical meaning of these complaints remains controversial. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to investigate the association between cognitive complaints and performance on a mental state screening test in elderly patients attended for the first time at the Neurogeriatric and Dementia (NGA) Outpatient Clinic within a major University hospital. METHODS: Two hundred patients referred to the NGA Clinic during 2005, 2006 and 2007 first semesters participated in the study. The variables of interest were:(a) source of and reason for referral;(b) whether or not they had previously been evaluated with the screening test (Mini Mental State Exam - MMSE) by their physicians before referral to our specialized clinic;(c) cognitive complaints; and(d) performance on the screening test (MMSE) at the NGA Clinic. RESULTS: The main reason for referral to the NGA clinic was cognitive complaints 63% (N=126), where only 5% (N=10) of the referred patients had been previously evaluated by the cognitive screening test (MMSE or equivalent). Of the 135 patients who presented cognitive complaints during the first appointment, 52 (38%) presented MMSE scores below the education-adjusted cut-off. No association between cognitive complaint and performance on the MMSE during the first evaluation at the NGA Clinic was observed (chi2=3.04, p=0.1). CONCLUSIONS: Although cognitive complaints among elders should not be disregarded, the mental state screening evaluation is crucial for the detection of clinically significant cognitive impairment.
