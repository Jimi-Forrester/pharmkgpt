37953874|t|Nanotechnologies meeting natural sources: Engineered lipoproteins for precise brain disease theranostics.
37953874|a|Biological nanotechnologies have provided considerable opportunities in the management of malignancies with delicate design and negligible toxicity, from preventive and diagnostic to therapeutic fields. Lipoproteins, because of their inherent blood-brain barrier permeability and lesion-homing capability, have been identified as promising strategies for high-performance theranostics of brain diseases. However, the application of natural lipoproteins remains limited owing to insufficient accumulation and complex purification processes, which can be critical for individual therapeutics and clinical translation. To address these issues, lipoprotein-inspired nano drug-delivery systems (nano-DDSs), which have been learned from nature, have been fabricated to achieve synergistic drug delivery involving site-specific accumulation and tractable preparation with versatile physicochemical functions. In this review, the barriers in brain disease treatment, advantages of state-of-the-art lipoprotein-inspired nano-DDSs, and bio-interactions of such nano-DDSs are highlighted. Furthermore, the characteristics and advanced applications of natural lipoproteins and tailor-made lipoprotein-inspired nano-DDSs are summarized. Specifically, the key designs and current applications of lipoprotein-inspired nano-DDSs in the field of brain disease therapy are intensively discussed. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives in the field of lipoprotein-inspired nano-DDSs combined with other vehicles, such as exosomes, cell membranes, and bacteria, are discussed.
