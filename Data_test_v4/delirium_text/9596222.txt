9596222|t|Increased density of olfactory receptor neurons immunoreactive for apolipoprotein E in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
9596222|a|Immunolocalization of apolipoprotein E (apoE) was investigated in human olfactory mucosa in which olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) were identified with antiserum to protein gene product (PGP) 9.5. Tissue was obtained at autopsy from 10 nondemented middle-aged or elderly subjects and 9 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Double-labeling immunofluorescence established that apoE immunoreactivity was colocalized in a subpopulation of PGP 9.5-immunoreactive ORNs. The mean number of apoE-immunoreactive ORNs per unit epithelial length in AD patients was about 3.5 times greater than that in nondemented patients, although the mean number of PGP 9.5-immunoreactive ORNs was similar. The apoE-immunopositive Schwann cells in olfactory nerve bundles were the probable source of apoE in the ORNs. The increased numbers of apoE-immunoreactive ORNs in AD patients compared to nondemented subjects demonstrates another manifestation of AD-related neuropathology, in addition to cytoskeletal changes, beta-amyloid deposition, and changes in immunoreactivity for other neuroproteins, that parallels changes in neurons in the AD brain.
