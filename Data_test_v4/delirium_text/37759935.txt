37759935|t|Peripheral S100B Protein Levels in Five Major Psychiatric Disorders: A Systematic Review.
37759935|a|Five major psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, autistic spectrum disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, show a shared genetic background and probably share common pathobiological mechanisms. S100B is a calcium-binding protein widely studied in psychiatric disorders as a potential biomarker. Our systematic review aimed to compare studies on peripheral S100B levels in five major psychiatric disorders with shared genetic backgrounds to reveal whether S100B alterations are disease-specific. EMBASE, Web of Science, and PubMed databases were searched for relevant studies published until the end of July 2023. This study was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA) guidelines. Overall, 1215 publications were identified, of which 111 full-text articles were included in the systematic review. Study designs are very heterogeneous, performed mostly on small groups of participants at different stages of the disease (first-episode or chronic, drug-free or medicated, in the exacerbation of symptoms or in remission), and various clinical variables are analyzed. Published results are inconsistent; most reported elevated S100B levels across disorders included in the review. Alterations in S100B peripheral levels do not seem to be disease-specific.
