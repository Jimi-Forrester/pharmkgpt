36117846|t|Identification of risk factors for 1-year mortality among critically ill older adults with hip fractures surgery: A single medical center retrospective study.
36117846|a|Aim: The purpose of this study was to analyze the potential risk factors for mortality 1 year after hip fracture surgery in critically ill older adults. Methods: We reviewed 591 critically ill older adults who underwent hip surgery at our institution from January 2018 to April 2021. We collected baseline demographics, clinical information, and 1-year survival status of the sample patients by means of medical record systems and follow-up phone calls. Patients were divided into survival and mortality groups based on survival within 1 year after surgery. Results: Based on the results of the 1-year postoperative follow-up of patients, we obtained 117 cases in the death group and 474 cases in the survival group, and this led to a 1-year mortality rate of 19.8% (117/591) after hip fracture in critically ill older adults at our hospital. The risk factors that influenced the 1-year postoperative mortality were identified as advanced age (HR:1.04, 95%, 1.01-1.06), preoperative arrhythmia (HR: 1.95, 95%, 1.26-2.70), high level of NLR (HR:1.03, 95%, 1.01-1.06), respiratory failure (HR: 2.63, 95%, 1.32-5.23), and acute cardiovascular failure. 5.23) and acute cardiovascular events (HR: 1.65, 95%, 1.05-2.59). Conclusion: Advanced age, preoperative arrhythmias, high levels of NLR, postoperative respiratory failure, and acute cardiovascular events were independent risk factors for survival of critically ill older adults with hip fracture at 1 year after surgery. Therefore, laboratory tests such as high levels of preoperative NLR can be an important indicator of patient prognosis.
