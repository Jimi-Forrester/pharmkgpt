39040381|a|Inflammation is a complex physiological phenomenon, which is the body's defensive response, but abnormal inflammation can have adverse effects, and many diseases are related to the inflammatory response. AMPK, as a key sensor of cellular energy status, plays a crucial role in regulating cellular energy homeostasis and glycolipid metabolism. In recent years, the anti-inflammation effect of AMPK and related signalling cascade has begun to enter everyone's field of vision - not least the impact on metabolic diseases. A great number of studies have shown that anti-inflammatory drugs work through AMPK and related pathways. Herein, this article summarises recent advances in compounds that show anti-inflammatory effects by activating AMPK and attempts to comment on them.
