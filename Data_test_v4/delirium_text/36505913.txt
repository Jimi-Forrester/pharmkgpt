36505913|t|Restraint Practices in Incapable Wandering Patients During COVID-19: Ethics and Best Practice Recommendations.
36505913|a|Patients who wander as one of their psychological and behavioural symptoms of dementia are often unable to follow or recall Infection Prevention and Control precautions, putting them at risk of contracting or spreading COVID-19. Physical and chemical restraints have been used to limit the risk of transmission to wandering patients and their care providers, but restraints are not the standard of care for wandering behaviour in non-pandemic scenarios. Although provincial policies on restraint use are available, their guidance may not provide the context-dependent information necessary for individual patient decisions. To address this knowledge gap, we reviewed the medical, ethical, and legal considerations through an interdisciplinary approach including nurses, physicians, ethicists, hospital leadership, risk management, and legal counsel. We present an ethical framework that front-line health-care workers can use to create a balanced patient-centred care plan for incapable wandering patients who are at risk of contracting or spreading COVID-19.
