26597964|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive neurodegenerative disorder. At present, there are no effective disease-modifying therapies, and the cause of the disease remains unclear. Previously, almost all researchers focus on the brain for exploring the pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies in AD. A recent study by Xiang et al. (Acta Neuropathol 130:487-499, 2015) reported the significance of the physiological capacity of peripheral tissues and organs in clearing brain-derived amyloid-beta (Abeta), which opens a novel avenue to understand the AD pathogenesis and develop therapies for AD.
