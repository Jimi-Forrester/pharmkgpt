9211985|t|Association of human, rat, and rabbit apolipoprotein E with beta-amyloid.
9211985|a|In humans, apolipoprotein E (apoE) has three major isoforms, E2 (Cys112, Cys158), E3 (Cys112, Arg158), and E4 (Arg112, Arg158). While epsilon4 is a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), epsilon2 may protect against late-onset AD. Using native preparations of apoE from conditioned tissue culture media or plasma lipoproteins, we have previously shown that when equivalent amounts of apoE3 or E4 were incubated with beta-amyloid (A beta), apoE3 formed 20 times as much SDS-stable complex with the peptide as apoE4. This preferential binding of A beta to apoE3 was abolished when apoE was purified by a process which includes delipidation and denaturation. Here we expand these observations to include A beta binding to lipoprotein-associated and purified apoE2. Lipoproteins isolated from the plasma of individuals homozygous for either epsilon2 or epsilon3 were incubated with A beta(1-40). SDS-stable complex formation was analyzed by a non-reducing gel shift assay, followed by immunoblotting with either A beta or apoE antibodies. ApoE2:A beta complex formation was comparable to apoE3:A beta in both native and purified preparations of apoE. In addition, lipoprotein-associated rat apoE (Arg112, Arg158), like human apoE4, did not form complex with A beta, while lipoprotein-associated rabbit apoE (Cys112, Arg158) did bind the peptide. These binding studies provide one possible explanation for protective effects of both apoE2 and E3 against the development of Alzheimer's disease.
