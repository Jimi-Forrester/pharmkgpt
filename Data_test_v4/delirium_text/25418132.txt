25418132|a|The early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is challenging due to the lack of reliable methods for detecting its biomarkers in the noninvasive biopsies. We used surface plasmon resonance imaging to identify AD based on the detection of amyloid-beta42 in the serum by the ADP3 peptoid.
