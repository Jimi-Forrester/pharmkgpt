37764834|t|Calcium Homeostasis and Psychiatric Disorders: A Mendelian Randomization Study.
37764834|a|Observational studies have investigated the impact of calcium homeostasis on psychiatric disorders; however, the causality of associations is yet to be established. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis of calcium homeostasis hormones was conducted on nine psychiatric disorders. Calcium, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (25OHD), parathyroid hormone, and fibroblast growth factor 23 are the major calcium homeostasis hormones. The causality was evaluated by the inverse variance weighted method (IVW) and the MR Steiger test, while Cochran's Q test, the MR-Egger intercept test, funnel plot, and the leave-one-out method were used for sensitivity analyses. Bonferroni correction was used to determine the causative association features (p < 6.94 x 10-4). Schizophrenia (SCZ) was significantly associated with decreased 25OHD concentrations with an estimated effect of -0.0164 (Prandom-effect IVW = 2.39 x 10-7). In the Multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis adjusting for potentially confounding traits including body mass index, obesity, mineral supplements (calcium, fish oil, and vitamin D) and outdoor time (winter and summer), the relationship between SCZ and 25OHD remained. The genetically predicted autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder were also nominally associated with decreased 25OHD. This study provided evidence for a causal effect of psychiatric disorders on calcium homeostasis. The clinical monitoring of 25OHD levels in patients with psychiatric disorders is beneficial.
