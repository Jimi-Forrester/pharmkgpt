7999331|t|Caregiver ratings of personality change in Alzheimer's disease patients: a replication.
7999331|a|Caregivers of 26 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) rated current and premorbid personality patterns with the NEO Personality Inventory. Results replicated previous findings on the degree of change reported in a previous group of patients with mixed memory disorder diagnoses. After a diagnosis of AD, the patients were rated as significantly more neurotic, less extraverted, less open, and less conscientious. There were no rated differences of changes in the personality domain of Agreeableness. These results strengthen the usefulness of caregiver ratings of personality change of patients with memory problems who cannot be useful informants on their own behalf.
