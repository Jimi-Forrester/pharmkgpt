35005850|t|Serum levels of sLOX-1 and Lp-PLA2 can predict the prognosis of acute cerebral infarction with a high specificity.
35005850|a|Soluble lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (sLOX-1) and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) plays an important role in acute cerebral infarction (ACI), whereas its clinical value in predicting the prognosis is unclear. Thus, this study aimed to explore this issue. A total of 127 ACI patients were included in this prospective observational study. The concentrations of sLOX-1 and Lp-PLA2 in serum were measured and their relationship with a poor prognosis 90 days after the onset of ACI was analyzed. We found that patients with poor prognosis had higher mean serum levels of sLOX-1 and Lp-PLA2. The level of sLOX-1 and Lp-PLA2 could predict the functional outcome of ACI. At the optimal cut off value of sLOX-1 level (1257.92 ng/ml), the sensitivity and specificity for the poor functional outcome were 0.69 and 0.753, respectively, and the area under ROC curve (AUC) was 0.727. Similarly, the optimal value for Lp-PLA2 level was 160.9 ng/ml, at which the sensitivity and specificity were 0.643 and 0.835, respectively; and the AUC was 0.758. When the two biomarkers were used in combination, the AUC was 0.855, and the sensitivity and specificity were 0.643 and 0.976, respectively, indicating a significant improvement of the diagnostic specificity. The level of sLOX-1 or Lp-PLA2 could thus serve as useful biomarkers to predict the functional outcome of ACI. Combined use of both indicators is better than the use of either single indicator, and provides the highest specificity in predicting poor prognosis.
