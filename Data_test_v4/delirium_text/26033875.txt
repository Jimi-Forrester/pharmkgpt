26033875|t|Proteomics, biomarkers, and HIV-1: A current perspective.
26033875|a|Despite more than three decades of extensive research, HIV-1 infection although well controlled with cART, remains incurable. Multifactorial complexity of the viral life-cycle poses great challenges in understanding molecular mechanisms underlying this infection and the development of biomarkers, which we hope will lead us to its eradication. For a more in-depth understanding of how the virus interacts with host target cells, T cells and macrophages, proteomic profiling techniques that offer strategies to investigate the proteome in its entirety were employed. Here, we review proteomic studies related to HIV-1 infection and discuss perspectives and limitations of proteomic and systems biology approaches in future studies.
