38245939|t|Enhancing delirium assessment and management through nursing education interventions: A scoping review.
38245939|a|AIM/OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this scoping review was to explore the characteristics and outcomes of education interventions for nurses focused on delirium assessment and management. BACKGROUND: Delirium is a prevalent acute and reversible neuropsychiatric syndrome in hospitalized patients. Delirium can cause cognitive, psychiatric and physical impairments and result in prolonged hospital stay, increased risk of readmission and elevated morbidity and mortality rates. Nurses play an essential role in managing delirium. There is a lack of understanding of the existing nursing educational interventions on delirium management. DESIGN: The study was a scoping review. METHODS: In this scoping review, we used Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) scoping review framework. We searched articles published between 2019 and 2023 in Academic Search Premier, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and MEDLINE using the following CINAHL/MeSH suggested subject terms: "delirium" in conjunction with "education" "intervention" and "nurse", "nurses" or "nursing." Studies on improving nursing knowledge and practices regarding delirium were included while those focusing on nursing students were excluded. Initial screening involved evaluating article titles and abstracts for relevance from 164 identified articles, followed by a full-text review of 42 articles. Finally, 17 articles were selected for comprehensive analysis. We extracted relevant information from each article and charted the findings in an evidence table. RESULTS: The 17 selected articles showcased a variety of interventions used to educate nursing staff, such as workshops, simulations, group discussions, online modules and one-on-one coaching. Educational interventions primarily focused on delirium definition, risk factors, assessment and management. These educational interventions enhanced nurses' perception of delirium, boosting their confidence and knowledge in managing delirium. These interventions also led to increased compliance with delirium assessment and management protocols, which ultimately resulted in improved documentation accuracy and patient outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this scoping review suggest that nursing administration need to provide support and education for delirium prevention and management to enhance nursing staff confidence and competence in assessing and managing delirium. The use of interactive educational techniques has demonstrated profound benefits in schema development, expertize promotion and critical thinking. These findings have significant implications for future research, including the identification of essential nursing competencies for educational interventions and the assessment of long-term knowledge retention and its application in nursing practice.
