35208224|t|Lipidome Alterations following Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in the Rat.
35208224|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) poses a major health challenge, with tens of millions of new cases reported globally every year. Brain damage resulting from TBI can vary significantly due to factors including injury severity, injury mechanism and exposure to repeated injury events. Therefore, there is need for robust blood biomarkers. Serum from Sprague Dawley rats was collected at several timepoints within 24 h of mild single or repeat closed head impacts. Serum samples were analyzed via ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) in positive and negative ion modes. Known lipid species were identified through matching to in-house tandem MS databases. Lipid biomarkers have a unique potential to serve as objective molecular measures of injury response as they may be liberated to circulation more readily than larger protein markers. Machine learning and feature selection approaches were used to construct lipid panels capable of distinguishing serum from injured and uninjured rats. The best multivariate lipid panels had over 90% cross-validated sensitivity, selectivity, and accuracy. These mapped onto sphingolipid signaling, autophagy, necroptosis and glycerophospholipid metabolism pathways, with Benjamini adjusted p-values less than 0.05. The novel lipid biomarker candidates identified provide insight into the metabolic pathways altered within 24 h of mild TBI.
