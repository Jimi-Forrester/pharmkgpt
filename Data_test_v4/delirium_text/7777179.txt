7777179|a|We investigated the distribution of L-ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), an enzyme known to be involved in several developmental and restorative processes, in neocortical brain areas of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal patients by means of immunohistochemistry. While ODC immunoreactive material was only scarcely distributed in neocortical neurons of control brains, neocortical specimens from AD brains stood out by intense immunostaining for ODC. Dendrites and, to a lesser extent, axons of neurons from AD brains showed a strong immunoreaction to the enzyme, whereas neurons from non-affected brains displayed only a weak circumnuclear reaction pattern. Our results support the idea that neurorestorative processes take place in AD brains and that the ODC/polyamine system might be actively involved in this process.
