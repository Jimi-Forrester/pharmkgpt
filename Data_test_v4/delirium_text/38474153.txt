38474153|a|Cell fate instability is a crucial characteristic of aging and appears to contribute to various age-related pathologies. Exploring the connection between bioactive substances and cell fate stability may offer valuable insights into longevity. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the potential beneficial effects of ginseng oligopeptides (GOPs) isolated from Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer at the cellular level. Disruption of homeostasis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and PC-12 was achieved by culturing them in the growth medium supplemented with 200 microM of H2O2, and 25, 50, and 100 microg/mL GOPs for 4 h. Then, they were cultured in a H2O2-free growth medium containing different concentration of GOPs. We found that GOP administration retards the oxidative stress-induced cell instability in HUVECs by increasing cell viability, inhibiting the cell cycle arrest, enhancing telomerase (TE) activity, suppressing oxidative stress and an inflammatory attack, and protecting mitochondrial function. Furthermore, we hypothesized that GOPs may promote mitochondrial biosynthesis by upregulating PGC-1alpha expression. Similarly, GOPs positively regulated cell stability in PC-12; notably, the protective effect of GOPs on PC-12 mainly occurred through the inhibition of autophagic cell death of neuronal cells, while the protective effect on mitochondria was weak. In conclusion, it is evident that GOPs demonstrate potential beneficial effects in maintaining cell fate stability, thereby potentially contributing to an enhanced health span and overall well-being.
