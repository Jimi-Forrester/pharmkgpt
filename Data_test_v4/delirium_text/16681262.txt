16681262|t|[A case of acute bromvalerylurea intoxication: clinical course and alteration in serum bromvalerylurea concentration].
16681262|a|Bromvalerylurea is one of the non-barbiturates products and has been used as analgesics and hypnotics in Japan. A 20-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for loss of consciousness. She had a 6-month history of transient delirium and drunken gait. Physical examination revealed erythema less than thumb's head size at her face, shoulder and thigh. Neurologically, she had a state of coma and low muscle tonus. EEG showed the pattern of burst-suppression. The level of her serum chloride was not elevated. The erythema made us check up her state of acute bromvalerylurea intoxication. High blood concentration of bromvalerylurea led to diagnosis of the bromvalerylurea intoxication. The maximum value of her serum bromvalerylurea concentration was 107 microg/ml on the second hospital day, while the concentration in cerebrospinal fluid were also increased and remained for several days. She was treated with respiration control and drip infusions. She gradually improved and recovered to be alert. She was complicated severe liver dysfunction and disseminated intravascular coagulation resulting from bromvalerylurea intoxication, also treated with intensive care and gradually recovered. We should take notice to bromvalerylurea, easily available over the counter, as one of the drugs which may cause severe loss of consciousness or coma, and general complications. And if the bromvalerylurea intoxication is prospective, we should consider whether the option of gastric irrigation is available regardless of the elapsed time.
