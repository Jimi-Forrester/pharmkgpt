546661|t|Epilepsy and agitated delirium caused by an astrocytoma of the amygdala.
546661|a|The clinical picture of a tumour involving the amygdaloid nucleus was characterized over a period of 6 years by generalised epileptic fits, then a state of agitated delirium with oneirism evolving during 2 months and leading finally to pulmonary embolism. The association of epilepsy and psychiatric disorders is the clinical picture usually observed in tumors of the limbic system but these symptoms are various and unspecific. The conventional neuroradiological procedures often fail to discover the lesion.
