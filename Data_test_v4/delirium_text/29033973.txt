29033973|t|Comparison of Central, Ambulatory, Home and Office Blood Pressure Measurement as Risk Markers for Mild Cognitive Impairment in Hypertensive Patients.
29033973|a|AIMS: We compared the role of central blood pressure (BP), ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), home-measured BP (HMBP) and office BP measurement as risk markers for the development of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: 70 hypertensive patients on combination medical therapy were studied. Their mean age was 64.97 +- 8.88 years. Eighteen (25.71%) were males and 52 (74.28%) females. All of the patients underwent full physical examination, laboratory screening, echocardiography, and office, ambulatory, home and central BP measurement. The neuropsychological tests used were: Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). SPSS 19 was used for the statistical analysis with a level of significance of 0.05. RESULTS: The mean central pulse pressure values of patients with MCI were significantly (p = 0.016) higher than those of the patients without MCI. There was a weak negative correlation between central pulse pressure and the results from the MoCA and MMSE (r = -0.283, p = 0.017 and r = -0.241, p = 0.044, respectively). There was a correlation between ABPM and MCI as well as between HMBP and MCI. CONCLUSIONS: The correlation of central BP with target organ damage (MCI) is as good as for the other types of measurements of BP (home and ambulatory). Office BP seems to be the poorest marker for the assessment of target organ damage.
