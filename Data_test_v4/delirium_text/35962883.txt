35962883|t|The Influence of Heparan Sulfate on Breast Amyloidosis and the Toxicity of the Pre-fibrils Formed by beta-casein.
35962883|a|Heparan sulfate (HS) as a mediator is usually involved in both inflammation and fibrosis. Besides, pre-fibrils are the intermediates of amyloid fibrils that usually cause cell death and tissue damage, like the amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's disease, alpha-synuclein in Parkinson disease and islet amyloid polypeptide in type II diabetes mellitus. However, the related study was involved rarely in breast. Therefore, the combing technologies including hematoxylin-eosin staining and thioflavin S staining were used to investigate the influence of HS on breast amyloidosis. To further study the toxicity of the pre-fibrils formed by beta-casein on the HC11 cells and the breast mammary gland, the combing technologies including pentamer formyl thiophene acetic acid fluorescence analysis, MTT assay, Annexin V/PI staining and hematoxylin-eosin staining were performed. The results demonstrated that HS, acted as an endogenous molecule, induced the inflammation and amyloid fibril formation at the same time, and there was a close relationship between inflammation and fibrosis of breast. In addition, the pre-fibrils formed by beta-casein were toxic because they induced the death and apoptosis of HC11 cells, as well as the inflammation of mammary gland of rats. Therefore, the early examination and identify of the pre-fibrils in the breast were worth considering to prevent the disease development, and it was interesting to explore the HS mimetics to impair the breast amyloidosis and attenuate the inflammatory response in the future.
