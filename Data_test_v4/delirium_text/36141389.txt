36141389|t|An Automated Algorithm for Determining Sleep Using Single-Channel Electroencephalography to Detect Delirium: A Prospective Observational Study in Intensive Care Units.
36141389|a|The relationship between polysomnography-based objective sleep and delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) is inconsistent across studies, suggesting limitations in manually determining the sleep stage of critically ill patients. We objectively measured 24-h sleep using a single-channel electroencephalogram (SleepScope [SS]) and an under-mattress sleep monitor (Nemuri SCAN [NSCAN]), both of which have independent algorithms that automatically determine sleep and wakefulness. Eighteen patients (median age, 68 years) admitted to the ICU after valvular surgery or coronary artery bypass grafting were included, and their sleep time was measured one day after extubation. The median total sleep times (TSTs) measured by SS (TST-SS) and NSCAN were 548 (48-1050) and 1024 (462-1257) min, respectively. Two patients with delirium during the 24-h sleep measurement had very short TST-SS of 48 and 125 min, and the percentage of daytime sleep accounted for >80% in both SS and NSCAN. This preliminary case series showed marked sleep deprivation and increased rates of daytime sleeping in ICU patients with delirium. Although data accuracy from under-mattress sleep monitors is contentious, automated algorithmic sleep/wakefulness determination using a single-channel electroencephalogram may be useful in detecting delirium in ICU patients and could even be superior to polysomnography.
