38077626|a|Human gut microbiome is a major source of human bacterial population and a significant contribution to both positive and harmful effects. Due to its involvement in a variety of interactions, gut microorganisms have a great impact on our health throughout our lives. The impact of gut microbial population is been studied intensively in last two decades. Extensive literature survey focusing developments in the field were searched in English language Electronic Databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, Pubag, Google books, and Research Gate were mostly used to understand the role of human gut mirobiome and its role in different human diseases. Gut microbiome in healthy subjects differs from those who suffer from diseases. Type 2 diabetes, obesity, non-alcoholic liver disease, and cardiometabolic diseases have all been linked to dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. Pathogenesis of many disorders is also linked to changes in gut microbiota. Other diseases like cancer, arithritis, autism, depression, anxiety, sleep disorder, HIV, hypertension, and gout are also related to gut microbiota dysbiosis. We focus in this review on recent studies looking into the link between gut microbiome dysbiosis and disease etiology. Research on how gut microbiota affects host metabolism has been changed in past decades from descriptive analyses to high throughput integrative omics data analysis such as metagenomics and metabolomics. Identification of molecular mechanisms behind reported associations is been carried out in human, animals, and cells for measure of host physiology and mechanics. Still many the mechanisms are not completely understood.
