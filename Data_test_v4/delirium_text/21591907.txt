21591907|a|Albumin is the most abundant plasma protein synthesised mainly in the liver. It is also a major component of extracellular fluids including cerebrospinal fluid, interstitial fluid and lymph. Albumin has several biochemical properties including regulation of colloid osmotic pressure of plasma, transportation of hormones, fatty acids, drugs and metabolites across plasma, regulation of microvascular permeability, antioxidant activity, anti-thrombotic activity and anti-inflammatory activity. This multifunctional protein has been implicated in many neurological diseases owing to its ability to regulate hemodynamic properties of the brain circulation as well as the direct neuroprotective actions on neuronal and glial cells. In this review, we summarise various neuroprotective actions of the albumin in the brain. In experimental ischemic stroke, exogenous human serum albumin administration has been found to be neuroprotective via reducing brain swelling, prevention of post-ischemic thrombosis, anti-oxidant activity, hemodilution and increasing the perfusion to the ischemic tissue. Also, human serum albumin administration is currently under clinical trials for treatment of cerebral ischemia. In the experimental models of Alzheimer's disease, albumin has been implicated in neuroprotection by inhibiting polymerisation and enhancing the clearance of amyloid beta. The direct neuroprotective actions on neuronal and glial cells are mediated via endogenously produced albumin or cellular uptake of blood derived albumin. These neuroprotective effects of albumin are partly attributed to anti-oxidant property and modulation of intracellular signalling of neuronal or glial cells. The recent finding of de novo synthesis of albumin in microglial cells directs us to explore newer roles of this endogenously produced multifunctional protein in normal as well as pathological conditions of the brain.
