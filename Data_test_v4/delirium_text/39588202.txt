In medical imaging, time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA) and perfusion MRI are the most common modalities used to study this system. However, due to lack of resources, many large-scale studies of AD are not acquiring these images; this creates a conundrum, as the lack of evidence limits our knowledge of the interaction between the cerebrovascular system and AD. Deep learning approaches have been used in recent developments to generate synthetic medical images from existing contrasts. In this review, we study the use of artificial intelligence in the generation of synthetic TOF-MRA and perfusion-related images from existing neuroanatomical and neurovascular acquisitions for the study of the cerebrovascular system. Method: Following the PRISMA reporting guidelines we conducted a scoping review of 729 studies relating to image synthesis of TOF-MRA or perfusion imaging, from which 13 met our criteria. Results: Studies showed that T1-w, T2-w, and FLAIR can be used to synthesize perfusion map and TOF-MRA. Other studies demonstrated that synthetic images could have a greater signal-to-noise ratio compared to real images and that some models trained on healthy subjects could generalize their outputs to an unseen population, such as stroke patients. Discussion: These findings suggest that generating TOF-MRA and perfusion MRI images holds significant potential for enhancing neurovascular studies, particularly in cases where direct acquisition is not feasible. This approach could provide valuable insights for retrospective studies of several cerebrovascular related diseases such as stroke and AD. While promising, further research is needed to assess their sensitivity and specificity, and ensure their applicability across diverse populations. The use of models to generate TOF-MRA and perfusion MRI using commonly acquired data could be the key for the retrospective study of the cerebrovascular system and elucidate its role in the development of dementia.
