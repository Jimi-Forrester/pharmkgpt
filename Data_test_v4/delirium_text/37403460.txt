37403460|t|A Rapid Systematic Review of Pharmacologic Sleep Promotion Modalities in the Intensive Care Unit.
37403460|a|Background: The Society of Critical Care Medicine Clinical Practice Guidelines for Management of Pain, Agitation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep recommend protocolized non-pharmacologic sleep improvement. Pharmacologic interventions are frequently initiated to promote sleep but the evidence supporting these strategies remains controversial. Purpose: To systematically search and synthesize evidence evaluating pharmacologic sleep promotion modalities in critically ill adults. Methods: A rapid systematic review protocol was used to search Medline, Cochrane Library, and Embase for reports published through October 2022. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and before-and-after cohort studies evaluating pharmacologic modalities intended to improve sleep in adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Sleep-related endpoints were the primary outcome of interest. Study and patient characteristics and relevant safety and non-sleep outcome data were also collected. The Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias or Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions were used to assess the risk of bias for all included studies. Results: Sixteen studies (75% RCTs) enrolling 2573 patients were included; 1207 patients were allocated to the pharmacologic sleep intervention. Most studies utilized dexmedetomidine (7/16; total n = 505 patients) or a melatonin agonist (6/16; total n = 592 patients). Only half of the studies incorporated a sleep promotion protocol as standard of care. Most (11/16, 68.8%) studies demonstrated a significant improvement in >=1 sleep endpoint (n = 5 dexmedetomidine, n = 3 melatonin agonists, n = 2 propofol/benzodiazepines). Risk of bias was generally low for RCTs and moderate-severe for cohort studies. Conclusions: Dexmedetomidine and melatonin agonists are the most studied pharmacologic sleep promotion modalities, but current evidence does not support their routine administration in the ICU to improve sleep. Future RCTs evaluating pharmacologic modalities for ICU sleep should consider patients' baseline and ICU risks for disrupted sleep, incorporate a non-pharmacologic sleep improvement protocol, and evaluate the effect of these medication interventions on circadian rhythm, physiologic sleep, patient-perceived sleep quality, and delirium.
