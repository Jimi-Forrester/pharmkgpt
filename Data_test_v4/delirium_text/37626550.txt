37626550|t|The Association between Pesticide Exposure and the Development of Fronto-Temporal Dementia-Cum-Dissociative Disorders: A Review.
37626550|a|Pesticides are chemicals used in agricultural fields for the prevention or destruction of pests. Inappropriate use of these substances, as well as handling them without using personal protective equipment, may result in serious health problems such as neurodegenerative diseases and mental disorders. Previous studies have demonstrated the adverse effects of pesticides on brain function. However, some researchers have associated pesticide poisoning with the development of disorders such as dissociative amnesia, multiple personality disorders, and depersonalization disorder. The objective of this work was to perform a bibliographic review of the relationship between pesticide poisoning and the development of dissociative disorders. Previous studies suggest that the duration of pesticide exposure is a major determinant in the development of dissociative diseases and disorders. The information obtained in this review suggests that there is no specific relationship between dissociative disorders and pesticide poisoning. However, these results point to associating the most representative symptoms of dissociative disorder (such as amnesia and memory loss) with pesticide exposure. Based on the bibliographic search, possible mechanisms of action were suggested in an attempt to explain a possible association between exposure to pesticides and the appearance of dissociative disorders.
