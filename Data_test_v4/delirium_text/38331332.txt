38331332|a|Aging is a major risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases like dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Even in non-pathological aging, decline in cognitive functioning is observed in the majority of the elderly population, necessitating the importance of studying the processes involved in healthy aging in order to identify brain biomarkers that promote the conservation of functioning. The default mode network (DMN) has been of special interest to aging research due to its vulnerability to atrophy and functional decline over the course of aging. Prior work has focused almost exclusively on functional (i.e. undirected) connectivity, yet converging findings are scarce. Therefore, we set out to use spectral dynamic causal modeling to investigate changes in the effective (i.e. directed) connectivity within the DMN and to discover changes in information flow in a sample of cognitively normal adults spanning from 48 to 89 years (n = 63). Age was associated to reduced verbal memory performance. Modeling of effective connectivity revealed a pattern of age-related downregulation of posterior DMN regions driven by inhibitory connections from the hippocampus and middle temporal gyrus. Additionally, there was an observed decline in the hippocampus' susceptibility to network inputs with age, effectively disconnecting itself from other regions. The estimated effective connectivity parameters were robust and able to predict the age in out of sample estimates in a leave-one-out cross-validation. Attained education moderated the effects of aging, largely reversing the observed pattern of inhibitory connectivity. Thus, medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and posterior DMN regions formed an excitatory cycle of extrinsic connections related to the interaction of age and education. This suggests a compensatory role of years of education in effective connectivity, stressing a possible target for interventions. Our findings suggest a connection to the concept of cognitive reserve, which attributes a protective effect of educational level on cognitive decline in aging (Stern, 2009).
