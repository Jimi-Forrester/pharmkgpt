35105303|t|A novel technique for assessment of post-extubation airway obstruction can successfully replace the conventional cuff leak test: a pilot study.
35105303|a|BACKGROUND: Post-extubation airway obstruction is an important complication of tracheal intubation. The cuff leak test is traditionally used to estimate the risk of this complication. However, the cuff leak test parameters are not constant and may depend on the respiratory system and ventilator settings. Furthermore, deflating the cuff also be a risk factor for patient-ventilator asynchrony and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Instead of using the cuff leak test, we measured the pressure of the leak to the upper airway through the gap between the tube and glottis with a constant low flow from the lumen above the cuff without deflating the cuff and called it "pressure above the cuff." The purpose of this study was to investigate whether pressure above the cuff can be used as an alternative to the cuff leak volume. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted at Kumamoto University Hospital after obtaining approval from the institutional review board. The pressure above the cuff was measured using an endotracheal tube with an evacuation lumen above the cuff and an automated cuff pressure modulation device. We pumped 0.16 L per minute of air and measured the steady-state pressure using an automated cuff pressure modulation device. Then, the cuff leak test was performed, and the cuff leak volume was recorded. The cuff leak volume was defined as the difference between the expiratory tidal volume with the cuff inflated and deflated. The relationship between the pressure above the cuff and cuff leak volume was evaluated. The patient-ventilator asynchrony during each measurement was also examined. RESULTS: The pressure above the cuff was measured, and the cuff leak volume was assessed 27 times. The pressure above the cuff was significantly correlated with the cuff leak volume (r = -0.76, p < 0.001). Patient-ventilator asynchrony was detected in 37% of measurements during the cuff leak test, but not during the pressure above the cuff test. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that pressure above the cuff measurement may be a less complicated alternative to the conventional cuff leak test for evaluation of the risk of post-extubation airway obstruction.
