38951593|t|P4HA2 promotes proliferation, invasion, and metastasis through regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in oral squamous cell carcinoma.
38951593|a|Proline 4-hydroxylase 2 (P4HA2) is known for its hydroxylase activity, primarily involved in hydroxylating collagen precursors and promoting collagen cross-linking under physiological conditions. Although its overexpression influences a wide variety of malignant tumors' occurrence and development, its specific effects and mechanisms in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remain unclear. This study focused on investigating the expression patterns, carcinogenic functions, and underlying mechanisms of P4HA2 in OSCC cells. Various databases, including TCGA, TIMER, UALCAN, GEPIA, and K-M plotter, along with paraffin-embedded samples, were used to ascertain P4HA2 expression in cancer and its correlation with clinicopathological features. P4HA2 knockdown and overexpression cell models were developed to assess its oncogenic roles and mechanisms. The results indicated that P4HA2 was overexpressed in OSCC and inversely correlated with patient survival. Knockdown of P4HA2 suppressed invasion, migration, and proliferation of OSCC cells both in vitro and in vivo, whereas overexpression of P4HA2 had the opposite effects. Mechanistically, the phosphorylation levels of the PI3K/AKT pathway were reduced following P4HA2 silencing. The study reveals that P4HA2 acts as a promising biomarker for predicting prognosis in OSCC and significantly affects metastasis, invasion, and proliferation of OSCC cells through the regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
