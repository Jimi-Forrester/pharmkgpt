38068354|t|The Prevalence of Pain in Chronic Diseases: An Umbrella Review of Systematic Reviews.
38068354|a|Since pain is common in many diseases, it is important to summarize the precise prevalence data on pain and high-impact pain, which frequently worsens the quality of life and work activities. This umbrella review aims to estimate the prevalence of pain among patients with different chronic diseases/conditions. We followed the PRISMA guidelines. We identified the following areas addressing the prevalence of pain: (1) pain in cancer patients; (2) neurodegenerative diseases; (3) chronic heart failure; (4) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; (5) chronic kidney diseases; (6) liver diseases and failure; (7) nursing home seniors; and (8) postamputation (phantom) pain. We included systematic reviews and meta-analyses that reported pain in patients from the mentioned populations. The prevalence of pain in chronic diseases is high, in some cases even higher than the cardinal symptoms of these diseases/conditions. Most patients who suffer from any of these diseases/conditions can develop chronic pain at later stages. Pain in chronic diseases does not receive enough attention and is not properly managed. Future studies are warranted to establish a more precise prevalence of chronic pain and develop better methods of pain screening, detection, and management.
