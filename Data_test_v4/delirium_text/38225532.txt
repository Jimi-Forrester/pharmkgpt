38225532|a|The gut microbiota that exists in the human gastrointestinal tract is incredibly important for the maintenance of general health as it contributes to multiple aspects of host physiology. Recent research has revealed a dynamic connection between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system, that can influence neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Indeed, imbalances in the gut microbiota, or dysbiosis, play a vital role in the pathogenesis and progression of human diseases, particularly NDs. Herbal medicine has been used for centuries to treat human diseases, including NDs. These compounds help to relieve symptoms and delay the progression of NDs by improving intestinal barrier function, reducing neuroinflammation, and modulating neurotransmitter production. Notably, herbal medicine can mitigate the progression of NDs by regulating the gut microbiota. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the potential mechanisms by which herbal medicine regulates the gut microbiota in the treatment of NDs can help explain the pathogenesis of NDs from a novel perspective and propose novel therapeutic strategies for NDs. In this review, we investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of herbal medicine, focusing on its ability to regulate the gut microbiota and restore homeostasis. We also highlight the challenges and future research priorities of the integration of herbal medicine and modern medicine. As the global population ages, access to this information is becoming increasingly important for developing effective treatments for these diseases.
