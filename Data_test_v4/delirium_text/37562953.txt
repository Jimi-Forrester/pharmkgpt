37562953|t|Factors influencing sleep quality in the intensive care unit: a descriptive pilot study.
37562953|a|Background: As sleep disturbances are common in the intensive care unit (ICU), this study assessed the sleep quality in the ICU and identified barriers to sleep. Methods: Patients admitted to the ICUs of a tertiary hospital between June 2022 and December 2022 who were not mechanically ventilated at enrollment were included. The quality of sleep (QoS) at home was assessed on a visual analog scale as part of an eight-item survey, while the QoS in the ICU was evaluated using the Korean version of the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (K-RCSQ). Good QoS was defined by a score of >=50. Results: Of the 30 patients in the study, 19 reported a QoS score <50. The Spearman correlation coefficient showed no meaningful relationship between the QoS at home and overall K-RCSQ QoS score in the ICU (r=0.16, P=0.40). The most common barriers to sleep were physical discomfort (43%), being awoken for procedures (43%), and feeling unwell (37%); environmental factors including noise (30%) and light (13%) were also identified sources of sleep disruption. Physical discomfort (32 [28-38] vs. 69 [42-80]; P=0.004), patient care interactions (36 [20-48] vs. 54 [36-80]; P=0.044), and feeling unwell (31 [18-42] vs. 54 [40-76]; P=0.013) were associated with lower K-RCSQ scores. Conclusions: In the ICU, physical discomfort, patient care interactions, and feeling unwell were identified as barriers to sleep.
