28282301|t|Postoperative confusion in older adults.
28282301|a|The development of postoperative confusion in older patients is increasingly being recognized as clinically significant because it is becoming more common as the population ages. Postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction differ in time course of development. Risk factors other than age include certain medications as well as anesthesia (both the type and amount used). Postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction appear to increase a patient's risk for developing dementia. Routine preoperative screening may help to identify patients with preexisting cognitive impairment who are at greatest risk for developing postoperative delirium or postoperative cognitive dysfunction.
