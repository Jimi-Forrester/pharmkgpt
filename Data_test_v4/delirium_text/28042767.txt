28042767|a|OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the review is to portray the theoretical concept on neurological disorders from research data. BACKGROUND: The freak changes in chemical response of nerve impulse causes neurological disorders. The research evidence of the effort done in the older history suggests that the biological drug targets and their effective feature with responsive drugs could be valuable in promoting the future development of health statistics structure for improved treatment for curing the nervous disorders. METHODS: In this review, we summarized the most iterative theoretical concept of structure based drug design approaches in various neurological disorders to unfathomable understanding of reported information for future drug design and development. RESULTS: On the premise of reported information we analyzed the model of theoretical drug designing process for understanding the mechanism and pathology of the neurological diseases which covers the development of potentially effective inhibitors against the biological drug targets. Finally, it also suggests the management and implementation of the current treatment in improving the human health system behaviors. CONCLUSION: With the survey of reported information we concluded the development strategies of diagnosis and treatment against neurological diseases which leads to supportive progress in the drug discovery.
