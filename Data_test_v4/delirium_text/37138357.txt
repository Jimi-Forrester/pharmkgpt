37138357|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive complications are major challenges for postoperative recovery. Acupuncture-related techniques have been used for treating neurocognitive dysfunctions. However, whether they help to prevent postoperative cognitive complicationss remains unclear. We intend to evaluate the effect of acupuncture-related techniques on the incidence of postoperative cognitive complications (PCC) in patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia. METHODS: Based on PRISMA guidelines, a search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed to identify eligible trials published from inception to June 6, 2021. The search was performed in June 2021. The inclusion criteria were prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials that compared acupuncture-related techniques with other techniques or non-acupuncture treatment in patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia. Pooled odds ratios (ORs), 95% CIs, and P values were estimated for end points using fixed and random effects statistical models. RESULTS: The analysis included 12 studies with 1058 patients. Compared with patients not receiving acupuncture, patients treated with acupuncture-related techniques had a lower incidence of PCCs (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.59; P < 0.001; n = 968) and lower levels of biomarkers, including IL-6, TNF-alpha, and S100beta. Acupuncture with needles and without needles showed similar effects on the prevention of PCCs. The effects of acupuncture-related techniques on PCCs were observed in both English and non-English articles. Subgroup analyses showed that both agitation and/or delirium (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.76; P < 0.001; n = 490) and delayed cognitive recovery (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.51; P < 0.001; n = 478) were reduced after treatment with acupuncture-related techniques. In adult studies evaluating MMSE scores, the scores were not different between groups (SMD, - 0.71; 95% CI, - 1.72 to 0.3; P = 0.17; n = 441). CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture-related techniques, including needle techniques and electrical techniques, are associated with fewer postoperative cognitive complications, suggesting that acupuncture could be considered a potential option in the perioperative setting. Additional research is needed to develop higher-quality evidence and optimal regimens. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO (CRD42021258378).
