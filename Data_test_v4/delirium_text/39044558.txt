39044558|t|Atypical Presentation of Ziprasidone-Induced Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: A Case Report.
39044558|a|Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a severe adverse reaction associated with neuroleptic or antipsychotic drugs. This case report discusses a 43-year-old man with a history of bipolar disorder and polysubstance abuse who presented with altered mental status, autonomic dysfunction, and muscular rigidity. The patient had recently started on ziprasidone, a second-generation antipsychotic, leading to an atypical presentation of NMS. Unlike classic findings associated with NMS induced by first-generation antipsychotics, this case lacked high fever, lead pipe rigidity, or elevated creatine kinase levels greater than 1000 on initial presentation. The delay in diagnosis was attributed to the milder symptoms and absence of typical findings, resulting in extensive diagnostic workup and interventions. The patient responded positively to treatment with lorazepam based on the Woodbury severity stage guidelines. This case underscores the complexity of diagnosing NMS induced by second-generation antipsychotics and highlights the need for awareness and tailored treatment approaches for atypical presentations.
