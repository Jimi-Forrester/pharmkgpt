38997907|a|OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this scoping review was to evaluate literature involving opioid-sparing medications in critically ill patients with a focus on clinically meaningful outcomes. DESIGN: Scoping review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. SETTING: Intensive care unit. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients in an intensive care unit setting. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: PubMed and Cochrane Library were searched from October 1, 2019 to June 1, 2023. Inclusion criteria consisted of randomized controlled trials evaluating adjunctive analgesic use in adult patients in an intensive care unit setting. RESULTS: There were 343 citations and titles identified in the initial search, with 328 remaining after removal of duplicates, 294 excluded at title and abstract screening, 34 available for full text review, and six included in the scoping review. Most studies reported modest reductions in opioid use as a secondary endpoint. Improvement in clinical outcomes such as reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation or delirium were reported in two trials with dexmedetomidine. CONCLUSIONS: In recently published trials of adjunctive agents in critically ill patients, opioid-sparing effects were small. Data to support improvements in clinical outcomes remains limited.
