38523839|t|Predictors of postoperative delirium in paediatric patients undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia at Amhara Regional State Tertiary Hospitals: a multicenter prospective study.
38523839|a|Introduction: Postoperative delirium in paediatric patients is a recognised issue. Nevertheless, in low- and middle-income nations, researchers have had luck in determining its extent and predictors. Identifying predictors of postoperative delirium in paediatric patients having general anaesthesia at Tertiary Hospitals in Ethiopia was the aim of this study. Methods: A multicenter, prospective follow up study was conducted from April 15 to June 15, 2023 at the study settings. During the study period a total of 424 paediatric surgical patients treated under general anaesthesia in all study locations, ranging in age from birth to sixteen were candidates for this study. Charts and direct observation of patient's with assessment tool [Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD)] were used from each available patient. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictors of postoperative delirium in paediatric patients undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia. Results: Postoperative delirium occurred in 160 of the 404 paediatric patients who underwent surgery under general anaesthesia. Ophthalmic surgery, corticosteroid use, anticholinergic use, severe postoperative pain, and preoperative anxiety were found to be predictors of postoperative delirium; whereas, sedative medication premedication and paracetamol used for analgesia were found to be protective against postoperative delirium. Inference and recommendation: The postoperative delirium in paediatric patients undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia was higher compared to developed countries. Ophthalmic surgery, corticosteroids, anticholinergic medications, postoperative pain, and preoperative anxiety were found to be predictors. The impact of postoperative delirium might be lessened by concentrating on its screening and factor control.
