36991402|a|BACKGROUND: Preoperative analgesia of hip fracture in elderly patients is important, but it is also lacking. In particular, nerve block was not provided in time. In order to provide more effective analgesia, we designed a multimodal pain management mode based on instant messaging software. METHODS: From May to September 2022, a total of 100 patients with unilateral hip fracture aged over 65 were randomly divided into the test group and the control group. Finally, 44 patients in each group completed the result analysis. A new pain management mode was used in the test group. This mode focuses on the full information exchange between medical personnel in different departments, early fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB), and closed-loop pain management. Outcomes include the time when FICB is completed for the first time; The number of cases of FICB completed by emergency doctors; Patients' pain score, pain duration. RESULTS: The time for patients in the test group to complete FICB for the first time was 3.0 [1.925-3.475] h, which was less than the time for patients in the control group (4.0 [3.300-5.275] h). The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Compared with 16 patients in the control group, 24 patients in the test group completed FICB by emergency doctors, and there was no statistical difference between the two groups (P = 0.087). The test group was superior to the control group in the highest NRS score (4.00 [3.00-4.00] vs 5.00 [4.00-5.75]), the duration of the highest NRS score (20.00 [20.00-25.00] mins vs 40.00 [30.00-48.75] mins), and the NRS > 3 time (35.00 [20.00-45.00] mins vs 72.50 [60.00-45.00] mins). The analgesic satisfaction of patients in the test group (5.00 [4.00-5.00]) was also significantly higher than that of the control group (3.00 [3.00-4.00]). The above four indexes were different between the two groups (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Using instant messaging software, the new model of pain management can enable patients to receive FICB as soon as possible and improve the timeliness and effectiveness of analgesia.
