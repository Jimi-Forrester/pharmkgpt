37485236|t|Microwave-assisted synthesis for a highly selective rhodamine 6G-derived fluorescent sensor and bioimaging.
37485236|a|A new rhodamine 6G derivative R1 has been synthesized by condensation of rhodamine hydrazide and 6-hydroxymethyl-pyridine using microwave-assisted reaction. Naked-eye colorimetric and photo physical studies show the synthesized compound is selectively sensing Cu2+ in CH3CN/H2O (9:1, v/v) solution. Upon coordination with Cu2+ ion, the spirolactam of R1 is opened, which results in a formation of highly fluorescent complex and change in color of the solution. The Job's plot indicates 1:2 binding stoichiometry between Cu2+ ion and R1. Limit of detection for Cu2+ was determined to be 1.23 muM. The sensor was successfully applied to fluorescent imaging of Cu2+ ion in living cells.
