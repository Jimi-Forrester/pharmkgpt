29403551|a|Previous studies have demonstrated that pterostilbene (Pter) prevents oxidative stress, suppresses cell growth and exhibits anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory effects. Pter is used to treat a number of clinical diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, various malignancies and hypercholesteremia. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether Pter protects against acute renal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) and inhibits oxidative stress, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and inflammation in rats. A total of 40 adult male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into the following 5 groups at random: Control group, where rats were not subjected to renal IRI; IRI group, where rats were subjected to renal IRI; Pter 10 group, where rats underwent renal IRI and were treated with 10 mg/kg Pter; Pter 20 group, where rats underwent renal IRI and were treated with 20 mg/kg Pter; Pter 30 group, where rats underwent renal IRI and were treated with 30 mg/kg Pter. The results demonstrated that Pter treatment improved renal function following acute renal IRI. Compared with the untreated renal IRI group, myeloperoxidase, iNOS, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression levels were significantly decreased (P<0.01), whereas IL-10 expression levels were significantly increased (P<0.01) following treatment with Pter in acute renal IRI rats. In addition, Pter significantly attenuated caspase-3 activity and the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling pathway induced by acute renal IRI (P<0.01). These results provide evidence to suggest that administration of Pter may protect against acute renal IRI and inhibit oxidative stress, iNOS expression and inflammation in rats via the TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling pathway.
