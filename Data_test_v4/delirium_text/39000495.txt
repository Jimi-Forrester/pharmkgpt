39000495|t|Novel Insights into Changes in Gene Expression within the Hypothalamus in Two Asthma Mouse Models: A Transcriptomic Lung-Brain Axis Study.
39000495|a|Patients with asthma experience elevated rates of mental illness. However, the molecular links underlying such lung-brain crosstalk remain ambiguous. Hypothalamic dysfunction is observed in many psychiatric disorders, particularly those with an inflammatory component due to many hypothalamic regions being unprotected by the blood-brain barrier. To gain a better insight into such neuropsychiatric sequelae, this study investigated gene expression differences in the hypothalamus following lung inflammation (asthma) induction in mice, using RNA transcriptome profiling. BALB/c mice were challenged with either bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS, E. coli) or ovalbumin (OVA) allergens or saline control (n = 7 per group), and lung inflammation was confirmed via histological examination of postmortem lung tissue. The majority of the hypothalamus was micro-dissected, and total RNA was extracted for sequencing. Differential expression analysis identified 31 statistically significant single genes (false discovery rate FDR5%) altered in expression following LPS exposure compared to controls; however, none were significantly changed following OVA treatment, suggesting a milder hypothalamic response. When gene sets were examined, 48 were upregulated and 8 were downregulated in both asthma groups relative to controls. REACTOME enrichment analysis suggests these gene sets are involved in signal transduction metabolism, immune response and neuroplasticity. Interestingly, we identified five altered gene sets directly associated with neurotransmitter signaling. Intriguingly, many of these altered gene sets can influence mental health and or/neuroinflammation in humans. These findings help characterize the links between asthma-induced lung inflammation and the brain and may assist in identifying relevant pathways and therapeutic targets for future intervention.
