21674238|t|Identification of novel alpha-synuclein isoforms in human brain tissue by using an online nanoLC-ESI-FTICR-MS method.
21674238|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized by intra-neuronal inclusions of Lewy bodies in distinct brain regions. These inclusions consist mainly of aggregated alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) protein. The present study used immunoprecipitation combined with nanoflow liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to high resolution electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR-MS/MS) to determine known and novel isoforms of alpha-syn in brain tissue homogenates. N-terminally acetylated full-length alpha-syn (Ac-alpha-syn1-140) and two N-terminally acetylated C-terminally truncated forms of alpha-syn (Ac-alpha-syn1-139 and Ac-alpha-syn1-103) were found. The different forms of alpha-syn were further studied by Western blotting in brain tissue homogenates from the temporal cortex Brodmann area 36 (BA36) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex BA9 derived from controls, patients with DLB and PD with dementia (PDD). Quantification of alpha-syn in each brain tissue fraction was performed using a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
