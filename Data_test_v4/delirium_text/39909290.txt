39909290|t|The Roles of Functional Bacterial Amyloids in Neurological Physiology and Pathophysiology: Pros and Cons for Neurodegeneration.
39909290|a|Bacterial biofilms, which are complex communities of microorganisms encapsulated in a self-produced extracellular matrix, play critical roles in various diseases. Recent research has underscored the dualistic nature of amyloids, structural proteins within these biofilms, in human health, particularly highlighting the significant role in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). These amyloids modulate the immune response by inducing the production of interleukin-10 (IL-10), which plays a role in anti-inflammatory processes. Additionally, they inhibit the aggregation of human amyloids and enhance the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Detrimentally, they exacerbate neuroinflammation by elevating inflammatory cytokines and promoting the aggregation of human amyloid proteins-amyloid-beta (Abeta) in AD and alpha-synuclein (alphaS) in PD-through a process known as cross-seeding. Moreover, bacterial amyloids have also been shown to stimulate the production of anti-curli/DNA antibodies, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Given their dualistic nature, bacterial amyloids may, under specific conditions, function as beneficial proteins for human health. This understanding holds promise for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating bacterial amyloids in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and PD.
