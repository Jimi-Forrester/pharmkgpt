37791217|t|Blood Alcohol Level as a Predictor of Withdrawal Severity.
37791217|a|Few studies have explored the correlation between the severity of alcohol withdrawal and blood alcohol level at the time of admission. Specifying prognostic factors for life-threatening withdrawal necessitating inpatient pharmacologic management over the course of days would be useful to identify at-risk patients at the time of admission. Hence, we present the case of a 34-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of poly-substance abuse who has presented to our emergency department 11 times over the past four years with a mean blood alcohol level (BAL) of 287 mg/dL upon withdrawal. BAL at the time of withdrawal is highly variable depending on the chronicity of abuse; however, a BAL this elevated is highly unusual and indicative of severe and long-term use. While in the unit at this admission, the patient's BAL was 437 and his withdrawal symptoms were severe, necessitating ICU admission and strong sedating medications to control his symptoms. Even after these interventions, he still demonstrated severe withdrawal symptoms including full body tremors, vital sign instability, and continuous visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations. This patient presents an interesting case of severe alcohol withdrawal at an abnormally elevated blood alcohol level progressing to a prolonged withdrawal course in the ICU. Alcohol level at the time of withdrawal could be a helpful predictor of the course of severity of alcohol withdrawal; however, more studies are required to prove this relationship.
