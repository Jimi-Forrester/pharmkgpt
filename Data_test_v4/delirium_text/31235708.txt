31235708|a|The establishment of new therapeutic strategies for metabolic syndrome is urgently needed because metabolic syndrome, which is characterized by several disorders, such as hypertension, increases the risk of lifestyle-related diseases. One approach is to focus on the pre-disease state, a state with high susceptibility before the disease onset, which is considered as the best period for preventive treatment. In order to detect the pre-disease state, we recently proposed mathematical theory called the dynamical network biomarker (DNB) theory based on the critical transition paradigm. Here, we investigated time-course gene expression profiles of a mouse model of metabolic syndrome using 64 whole-genome microarrays based on the DNB theory, and showed the detection of a pre-disease state before metabolic syndrome defined by characteristic behavior of 147 DNB genes. The results of our study demonstrating the existence of a notable pre-disease state before metabolic syndrome may help to design novel and effective therapeutic strategies for preventing metabolic syndrome, enabling just-in-time preemptive interventions.
