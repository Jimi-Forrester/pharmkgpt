37393057|t|Cardiovascular health, infection burden and their interactive association with brain volumetric and white matter integrity outcomes in the UK biobank.
37393057|a|BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular health is associated with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of pathology and infections may modulate this association. METHODS: Using data from 38,803 adults (aged 40-70 years) and followed-up for 5-15 years, we tested associations of prevalent total (47.5%) and hospital-treated infection burden (9.7%) with brain structural and diffusion-weighted MRI (i.e., sMRI and dMRI, respectively) common in dementia phenome. Poor white matter tissue integrity was operationalized with lower global and tract-specific fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean diffusivity (MD). Volumetric sMRI outcomes included total, gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), frontal bilateral GM, white matter hyperintensity (WMH), and selected based on previous associations with dementia. Cardiovascular health was measured with Life's Essential 8 score (LE8) converted to tertiles. Multiple linear regression models were used, adjusting for intracranial volumes (ICV) for subcortical structures, and for demographic, socio-economic, and the Alzheimer's Disease polygenic risk score for all outcomes, among potential confounders. RESULTS: In fully adjusted models, hospital-treated infections were inversely related to GM (beta +- SE: -1042 +- 379, p = 0.006) and directly related to WMH as percent of ICV (Loge transformed) (beta +- SE:+0.026 +- 0.007, p < 0.001). Both total and hospital-treated infections were associated with poor WMI, while the latter was inversely related to FA within the lowest LE8 tertile (beta +- SE:-0.0011 +- 0.0003, p < 0.001, PLE8xIB < 0.05), a pattern detected for GM, Right Frontal GM, left accumbens and left hippocampus volumes. Within the uppermost LE8 tertile, total infection burden was linked to smaller right amygdala while being associated with larger left frontal GM and right putamen volumes, in the overall sample. Within that uppermost tertile of LE8, caudate volumes were also positively associated with hospital-treated infections. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital-treated infections had more consistent deleterious effects on volumetric and white matter integrity brain neuroimaging outcomes compared with total infectious burden, particularly in poorer cardiovascular health groups. Further studies are needed in comparable populations, including longitudinal studies with multiple repeats on neuroimaging markers.
