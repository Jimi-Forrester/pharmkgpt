34222276|t|Glomerular Endothelial Cells Are the Coordinator in the Development of Diabetic Nephropathy.
34222276|a|The prevalence of diabetes is consistently rising worldwide. Diabetic nephropathy is a leading cause of chronic renal failure. The present study aimed to explore the crosstalk among the different cell types inside diabetic glomeruli, including glomerular endothelial cells, mesangial cells, podocytes, and immune cells, by analyzing an online single-cell RNA profile (GSE131882) of patients with diabetic nephropathy. Differentially expressed genes in the glomeruli were processed by gene enrichment and protein-protein interactions analysis. Glomerular endothelial cells, as well as podocytes, play a critical role in diabetic nephropathy. A subgroup of glomerular endothelial cells possesses characteristic angiogenesis genes, indicating that angiogenesis takes place in the progress of diabetic nephropathy. Immune cells such as macrophages, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and plasma cells also contribute to the disease progression. By using iTALK, the present study reports complicated cellular crosstalk inside glomeruli. Dysfunction of glomerular endothelial cells and immature angiogenesis result from the activation of both paracrine and autocrine signals. The present study reinforces the importance of glomerular endothelial cells in the development of diabetic nephropathy. The exploration of the signaling pathways involved in aberrant angiogenesis reported in the present study shed light on potential therapeutic target(s) for diabetic nephropathy.
