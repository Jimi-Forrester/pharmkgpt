20808106|a|OBJECTIVES: Depression in the elderly might represent a prodromal phase of Alzheimer disease (AD). High levels of plasma amyloid beta-42 (Abeta42) were found in prestages of AD and also in depressed patients in cross-sectional studies. This study examined the association of emerging late-onset depression (LOD) and AD with plasma Abeta42 in a sample of never depressed and not demented persons at baseline. DESIGN: Prospective 5-year longitudinal study. PARTICIPANTS: A community dwelling of older adults (N = 331) from the Vienna Transdanube Aging study. MEASUREMENTS: Laboratory measurements, cognitive functioning, and depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline, 2.5, and 5 years follow-ups. RESULTS: After exclusion of converters to AD, regression analysis revealed that higher plasma Abeta42 at baseline was a positive predictor for conversion to first episode of LOD. Independent of whether persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at 2.5 years were included or excluded into regressions, higher plasma Abeta42 at baseline was a significant predictor for the development of probable or possible AD at 5 years. Higher conversion to AD was also associated with male gender but not with either higher scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), with stroke or cerebral infarction nor apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele. No association was found for an interaction between plasma Abeta42 levels and GDS. CONCLUSIONS: Higher plasma Abeta42 at baseline predicted the development of first episode of LOD and conversion to probable or possible AD. Emerging depression as measured by scores on GDS at the 2.5-year follow-up, either alone or as an interaction factor with plasma Abeta42, failed to predict the conversion to AD at 5 years.
