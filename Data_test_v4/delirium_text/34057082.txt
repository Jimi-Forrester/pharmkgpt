34057082|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by impairments in synaptic plasticity and cognitive performance. Cognitive dysfunction and loss of neuronal plasticity are known to begin decades before the clinical diagnosis of the disease. The important influence of congenital genetic mutations on the early development of AD provides a novel opportunity to initiate treatment during early development to prevent the Alzheimer-like behavior and synaptic dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: To explore strategies for early intervention to prevent Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the effect of treatment during early development with a ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) derived peptidergic compound, P021 (Ac-DGGLAG-NH2) on cognitive function and synaptic plasticity in 3xTg-AD transgenic mouse model of AD. 3xTg-AD and genetic background-matched wild type female mice were treated from birth to postnatal day 120 with P021 in diet or as a control with vehicle diet, and cognitive function and molecular markers of neuroplasticity were evaluated. RESULTS: P021 treatment during early development prevented cognitive impairment and increased expressions of pCREB and BDNF that activated downstream various signaling cascades such as PLC/PKC, MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt, and ameliorated synaptic protein deficit in 4-month-old 3xTg-AD mice. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that treatment with the neurotrophic peptide mimetic such as P021 during early development can be an effective therapeutic strategy to rescue synaptic deficit and cognitive impairment in familial AD and related tauopathies.
