33396487|t|The Significance of True Knot of the Umbilical Cord in Long-Term Offspring Neurological Health.
33396487|a|We aimed to study both the short- and long-term neurological implications in offspring born with confirmed knotting of the umbilical cord-"true knot of cord". In this population based cohort study, a comparison of perinatal outcome and long-term neurological hospitalizations was performed on the basis of presence or absence of true knot of cord. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was constructed to compare the cumulative incidence of neurological hospitalizations between the study groups. Multivariable regression models were used to assess the independent association between true knot of cord, perinatal mortality and long term neurological related hospitalizations, while controlling for potential confounders. The study included 243,639 newborns, of them 1.1% (n = 2606) were diagnosed with true knot of the umbilical cord. Higher rates of intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) were noted in the exposed group, a finding which remained significant in the multivariable generalized estimation equation, while controlling for confounders. The cumulative incidences of neurological hospitalizations over time were comparable between the groups. The Cox regression confirmed a lack of association between true knot of cord and total long term neurological related hospitalizations. While presence of true knot of the umbilical cord is associated with higher IUFD rates, in our population, however, its presence does not appear to impact the long term neurological health of exposed offspring.
