39335626|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent kind of dementia and is a long-term degenerative disease. Pathologically, it is defined by the development of extracellular amyloid-beta plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles made up of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. This causes neuronal death, particularly in the hippocampus and cortex. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes have been identified as possibly therapeutic and have promise for Alzheimer's disease due to their regenerative characteristics. METHODS: A systematic retrieval of information was performed on PubMed. A total of 60 articles were found in a search on mesenchymal stem cells, exosomes, and Alzheimer's disease. A total of 16 ongoing clinical trials were searched and added from clinicaltrials.gov. We added 23 supporting articles to help provide information for certain sections. In total, we included 99 articles in this manuscript: 50 are review articles, 13 are preclinical studies, 16 are clinical studies, 16 are ongoing clinical trials, and 4 are observational studies. Appropriate studies were isolated, and important information from each of them was understood and entered into a database from which the information was used in this article. The clinical trials on mesenchymal stem cell exosomes for Alzheimer's disease were searched on clinicaltrials.gov. RESULTS: Several experimental investigations have shown that MSC-Exo improves cognitive impairment in rats. In this review paper, we summarized existing understanding regarding the molecular and cellular pathways behind MSC-Exo-based cognitive function restoration, with a focus on MSC-Exo's therapeutic potential in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSION: AD is a significant health issue in our culture and is linked to several important neuropathological characteristics. Exosomes generated from stem cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or neural stem cells (NSCs), have been examined more and more in a variety of AD models, indicating that they may be viable therapeutic agents for the treatment of diverse disorders. Exosome yields may be increased, and their therapeutic efficacy can be improved using a range of tailored techniques and culture conditions. It is necessary to provide standardized guidelines for exosome manufacture to carry out excellent preclinical and clinical research.
