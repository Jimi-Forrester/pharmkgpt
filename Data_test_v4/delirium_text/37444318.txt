37444318|t|Chemical Fingerprinting, Aorta Endothelium Relaxation Effect, and Enzymatic Inhibition of Canelo (Drimys winteri J. R. Forst. & G. Forst, (D.C) A. Gray, Family Winteraceae) Fruits.
37444318|a|Drimys winteri J.R. Forst. & G. Forst (D.C) G. Gray, var. chilensis (canelo) is an endemic tree from Chile. Since pre-Columbian times, it has produced a fruit known as the canelo pepper, (pimienta de canelo) or Foye pepper, which can be used as a spice. The chemical and biological analysis of canelo fruits is reported for the first time in this study, that is, its phenolic fingerprinting by UHPLC-PDA- Q-orbitrap MS, the antioxidant activity, the enzymatic inhibitory activity, and its relaxation effects on rat aorta. The proximal composition and the mineral content (Ca: 1.45 +- 0.03 mg/100 g; Mg: 7.72 +- 0.03 mg/100 g; Fe: 4.54 +- 0.21 mg/100 g; Zn: 2.99 +- 0.02 mg/100 g; Mn: 1.08 +- 0.03 mg/100 g; Cu: 0.82 +- 0.02 mg/100 g; K: 53.03 +- 0.20 mg/100 g; Na: 0.087 +- 0.00 mg/100 g) are also reported. The canelo fruits showed a total phenolic content of 57.33 +- 0.82 mg GAE/g dry weight. In addition, the total flavonoid content was 38.42 +- 1.32 mg equivalent of QE/g dry weight. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by employing DPPH and ABTS methods (IC50 of 6.65 +- 0.5 and 9.5 +- 0.05 mug/mL, respectively), ORAC (25.33 +- 1.2 mumol Trolox/g dry plant) and FRAP (45.56 +- 1.32 mumol Trolox/g dry plant). The enzymatic inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and tyrosinase (IC50: 1.94 +- 0.07, 2.73 +- 0.05, and 9.92 +- 0.05 microg extract/mL, respectively) is also reported. Canelo extract led to an 89% relaxation of rat aorta. Our results confirm that D. winteri fruits are a rich source of secondary metabolites and can inhibit enzymes associated with neurodegenerative diseases; the results also suggest that canelo may induce a potentially hypotensive effect in rat aorta. The study demonstrates the medicinal properties of canelo fruit and spice.
