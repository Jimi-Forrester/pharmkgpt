36083499|a|Communication is one of the fundamental human needs. It includes not only expressing oneself but also verbal and nonverbal communication and establishing contact to other people. In the context of intensive care treatment, influences such as sedation, delirium or the need for an artificial airway, be it a tube or tracheostomy, can make verbal communication almost impossible. In addition, nonverbal communication possibilities are often restricted by physical weakness or illness. Despite these difficulties, there is always a communication relationship, verbal or nonverbal, between patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and the team. A lack of willingness in the team or mistakes in communication leave patients with a perception of not being heard or not being noticed. As a result, the patients can develop an impression of powerlessness and helplessness. It is precisely in these situations of dependency that there is a risk of overriding the patient's will and exercising coercion. Communication with patients in the ICU is a challenging process. Difficulties that arise here not only burden patients in the ICU but can also lead to frustration and moral stress in the team. The team should reflect on the imbalance of influences on communication between patients and the team in order to help the patients to survive and cope with the critical period by using tools and appreciative communication.
