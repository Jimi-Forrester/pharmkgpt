38114999|t|IL-1beta may be an indicator of peritoneal deterioration after healing of peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis.
38114999|a|BACKGROUND: Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an essential lifesaving treatment for end-stage renal disease. However, PD therapy is limited by peritoneal inflammation, which leads to peritoneal membrane failure because of progressive peritoneal deterioration. Peritonitis is the most common complication in patients undergoing PD. Thus, elucidating the mechanism of chronic peritoneal inflammation after PD-associated peritonitis is an urgent issue for patients undergoing PD. This first case report suggests that an increased interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) expression in the peritoneal dialysate after healing of peritonitis can contribute to peritoneal deterioration. CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old woman was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus 10 years ago and had been started on PD for end-stage renal disease. One day, the patient developed PD-associated acute peritonitis and was admitted to our hospital for treatment. Thus, treatment with antimicrobial agents was initiated for PD-associated peritonitis. Dialysate turbidity gradually disappeared after treatment with antimicrobial agents, and the number of cells in the PD fluid decreased. After 2 weeks of antimicrobial therapy, peritonitis was clinically cured, and the patient was discharged. Thereafter, the patient did not develop peritonitis; however, residual renal function tended to decline, and peritoneal function also decreased in a relatively short period. We evaluated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels before and after PD-associated peritonitis; interestingly, the levels of IL-1beta remained high in the PD fluid, even after remission of bacterial peritonitis. In addition, it correlated with decreased peritoneal function. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that inflammasome-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to chronic inflammation-induced peritoneal deterioration after PD-related peritonitis is cured.
