35970311|a|Aging is fundamental to neurodegeneration and dementia. Preventing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are potential methods of delaying the onset of aging-associated neurodegenerative diseases. The acidic oligosaccharide sugar chain (AOSC) and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) can increase the expression of antioxidants and have a neuroprotective function. In this study, we investigate the ability of AOSC, HBO, and AOSC + HBO to prevent D-gal-induced brain senescence. The Morris water maze and Y-maze test results showed that all three therapies significantly attenuated D-gal-induced memory disorders. A potential mechanism of this action was decreasing elevated levels of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. The western blot and morphological results showed that all three therapies decreased D-gal-induced neuroinflammation and downregulated inflammatory mediators including the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Taken together, our results indicated that AOSC, HBO, and AOSC + HBO therapies attenuated D-gal-induced brain aging in mice by repressing RAGE/NF-KB-induced inflammation, the activation of astrocytes and microglia, and a decrease in neuronal degeneration. These could be useful therapies for treating age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, HBO combined with AOSC had a better effect than HBO or AOSC alone.
