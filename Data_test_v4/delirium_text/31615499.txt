31615499|a|BACKGROUND: The global increase in elderly populations is accompanied by an increasing number of candidates for esophagectomy. Here we aimed to determine the postoperative outcomes after subtotal esophagectomy in elderly patients with esophageal cancer. METHODS: Patients (n = 432) with who underwent curative-intent transthoracic subtotal esophagectomy with 2- or 3-field lymphadenectomies for thoracic esophageal cancer were classified as follows: non-elderly (age < 75 years, n = 373) and elderly (age >= 75 years, n = 59) and groups. To balance the essential variables including neoadjuvant treatment and stage of progression, we conducted propensity score analysis, and clinical characteristics, perioperative course and prognosis were compared. RESULTS: After two-to-one propensity score matching, 100 and 50 patients were classified in the non-elderly and elderly groups. The elderly group had more comorbidities and lower preoperative cholinesterase activities and prognostic nutrition indexes. Although incidences of postoperative pneumonia, arrhythmia and delirium were slightly increased in the elderly group, no significant differences were observed in overall incidence of postoperative complications, rates of repeat surgery and death caused by surgery, and length of postoperative hospital stay between the two groups. There were no significant differences in disease-free and disease-specific survival as well as overall survival between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Older age (>=75 years) had limited impact on morbidity, disease recurrence, and survival after subtotal esophagectomy. Therefore, age should not prevent older patients from benefitting from surgery.
