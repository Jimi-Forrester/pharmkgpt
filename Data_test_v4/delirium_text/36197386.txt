36197386|a|OBJECTIVE: analyze the structure of teaching programs and contents of the adolescent health and its development in nursing education. METHOD: descriptive observational study conducted in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Data was collected by the Instrument for (self-)evaluation of the adolescent health and development component in undergraduate nursing programs, and investigated using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 95 nursing schools participated in the study (84.1% of the total). Of the faculty responsible for teaching contents relating to adolescent health, 31.6% had no specific training on the topic and 18.9% had no educational/pedagogical training. Behavior, gender identity and sexual orientation, bullying and cyberbullying, use of digital technologies, partner violence, parenting, and pubertal delay were the main topics which could be incorporated into nursing education. CONCLUSION: the faculty of the schools analyzed have limited education in pedagogical/educational topics and specific adolescent health issues. Curricula should be updated, including knowledge of laws and policies, thus expanding nurses' ability to generate, analyze and use data for decision making. (1) 31.6% of faculty have no specific education in adolescent health. (2) 18.9% of faculty have no educational/pedagogical training. (3) Progress is needed in the use of active methodologies and interactive multimedia. (4) Knowledge of laws and policies for the adolescent population must be expanded. (5) Current and relevant adolescent health issues need to be addressed in nursing education.
