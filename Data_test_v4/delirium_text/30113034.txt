30113034|a|Intact amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) may undergo prion-like aggregation when they interact with chemically or structurally modified variants of Abeta present in extracellular pathohistological inclusions (amyloid plaques). This aggregation is regarded as one of the key molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Zinc ions are involved in the pathological dimerization and oligomerization of natural Abeta isoforms, and zinc-induced oligomers can also initiate the pathological aggregation of Abeta. Based on the earlier found molecular mechanism of zinc-dependent oligomerization of Abeta, it has been suggested that the targeted inhibition of the 11EVHH14 site in one Abeta molecule from zinc-mediated interactions with the same site of another Abeta molecule can effectively inhibit the oligomerization and aggregation of Abeta. Taking into account the similarity in the structural organization of zinc-binding sites within Abeta and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), we hypothesized that inhibitors of the ACE active sites could specifically interact with the 11EVHH14 site of Abeta. Using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we have found that the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat effectively inhibits zinc-dependent dimerization of the metal-binding domains of intact Abeta and Abeta with isomerized Asp7 (isoAbeta). We have also found that enalaprilat protects SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells from the toxic effects of Abeta(1-42) and isoAbeta(1-42), which are among the most common components of amyloid plaques. The results confirm the role of zincdependent oligomerization of Abeta in AD pathogenesis and make it possible one to consider enalaprilat as a prototype of antiaggregation agents for treating AD.
