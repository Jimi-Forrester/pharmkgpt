30282362|a|Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is involved in proteolytic processing of the amyloid-beta(Abeta) peptide implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and known products of ACE-based processing of Abeta42 are characterized by reduced aggregability and cytotoxicity. Recently it has been demonstrated that ACE can act as an arginine specific endopeptidase cleaving the N-terminal pentapeptide (Abeta1-5) from synthetic Abeta peptide analogues. In the context of proteolytic processing of full length Abeta42, this suggests possible formation of Abeta6-42 species. The aim of this study was to test a hypothesis that some N-terminally truncated Abeta peptide(s) could retain aggregability and neurotoxic properties typical for Abeta42. We have investigated aggregability of two amyloid-beta peptides, Abeta6-42 and isoD7-Abeta6-42, mimicking potential proteolytic products of Abeta42 and isoD7-Abeta42, and evaluated their effects on the repertoire of brain Abeta binding proteins, and cytotoxicity towards neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Aggregability of isoD7-Abeta6-42 and Abeta6-42 was higher than that of full-length peptides Abeta42 and isoD7-Abeta42, while the repertoire of mouse brain Abeta binding proteins dramatically decreased. Abeta6-42 and isoD7-Abeta6-42 exhibited higher neurotoxicity towards SH-SY5Y cells than Abeta42 and isoD7-Abeta42, respectively. They effectively stimulated production of ROS and NO, and also TNFalpha secretion by cells. Thus, our results suggest that ACE-dependent processing of full-length Abetas could result in formation of more pathogenic peptides.
