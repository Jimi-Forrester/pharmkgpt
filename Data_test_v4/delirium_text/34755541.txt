34755541|a|Background Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) causes cognitive decline, but it is not known whether it is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). Methods and Results Participants with CAA, mild cognitive impairment, mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, and normal cognition were recruited from stroke and dementia clinics and community advertising. NPS were captured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire short form. The number and total severity (number multiplied by severity of each symptom [mild, moderate, or severe]) of NPS were analyzed using generalized linear regression with a negative binomial link and multiple linear regression, adjusting for age, sex, and education. A total of 109 participants (43 with CAA, 15 with Alzheimer's disease, 28 with mild cognitive impairment, and 23 with normal cognition) (mean age 71.1 [SD=7.6]; 53.2% male) were included. The most frequent NPS in CAA were depression/dysphoria (48.8%), irritability/lability (37.2%), agitation/aggression (37.2%), apathy/indifference (34.9%), and anxiety (32.6%). In adjusted models, patients with CAA had 3.2 times (95% CI, 1.7-6.0) more NPS symptoms and 3.1 units (95% CI, 1.0-5.1) higher expected severity score. The number of NPS was similar to patients with mild cognitive impairment (3.2 times higher than controls) but less than in patients with Alzheimer's disease dementia (4.1 times higher than controls). Within patients with CAA, there were 1.20 times (95% CI, 1.01-1.32) more NPS per 1% increase in white matter hyperintensity as a percentage of intracranial volume. Conclusions NPS are common in CAA, with a similar prevalence as in mild cognitive impairment. The association of the total number of NPS with higher white matter hyperintensity volume suggests that white matter damage may underlie some of these symptoms.
