37932406|a|This study aimed to evaluate the effects of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) on major adverse cardiac events (MACE) among patients who underwent PCI procedure. We used data from the electronic medical records (EMR) of a tertiary hospital in Seoul, Korea, from January 2014 to February 2020. Data from 2988 patients who had experienced their first acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were included during the study period. we classified patients into CR participants and non-participants based on their participation in the cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program within 30 days after discharge. And the outcome was the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke within 1 year after discharge. The association between participation in CR and risk of developing MACE was evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Patients who achieved CR after undergoing PCI were at a lower risk of developing MI (HR 0.68, CI 0.53-0.86). There was no significant association between participation in CR and the incidence of stroke. Among patients who had more than three stenotic vessels, the risk of developing MI within 1 year of discharge was reduced in CR users compared to non-users (3 or more stenosis vessels: HR 0.55, CI 0.35-0.86). Among patients who used two and more stents during PCI procedures, the risk of developing MI within 1 year of discharge was reduced in CR users compared to non-users (2 and more stents: HR 0.54, CI 0.35-0.85). Among people diagnosed with ACS and receiving PCI, patients who participated in CR within one month of discharge reduced risk of developing MI. Our study reinforced the current evidence on the effect of CR among patients receiving PCI and presented the expansion and enhancement of the CR program.
