37830677|t|Personalized Technological Support for Informal Caregivers of Older People with Dementia: A Co-Design Approach Involving Potential End Users and Healthcare Professionals in Three Focus Groups in Italy.
37830677|a|Informal/family caregivers (ICs) of older people with dementia (PwD) can suffer from depression and burnout. However, digital solutions can potentially provide innovative ways to facilitate care provision. The aim of this study was to analyze the opinions of end users (EUs), i.e., PwD aged 65 years and over and their ICs and healthcare professionals (HPs), on the use of digital technology to support care activities. Qualitative data were collected during the co-design phase of the European project "DemiCare-Personalized support for informal caregivers of people with dementia". This study focused on the Italian context and included two PwD, three ICs, and seven HPs. Three focus groups were held in April-June 2022. Qualitative data were analyzed using MaxQDA 2020 software. Seven thematic areas were identified: daily activities, care tasks, information needs, support received, relationship with and expectations from technology, functionality of the DemiCare integrated system, and ethical issues. Smart devices seemed to be received positively by ICs and HPs, although older PwD seemed to have difficulty accepting the technology. Overall, despite the low number of participants, it seems important and potentially effective to consider the needs and preferences of PwD during exploratory co-design to allow social interactions with them. This study was not registered.
