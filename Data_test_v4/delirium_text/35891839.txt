35891839|t|Arteria Lusoria With Right-Sided Aortic Arch and Atrial Septal Defect Associated With Extensive Thrombosis and Paradoxical Embolism: A Case Report.
35891839|a|In this report, we present an incidental finding of a rare combination of an Aberrant Right Subclavian Artery (ARSA), or arteria lusoria, with right-sided aortic arch and atrial septal defect associated with extensive thrombosis and paradoxical embolism causing acute stroke in an octogenarian woman with COPD presenting with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. We also discuss the various surgical approaches for management and conservative treatment alternatives in non-surgical candidates (as in this case). We believe that this is the first reported case of these combined rare anomalies in an asymptomatic patient to the best of our knowledge.
