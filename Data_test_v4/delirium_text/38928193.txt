38928193|t|A Systematic Review of the Predictive and Diagnostic Uses of Neuroinflammation Biomarkers for Epileptogenesis.
38928193|a|A central role for neuroinflammation in epileptogenesis has recently been suggested by several investigations. This systematic review explores the role of inflammatory mediators in epileptogenesis, its association with seizure severity, and its correlation with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). The study analysed articles published in JCR journals from 2019 to 2024. The search strategy comprised the MESH, free terms of "Neuroinflammation", and selective searches for the following single biomarkers that had previously been selected from the relevant literature: "High mobility group box 1/HMGB1", "Toll-Like-Receptor 4/TLR-4", "Interleukin-1/IL-1", "Interleukin-6/IL-6", "Transforming growth factor beta/TGF-beta", and "Tumour necrosis factor-alpha/TNF-alpha". These queries were all combined with the MESH terms "Epileptogenesis" and "Epilepsy". We found 243 articles related to epileptogenesis and neuroinflammation, with 356 articles from selective searches by biomarker type. After eliminating duplicates, 324 articles were evaluated, with 272 excluded and 55 evaluated by the authors. A total of 21 articles were included in the qualitative evaluation, including 18 case-control studies, 2 case series, and 1 prospective study. As conclusion, this systematic review provides acceptable support for five biomarkers, including TNF-alpha and some of its soluble receptors (sTNFr2), HMGB1, TLR-4, CCL2 and IL-33. Certain receptors, cytokines, and chemokines are examples of neuroinflammation-related biomarkers that may be crucial for the early diagnosis of refractory epilepsy or may be connected to the control of epileptic seizures. Their value will be better defined by future studies.
