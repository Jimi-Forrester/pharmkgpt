38031413|a|In recent years, trehalose, a natural disaccharide, has attracted growing attention because of the discovery of its potential to induce autophagy. Trehalose has also been demonstrated to preserve the protein's structural integrity and to limit the aggregation of pathologically misfolded proteins. Both of these properties have made trehalose a promising therapeutic candidate to target autophagy-related disorders and protein aggregation diseases. Unfortunately, trehalose has poor bioavailability due to its hydrophilic nature and susceptibility to enzymatic degradation. Recently, trehalose-bearing carriers, in which trehalose is incorporated either by chemical conjugation or physical entrapment, have emerged as an alternative option to free trehalose to improve its efficacy, particularly for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, atherosclerosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and cancers. In the current Perspective, we discuss all existing literature in this emerging field and try to identify key challenges for researchers intending to develop trehalose-bearing carriers to stimulate autophagy or inhibit protein aggregation.
