37541395|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in older adults and characterized by progressive loss of memory and cognitive functions that are associated with amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Immune cells play an important role in the clearance of Abeta deposits and neurofibrillary tangles. T cells are the major component of the immune system. The thymus is the primary organ for T cell generation. T cell development in the thymus depends on thymic epithelial cells (TECs). However, TECs undergo both qualitative and quantitative loss over time. We have previously reported that a recombinant (r) protein containing FOXN1 and a protein transduction domain can increase the number of TECs and subsequently increases the number of T cells in mice. In this study we determined the ability of rFOXN1 to affect cognitive performance and AD pathology in mice. METHODS: Aged 3xTg-AD and APP/PS1 AD mice were injected with rFOXN1 or control protein. Cognitive performance, AD pathology, the thymic microenvironment and immune cells were then analyzed. RESULTS: Administration of rFOXN1 into AD mice improves cognitive performance and reduces Abeta plaque load and phosphorylated tau in the brain. This is related to rejuvenating the aged thymic microenvironment, which results in enhanced T cell generation in the thymus, leading to increased number of T cells, especially IFNgamma-producing T cells, in the spleen and the choroid plexus (CP), enhanced expression of immune cell trafficking molecules in the CP, and increased migration of monocyte-derived macrophages into the brain. Furthermore, the production of anti-Abeta antibodies in the serum and the brain, and the macrophage phagocytosis of Abeta are enhanced in rFOXN1-treated AD mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that rFOXN1 protein has the potential to provide a novel approach to treat AD patients.
