31396581|t|Mitochondrial-Endoplasmic Reticulum Interplay: A Lifelong On-Off Relationship?
31396581|a|This article comments recent publications that highlight an intriguing importance of specific settings in the interaction between the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum to ensure cell-specific functions like the responsiveness to elevated glucose in pancreatic beta-cells. Hence, alterations of the mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum communications under various pathological conditions like aging or cancer often come with enhanced Ca2+ transfer that, in turn, yields stimulation of basal mitochondrial activity to meet the increasing adenosine triphosphate demand of the very cell. Such observations identify mitochondria-associated membranes as potential target for new therapeutic strategies against aging or cancer.
