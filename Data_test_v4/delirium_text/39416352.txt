39416352|a|Background: As the population ages, the prevalence of dementia in Indonesia is rapidly increasing. In Indonesia, dementia care is primarily provided by informal or family caregivers. However, there is limited information about these caregivers' understanding of dementia and the factors that may influence their knowledge. Given that family members are the primary source of dementia care in Indonesia, it is essential to understand their knowledge and identify any gaps to inform future educational interventions. Objective: To explore the knowledge of dementia among Indonesian family caregivers and identify the sociodemographic factors associated with dementia knowledge. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2022 with 200 family caregivers who were members of Alzheimer's Indonesia (ALZI) support groups. These caregivers received invitations via ALZI to complete a translated version of the Dementia Knowledge Assessment Scale (DKAS-I). Independent t-tests and ANOVAs were used to examine differences in dementia knowledge across various subgroups, such as gender, education, and age. Results: Seventy-six family caregivers completed the DKAS-I (38% response rate). Respondents had an average age of 49 years, were mostly female, and the majority were children of people with dementia. Over two-thirds of the DKAS-I items were answered correctly by family caregivers, with the 'care considerations' domain scoring the highest. Age, relationship to the person with dementia (being a child), and prior dementia education were significantly correlated with higher dementia knowledge in our sample. Conclusion: Family caregivers of people living with dementia across 10 Indonesian provinces who were members of dementia support groups demonstrated moderate dementia knowledge. Targeted education is needed to address gaps in knowledge about communication and behavioural changes in people with dementia and other areas related to quality of care. There is an opportunity for gerontological nurses with specialised dementia knowledge to lead educational initiatives for family caregivers to enhance their capacity. Future research should also investigate the dementia knowledge of caregivers in the general population, who may be older and less educated compared to the participants in this study.
