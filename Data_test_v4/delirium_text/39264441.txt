39264441|t|Association between blood-based protein biomarkers and brain MRI in the Alzheimer's disease continuum: a systematic review.
39264441|a|Blood-based biomarkers (BBM) are becoming easily detectable tools to reveal pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). A comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the association between BBM and brain MRI parameters is not available. This systematic review aimed to summarize the literature on the associations between the main BBM and MRI markers across the clinical AD continuum. A systematic literature search was carried out on PubMed and Web of Science and a total of 33 articles were included. Hippocampal volume was positively correlated with Abeta42 and Abeta42/Abeta40 and negatively with Abeta40 plasma levels. P-tau181 and p-tau217 concentrations were negatively correlated with temporal grey matter volume and cortical thickness. NfL levels were negatively correlated with white matter microstructural integrity, whereas GFAP levels were positively correlated with myo-inositol values in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus. These findings highlight consistent associations between various BBM and brain MRI markers even in the pre-clinical and prodromal stages of AD. This suggests a possible advantage in combining multiple AD-related markers to improve accuracy of early diagnosis, prognosis, progression monitoring and treatment response.
