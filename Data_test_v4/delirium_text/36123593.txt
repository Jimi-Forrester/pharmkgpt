36123593|t|Impact of tight blood glucose control within normal fasting ranges with insulin titration prescribed by the Leuven algorithm in adult critically ill patients: the TGC-fast randomized controlled trial.
36123593|a|BACKGROUND: It remains controversial whether critical illness-related hyperglycemia should be treated or not, since randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown context-dependent outcome effects. Whereas pioneer RCTs found improved outcome by normalizing blood glucose in patients receiving early parenteral nutrition (PN), a multicenter RCT revealed increased mortality in patients not receiving early PN. Although withholding early PN has become the feeding standard, the multicenter RCT showing harm by tight glucose control in this context has been criticized for its potentially unreliable glucose control protocol. We hypothesize that tight glucose control is effective and safe using a validated protocol in adult critically ill patients not receiving early PN. METHODS: The TGC-fast study is an investigator-initiated, multicenter RCT. Patients unable to eat, with need for arterial and central venous line and without therapy restriction, are randomized upon ICU admission to tight (80-110 mg/dl) or liberal glucose control (only initiating insulin when hyperglycemia >215 mg/dl, and then targeting 180-215 mg/dl). Glucose measurements are performed on arterial blood by a blood gas analyzer, and if needed, insulin is only administered continuously through a central venous line. If the arterial line is no longer needed, glucose is measured on capillary blood. In the intervention group, tight control is guided by the validated LOGIC-Insulin software. In the control arm, a software alert is used to maximize protocol compliance. The intervention is continued until ICU discharge, until the patient is able to eat or no longer in need of a central venous line, whatever comes first. The study is powered to detect, with at least 80% power and a 5% alpha error rate, a 1-day difference in ICU dependency (primary endpoint), and a 1.5% increase in hospital mortality (safety endpoint), for which 9230 patients need to be included. Secondary endpoints include acute and long-term morbidity and mortality, and healthcare costs. Biological samples are collected to study potential mechanisms of organ protection. DISCUSSION: The ideal glucose target for critically ill patients remains debated. The trial will inform physicians on the optimal glucose control strategy in adult critically ill patients not receiving early PN. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03665207.
