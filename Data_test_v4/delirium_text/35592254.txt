35592254|t|Retrosplenial Cortex Effects Contextual Fear Formation Relying on Dysgranular Constituent in Rats.
35592254|a|Animal contextual fear conditioning (CFC) models are the most-studied forms used to explore the neural substances of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In addition to the well-recognized hippocampal-amygdalar system, the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is getting more and more attention due to substantial involvement in CFC, but with a poor understanding of the specific roles of its two major constituents-dysgranular (RSCd) and granular (RSCg). The current study sought to identify their roles and underlying brain network mechanisms during the encoding processing of the rat CFC model. Rats with pharmacologically inactivated RSCd, RSCg, and corresponding controls underwent contextual fear conditioning. [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) scanning was performed for each animal. The 5-h and 24-h retrieval were followed to test the formation of contextual memory. Graph theoretic tools were used to identify the brain metabolic network involved in encoding phase, and changes of nodal (brain region) properties linked, respectively, to disturbed RSCd and RSCg were analyzed. Impaired retrieval occurred in disturbed RSCd animals, not in RSCg ones. The RSC, hippocampus (Hip), amygdala (Amy), piriform cortex (Pir), and visual cortex (VC) are hub nodes of the brain-wide network for contextual fear memory encoding in rats. Nodal degree and efficiency of hippocampus and its connectivity with amygdala, Pir, and VC were decreased in rats with disturbed RSCd, while not in those with suppressed RSCg. The RSC plays its role in contextual fear memory encoding mainly relying on its RSCd part, whose condition would influence the activity of the hippocampal-amygdalar system.
