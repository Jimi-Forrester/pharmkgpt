37446296|t|The QPLEX  Plus Assay Kit for the Early Clinical Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.
37446296|a|We recently developed a multiplex diagnostic kit, QPLEX  Alz plus assay kit, which captures amyloid-beta1-40, galectin-3 binding protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and periostin simultaneously using microliters of peripheral blood and utilizes an optimized algorithm for screening Alzheimer's disease (AD) by correlating with cerebral amyloid deposition. Owing to the demand for early AD detection, we investigate the potential of our kit for the early clinical diagnosis of AD. A total of 1395 participants were recruited, and their blood samples were analyzed with the QPLEX  kit. The average of QPLEX  algorithm values in each group increased gradually in the order of the clinical progression continuum of AD: cognitively normal (0.382 +- 0.150), subjective cognitive decline (0.452 +- 0.130), mild cognitive impairment (0.484 +- 0.129), and AD (0.513 +- 0.136). The algorithm values between each group showed statistically significant differences among groups divided by Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating. The QPLEX  algorithm values could be used to distinguish the clinical continuum of AD or cognitive function. Because blood-based diagnosis is more accessible, convenient, and cost- and time-effective than cerebral spinal fluid or positron emission tomography imaging-based diagnosis, the QPLEX  kit can potentially be used for health checkups and the early clinical diagnosis of AD.
