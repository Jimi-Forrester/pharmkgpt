37203034|a|Ophthalmic disorders have psychiatric aspects associated with them at various levels. Psychological factors have a well-documented role in the causation, aggravation, and maintenance of various ophthalmic conditions, including glaucoma, central serous retinopathy, dry eye disease, and retinitis pigmentosa. Many ophthalmic conditions, including blindness, have psychological manifestations as well, which need to be addressed, in addition to the ophthalmic pathology. There is also significant overlap in the treatment of the two disciplines in many ways. For instance, many ophthalmic drugs have psychiatric side effects. Even ophthalmological surgeries have psychiatric aspects associated with them, which primarily include black patch psychosis and anxiety in the operation theater. This review will be useful for psychiatrists and ophthalmologists, for their clinical practice and research. Future research should focus on this interface to give it its well-deserved attention.
