37580674|a|BACKGROUND: Given a lack of studies precisely indicating how many steps elderly people should take daily for their antioxidant defence, bone metabolism, and cognitive abilities to improve, our study set out to compare the selected antioxidant, prooxidant, bone turnover, and BDNF indicators between elderly women differing in physical activity (PA) measured by the daily number of steps. METHODS: The PA levels of 62 women aged 72.1 +- 5.4 years were assessed based on their daily number of steps and then were used to allocate the participants to three groups: group I (n = 18; <5,000 steps a day); group II (n = 22; from 5,000 to 9,999 steps a day); and group III (n = 22; >=10,000 steps a day). Blood samples were collected from the participants in early morning hours and subjected to biochemical analysis for prooxidant-antioxidant balance indicators (SOD, CAT, GPx, GR, GSH, UA, MDA and TOS/TOC), bone metabolism indicators (Ca, 25-OH vitamin D, osteocalcin, CTX-I, and PTH), and BDNF levels. RESULTS: The groups were not statistically significantly different in the activity of SOD, CAT, GPx, and GR, but their concentrations of GSH (H = 22.10, p < 0.001) and UA (H = 12.20, p = 0.002) proved to be significantly associated with the groups' daily PA. The between-group differences in the concentrations of MDA and TOS/TOC were not significant, with both these indicators tending to take higher values in group I than in groups II and III. Significant differences between the groups were established for the concentrations of 25-OH vitamin D (H = 24.21, p < 0.001), osteocalcin (H = 7.88, p = 0.019), CTX-I (H = 12.91, p = 0.002), and BDNF (H = 14.47, p = 0.001), but not for Ca and PTH. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly higher concentrations of GSH, slightly lower oxidative stress indicators, significantly higher BDNF levels, and moderately better bone turnover indicators and resorption markers in the group taking more than 5,000 steps a day suggest that this level of PA can promote successful aging. More research is, however, needed to confirm this finding.
