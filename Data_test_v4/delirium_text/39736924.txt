39736924|t|Molecular mechanisms and therapeutic strategies of gut microbiota modulation in Sarcopenia (Review).
39736924|a|Sarcopenia is an age-related disease that is characterized by a decline in muscle mass and function with significant epidemiological and clinical implications. In recent years, gut microbiota has gained attention as an important regulatory factor in human health. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce the definition and epidemiological background of sarcopenia and analyze the potential impact of the gut microbiota on muscle metabolism and growth, including aspects such as gut microbiota metabolites, muscle protein synthesis and energy metabolism. Additionally, this article summarizes the current research progress in gut microbiota interventions for the treatment of sarcopenia, such as probiotics, prebiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation and discusses future research directions and potential therapeutic strategies.
