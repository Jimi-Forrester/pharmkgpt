29410696|a|BACKGROUND: Selenoprotein F (SELENOF, was named as 15-kDa selenoprotein) has been reported to play important roles in oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and carcinogenesis. However, the biological function of SELENOF is still unclear. METHODS: A yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen the interactive protein of SELENOF in a human fetal brain cDNA library. The interaction between SELENOF and interactive protein was validated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and pull-down assays. The production of retinol was detected by high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC). RESULTS: Retinol dehydrogenase 11 (RDH11) was found to interact with SELENOF. RDH11 is an enzyme for the reduction of all-trans-retinaldehyde to all-trans-retinol (vitamin A). The production of retinol was decreased by SELENOF overexpression, resulting in more retinaldehyde. CONCLUSIONS: SELENOF interacts with RDH11 and blocks its enzyme activity to reduce all-trans-retinaldehyde.
