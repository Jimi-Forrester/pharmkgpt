38578958|t|Treatment outcomes amongst older people with HIV infection receiving antiretroviral therapy.
38578958|a|OBJECTIVES: There is conflicting data regarding the response of older people with HIV (PWH) to antiretroviral therapy (ART). The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term immunological and virological responses, changes in regimen, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in older participants (50+ years) compared with younger (18-34 years) and middle-aged (35-49 years) PWH. METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records was conducted on 1622 participants who received ART in Yunnan Province, China, from 2010 to 2019. The study compared CD4+ T-cell counts, CD4+/CD8+ ratio, and relative numbers between different groups using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to identify variables associated with the occurrence of immune reconstitution insufficiency. The rates of immune reconstitution, incidence of ADRs, and rates of treatment change were analyzed using the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Over 95% achieved viral load 200 copies/ml or less, with no age-related difference. However, older participants exhibited significantly lower CD4+ T-cell counts and CD4+/CD8+ recovery post-ART (P < 0.001), with only 32.21% achieving immune reconstitution (compared with young: 52.16%, middle-aged: 39.29%, P < 0.001) at the end of follow-up. Middle-aged and elderly participants changed ART regimens more because of ADRs, especially bone marrow suppression and renal dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Although the virological response was consistent across age groups, older individuals showed poorer immune responses and higher susceptibility to side effects. This underscores the need for tailored interventions and comprehensive management for older patients with HIV.
