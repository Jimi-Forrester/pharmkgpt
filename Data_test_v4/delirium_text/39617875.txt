39617875|a|BACKGROUND: Adults with intellectual disability experience more pain than adults without and, despite a higher number of medications being prescribed, may be less likely to receive medication for pain. We conducted a systematic review of existing literature on medication for pain and painful conditions in adults with intellectual disability to explore if there is any association with polypharmacy, multimorbidity or demographic characteristics. METHODS: This systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines. Medline, Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and Scopus were searched from January 2000 to 21st October 2024. We included original, peer-reviewed observational, qualitative or mixed-method studies published in English with data on medication for pain or painful conditions in adults with intellectual disability. Two independent reviewers performed study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment; disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. Adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Scale or the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme for qualitative studies was used for quality assessment of included studies and findings were reported via narrative synthesis. PROSPERO registration: CRD42023415051. RESULTS: Twenty-seven of 26,170 articles met the eligibility criteria. Adults with intellectual disability were more likely to have simple analgesic medication than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids or adjuvant pain medications than the general population. Psychotropic medications were more commonly prescribed in adults with intellectual disability than medication for pain or painful conditions. Adults with intellectual disability and caregivers reported under-recognition and most likely under-treatment of pain. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with intellectual disability may receive less pharmacological management of pain with analgesics and medication for painful conditions despite the high prevalence of polypharmacy, suggesting pain is under-treated. Better assessment and pharmacological treatment of pain and painful conditions is a key future research priority to address this health inequality and improve quality of life for this vulnerable group of people.
