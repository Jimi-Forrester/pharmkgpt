36555448|t|Redox State of Human Serum Albumin in Multiple Sclerosis: A Pilot Study.
36555448|a|Like in many other pathologies, oxidative stress is involved in the development of neurodegenerative disorders. Human serum albumin (HSA) is the main protein in different body fluids including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). By its redox state in terms of cysteine-34, albumin serves as marker for oxidative burden. We aimed to evaluate the redox state of HSA in patients with multiple sclerosis in serum and CSF in comparison to controls to identify possible correlations with disease activity and severity. Samples were stored at -70  C until analysis by HPLC for the determination of albumin redox state in terms of the fractions of human mercaptalbumin (HMA), human nonmercaptalbumin1 (HNA1), and human nonmercaptalbumin2 (HNA2). Albumin in CSF showed significantly higher fractions of the reduced form HMA and decreased HNA1 and HNA2. There was no difference between albumin redox states in serum of patients and controls. In CSF of patients HNA2 showed a trend to higher fractions compared to controls. Albumin redox state in serum was associated with physical disability in remission while albumin redox state in CSF was related to disease activity. Thus, albumin redox state in serum and CSF of patients in relation to disease condition merits further investigation.
