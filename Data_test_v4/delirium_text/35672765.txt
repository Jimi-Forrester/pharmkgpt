35672765|t|Nanomaterials alleviating redox stress in neurological diseases: mechanisms and applications.
35672765|a|Overproduced reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species (RONS) in the brain are involved in the pathogenesis of several neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, and stroke, as they attack neurons and glial cells, triggering cellular redox stress. Neutralizing RONS, and, thus, alleviating redox stress, can slow down or stop the progression of neurological diseases. Currently, an increasing number of studies are applying nanomaterials (NMs) with anti-redox activity and exploring the potential mechanisms involved in redox stress-related neurological diseases. In this review, we summarize the anti-redox mechanisms of NMs, including mimicking natural oxidoreductase activity and inhibiting RONS generation at the source. In addition, we propose several strategies to enhance the anti-redox ability of NMs and highlight the challenges that need to be resolved in their application. In-depth knowledge of the mechanisms and potential application of NMs in alleviating redox stress will help in the exploration of the therapeutic potential of anti-redox stress NMs in neurological diseases.
