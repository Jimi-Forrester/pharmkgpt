31098343|t|Molecular Characterization of Primary Human Astrocytes Using Digital Gene Expression Analysis.
31098343|a|OBJECTIVE: Astrocyte dysfunctions are related to several central nervous system (CNS) pathologies. Transcriptomic profiling of human mRNAs to investigate astrocyte functions may provide the basic molecular-biological data pertaining to the cellular activities of astrocytes. METHODS: Human Primary astrocytes (HPAs) and human neural stem cell line (HB1.F3) were used for differential digital gene analysis. In this study, a massively parallel sequencing platform, next-generation sequencing (NGS), was used to obtain the digital gene expression (DGE) data from HPAs. A comparative analysis of the DGE from HPA and HB1.F3 cells was performed. Sequencing was performed using NGS platform, and subsequently, bioinformatic analyses were implemented to reveal the identity of the pathways, relatively up- or down-regulated in HPA cells. RESULTS: The top, novel canonical pathways up-regulated in HPA cells than in the HB1.F3 cells were "Cyclins and cell cycle regulation," "Integrin signaling," "Regulation of eIF4 and p70S6K signaling," "Wnt/beta-catenin signaling," "mTOR signaling," "Aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling," "Hippo signaling," "RhoA signaling," "Signaling by Rho family GTPases," and "Glioma signaling" pathways. The down-regulated pathways were "Cell cycle: G1/S checkpoint regulation," "eIF2 signaling," "Cell cycle: G2/M DNA damage checkpoint regulation," "Telomerase signaling," "RhoGDI signaling," "NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response," "ERK/MAPK signaling," "ATM signaling," "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma signaling," "VEGF signaling," and "Role of CHK proteins in cell cycle checkpoint control" pathways. CONCLUSION: This study would be a good reference to understand astrocyte functions at the molecular level, and to develop a diagnostic test, based on the DGE pattern of astrocytes, as a powerful, new clinical tool in many CNS diseases.
