34829980|a|Arginase 2 (ARG2) is a manganese metalloenzyme involved in several tissue specific processes, from physiology to pathophysiology. It is variably expressed in extra-hepatic tissues and is located in the mitochondria. In human pancreatic beta cells, ARG2 is downregulated in type 2 diabetes. The enzyme regulates the synthesis of polyamines, that are involved in pancreas development and regulation of beta cell function. Here, we discuss several features of ARG2 and polyamines, which can be relevant to the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes.
