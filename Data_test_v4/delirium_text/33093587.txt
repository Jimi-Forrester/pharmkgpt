33093587|a|Genetic variations of TREM2 have been implicated as a risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies suggest that the loss of TREM2 function compromises microglial responses to the accumulation of amyloid beta. Previously, we found that exon 3 of TREM2 is an alternative exon whose skipping leads to a reduction in full-length TREM2 protein by inducing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Here, we aimed to identify factors regulating TREM2 splicing. Using a panel of RNA-binding proteins, we found that exon 3 skipping of TREM2 was promoted by two paralogous proteins, CELF1 and CELF2, which were both linked previously with risk loci of AD. Although the overexpression of both CELF1 and CELF2 enhanced exon 3 skipping, only CELF2 reduced the expression of full-length TREM2 protein. Notably, the TREM2 ortholog in the green monkey, but not in the mouse, showed alternative splicing of exon 3 like human TREM2. Similarly, splicing regulation of exon 3 by CELF1/2 was found to be common to humans and monkeys. Using chimeric minigenes of human and mouse TREM2, we mapped a CELF-responsive sequence within intron 3 of human TREM2. Collectively, our results revealed a novel regulatory factor of TREM2 expression and highlighted a species-dependent difference of its regulation.
