22350541|a|The amyloid cascade hypothesis on the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) states that amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation in the brain is a key factor that initiates the neurodegenerative process. Abeta is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavages by BACE1 (the major beta-secretase in the brain) and gamma-secretase. The purpose of this study was to characterize APP metabolism in vivo in AD patients versus cognitively healthy subjects by examining alterations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. We measured BACE1 activity and concentrations of alpha- and beta-cleaved soluble APP (sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta, respectively) and Abeta40 in CSF, biomarkers that all reflect the metabolism of APP, in 75 AD patients and 65 cognitively healthy controls. These analytes were also applied in a multivariate model to determine whether they provided any added diagnostic value to the core CSF AD biomarkers Abeta42, T-tau, and P-tau. We found no significant differences in BACE1 activity or sAPPalpha, sAPPbeta, and Abeta40 concentrations between AD patients and controls. A multivariate model created with all analytes did not improve the separation of AD patients from controls compared with using the core AD biomarkers alone, highlighting the strong diagnostic performance of Abeta42, T-tau, and P-tau for AD. However, AD patients in advanced clinical stage, as determined by low MMSE score (<=20), had lower BACE1 activity and sAPPalpha, sAPPbeta, and Abeta40 concentrations than patients with higher MMSE score, suggesting that these markers may be related to the severity of the disease.
