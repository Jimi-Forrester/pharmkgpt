31025518|t|Costs of postoperative delirium with transcatheter aortic valve replacement: Improved yet still present.
31025518|a|Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is associated with a lower risk of postoperative delirium (PD) than surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients aged >=80, based on billing codes. Postoperative delirium remains a frequent problem after both SAVR and TAVR in clinical series and is costly. Improved pre-procedural prediction of PD risk would improve targeting of clinical care and allow testing of preventative and management strategies.
