38638791|t|Analysis of Vocal Signatures of COVID-19 in Cough Sounds: A Newer Diagnostic Approach Using Artificial Intelligence.
38638791|a|BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) based models are explored increasingly in the medical field. The highly contagious pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affected the world and availability of diagnostic tools high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and/or real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) was very limited, costly and time consuming. Therefore, the use of AI in COVID-19 for diagnosis using cough sounds can be efficacious and cost effective for screening in clinic or hospital and help in early diagnosis and further management of patients. OBJECTIVES: To develop an accurate and fast voice-processing AI software to determine voice-based signatures in discriminating COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cough sounds for screening of COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: A prospective study involving 117 patients was performed based on online and/or offline voice data collection of cough sounds of COVID-19 patients in isolation ward of a tertiary care teaching hospital and non-COVID-19 participants using a smart phone. A website-based AI software was developed to identify the cough sounds as COVID-19 or non-COVID-19. The data were divided into three segments including training set, validation set and test set. A pre-processing algorithm was utilized and combined with Short Time Fourier Transform feature representation and Logistic regression model. A precise software was used to identify vocal signatures and K-fold cross validation was carried out. RESULT: A total of 117 audio recordings of cough sounds were collected through the developed website after inclusion-exclusion criteria out of which 52 have been marked belonging to COVID-19 positive, while 65 were marked as COVID-19 negative/unsure /never had COVID-19, which were assumed to be COVID-19 negative based on RT-PCR test results. The mean and standard error values for the accuracies attained at the end of each experiment in training, validation and testing set were found to be 67.34%+-0.22, 58.57%+-1.11 and 64.60%+-1.79 respectively. The weight values were found to be positive which were contributing towards predicting the samples as COVID-19 positive with large spikes around 7.5 kHz, 7.8 kHz, 8.6 kHz and 11 kHz which can be used for classification. CONCLUSION: The proposed AI based approach can be a helpful screening tool for COVID-19 using vocal sounds of cough. It can help the health system by reducing the cost burden and improving overall diagnosis and management of the disease.
