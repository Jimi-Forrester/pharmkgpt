33198435|a|OBJECTIVE: Cognition of peritoneal dialysis patients is influenced by various factors including dialysis adequacy such as fractional urea clearance (Kt/V) and relative overhydration (RelOH). This study aimed to discover the potential contribution of dialysis adequacy to cognitive function in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. METHODS: Fifty-nine patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis were recruited. Demographic information, comorbidities, and clinical lab findings were retrospectively collected, and dialysis adequacy was determined by the Kt/V and RelOH calculation. Cognition and depression were measured with Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Wechsler memory scale (spatial span), Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and Beck's depression inventory. Partial correlation test was used to explore the correlation of dialysis adequacy with cognitive function. RESULTS: RelOH showed significant correlation with some of the Wisconsin Card Sorting test results. The categories achieved showed negative correlation (r=-0.32, p=0.02) and trials to complete first category showed positive correlation (r=0.31, p=0.02) with RelOH. Other tasks showed no significant correlation with RelOH. Kt/V. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that peritoneal dialysis adequacy, measured by RelOH, seems to be significantly correlated with the occurrence of cognitive impairment. The outcome suggests that RelOH may have the potential to clarify the role of cognitive impairment in peritoneal dialysis patients.
