38108325|t|Integrated approach to reducing polypharmacy in older people: exploring the role of oxidative stress and antioxidant potential therapy.
38108325|a|Increased life expectancy, attributed to improved access to healthcare and drug development, has led to an increase in multimorbidity, a key contributor to polypharmacy. Polypharmacy is characterised by its association with a variety of adverse events in the older persons. The mechanisms involved in the development of age-related chronic diseases are largely unknown; however, altered redox homeostasis due to ageing is one of the main theories. In this context, the present review explores the development and interaction between different age-related diseases, mainly linked by oxidative stress. In addition, drug interactions in the treatment of various diseases are described, emphasising that the holistic management of older people and their pathologies should prevail over the individual treatment of each condition.
