39172165|a|PURPOSE: For nearly half of patients who undergo Endovascular Thrombectomy following ischemic stroke, successful recanalisation does not guarantee a good outcome. Understanding the underlying tissue changes in the infarct tissue with the help of biomarkers specific to ischemic stroke could offer valuable insights for better treatment and patient management decisions. Using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) MRI to measure cerebral iron concentration, this study aims to track the progression of iron within the infarct lesion after successful reperfusion. METHODS: In a prospective study of 87 ischemic stroke patients, successfully reperfused patients underwent MRI scans at 24-to-72 h and 3 months after reperfusion. QSM maps were generated from gradient-echo MRI images. QSM values, measured in parts per billion (ppb), were extracted from ROIs defining the infarct and mirror homolog in the contralateral hemisphere and were compared cross-sectionally and longitudinally. RESULTS: QSM values in the infarct ROIs matched those of the contralateral ROIs at 24-to-72 h, expressed as median (interquartile range) ppb [0.71(-7.67-10.09) vs. 2.20(-10.50-14.05) ppb, p = 0.55], but were higher at 3 months [10.68(-2.30-21.10) vs. -1.27(-12.98-9.82) ppb, p < 0.001]. The infarct QSM values at 3 months were significantly higher than those at 24-to-72 h [10.41(-2.50-18.27) ppb vs. 1.68(-10.36-12.25) ppb, p < 0.001]. Infarct QSM at 24-to-72 h and patient outcome measured at three months did not demonstrate a significant association. CONCLUSION: Following successful endovascular reperfusion, iron concentration in infarct tissue, as measured by QSM increases over time compared to that in healthy tissue. However, its significance warrants further investigation.
