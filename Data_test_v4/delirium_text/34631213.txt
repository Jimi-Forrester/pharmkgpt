34631213|t|cGAS- Stimulator of Interferon Genes Signaling in Central Nervous System Disorders.
34631213|a|Cytosolic nucleic acid sensors contribute to the initiation of innate immune responses by playing a critical role in the detection of pathogens and endogenous nucleic acids. The cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and its downstream effector, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), mediate innate immune signaling by promoting the release of type I interferons (IFNs) and other inflammatory cytokines. These biomolecules are suggested to play critical roles in host defense, senescence, and tumor immunity. Recent studies have demonstrated that cGAS-STING signaling is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of central nervous system (CNS) diseases which are underscored by neuroinflammatory-driven disease progression. Understanding and regulating the interactions between cGAS-STING signaling and the nervous system may thus provide an effective approach to prevent or delay late-onset CNS disorders. Here, we present a review of recent advances in the literature on cGAS-STING signaling and provide a comprehensive overview of the modulatory patterns of the cGAS-STING pathway in CNS disorders.
