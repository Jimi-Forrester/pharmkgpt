38911254|a|Mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species production at a moderate physiological level plays a fundamental role in the anti-aging signaling, due to their action as redox-active sensors for the maintenance of optimal mitochondrial balance between intracellular energy status and hormetic nutrients. Iron regulatory protein dysregulation, systematically increased iron levels, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the consequent oxidative stress are recognized to underlie the pathogenesis of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Central to their pathogenesis, Nrf2 signaling dysfunction occurs with disruption of metabolic homeostasis. We highlight the potential therapeutic importance of nutritional polyphenols as substantive regulators of the Nrf2 pathway. Here, we discuss the common mechanisms targeting the Nrf2/vitagene pathway, as novel therapeutic strategies to minimize consequences of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, generally associated to cognitive dysfunction, and demonstrate its key neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammatory properties, summarizing pharmacotherapeutic aspects relevant to brain pathophysiology.
