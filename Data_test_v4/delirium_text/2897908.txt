2897908|a|In conclusion, at present, no consistent endocrine abnormalities can be detected in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease. However, assessment of neuroendocrine function might help identify subpopulations of patients with particular neurotransmission abnormalities who are likely to benefit from a specific pharmacologic strategy. For example, patients in whom cholinomimetic drugs produce the greatest elevation in plasma cortisol concentration appear to derive the most symptomatic benefit from these drugs.
