36293806|t|A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Different Training Modalities on the Inflammatory Response in Adolescents with Obesity.
36293806|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different training modalities on improving the inflammatory response in adolescents with obesity. For the study methodology, the databases such as China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, Pubmed, Web of Science, and EBSCO were selected for searching. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB) tool, and statistical analysis was performed by applying RevMan 5.4.1 analysis software. A total of 14 studies with 682 subjects were included. The results of this meta-analysis showed that aerobic training (AT) and aerobic plus resistance training (AT + RT) reduced the levels of IL-6 and CRP in adolescents with obesity. Among them, AT + RT was more effective than other training modalities in reducing IL-6 and CRP in adolescents with obesity. Different training modalities have no effect on the TNF-alpha level in adolescents with obesity. However, regarding the increase in IL-6, CRP, and TNF-alpha in adolescents with obesity, resistance training (RT) did not lead to significant differences. In conclusion, long-term regular AT, AT + RT, and HIIT are all helpful in improving the inflammatory state of adolescents with obesity, with AT + RT being the best training modality to combat inflammation in adolescents with obesity.
