38037913|t|Insights Into the Role of Copper in Neurodegenerative Diseases and the Therapeutic Potential of Natural Compounds.
38037913|a|Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a collection of neurological disorders originating from the progressive degeneration of neurons, resulting in the dysfunction of neurons. Unfortunately, effective therapeutic interventions for these diseases are presently lacking. Copper (Cu), a crucial trace element within the human body, assumes a pivotal role in various biological metabolic processes, including energy metabolism, antioxidant defense, and neurotransmission. These processes are vital for the sustenance, growth, and development of organisms. Mounting evidence suggests that disrupted copper homeostasis contributes to numerous age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Wilson's disease (WD), Menkes disease (MD), prion diseases, and multiple sclerosis (MS). This comprehensive review investigates the connection between the imbalance of copper homeostasis and neurodegenerative diseases, summarizing pertinent drugs and therapies that ameliorate neuropathological changes, motor deficits, and cognitive impairments in these conditions through the modulation of copper metabolism. These interventions include Metal-Protein Attenuating Compounds (MPACs), copper chelators, copper supplements, and zinc salts. Moreover, this review highlights the potential of active compounds derived from natural plant medicines to enhance neurodegenerative disease outcomes by regulating copper homeostasis. Among these compounds, polyphenols are particularly abundant. Consequently, this review holds significant implications for the future development of innovative drugs targeting the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
