20860760|t|The heme oxygenase system and oral diseases.
20860760|a|Oral Diseases (2011) 17, 252-257 Heme oxygenase (HO) system catabolizes heme into three products: carbon monoxide (CO), biliverdin/bilirubin and free iron, which consists of three forms identified to date: the oxidative stress-inducible protein HO-1 and the constitutive isozymes HO-2 and HO-3. HO has been involved in many physiological and pathophysiological processes, ranging from Alzheimer's disease to cancer. The interest in HO system by scientists and clinicians involved with the oral and maxillofacial region is fairly recent, and few papers currently cited on HO relate to diseases in this anatomical area. This review will focus on the current understanding of the physiological significance of HO-1 induction and its possible roles in the oral diseases studied to date. The implications for possible therapeutic manipulation of HO are also discussed.
