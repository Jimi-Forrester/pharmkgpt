11940407|t|Adaptation and standardization of the geriatric evaluation of relative's rating instrument (GERRI) for Spain.
11940407|a|BACKGROUND: The Geriatric Evaluation of Relative's Rating Instrument (GERRI) is a scale that evaluates the frequencies of alterations in behavior and functional capacity over a two-week period prior to exploration. The scale depends on the observations done by a relative o first caregiver of the studied subject. AIM: To adapt and standardize the GERRI for the use in the Spanish population as a part of a general project to standardized cognitive and functional tests. METHOD: The scale was administered to 444 subjects: 249 controls, 85 mild memory-cognitive disorders without dementia subjects (DWD) and 110 patients with Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD). An across-sectional statistical study was conducted in our samples stratified by age, gender and education. We evaluated the reliability of repeatability of the test, the internal reliability and the age, sex and education effects on the score of the different subscales. We also took into account the diagnostical validity in the Alzheimer disease and finally we correlated this test results with Mini mental test. RESULTS: The demographic variables age and schooling were found to affect the GERRI subscales differently. Gender did not reach significance. Internal consistency for the GERRI-Social, -Mood and -Cognitive were 0.8620, 0.7647 and 0.9259, respectively. CONCLUSION: The Spanish version of the GERRI may be applied to Spanish clinical series because of its reliable internal consistency and reproducibility.
