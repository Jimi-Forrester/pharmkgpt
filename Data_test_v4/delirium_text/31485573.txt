31485573|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine if a hospital-wide symptom-based alcohol withdrawal protocol may result in significant clinical improvements to patient outcomes, safety, and hospital efficiency. METHODS: Retrospective/prospective cohort study between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016 (pre-protocol), and between March 1, 2017 and August 7, July 2017 (post-protocol). Pre-protocol patients were identified retrospectively using International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision codes (F10.1, F10.2, and Z71.4). Post-protocol patients were identified by the use of a unique alcohol withdrawal order set in their electronic medical record. The primary endpoint was average length of stay. Secondary outcomes included death, escalation of care as defined as requiring intensive care unit (ICU) consultation or the rapid response team, average ICU length of stay, respiratory failure, average benzodiazepine usage, and incidence of seizures. RESULTS: The study included 276 patients in the pre-protocol group and 145 patients in the post-protocol group. There was a significant reduction found in the primary endpoint of average length of stay (7.15 +- 6.5 days vs 5.7 +- 5.6 days; P=.02). There was a significant reduction in the average benzodiazepine use, use of adjunctive medications, need for ICU consultation or rapid response team, respiratory failure, average ICU length of stay, use of neurologic imaging, and the need for lumbar puncture. CONCLUSION: Implementation of a Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, Revised-based alcohol withdrawal protocol may significantly improve quality of care, patient safety, and treatment effectiveness in a large, mixed medical/surgical, urban community-based academic medical center.
