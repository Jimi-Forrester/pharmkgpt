35684108|a|Circadian rhythm disruption is detrimental and results in adverse health consequences. We used a multi-omics profiling approach to investigate the effects of Cyclocarya paliurus flavonoid (CPF)-enriched diets on gut microbiota, metabolites, and hypothalamus clock genes in mice with induced circadian rhythm disruption. It was observed that CPF supplementation altered the specific composition and function of gut microbiota and metabolites induced by circadian rhythm disruption. Analysis showed that the abundance of Akkermansia increased, while the abundance of Clostridiales and Ruminiclostridium displayed a significant downward trend after the CPF intervention. Correlation analysis also revealed that these gut microbes had certain correlations with the metabolites, suggesting that CPFs help the intestinal microbiota to repair the intestinal environment and modulate the release of some beneficial metabolites. Notably, single-cell RNA-seq revealed that CPF supplementation significantly regulated the expression of genes associated with circadian rhythm, myelination, and neurodegenerative diseases. Altogether, these findings highlight that CPFs may represent a promising dietary therapeutic strategy for treating circadian rhythm disruption.
