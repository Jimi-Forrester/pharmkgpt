30147734|t|Electroacupuncture for Postoperative Urinary Retention: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
30147734|a|BACKGROUND: This systematic review aimed at summarizing and evaluating the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which used electroacupuncture (EA) to treat postoperative urinary retention (PUR). METHODS: We searched thirteen databases electronically through April 2018 without language restrictions. We included RCTs of women with PUR; other types of urinary retention or not-RCTs were excluded. Two independent reviewers extracted studies' characteristics, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. Data were pooled and expressed as standard mean difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes and odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous outcomes, with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: We found very low to moderate level of evidence that effects of less than or equal to a week were statistically significant: therapeutic effect improved (OR=4.21; 95%CI [3.04, 5.83]; P<0.00001), residual urine volume decreased (SMD=-13.24; 95%CI [-15.70, -10.78]; P<0.00001), bladder capacity increased (SMD=0.56; 95%CI [0.30, 0.83]; P<0.0001), and urinary flow rate improved (SMD=0.91; 95%CI [0.64, 1.18]; P<0.00001). Effect over a week was statistically significant as well. Therapeutic effect improved (OR=8.29; 95%CI [2.91, 24.25]; P<0.0001), residual urine volume decreased (SMD=-1.78; 95%CI [-2.66, -0.89]; P<0.0001), bladder capacity (SMD=0.92; 95%CI [0.61, 1.23]; P<0.00001) and urinary flow rate (SMD=1.69; 95%CI [0.59, 2.79]; P=0.003) increased, and first urination after surgery was earlier (SMD=-0.92; 95%CI [-1.37, -0.46]; P<0.0001), compared with physical exercise, medication, or no treatment. CONCLUSION: The efficacy and safety of EA on key outcomes in women with PUR are statistically significant, but the level of most evidence was very low or low. More large-scale, long-term RCTs with rigorous methodological quality are needed.
