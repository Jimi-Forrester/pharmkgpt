14589626|t|Episodic memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease: a behaviorally anchored scale.
14589626|a|This research represents an investigation into a behaviorally anchored scale for assessment of episodic memory. The Episodic Memory Scale (EMS) was theoretically derived and developed for use in a professional office environment. Performances of patients diagnosed with dementia of the Alzheimer's Type (N = 17) were significantly worse (p <.002) on the EMS than a comparison group (N = 17) of patients with cognitive dysfunction not associated with Alzheimer's disease. The EMS was positively and significantly correlated with other measures of episodic memory and less so with a measure of semantic memory. The extent to which episodic and semantic memory deficits relate to caregiver functional assessment ratings was explored. Findings are discussed with respect to ecological validity of the EMS and implications for reality monitoring ability. Utility of measuring episodic memory processes for purposes of neuropsychological assessment and caregiver decision-making are also discussed.
