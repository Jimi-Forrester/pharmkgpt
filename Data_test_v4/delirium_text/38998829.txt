38998829|t|Diagnostic Accuracy of the Recognizing Acute Delirium as Part of Your Routine (RADAR) Scale for Delirium Assessment in Hospitalized Older Adults: A Cross-Sectional Study.
38998829|a|Delirium is highly prevalent among hospitalized older adults and is associated with unfavorable outcomes. However, delirium often remains undiagnosed in the hospital context. Having a valid, simple, and fast screening tool could help in limiting the additional workload for healthcare professionals, without leaving delirium undetected. The aim of this study was to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the Recognizing Acute Delirium As part of your Routine (RADAR) scale in an Italian hospital. An observational cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 150 patients aged >=70 years were enrolled. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) criterion-defined delirium as the gold standard were plotted to evaluate the performance of the RADAR scale. The cut-off suggested by previous research was used to estimate the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the RADAR scale. The involved patients were mostly females (60%; n = 90), with a median age of 84 years (I-III quartiles: 80-88). According to the CAM and the RADAR scale, 37 (25%) and 58 (39%) patients were classified as experiencing delirium, respectively. The area under the ROC curve of the RADAR scale was 0.916. Furthermore, the RADAR scale showed robust sensitivity (95%), specificity (80%), and positive (60%) and negative predictive values (98%). The RADAR scale is thus suggested to be a valid tool for screening assessment of delirium in hospitalized older adults.
