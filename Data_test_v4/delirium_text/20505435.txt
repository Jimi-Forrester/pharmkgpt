20505435|a|Nonlinear analyses have shown that Alzheimer disease (AD) patients' brain activity is characterized by a reduced complexity and connectivity. The aim of this study is to define complexity patterns of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. Whole-head magnetoencephalography recordings were obtained from 18 diagnosed AD patients, 18 MCI patients, and 18 healthy controls during resting conditions. Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) values were calculated. MCI patients exhibited intermediary LZC scores between AD patients and controls. A combination of age and posterior LZC scores allowed ADs-MCIs discrimination with 94.4% sensitivity and specificity, whereas no LZC score allowed MCIs---controls discrimination. AD patients and controls showed a parallel tendency to diminished LZC scores as a function of age, but MCI patients did not exhibit such "normal" tendency. Accordingly, anterior LZC scores allowed MCIs-controls discrimination for subjects below 75 years. MCIs exhibited a qualitatively distinct relationship between aging and complexity reduction, with scores higher than controls in older individuals. This fact might be considered a new example of compensatory mechanism in MCI before fully established dementia.
