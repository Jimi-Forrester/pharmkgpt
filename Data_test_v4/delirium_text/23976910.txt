23976910|a|BACKGROUND: Alcohol withdrawal is a relatively common problem among chronic alcohol users, and its severity will determine the setting in which it will be more appropriate to take care of the patients. Those with mild symptoms will be managed in an outpatient setting, as opposed to those with advanced moderate or severe symptoms who will require inpatient management. Among those patients who will require hospitalization, some of them will do well in a regular floor, but some of them will have to be managed in an intensive care unit. We tried to determine whether some variables could be predictive of an increased risk of being managed in an intensive care unit as opposed to being managed in a regular medical floor. METHODS: A retrospective non-randomized review trial design was implemented and a total of 110 medical charts of patients admitted to our institution with severe alcohol withdrawal during the calendar year of 2009 were reviewed. Different demographic and clinical parameters were analyzed, and their significance established in regard to the clinical settings (ICU vs. medical floor) in which the patients were managed. RESULTS: The patients managed in the ICU were found to be younger than their counterparts who were managed in the medical floor, and they were more likely to be white and unemployed. On the other hand, being diabetic, using over-the-counter drugs or prescribed medications appeared to be protective factors, resulting in management of alcohol withdrawal on the medical floors. CONCLUSION: A likely explanation to our findings could be that patients exhibiting better health protective behaviors have a better chance to stay away from the ICU. However no tools could be developed to stratify the patients' risks and more behavioral and observational cohort studies will be needed for that purpose.
