24765077|t|Mechanisms of CaMKII Activation in the Heart.
24765077|a|Calcium/calmodulin (Ca(2+)/CaM) dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has emerged as a key nodal protein in the regulation of cardiac physiology and pathology. Due to the particularly elegant relationship between the structure and function of the kinase, CaMKII is able to translate a diverse set of signaling events into downstream physiological effects. While CaMKII is typically autoinhibited at basal conditions, prolonged rapid Ca(2+) cycling can activate the kinase and allow post-translational modifications that depend critically on the biochemical environment of the heart. These modifications result in sustained, autonomous CaMKII activation and have been associated with pathological cardiac signaling. Indeed, improved understanding of CaMKII activation mechanisms could potentially lead to new clinical therapies for the treatment or prevention of cardiovascular disease. Here we review the known mechanisms of CaMKII activation and discuss some of the pathological signaling pathways in which they play a role.
