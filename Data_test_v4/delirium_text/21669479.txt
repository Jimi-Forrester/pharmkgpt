21669479|a|The synthesis, biological evaluation and molecular modeling of new multipotent inhibitors of type I and type II, able to simultaneously inhibit monoamine oxidases (MAO) as well as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), is described. Compounds of type I were prepared by sequential reaction of 2,6-dichloro-4-phenylpyridine-3,5-dicarbonitrile (14) [or 2,6-dichloropyridine-3,5-dicarbonitrile (15)] with prop-2-yn-1-amine (or N-methylprop-2-yn-1-amine) and 2-(1-benzyl-piperidin-4-yl)alkylamines 22-25. Compounds of type II were prepared by Friedlander type reaction of 6-amino-5-formyl-2-(methyl(prop-2-yn-1-yl)amino)nicotinonitriles 32 and 33 with 4-(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)butan-2-one (31). The biological evaluation of molecules 1-11 showed that most of these compounds are potent, in the nanomolar range, and selective AChEI, with moderate and equipotent selectivity for MAO-A and MAO-B inhibition. Kinetic studies of compound 8 proved that this is a EeAChE mixed type inhibitor (IC(50) = 16 +- 2; Ki = 12 +- 3 nM). Molecular modeling investigation on compound 8 confirmed its dual AChE inhibitory profile, binding simultaneously at the catalytic active site (CAS) and at the peripheric anionic site (PAS). In overall, compound 11, as a potent and selective dual AChEI, showing a moderate and selective MAO-A inhibitory profile, can be considered as an attractive multipotent drug for further development on two key pharmacological targets playing key roles in the therapy of Alzheimer's disease.
