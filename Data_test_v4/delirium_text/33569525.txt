33569525|t|COVID-19 related thrombi in ascending and descending thoracic aorta with peripheral embolization: a case report.
33569525|a|BACKGROUND: COVID-19 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infected patients have increased risk for thrombotic events, which initially may have been under recognized. The existence of cardiovascular emboli can be directly life threatening when obstructing the blood flow to vital organs such as the brain or other parts of the body. The exact mechanism for this hypercoagulable state in COVID-19 patients yet remains to be elucidated. CASE SUMMARY: A 72-year-old man critically ill with COVID-19 was diagnosed with a free-floating and mural thrombus in the thoracic aorta. Subsequent distal embolization to the limbs led to ischaemia and necrosis of the right foot. Treatment with heparin and anticoagulants reduced thrombus load in the ascending and thoracic aorta. DISCUSSION: One-third of COVID-19 patients show major thrombotic events, mostly pulmonary emboli. The endothelial expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptors makes it feasible that in patients with viraemia direct viral-toxicity to the endothelium of also the large arteries results in local thrombus formation. Up to date, prophylactic anticoagulants are recommended in all patients that are hospitalized with COVID-19 infections to prevent venous and arterial thrombotic complications.
