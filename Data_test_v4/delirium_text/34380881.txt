34380881|t|The role of miRNA in retinal ganglion cell health and disease.
34380881|a|miRNA are short non-coding RNA responsible for the knockdown of proteins through their targeting and silencing of complimentary mRNA sequences. The miRNA landscape of a cell thus affects the levels of its proteins and has significant consequences to its health. Deviations in this miRNA landscape have been implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases and have also garnered interest as targets for treatment. Retinal ganglion cells are the sole projection neuron of the retina with their axons making up the optic nerve. They are a focus of study not only for their importance in vision and the myriad of blinding diseases characterized by their dysfunction and loss, but also as a model of other central nervous system diseases such as spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury. This review summarizes current knowledge on the role of miRNA in retinal ganglion cell function, highlighting how perturbations can result in disease, and how modulating their abundance may provide a novel avenue of therapeutic research.
