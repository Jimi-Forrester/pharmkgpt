37630709|a|Limitations in daily living have not yet been described adequately for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this study, we investigated first, time spent on protective activities (social, mental, and physical) and second, limitations in practical skills of daily living, both for people with MCI. We used baseline data from 270 individuals who participated in the randomized controlled trial BrainFit-Nutrition. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to identify people with MCI. Participants were asked how much time they spent engaged in social, mental, and physical activities each week. Furthermore, the Bayer-ADL scale was used to quantify deficits in activities of daily living (ADLs). Regarding protection, the number of hours spent engaged in the three activity areas was significantly correlated with the cognitive performance in people with MCI. Social activities were positively associated with current cognitive performance. Concerning the limitations in practical skills of daily living, older and more cognitively impaired individuals were affected. Memory and orientation appear to be among the first practical skills of daily living that become impaired in people with MCI. Treatment recommendations for people with MCI include an increase in social, mental, and physical activities as well as the promotion of a healthy lifestyle.
