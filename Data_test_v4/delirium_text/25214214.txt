25214214|a|Rosmarinic acid (RA), an ester of caffeic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl lactic acid, is widely distributed in the plant kingdom. Interest in it is growing due to its promising biological activities, including cognitive-enhancing effects and slowing the development of Alzheimer's disease, cancer chemoprotection or anti-inflammatory activity, among others. In order to meet the increasing demand for this compound, several biotechnological approaches to its production based on plant cell and hairy root cultures have been developed. Empirical strategies are currently being combined with metabolic engineering tools to increase RA production in plant cell platforms in a more rational way. Discussed here are the latest advances in the field, together with recent trends in plant biotechnology, such as the application of single use technology and the use of biosensors in downstream processes.
