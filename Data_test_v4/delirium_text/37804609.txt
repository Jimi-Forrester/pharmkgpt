37804609|a|Both the APOE epsilon4 and TOMM40 rs10524523 ("523") genes have been associated with risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neuroimaging biomarkers of AD. No studies have investigated the relationship of TOMM40'523-APOE epsilon4 on the structural complexity of the brain in AD individuals. We quantified brain morphology and multiple cortical attributes in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, then tested whether APOE epsilon4 or TOMM40 poly-T genotypes were related to AD morphological biomarkers in cognitively unimpaired (CU) and MCI/AD individuals. We identified several AD-specific phenotypes in brain morphology and found that TOMM40 poly-T short alleles are associated with early, AD-specific brain morphological differences in healthy aging. We observed decreased cortical thickness, sulcal depth, and fractal dimension in CU individuals with the poly-T short alleles. Moreover, in MCI/AD participants, the APOE epsilon4 (TOMM40 L) individuals had a higher rate of gene-related morphological markers indicative of AD. Our data suggest that TOMM40'523 is associated with early brain structure variations in the precuneus, temporal, and limbic cortices.
