29537728|t|Chelating Rotaxane Ligands as Fluorescent Sensors for Metal Ions.
29537728|a|Although metal-ion-binding interlocked molecules have been under intense investigation for over three decades, their application as scaffolds for the development of sensors for metal ions remains underexplored. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of simple rotaxanes as metal-ion-responsive ligand scaffolds through the development of a proof-of-concept selective sensor for Zn2+ .
