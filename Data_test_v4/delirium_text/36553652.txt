36553652|t|Integrative Meta-Analysis of Huntington's Disease Transcriptome Landscape.
36553652|a|Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance caused by glutamine expansion in the Huntingtin gene (HTT). Striatal projection neurons (SPNs) in HD are more vulnerable to cell death. The executive striatal population is directly connected with the Brodmann Area (BA9), which is mainly involved in motor functions. Analyzing the disease samples from BA9 from the SRA database provides insights related to neuron degeneration, which helps to identify a promising therapeutic strategy. Most gene expression studies examine the changes in expression and associated biological functions. In this study, we elucidate the relationship between variants and their effect on gene/downstream transcript expression. We computed gene and transcript abundance and identified variants from RNA-seq data using various pipelines. We predicted the effect of genome-wide association studies (GWAS)/novel variants on regulatory functions. We found that many variants affect the histone acetylation pattern in HD, thereby perturbing the transcription factor networks. Interestingly, some variants affect miRNA binding as well as their downstream gene expression. Tissue-specific network analysis showed that mitochondrial, neuroinflammation, vasculature, and angiogenesis-related genes are disrupted in HD. From this integrative omics analysis, we propose that abnormal neuroinflammation acts as a two-edged sword that indirectly affects the vasculature and associated energy metabolism. Rehabilitation of blood-brain barrier functionality and energy metabolism may secure the neuron from cell death.
