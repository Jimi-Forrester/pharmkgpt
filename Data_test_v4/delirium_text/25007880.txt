25007880|a|The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is a ligand-activated transcriptional factor that belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. PPARgamma was initially identified through its role in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism and cell differentiation. It also influences the expression or activity of a number of genes in a variety of signalling networks. These include regulation of redox balance, fatty acid oxidation, immune responses and mitochondrial function. Recent studies suggest that the PPARgamma agonists may serve as good candidates for the treatment of several neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, even though multiple etiological factors contribute to the development of these disorders. Recent reports have also signposted a role for PPARgamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. In this review, we explore the current knowledge of mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of PPARgamma agonists and PGC-1alpha in models of PD.
