38696152|a|The most common cause of severe cognitive impairment in adults is Alzheimer's disease (AD). Depending on the age of onset, AD is divided into early (<65 years) and late (>=65 years) forms. Early-onset AD (EOAD) is significantly less common than later-onset AD (LOAD) and accounts for only about 5-10% of cases. However, its medical and social significance, as a disease leading to loss of ability to work and legal capacity, as well as premature death in patients aged 40-64 years, is extremely high. Patients with EOAD compared with LOAD have a greater number of atypical clinical variants - 25% and 6-12.5%, respectively, which complicates the differential diagnosis of EOAD with other neurodegenerative diseases. However, the typical classical amnestic variant predominates in both EOAD and LOAD. Also, patients with EOAD have peculiarities according to neuroimaging data: when performing MRI of the brain, patients with EOAD often have more pronounced parietal atrophy and less pronounced hippocampal atrophy compared to patients with LOAD. The article pays attention to the features of the clinical and neuroimaging data in patients with EOAD; a case of a patient with EOAD is presented.
