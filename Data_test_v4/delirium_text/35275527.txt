35275527|t|Potential Mechanisms Underlying Resistance to Dementia in Non-Demented Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease Neuropathology.
35275527|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and typically characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles. Intriguingly, there also exists a group of elderly which do not develop dementia during their life, despite the AD neuropathology, the so-called non-demented individuals with AD neuropathology (NDAN). In this review, we provide extensive background on AD pathology and normal aging and discuss potential mechanisms that enable these NDAN individuals to remain cognitively intact. Studies presented in this review show that NDAN subjects are generally higher educated and have a larger cognitive reserve. Furthermore, enhanced neural hypertrophy could compensate for hippocampal and cingulate neural atrophy in NDAN individuals. On a cellular level, these individuals show increased levels of neural stem cells and 'von Economo neurons'. Furthermore, in NDAN brains, binding of Abeta oligomers to synapses is prevented, resulting in decreased glial activation and reduced neuroinflammation. Overall, the evidence stated here strengthens the idea that some individuals are more resistant to AD pathology, or at least show an elongation of the asymptomatic state of the disease compared to others. Insights into the mechanisms underlying this resistance could provide new insight in understanding normal aging and AD itself. Further research should focus on factors and mechanisms that govern the NDAN cognitive resilience in order to find clues on novel biomarkers, targets, and better treatments of AD.
