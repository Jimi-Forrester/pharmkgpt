36537174|t|Potential Imaging Biomarkers of Cognitive Frailty.
36537174|a|Cognitive frailty (CF) is a state of impairment in both cognitive and motor functions. The concept of CF has been developed in several ways. However, it is difficult to identify consistent neuroimaging findings according to the application of the operational definition of different frailty models within the same concept, as well as the diversity of the concept itself of CF. This study aimed to review neuroimaging studies of CF and to determine suitable imaging biomarkers of CF. White matter abnormalities (e.g., white matter hyperintensity and microbleeds) seem likely to be considered imaging biomarkers of CF. The volume of the cerebral/cerebellar cortex and that of the subcortical nuclei are also candidates of imaging biomarkers of CF. These imaging biomarkers are expected to be more useful in discriminating the need for screening CF in visitors of clinics or health examination centers than in detecting the presence of CF in community-dwelling older adults.
