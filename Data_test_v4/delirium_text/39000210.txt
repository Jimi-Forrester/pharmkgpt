39000210|a|Neurodegeneration diseases (NDs) are a group of complex diseases primarily characterized by progressive loss of neurons affecting mental function and movement. Oxidative stress is one of the factors contributing to the pathogenesis of NDs, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). These reactive species disturb mitochondrial function and accelerate other undesirable conditions including tau phosphorylation, inflammation, and cell death. Therefore, preventing oxidative stress is one of the imperative methods in the treatment of NDs. To accomplish this, we prepared hexane and ethyl acetate extracts of Anethum graveolens (dill) and identified the major phyto-components (apiol, carvone, and dihydrocarvone) by GC-MS. The extracts and major bioactives were assessed for neuroprotective potential and mechanism in hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell model and other biochemical assays. The dill (extracts and bioactives) provided statistically significant neuroprotection from 0.1 to 30 microg/mL by mitigating ROS levels, restoring mitochondrial membrane potential, reducing lipid peroxidation, and reviving the glutathione ratio. They moderately inhibited acetylcholine esterase (IC50 dill extracts 400-500 microg/mL; carvone 275.7 microg/mL; apiole 388.3 microg/mL), displayed mild anti-Abeta1-42 fibrilization (DHC 26.6%) and good anti-oligomerization activity (>40% by dill-EA, carvone, and apiole). Such multifactorial neuroprotective displayed by dill and bioactives would help develop a safe, low-cost, and small-molecule drug for NDs.
