38074413|t|Anti-tau intrabodies: From anti-tau immunoglobulins to the development of functional scFv intrabodies.
38074413|a|Over the last decade, there has been a growing interest in intrabodies and their therapeutic potential. Intrabodies are antibody fragments that are expressed inside a cell to target intracellular antigens. In the context of intracellular protein misfolding and aggregation, such as tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease, intrabodies have become an interesting approach as there is the possibility to target early stages of aggregation. As such, we engineered three anti-tau monoclonal antibodies into single-chain variable fragments for cytoplasmic expression and activity: PT51, PT77, and hTau21. Due to the reducing environment of the cytoplasm, single-chain variable fragment (scFv) aggregation is commonly observed. Therefore, we also performed complementarity-determining region (CDR) grafting into three different stable frameworks to rescue solubility and intracellular binding. All three scFvs retained binding to tau after cytoplasmic expression in HEK293 cells, in at least one of the frameworks. Subsequently, we show their capacity to interfere with either mouse or mutant human tau aggregation in two different primary mouse neuron models and organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Collectively, our work extends the current knowledge on intracellular tau targeting with intrabodies, providing three scFv intrabodies that can be used as immunological tools to target tau inside cells.
