38937751|t|Delayed hemothorax following blunt thoracic trauma: a case report.
38937751|a|BACKGROUND: Late hemothorax is a rare complication of blunt chest trauma. The longest reported time interval between the traumatic event and the development of hemothorax is 44 days. CASE PRESENTATION: An elderly patient with right-sided rib fractures from chest trauma, managed initially with closed thoracostomy, presented with a delayed hemothorax that occurred 60 days after initial management, necessitating conservative and then surgical intervention due to the patient's frail condition and associated complications. CONCLUSIONS: This case emphasizes the clinical challenge and significance of delayed hemothorax in chest trauma, highlighting the need for vigilance and potential surgical correction in complex presentations, especially in the elderly.
