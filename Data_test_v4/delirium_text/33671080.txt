33671080|t|Discovery and Optimization of Selective Inhibitors of Meprin alpha (Part I).
33671080|a|Meprin alpha and beta are zinc-dependent proteinases implicated in multiple diseases including cancers, fibrosis, and Alzheimer's. However, until recently, only a few inhibitors of either meprin were reported and no inhibitors are in preclinical development. Moreover, inhibitors of other metzincins developed in previous years are not effective in inhibiting meprins suggesting the need for de novo discovery effort. To address the paucity of tractable meprin inhibitors we developed ultrahigh-throughput assays and conducted parallel screening of >650,000 compounds against each meprin. As a result of this effort, we identified five selective meprin alpha hits belonging to three different chemotypes (triazole-hydroxyacetamides, sulfonamide-hydroxypropanamides, and phenoxy-hydroxyacetamides). These hits demonstrated a nanomolar to micromolar inhibitory activity against meprin alpha with low cytotoxicity and >30-fold selectivity against meprin beta and other related metzincincs. These selective inhibitors of meprin alpha provide a good starting point for further optimization.
