35629249|t|Altered TIMP-3 Levels in the Cerebrospinal Fluid and Plasma of Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.
35629249|a|Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3) is a component of the extracellular environment and is suggested to play an indirect role in regulating Abeta production and the pathophysiology of Abeta deposition in brains. However, studies on the amount of TIMP-3 in bodily fluids of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients have not been conducted. Here, we investigated the relationship between fluid TIMP-3 levels and AD pathology. We first showed that the fluid levels of TIMP-3 were lower in AD dementia patients compared with in non-AD patients. ELISA results revealed that plasma levels of TIMP-3 in 65 patients with AD were significantly lower than those in 115 healthy control subjects and 71 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects. Furthermore, we found that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) level of TIMP-3 was decreased in AD compared with that in healthy control. These data suggest that fluid TIMP-3 levels negatively correlated with progress of cognitive decline. Collectively, our study suggests that alterations of fluid TIMP-3 levels might be associated with AD pathology.
