31181694|t|Design, Synthesis and Anti-Platelet Aggregation Activity Study of Ginkgolide-1,2,3-triazole Derivatives.
31181694|a|Ginkgolides are the major active component of Ginkgo biloba for inhibition of platelet activating factor receptor. An azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition reaction was used to introduce a triazole nucleus into the target ginkgolide molecules. A series of ginkgolide-1,2,3-triazole conjugates with varied functional groups including benzyl, phenyl and heterocycle moieties was thus synthesized. Many of the designed derivatives showed potent antiplatelet aggregation activities with IC50 values of 5~21 nM.
