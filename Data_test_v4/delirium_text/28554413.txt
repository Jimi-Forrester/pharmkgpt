28554413|t|The Nonmotor Features of Parkinson's Disease.
28554413|a|Nonmotor symptoms (NMS) of Parkinson's disease (PD) were recognized by the great James Parkinson himself who mentioned symptoms such as sleep dysfunction, delirium, dementia, and dysautonomia, in his seminal 1817 essay, "An Essay on the Shaking Palsy" (Parkinson, 1817). In spite of the key impact of PD NMS on quality of life, there was little holistic research and awareness till the validation and use of comprehensive tools such as the NMS questionnaire, scale, and the revised version of the unified PD rating scale. Research studies using these tools highlighted the key impact of the burden of NMS on quality of life of PD patients and the need for NMS to be routinely assessed in clinic. We now define PD as a motor and nonmotor disorder, and the natural history includes a long prodromal phase of PD dominated by a range of NMS. The prodromal phase is the subject of much research particularly in relation to neuroprotection and identifying subjects at risk. Use of NMS tools has also validated burden grading of NMS with cutoff values, which can be used as outcome measure in clinical trials. Finally, the complex multineurotransmitter dysfunction that is seen in PD has been shown to manifest clinically as nonmotor subtypes. Recognition of such subtypes is likely to lead to the emergence of personalized and precision medicine in PD.
