32307541|t|Hypertension Management in Emergency Departments.
32307541|a|BACKGROUND: Elevated blood pressure (BP) is pervasive among patients that visit emergency departments (EDs) for their care. METHODS: In this review article, we outline the current approach to the management of these individuals and highlight the crucial role emergency medicine clinicians play in reducing the morbidity associated with elevated BP. RESULTS: We highlight the critical importance of immediate treatment when elevated BP contributes to new or worsening end-organ injury but emphasize that such hypertensive emergencies are rare. For the vast majority of patients with elevated BP in the ED who do not have new or worsening end-organ injury from elevated BP, immediate BP reduction within the ED is not recommended or safe. Nonetheless, within weeks after an ED visit, there is a pressing need to improve the care of patients with elevated or previously undiagnosed hypertension. For many, it may be their only regular point of engagement with the healthcare system. To address this, we present novel perspectives that envision a new role for emergency medicine in chronic hypertension management-one that acknowledges the significant population-level gaps in BP control that contribute to disparities in cardiovascular disease and sets the stage for future changes in systems-based practice. CONCLUSIONS: Emergency medicine plays a key and evolving role in reducing morbidity associated with elevated BP.
