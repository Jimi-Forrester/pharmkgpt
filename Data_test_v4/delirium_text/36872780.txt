36872780|t|The Effect of Self-Reported Visual Impairment and Sleep on Cognitive Decline: Results of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos.
36872780|a|BACKGROUND: Visual impairment could worsen sleep/wake disorders and cognitive decline. OBJECTIVE: To examine interrelations among self-reported visual impairment, sleep, and cognitive decline in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) Miami-site. METHOD: HCHS/SOL Miami-site participants ages 45-74 years (n = 665) at Visit-1, who returned for cognitive test 7-years later (SOL-INCA). Participants completed the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ), validated sleep questionnaires and test for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) at Visit-1. We obtained verbal episodic learning and memory, verbal fluency, processing speed, and executive functioning at Visit-1 and at SOL-INCA. Processing speed/executive functioning were added to SOL-INCA. We examined global cognition and change using a regression-based reliable change index, adjusting for the time lapse between Visit-1 and SOL-INCA. We used regression models to test whether 1) persons with OSA, self-reported sleep duration, insomnia, and sleepiness have an increased risk for visual impairment, 2a) visual impairment is associated with worse cognitive function and/or decline, and 2b) sleep disorders attenuate these associations. RESULT: Sleepiness (beta= 0.04; p <  0.01) and insomnia (beta= 0.04; p <  0.001) were cross-sectionally associated with visual impairment, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, behavioral factors, acculturation, and health conditions. Visual impairment was associated with lower global cognitive function at Visit-1 (beta= -0.16; p <  0.001) and on average 7-years later (beta= -0.18; p <  0.001). Visual impairment was also associated with a change in verbal fluency (beta= -0.17; p <  0.01). OSA, self-reported sleep duration, insomnia, and sleepiness did not attenuate any of the associations. CONCLUSION: Self-reported visual impairment was independently associated with worse cognitive function and decline.
