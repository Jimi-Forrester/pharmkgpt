34898933|a|OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to describe the clinical experience of the health-care professionals (HCPs) responsible for the introduction of methadone, for the treatment of complex cancer pain, at a low-resource hospital in India in a patient-group, burdened by illiteracy, and low socio-economic status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten HCPs: Four medical doctors, four nurses, one pharmacist, and one hospital administrator were interviewed. The interviews are examined using a qualitative conventional content analysis. RESULTS: The interviews showed a confidence amongst the HCPs, responsible for the safe introduction of methadone in a stressful and low-resource surrounding, to patients with cancer pain and the different aspects of methadone, as initiation, titration, and maintenance of treatment. CONCLUSION: Introduction of methadone for cancer pain management is safe and feasible although low resources in a challenging hospital setting and care environment.
