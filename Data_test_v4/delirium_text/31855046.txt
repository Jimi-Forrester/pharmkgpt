MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were divided into 4 groups as followed: control (Group C), sevoflurane (Group S), Alzheimer's (Group A) and Alzheimer's + sevoflurane (Group AS)]. Cognitive functions were evaluated with Radial Arm Maze Test (RAMT). Alzheimer model was created by administering 3 mg/kg (10 mul) STZ. Sevoflurane was administered to S and AS groups. Serum samples and hippocampus tissues were analyzed. RESULTS: In RAM test, the entry-exit data were significantly decreased in A and AS groups. After the 2nd and 3rd administration of anesthesia, the numbers were significantly decreased in Group S. Glial-fibrillary-acidic protein levels were significantly higher in AS compared to the C and S groups. The brain tissue caspase 3 activity was less than 1% in all rats in the Group C, 3 % in 2 rats and 1 % in 1 rat in the Group AS. In A and AS group, serum catalase, myeloperoxidase and ferroxidase activities were found to be higher than in the other groups and myeloperoxidase activity was higher in the AS than in the A Group. Serum native thiol, total thiol and disulfide levels were found to be significantly different in the A and AS groups. CONCLUSION: Sevoflurane anesthesia negatively affected the cognitive functions (Tab. 5, Fig. 10, Ref. 51).
