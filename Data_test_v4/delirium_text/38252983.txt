38252983|a|OBJECTIVES: To explore the preferences of patients and families for delirium prevention by auditory stimulation in intensive care units. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: One-on-one, face-to-face, semistructured interviews with 17 participants (6 patients and 11 family members) were conducted at a step-down unit in a tertiary general hospital using a descriptive qualitative design. The data were analyzed via inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four major themes and ten subthemes emerged from the interviews: (1) reality orientation; (2) emotional support; (3) links to the outside; and (4) promising future. CONCLUSIONS: The results in this qualitative study shed light on patients' and families' preferences for auditory stimulation in preventing ICU delirium. The participation of family members plays a crucial role in preventing ICU delirium. Family members can assist patients in reducing confusion about the situation by providing accurate and clear reality orientation. The emotional support and promising future provided by family members can help patients regain confidence and courage, which are often lacking in ICU patients. Linking patients to the outside world helps them stay connected, understand what is happening outside and reduce feelings of isolation. IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: These findings can help health care staff gain insight into patients' and families' preferences and needs for auditory stimulation. Furthermore, these findings pave the way for crafting effective auditory interventions.
