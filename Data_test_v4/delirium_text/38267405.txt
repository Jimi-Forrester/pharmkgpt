38267405|t|Prediction models for postoperative delirium in elderly patients with machine-learning algorithms and SHapley Additive exPlanations.
38267405|a|Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common and severe complication in elderly patients with hip fractures. Identifying high-risk patients with POD can help improve the outcome of patients with hip fractures. We conducted a retrospective study on elderly patients (>=65 years of age) who underwent orthopedic surgery with hip fracture between January 2014 and August 2019. Conventional logistic regression and five machine-learning algorithms were used to construct prediction models of POD. A nomogram for POD prediction was built with the logistic regression method. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), accuracy, sensitivity, and precision were calculated to evaluate different models. Feature importance of individuals was interpreted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). About 797 patients were enrolled in the study, with the incidence of POD at 9.28% (74/797). The age, renal insufficiency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), use of antipsychotics, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein are used to build a nomogram for POD with an AUC of 0.71. The AUCs of five machine-learning models are 0.81 (Random Forest), 0.80 (GBM), 0.68 (AdaBoost), 0.77 (XGBoost), and 0.70 (SVM). The sensitivities of the six models range from 68.8% (logistic regression and SVM) to 91.9% (Random Forest). The precisions of the six machine-learning models range from 18.3% (logistic regression) to 67.8% (SVM). Six prediction models of POD in patients with hip fractures were constructed using logistic regression and five machine-learning algorithms. The application of machine-learning algorithms could provide convenient POD risk stratification to benefit elderly hip fracture patients.
