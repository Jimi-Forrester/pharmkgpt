34359343|t|Sjogren's Syndrome Presenting with Solely Cutaneous Features.
34359343|a|Sjogren's syndrome is classically characterized by symptoms of keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia, secondary to lymphocytic infiltration of the salivary and lacrimal glands. Cutaneous findings of this disease are infrequently discussed and thus rarely considered among patients without the typical symptomatology. However, these patients can develop xerosis, alopecia, vitiligo, papular or nodular lesions, or cutaneous vasculitis. A 56-year-old Asian female presented with intermittent cutaneous erythematous lesions of her bilateral pinna and preauricular areas. Despite initial symptom presentation causing concern for tumid lupus versus cutaneous T cell lymphoma versus relapsing polychondritis, extensive serologic and histopathologic workup eventually indicated a likely diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome. This case brings to light that Sjogren's syndrome is truly a multi-systemic disease and can present with primarily extra glandular cutaneous symptoms. When approaching the workup of a new patient, it is absolutely vital to maintain a broad differential and keep in mind that overlap syndromes among multiple autoimmune diseases do exist as well.
