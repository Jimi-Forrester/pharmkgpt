39394037|a|Abeta accumulation in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) endothelium, which lines the cerebrovascular lumen, is a significant contributor to cerebrovascular dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels are associated with increased AD risk, and the HDL mimetic peptide 4F has been developed as a promising therapeutic agent to improve cerebrovascular health in AD. In this study, we evaluated the impact of 4F on 125I-Abeta42 blood-to-brain distribution using dynamic SPECT/CT imaging in both wild-type and APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Graphical analysis of the imaging data demonstrated that 4F significantly reduced the blood-to-brain influx rate in wild-type mice and the distribution of 125I-Abeta42 in the BBB endothelium in APP/PS1 mice. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of 4F, we evaluated its impact on the p38 pathway and its role in mediating Abeta42 trafficking in human BBB endothelial cell monolayers. Treatment with 4F significantly decreased Abeta42 induced p38 activation in BBB endothelial cells. Furthermore, inhibition of p38 kinase significantly reduced endothelial accumulation of fluorescence-labeled Abeta42 and luminal-to-abluminal permeability across the cell monolayer. While our previous publication has hinted at the potential of 4F to reduce Abeta accumulation in the brain parenchyma, the current findings demonstrated the protective effect of 4F in reducing Abeta42 accumulation in the BBB endothelium of AD transgenic mice. These findings revealed the impact of a clinically tested agent, the HDL mimetic peptide 4F, on Abeta exposure to the BBB endothelium and offer novel mechanistic insights into potential therapeutic strategies to treat cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD.
