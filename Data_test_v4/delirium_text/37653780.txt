37653780|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) refers to acute brain dysfunction occurring within 7 days after operation or before discharge. Frailty refers to the state that the body's physiological reserve is insufficient, so that the compensative capacity to endogenous and exogenous stress stimuli decreases. The purpose of this study is to explore the association of preoperative frailty (PF) with POD in elderly patients undergoing hip arthroplasty. METHODS: Totally 228 elderly patients (age >= 65 years) who received elective hip arthroplasty in the Ningbo No. 6 Hospital between December 2021 and June 2022 were enrolled. One day before surgery, the frailty phenotype scale was adopted for evaluation of patients' frailty. On the 1st-3rd day after operation, the confusion assessment method was adopted for evaluation of delirium, and the patients were grouped into a POD group and non-POD group. Logistic regression was conducted to analyze the correlation between PF and POD. RESULTS: Among the patients, the incidence of PF was 30.70% (70/228), and the incidence of delirium within 3 days after operation was 25.88% (59/228). According to binary logistic regression analysis, PF, age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and preoperative sleep disorder were independent risk factors for POD in elderly patients undergoing hip arthroplasty (all P < .05). CONCLUSION: PF is a crucial risk factor for POD in elderly patients undergoing hip arthroplasty.
