8830319|t|A closely linked gene to apolipoprotein E may serve as an additional risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.
8830319|a|The E4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene has been identified as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Immediately downstream from the APOE gene on chromosome 19 is the gene for apolipoprotein CI (APOCI). We have found that the frequency of an APOCI restriction site is 0.45 for Alzheimer's patients and 0.14 for control spouses, which is similar to the frequencies for the APOE4 allele. The APOE4 allele is in linkage disequilibrium with the APOCI restriction site. Thus both the APOE4 allele and the APOCI restriction site may be considered as risk factors for Alzheimer's disease.
