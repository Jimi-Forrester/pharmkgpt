36309938|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a central nervous system disease that can lead to cognitive impairment and progressive memory loss. An increasing number of studies have shown that intestinal flora play a crucial role in regulating the brain-gut axis. Short-chain fatty acids are metabolites of intestinal flora that regulate hormone synthesis and play an essential role in microbial-intestinal-brain communication. An imbalance of intestinal flora can promote microglia to secrete proinflammatory factors, cause nerve inflammation, and then affect cognitive and learning ability. However, the mechanism is not clear. From this, we infer that endogenous hormones may be the medium for intestinal flora to affect the process of AD. This review of the relationships among AD, endogenous hormones, and intestinal flora expounds on the critical role of various hormones in the brain-gut axis. It discusses intervention measures aimed at intestinal flora to prevent or delay AD occurrence. Finally, the potential development prospects of fecal microbiota transplantation in treating AD are put forward, which provide potential ideas for future AD research.
