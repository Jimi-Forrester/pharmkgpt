35518272|t|A review on biological activities of Schiff base, hydrazone, and oxime derivatives of curcumin.
35518272|a|Curcumin (1,7-bis[4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl]-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione) is the main pigment present in the turmeric rhizome and shows various biological properties. The synthesis of different derivatives is an effective way to improve the medicinal and biological properties of curcumin. Many researchers have chosen the carbonyl group of curcumin for modification and preparation of new analogues. This review critically surveys a general overview of the literature and summarizes the synthesis and biological activities of Schiff base, hydrazone and oxime derivatives of curcumin over the last decade. These compounds and also their metal complexes possess higher potency in biological activity.
