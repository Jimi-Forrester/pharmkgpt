35631531|a|Timosaponin A3 (TA3) was demonstrated as a potent anticancer chemical by several studies. Although the effects of inhibiting growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis in various cancer cells were demonstrated through multiple mechanisms, the pharmacological mechanism of TA3 shown in pancreatic cancer (PC) is insufficient compared to other cancers. In this study, we aimed to explore the key molecular mechanisms underlying the growth inhibitory effects of TA3 using PC cells and a xenograft model. First, from the microarray results, we found that TA3 regulated INSIG-1 and HMGCR in BxPC-3 cells. Furthermore, we showed that inhibition of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) by TA3 reduced the fatty acid synthases FASN and ACC, thereby controlling the growth of BxPC-3 cells. We also tried to find mechanisms involved with SREBP-1, such as Akt, Gsk3beta, mTOR, and AMPK, but these were not related to SREBP-1 inhibition by TA3. In the BxPC-3 xenograft model, the TA3 group had more reduced tumor formation and lower toxicity than the gemcitabine group. Interestingly, the level of the fatty acid metabolites palmitate and stearate were significantly reduced in the tumor tissue in the TA3 group. Overall, our study demonstrated that SREBP-1 was a key transcription factor involved in pancreatic cancer growth and it remained a precursor form due to TA3, reducing the adipogenesis and growth in BxPC-3 cells. Our results improve our understanding of novel mechanisms of TA3 for the regulation of lipogenesis and provide a new approach to the prevention and treatment of PC.
