11132941|t|An autopsy case of Alzheimer's disease with a progressive supranuclear palsy overlap.
11132941|a|A 74-year-old man developed abnormal forgetfulness, soon followed by unstable speech content and marked disorientation. At 77 years of age, the patient started to occasionally fall, an aspect of progressive supranuclear palsy. He then became bedridden. The patient eventually died of pneumonia at 79 years of age. Neuropathological examination revealed profiles of both progressive supranuclear palsy and Alzheimer's disease. Although the two conditions both belong to tauopathy, their pathologically proven combination was rare. Furthermore, the case had the possibility of being a subgroup of tauopathy.
