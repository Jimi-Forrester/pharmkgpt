37396540|t|Cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1): Its functional role in physiological and pathophysiological processes.
37396540|a|Cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1), belonging to the mammalian non-heme Fe(II) dioxygenases family, is a key enzyme for cysteine catabolism. Its activity and expression is regulated through multiple mechanisms. CDO1 is involved in a spectrum of physiological processes including lipid metabolism, adipogenesis, osteoblastic differentiation, redox homeostasis, fertility, bile acid metabolism, sulfide metabolism, and organismal growth and development. Many of these processes are regulated directly or indirectly by CDO1-mediated metabolism of cysteine. In pathophysiological processes, the degree of CDO1 promoter methylation is closely related to the progression and malignancy of tumors, and overexpression of CDO1 will promote ferroptosis of cancer cells. Moreover, CDO1 may ameliorate metabolic disorders through the taurine-mediated improvement of lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity and improve neurodegenerative diseases by regulating cysteine level. Therefore, elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the role of CDO1 would provide a clearer view of the therapeutic potential and possible risks of targeting this important enzyme.
