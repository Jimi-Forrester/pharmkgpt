36235230|t|Allergic Inflammation: Effect of Propolis and Its Flavonoids.
36235230|a|The incidence of allergic diseases and their complications are increasing worldwide. Today, people increasingly use natural products, which has been termed a "return to nature". Natural products with healing properties, especially those obtained from plants and bees, have been used in the prevention and treatment of numerous chronic diseases, including allergy and/or inflammation. Propolis is a multi-component resin rich in flavonoids, collected and transformed by honeybees from buds and plant wounds for the construction and adaptation of their nests. This article describes the current views regarding the possible mechanisms and multiple benefits of flavonoids in combating allergy and allergy-related complications. These benefits arise from flavonoid anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and wound healing activities and their effects on microbe-immune system interactions in developing host responses to different allergens. Finally, this article presents various aspects of allergy pathobiology and possible molecular approaches in their treatment. Possible mechanisms regarding the antiallergic action of propolis on the microbiota of the digestive and respiratory tracts and skin diseases as a method to selectively remove allergenic molecules by the process of bacterial biotransformation are also reported.
