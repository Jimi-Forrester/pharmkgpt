33637687|a|CREB-binding protein (CBP) is an acetyltransferase known to play multiple roles in the transcriptions of genes involving oxidative metabolism, cell cycle, DNA damage checkpoints, and cell death. In this study, CBP was found to positively regulate the expression of Ku70, and both CBP and Ku70 were found to negatively regulate the expression of NOX2, therefore, mitigating the intracellular ROS in human melanoma. Knocking down CBP or Ku70 induced necrotic and paraptotic cell death as indicated by high-level intracellular ROS, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and cell cycle arrest in the S phase. In addition, chromosomal condensations were also observed in the cells proceeding necrotic and paraptotic cell death, which was found to be related to the BAX-associated intrinsic pathway of apoptotic cell death, when Ku70 was decreased either by CBP depletion or by Ku70 depletion directly. Our results, therefore, supported the idea that CBP, Ku70, BAX, and NOX2 have formed a transcriptional network in the prevention of cell death of necrosis, paraptosis, and apoptosis in human melanoma.
