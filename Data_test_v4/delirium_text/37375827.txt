37375827|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by progressive memory loss and other affected cognitive functions. Pharmacological therapy of AD relies on inhibitors of the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), offering only a palliative effect and being incapable of stopping or reversing the neurodegenerative process. However, recent studies have shown that inhibiting the enzyme beta-secretase 1 (BACE-1) may be able to stop neurodegeneration, making it a promising target. Considering these three enzymatic targets, it becomes feasible to apply computational techniques to guide the identification and planning of molecules capable of binding to all of them. After virtually screening 2119 molecules from a library, 13 hybrids were built and further screened by triple pharmacophoric model, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (t = 200 ns). The selected hybrid G meets all stereo-electronic requirements to bind to AChE, BChE, and BACE-1 and offers a promising structure for future synthesis, enzymatic testing, and validation.
