33868261|t|Integrative Transcriptomic, Proteomic and Functional Analysis Reveals ATP1B3 as a Diagnostic and Potential Therapeutic Target in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
33868261|a|The Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), has been proposed as a signal transducer involving various pathobiological processes, including tumorigenesis. However, the clinical relevance of NKA in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been well studied. This study revealed the upregulation of mRNA of ATP1A1, ATP1B1, and ATP1B3 in HCC using TCGA, ICGC, and GEO database. Subsequently, ATP1B3 was demonstrated as an independent prognostic factor of overall survival (OS) of HCC. To investigate the potential mechanisms of ATP1B3 in HCC, we analyzed the co-expression network using LinkedOmics and found that ATP1B3 co-expressed genes were associated with immune-related biological processes. Furthermore, we found that ATP1B3 was correlated immune cell infiltration and immune-related cytokines expression in HCC. The protein level of ATP1B3 was also validated as a prognostic significance and was correlated with immune infiltration in HCC using two proteomics datasets. Finally, functional analysis revealed that ATP1B3 was increased in HCC cells and tissues, silenced ATP1B3 repressed HCC cell proliferation, migration, and promoted HCC cell apoptosis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). In conclusion, these findings proved that ATP1B3 could be an oncogene and it was demonstrated as an independent prognostic factor and correlated with immune infiltration in HCC, revealing new insights into the prognostic role and potential immune regulation of ATP1B3 in HCC progression and provide a novel possible therapeutic strategy for HCC.
