25326104|a|AIMS: Since the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), newer generation and novel devices such as the retrievable JenaValve  have been developed. We evaluated the procedural and 6-month results of our first experience with implantation of the JenaValve . METHODS AND RESULTS: From June 2012 to December 2013, 24 consecutive patients (mean age 80 +- 7 years, 42 % male) underwent an elective transapical TAVI with the JenaValve . Device success was 88 %. The mortality rate was 4 % at 30 days and 31 % at 6 months. TAVI reduced the mean transvalvular gradient (44.2 +- 11.1 mmHg vs. 12.3 +- 4.3 mmHg, p < 0.001) and increased the mean aortic valve area (0.8 3 +- 0.23 to 1.70 +- 0.44 cm(2)). A mild paravalvular leakage (PVL) occurred in 4 patients (18 %) and a moderate PVL in 1 patient (4 %). Mean New York Heart Association Functional Class improved from 2.9 +- 0.5 to 2.0 +- 0.8 at 30 days. CONCLUSION: TAVI using the JenaValve  prosthesis seems adequate and safe in this first experience cohort.
