32424756|a|Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a naturally occurring mycotoxin mostly found in food items including grains and coffee beans. It induces DNA single-strand breaks and has been considered to be carcinogenic. It is recognized as a serious threat to reproductive health both in males and females. OTA is highly nephrotoxic and carcinogenic, and its potency changes evidently between species and sexes. There is a close association between OTA, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and genotoxicity, but the underlying mechanisms are not clear. Reports regarding genotoxic effects in relation to OTA which leads to the induction of DNA adduct formation, protein synthesis inhibition, perturbation of cellular energy production, initiation of oxidative stress, induction of apoptosis, influences on mitosis, induction of cell cycle arrest, and interference with cytokine pathways. All these mechanisms are associated with nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, teratotoxicity, immunological toxicity, and neurotoxicity. OTA administration activates various mechanisms such as p38 MAPK, JNKs, and ERKs dysfunctions, BDNF disruption, TH overexpression, caspase-3 and 9 activation, and ERK-1/2 phosphorylation which ultimately lead to Alzheimer disease (AD) progression. The current review will focus on OTA in terms of recent discoveries in the field of molecular biology. The main aim is to investigate the underlying mechanisms of OTA in regard to genotoxicity and epigenetic modulations that lead to AD. Also, we will highlight the strategies for the purpose of attenuating the hazards posed by OTA exposure.
