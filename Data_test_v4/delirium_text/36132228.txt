36132228|a|Stroke is a neurological disease that causes significant disability and death worldwide. Ischemic stroke accounts for 75% of all strokes. The pathophysiological processes underlying ischemic stroke include oxidative stress, the toxicity of excitatory amino acids, ion disorder, enhanced apoptosis, and inflammation. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) may have a vital role in regulating the pathophysiological processes of ischemic stroke, as confirmed by the altered expression of ncRNAs in blood samples from acute ischemic stroke patients, animal models, and oxygen-glucose-deprived (OGD) cell models. Due to specific changes in expression, ncRNAs can potentially be biomarkers for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of ischemic stroke. As an important brain cell component, glial cells mediate the occurrence and progression of oxidative stress after ischemic stroke, and ncRNAs are an irreplaceable part of this mechanism. This review highlights the impact of ncRNAs in the oxidative stress process of ischemic stroke. It focuses on specific ncRNAs that underlie the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke and have potential as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
