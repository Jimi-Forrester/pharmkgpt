37491244|t|Objectively-measured movement behaviors, systemic low-grade inflammation, and plasma neurofilament light chain in older adults: a population-based study.
37491244|a|BACKGROUND: Evidence has linked self-reported sedentary behavior (SB) and physical activity (PA) with cognitive impairment; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We examined the associations of the accelerometer-measured movement behaviors with plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) among older adults and the role of systemic low-grade inflammation in the associations. RESULTS: This population-based study included 1,029 dementia-free older adults (age >= 60 years, range 60-88 years; 59.48% women) who undertook the ActiGraph substudy (March 2018-December 2020) in MIND-China. There were nonlinear relationships of daily SB and PA time with plasma NfL concentration, such that more daily SB time or less time spent in daily light-intensity physical activity (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) was significantly associated with increased plasma NfL only when SB time >= 8.00 h/day or LPA time < 5.00 h/day or MVPA time < 2.00 h/day. Furthermore, more daily SB time or less daily LPA and MVPA time was significantly associated with higher serum low-grade inflammation score, a composite measure generated from serum IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, and ICAM-1 (P < 0.05). Finally, low-grade inflammation score accounted for 14.5% to 17.8% of the associations between movement behaviors and plasma NfL. CONCLUSIONS: More daily SB and less PA time are associated with neurodegeneration and systemic low-grade inflammation in older adults. The association of movement behaviors with neurodegeneration is partially mediated by low-grade inflammation.
