34604435|t|Amyloidosis: A Rare Cause of Severe Cholestasis and Acute Liver Failure.
34604435|a|Although hepatic involvement in light chain-associated amyloidosis is common, clinical manifestations of hepatic amyloidosis are rare. In most cases, hepatomegaly serves as a clue to diagnosis. We report a unique case of a 48-year-old man from China with jaundice and noncirrhotic portal hypertension, with rapidly progressive liver failure, in the absence of hepatomegaly, secondary to systemic light chain-associated amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma.
