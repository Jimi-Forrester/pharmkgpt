35692393|t|Emerging Role of Epitranscriptomics in Diabetes Mellitus and Its Complications.
35692393|a|Diabetes mellitus (DM) and its related complications are among the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide. Substantial studies have explored epigenetic regulation that is involved in the modifications of DNA and proteins, but RNA modifications in diabetes are still poorly investigated. In recent years, posttranscriptional epigenetic modification of RNA (the so-called 'epitranscriptome') has emerged as an interesting field of research. Numerous modifications, mainly N6 -methyladenosine (m6A), have been identified in nearly all types of RNAs and have been demonstrated to have an indispensable effect in a variety of human diseases, such as cancer, obesity, and diabetes. Therefore, it is particularly important to understand the molecular basis of RNA modifications, which might provide a new perspective for the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and the discovery of new therapeutic targets. In this review, we aim to summarize the recent progress in the epitranscriptomics involved in diabetes and diabetes-related complications. We hope to provide some insights for enriching the understanding of the epitranscriptomic regulatory mechanisms of this disease as well as the development of novel therapeutic targets for future clinical benefit.
