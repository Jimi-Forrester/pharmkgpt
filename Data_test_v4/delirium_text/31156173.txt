31156173|t|Lithium as a Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease: The Systems Pharmacology Perspective.
31156173|a|Systems pharmacology is a novel framework for drug research that models traditional and innovative pharmacological parameters and provides the overall efficacy and safety profile of a drug across body systems and complex, non-linear, molecular interactions. Lithium chloride, a pharmacological compound approved for the therapy of psychiatric disorders, represents a poorly explored compound for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lithium has been shown to reduce downstream effects associated with the aberrant overactivation of certain molecular pathways, such as glycogen synthase kinase 3 subunit beta (GSK3-beta)-related pathways, involved in AD-related pathophysiology. It seems that overactivation and overexpression of GSK3-beta lead to an impairment of long-term potentiation and amyloid-beta induced neurotoxicity that can be normalized using lithium. Moreover, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that lithium's GSK3-beta inhibitory effect prevents tau phosphorylation in mouse models of tauopathies. Clinical data have been inconclusive, partly due to methodological limitations. The lack of studies exploring the dynamics of protein misfolding in AD and investigating the specific tau-isoforms appearing prior to the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles calls for new and optimized clinical trials. Advanced computer modeling based on a formal implementation of quantitative parameters and basic enzymatic insights into a mechanism-based model would present a good start to tackle these non-linear interactions. This innovative approach will pave the way for developing "molecularly" biomarker-guided targeted therapies, i.e., treatments specifically adapted ("tailored") to the individual, consistently with the primary objectives and key conceptual points of precision medicine and precision pharmacology.
