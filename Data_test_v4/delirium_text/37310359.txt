37310359|a|Phase separation is a common biological phenomenon in the liquid environment of organisms. Phase separation has been shown to be a key cause of many existing incurable diseases, such as the protein aggregates formed by phase separation of Alzheimer's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, etc. Tracking the occurrence of phase separation in vivo is critical to many disease detection methods and solving many treatment problems. Its physicochemical properties and visual detection methods have flourished in the last few years in chemical biology, among which the fluorogenic toolbox has great application potential compared to the traditional detection methods that cannot visualize the phase separation process intuitively, but just show some parameters indirectly. This paper reviews the mechanism and disease correlation proven in recent years for phase separation and analyzes the detection methods for phase separation, including functional microscope imaging techniques, turbidity monitoring, macromolecule congestion sensing, in silico analysis, etc. It is worth mentioning that the qualitative and quantitative analysis of aggregates formed by phase separation using in vitro parameters has successfully provided basic physical and chemical properties for phase separation aggregates, and is an important cornerstone for researchers to carry forward the past and break through the existing technical shackles to create new in vivo monitoring methods such as fluorescence methodology. Crucially, fluorescence methods for cell microenvironment imaging based on different mechanisms are discussed, such as AIE-based probes, TICT-based probes and FRET-based probes, etc.
