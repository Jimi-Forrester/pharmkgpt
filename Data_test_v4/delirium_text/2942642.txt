2942642|t|Subcellular pathology of human neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer-type dementia and Huntington's disease.
2942642|a|Activities of enzyme markers of subcellular organelles have been measured in brain tissue from subjects with Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD) and Huntington's disease (HD). Significant increases in the activity of the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase were observed in both ATD temporal cortex and HD putamen. It is suggested that beta-glucuronidase activity may be a useful biochemical indicator of cellular damage in the CNS. A significant reduction in neutral alpha-glucosidase activity was observed in ATD temporal cortex and HD putamen. This change may reflect an alteration in glycoconjugate processing and may relate to the susceptibility of neurones to the degenerative processes of ATD and HD.
