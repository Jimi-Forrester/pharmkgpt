36175277|t|Piloting Smart Home Sensors to Detect Overnight Respiratory and Withdrawal Symptoms in Adults Prescribed Opioids.
36175277|a|BACKGROUND: Novel strategies are needed to curb the opioid overdose epidemic. Smart home sensors have been successfully deployed as digital biomarkers to monitor health conditions, yet they have not been used to assess symptoms important to opioid use and overdose risks. AIM: This study piloted smart home sensors and investigated their ability to accurately detect clinically pertinent symptoms indicative of opioid withdrawal or respiratory depression in adults prescribed methadone. METHODS: Participants (n = 4; 3 completed) were adults with opioid use disorder exhibiting moderate levels of pain intensity, withdrawal symptoms, and sleep disturbance. Participants were invited to two 8-hour nighttime sleep opportunities to be recorded in a sleep research laboratory, using observed polysomnography and ambient smart home sensors attached to lab bedroom walls. Measures of feasibility included completeness of data captured. Accuracy was determined by comparing polysomnographic data of sleep/wake and respiratory status assessments with time and event sensor data. RESULTS: Smart home sensors captured overnight data on 48 out of 64 hours (75% completeness). Sensors detected sleep/wake patterns in alignment with observed sleep episodes captured by polysomnography 89.4% of the time. Apnea events (n = 118) were only detected with smart home sensors in two episodes where oxygen desaturations were less severe (>80%). CONCLUSIONS: Smart home technology could serve as a less invasive substitute for biologic monitoring for adults with pain, sleep disturbances, and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Supplemental sensors should be added to detect apnea events. Such innovations could provide a step forward in assessing overnight symptoms important to populations taking opioids.
