37508386|t|Mitochondrial Proteome Changes in Rett Syndrome.
37508386|a|Rett syndrome (RTT) is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder with mutations in the X-chromosomal MECP2 (methyl-CpG-binding protein 2) gene. Most patients are young girls. For 7-18 months after birth, they hardly present any symptoms; later they develop mental problems, a lack of communication, irregular sleep and breathing, motor dysfunction, hand stereotypies, and seizures. The complex pathology involves mitochondrial structure and function. Mecp2-/y hippocampal astrocytes show increased mitochondrial contents. Neurons and glia suffer from oxidative stress, a lack of ATP, and increased hypoxia vulnerability. This spectrum of changes demands comprehensive molecular studies of mitochondria to further define their pathogenic role in RTT. Therefore, we applied a comparative proteomic approach for the first time to study the entity of mitochondrial proteins in a mouse model of RTT. In the neocortex and hippocampus of symptomatic male mice, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and subsequent mass-spectrometry identified various differentially expressed mitochondrial proteins, including components of respiratory chain complexes I and III and the ATP-synthase FoF1 complex. The NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa subunit, NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 8, NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] flavoprotein 2, cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 1, and ATP synthase subunit d are upregulated either in the hippocampus alone or both the hippocampus and neocortex of Mecp2-/y mice. Furthermore, the regulatory mitochondrial proteins mitofusin-1, HSP60, and 14-3-3 protein theta are decreased in the Mecp2-/y neocortex. The expressional changes identified provide further details of the altered mitochondrial function and morphology in RTT. They emphasize brain-region-specific alterations of the mitochondrial proteome and support the notion of a metabolic component of this devastating disorder.
