35928538|t|Timing of Exposure to ICU Diaries and Its Impact on Mental Health, Memories, and Quality of Life: A Double-Blind Randomized Control Trial.
35928538|a|Optimal time for ICU diary delivery and impact on mental health (MH), anxiety-depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), quality of life (QOL), and memories is unclear. We evaluated the effect of ICU diaries, dispatched at different time points, on outcomes in an Indian cohort. DESIGN: Double-blind randomized controlled trial. SETTING: A 1,000-bedded teaching hospital in East India. PATIENTS: Mechanically ventilated (>24 hr) adults were recruited, excluding those dead or incapable of meaningful-communication at discharge or follow-up. Eighty-three patients, aged 46.2 +- 17.2 years, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores 13.7 +- 4.9 were assessed. Length of ICU stay was 8.2 +- 7.1 days with 3.7 +- 3.2 ventilator days. INTERVENTION: Of 820 screened, 164 had diaries created. Including photographs, diaries were comaintained by healthcare workers and family members. Ninety patients were randomized at 1-month follow-up: diary sent to 45 at 1 month (group ID1) and to 45 at 3 months (ID3). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Anxiety-depression, memory, and QOL were assessed telephonically or home visits by a psychologist using the Hospital Anxiety-Depression Scale (HADS) and other tools at ICU discharge, 1-month (prerandomization), and 3 months of discharge. ID3 was reassessed after receiving diaries at 3.5 months. Primary outcome was anxiety-depression; secondary outcomes included PTSS, QOL, and memories. There was 100% follow-up. At 3 months, ID1 patients had a significant (p < 0.001) reduction in HADS from baseline when compared with ID3 that had not received diaries (4.16 +- 2.9 vs 2.15 +- 1.8; 95% CI, 2.8-1.2). PTSS scores were likewise better (p < 0.001). ID3 patients demonstrated significant improvement (p < 0.01) in QOL and memories along with HADS and PTSS when assessed at 3.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: ICU diaries improve MH but not QOL when delivered at 1 month and assessed 2 months thereafter. Assessed after 15 days, delayed exposure at 3 months significantly improved QOL and memories in addition to MH.
