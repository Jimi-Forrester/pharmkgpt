37206021|a|Objective: Anxiety and depression in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) complicate clinical treatment and can seriously affect prognosis. The present study aims to investigate the effects of the anti-ribosomal P protein antibody (anti-RibP) in the peripheral blood and insomnia on the severity of anxiety and depression in case of SLE. The study compared both the results of the investigation on the objective perceptions of physicians concerning mood changes in patients with SLE and the results of self-rating scales that were completed by the enrolled patients. The conclusion of the comparation is used to determine the probability of the accurate detection of anxiety and depression by physicians. The study aims to assist in the early detection in clinical practice of abnormal emotions in patients with SLE and to summarize common clinical interventions for anxiety and depression. Method: The relationship between anxiety and depression was evaluated by the Zung self-rating anxiety/depression scale (SAS/SDS). Basic information (e.g., blood type, smoking history, drinking history, educational background, duration of illness), the insomnia severity index (ISI) results, and anti-RibP in the peripheral blood, were investigated in 107 patients with SLE in northeastern China to further analyze the correlation between the severity of depression and anti-RibP, together with the consistency between results of the questionnaire for physicians and the self-rating scale for patients. Results: Gender, smoking history, drinking history, educational background, and duration of illness were correlated with the SAS/SDS scores (P < 0.05). Family history had a significant effect on the SAS score (P = 0.031), while the SDS score was significantly correlated with blood type (P = 0.021). The ISI score was significantly and positively correlated with the SAS/SDS score (P < 0.001). The titer of anti-RibP showed a correlation with the SDS score (P < 0.05) but not with the SAS score (P = 0.198). The titer of anti-RibP was significantly higher in patients with major depression compared with those with no depression, patients with mild depression, and those with moderate depression (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Anxiety and depression in patients with SLE were correlated with sleeping, educational background, blood type, smoking history, and alcohol consumption. Although anti-RibP was not significantly correlated with anxiety, it indicated a significant correlation with major depression. Clinicians were more accurate in assessing anxiety compared with depression.
