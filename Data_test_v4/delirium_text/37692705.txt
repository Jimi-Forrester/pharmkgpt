37692705|t|Multimodal Pain Management for Parsonage-Turner Syndrome in the Acute Rehabilitation Setting: A Case Report.
37692705|a|Parsonage-Turner syndrome (PTS) is a rare neurological condition characterized by acute shoulder pain and novel neuromuscular weakness in the distribution of the brachial plexus. We present a case report highlighting the difficulties in the diagnosis and management of this condition. A multidisciplinary approach is often required to control this unique type of pain, consisting of neuropathic medications, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to control neuromuscular pain, and modalities provided by experienced physical therapists. Finally, a comprehensive, structured rehabilitation program focusing on the range of motion, neuromuscular re-education, and strengthening is imperative to regain function, reduce symptoms, and improve recovery.
