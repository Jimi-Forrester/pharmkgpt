31851431|t|CogEvo, a cognitive function balancer, is a sensitive and easy psychiatric test battery for age-related cognitive decline.
31851431|a|AIM: We examined whether a newly developed computer-aided neuropsychiatric series of test, CogEvo, is necessary and sufficient for the evaluation of cognitive function in older people. METHODS: A total of 272 participants in worthwhile life activity for the prevention of decline in mobility and cognitive function were administered tests every week at 33 locations in Fukaura-machi, Japan. Basic profile information, a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), a CogEvo and a clock drawing test were used in the present study. RESULTS: Our results are summarized as: (i) the total score of the CogEvo and MMSE tests decreased significantly according to age and in age group analysis; (ii) scores from the CogEvo and MMSE tests showed a significant correlation; (iii) MMSE scores showed marked ceiling effects; (iv) analysis of cognitive domains, such as orientation, attention, memory and executive function, and spatial cognition using CogEvo showed significant age-dependent impairment; (v) CogEvo discriminated three score groups of MMSE results with sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 60% in the <23 score group, 78% and 54% in the 24-26 score group, and 85% and 70% in the >27 score group, respectively; (vi) CogEvo memory tests reflected more detailed recall function than registration function; and (vii) CogEvo spatial cognition test results were correlated with test items of the MMSE and clock drawing tests. CONCLUSIONS: CogEvo is an easy and potentially useful computer-aided test battery that can be used to evaluate age-related or pathological decline in cognitive function from middle age and in preclinical stages of dementia.
