38575930|a|BACKGROUND: According to traditional medicine, Melissa officinalis L., (lemon balm) has been known to remove harmful substances from the blood and is considered a cardiac tonic. Therefore, its use as a cardiovascular remedy may explain the lipid-lowering effects of lemon balm. Dyslipidemia can be considered as a significant preventable risk factor for atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The present study is the first meta-analysis to investigate the effects of M. officinalis administration on serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC). METHODS: From inception to October 2023, a thorough search through literature was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The inclusion criteria of this study were randomized controlled trials, with or without blinding which provided adequate data for each group at the beginning and end of the follow-up period. Meta-analysis was performed on randomized controlled trials using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) V4 software. Risk of bias in the selected studies was examined according to the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. Begg's funnel plot symmetry status, Begg's rank correlation, and Egger's weighted regression tests were employed to evaluate potential publication bias. RESULTS: The meta-analysis comprised of 5 randomized controlled trials with a total of 302 patients. The findings of the meta-analysis indicated that the consumption of lemon balm had a significant decrease in TG (SMD (95% CI): -0.396(-0.620, -0.173), p-value = 0.001), TC (SMD (95% CI): -0.416 (-0.641, -0.192), p-value < 0.001) and LDL (SMD (95% CI): -0.23(-0.45, -0.008), p < 0.05) levels compared to the placebo group. While it had no statistically significant effect on HDL level (SMD (95% CI): 0.336(-0.091, 0.767), p-value = 0.123). No significant and detectable publication bias was found in the meta-analysis. Additionally, all included clinical studies demonstrated a low risk of bias for missing outcome data and selection of the reported results. The robustness of the results was demonstrated by a sensitivity analysis using the one-study remove method. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this meta-analysis provide evidence that lemon balm may be administered as a safe and beneficial herbal medicine for reducing TC, TG and LDL levels. According to the pooled results of 5 studies with a total of 302 patients, lemon balm intake had no significant effect on HDL level. This study reinforces the notion that lemon balm may have a substantial impact on serum lipid profile as a potential remedy in cases of dyslipidemia. The main concern of our research is the limited number of eligible studies and the relatively small population size of each individual study. The patients of these studies had different types of diseases and metabolic syndromes. However, the meta-analysis was sufficiently powered to detect the considerable effects of lemon balm in the combined population regardless of type of diseases.
