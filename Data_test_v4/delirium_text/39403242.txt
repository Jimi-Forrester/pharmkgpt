39403242|a|Objectives: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of death worldwide, emerging from a combination of several factors. The aim of this review is to define the psychological factors that are significant in the development and progression of these disorders. Methods: Studies published through 2023 concerning adults with psychological vulnerability factors and/or cardiovascular disease were selected through searches of PubMed, PsychINFO, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. Results: Psychological stress may influence CVD, in combination with other risk factors, or it can act independently, as in cases of workplace stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, Takotsubo syndrome and bereavement. Coping strategies, anxiety and depression have also been identified as relevant psychological factors in cardiac patients. Adverse childhood experiences are linked to a reduced quality of life and have been identified as significant risk factors for the development of acquired CVDs. Conclusion: This review demonstrates that several psychological factors affect cardiovascular function. An in-depth study of the psychological correlates of CVDs would allow healthcare professionals to design more effective prevention and intervention programs.
