28841371|t|Membrane Dynamics of gamma-Secretase Provides a Molecular Basis for beta-Amyloid Binding and Processing.
28841371|a|gamma-Secretase produces beta-amyloid (Abeta) within its presenilin (PS1) subunit, mutations in which cause Alzheimer's disease, and current therapies thus seek to modulate its activity. While the general structure is known from recent electron microscopy studies, direct loop and membrane interactions and explicit dynamics relevant to substrate processing remain unknown. We report a modeled structure utilizing the optimal multitemplate information available, including loops and missing side chains, account of maturation cleavage, and explicit all-atom molecular dynamics in the membrane. We observe three distinct conformations of gamma-secretase (open, semiopen, and closed) that remarkably differ by tilting of helices 2 and 3 of PS1, directly controlling active site availability. The large hydrophilic loop of PS1 where maturation occurs reveals a new helix segment that parallels the likely helix character of other substrates. The semiopen conformation consistently shows the best fit of Abeta peptides, that is, longer residence before release and by inference more trimming. In contrast, the closed, hydrophobic conformation is largely inactive and the open conformation is active but provides fewer optimal interactions and induces shorter residence time and by inference releases Abeta peptides of longer lengths. Our simulations thus provide a molecular basis for substrate processing and changes in the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio. Accordingly, selective binding to protect the semiopen "innocent" conformation provides a molecular recipe for effective gamma-secretase modulators; we provide the full atomic structures for these states that may play a key role in developing selective gamma-secretase modulators for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
