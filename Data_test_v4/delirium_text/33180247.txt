33180247|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system characterised by cognitive impairment. Its major pathological feature is the deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide, which triggers a series of pathological cascades. Autophagy is a main pathway to eliminate abnormal aggregated proteins, and increasing autophagy represents a plausible treatment strategy against relative overproduction of neurotoxic Abeta. Graphene oxide (GO) is an emerging carbon-based nanomaterial. As a derivative of graphene with neuroprotective effects, it can effectively increase the clearance of abnormally aggregated protein. In this article, we investigated the protective function of GO in an AD mouse model. GO (30 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) was administered for 2 weeks. The results of the Morris water maze test and the novel object recognition test suggested that GO ameliorated learning and memory impairments in 5xFAD mice. The long-term potentiation and depotentiation from the perforant path to the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus were increased with GO treatment in 5xFAD mice. Furthermore, GO upregulated the expression of synapse-related proteins and increased the cell density in the hippocampus. Our results showed that GO up-regulated LC3II/LC3I and Beclin-1 and decreased p62 protein levels in 5xFAD mice. In addition, GO downregulated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway to induce autophagy. These results have revealed the protective potential of GO in AD.
