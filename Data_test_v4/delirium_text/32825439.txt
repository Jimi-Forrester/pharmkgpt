32825439|t|Hip Fracture Patients in Geriatric Rehabilitation Show Poor Nutritional Status, Dietary Intake and Muscle Health.
32825439|a|The aim of this study was to gain insight into the nutritional status, dietary intake and muscle health of older Dutch hip fracture patients to prevent recurrent fractures and to underpin rehabilitation programs. This cross-sectional study enrolled 40 hip fracture patients (mean +- SD age 82 +- 8.0 years) from geriatric rehabilitation wards of two nursing homes in the Netherlands. Assessments included nutritional status (Mini Nutritional Assessment), dietary intake on three non-consecutive days which were compared with Dietary Reference Intake values, and handgrip strength. Muscle mass was measured using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis and ultrasound scans of the rectus femoris. Malnutrition or risk of malnutrition was present in 73% of participants. Mean energy, protein, fibre and polyunsaturated fat intakes were significantly below the recommendations, while saturated fat was significantly above the UL. Protein intake was <0.8 in 46% and <1.2 g/(kg day) in 92%. Regarding micronutrients, mean intakes of calcium, vitamin D, potassium, magnesium and selenium were significantly below the recommendations. The prevalence of low muscle mass, low handgrip strength and sarcopenia were 35%, 27% and 10%, respectively. In conclusion, a poor nutritional status, dietary intake and muscle health are common in older hip fracture patients in geriatric rehabilitation wards.
