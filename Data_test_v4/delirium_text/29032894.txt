29032894|a|Hyperinsulinemia activates brain Akt and PKC-lambda/iota and increases Abeta1-40/42 and phospho-tau in insulin-resistant animals. Here, we examined underlying mechanisms in mice, neuronal cells, and mouse hippocampal slices. Like Abeta1-40/42, beta-secretase activity was increased in insulin-resistant mice and monkeys. In insulin-resistant mice, inhibition of hepatic PKC-lambda/iota sufficient to correct hepatic abnormalities and hyperinsulinemia simultaneously reversed increases in Akt, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), beta-secretase, and Abeta1-40/42, and restored acute Akt activation. However, 2 aPKC inhibitors additionally blocked insulin's ability to activate brain PKC-lambda/iota and thereby increase beta-secretase and Abeta1-40/42. Furthermore, direct blockade of brain aPKC simultaneously corrected an impairment in novel object recognition in high-fat-fed insulin-resistant mice. In neuronal cells and/or mouse hippocampal slices, PKC-iota/lambda activation by insulin, metformin, or expression of constitutive PKC-iota provoked increases in beta-secretase, Abeta1-40/42, and phospho-thr-231-tau that were blocked by various PKC-lambda/iota inhibitors, but not by an Akt inhibitor. PKC-lambda/iota provokes increases in brain beta-secretase, Abeta1-40/42, and phospho-thr-231-tau. Excessive signaling via PKC-lambda/iota may link hyperinsulinemia and other PKC-lambda/iota activators to pathological and functional abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease.
