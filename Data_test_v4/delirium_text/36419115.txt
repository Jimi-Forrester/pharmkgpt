36419115|a|Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has significantly improved the life expectancy for patients with refractory or relapse B cell lymphoma. As for B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), although the primary response rate is promising, the high incidence of early relapse has caused modest long-term survival with CAR-T cell alone. One of the main challenges is the limited persistence of CAR-T cells. To further optimize the clinical effects of CAR-T cells, many studies have focused on modifying the CAR structure and regulating CAR-T cell differentiation. In this review, we focus on CAR-T cell persistence and summarize the latest progress and strategies adopted during the in vitro culture stage to optimize CAR-T immunotherapy by improving long-term persistence. Such strategies include choosing a suitable cell source, improving culture conditions, combining CAR-T cells with conventional drugs, and applying genetic manipulations, all of which may improve the survival of patients with hematologic malignancies by reducing the probability of recurrence after CAR-T cell infusion and provide clues for solid tumor CAR-T cell therapy development.
