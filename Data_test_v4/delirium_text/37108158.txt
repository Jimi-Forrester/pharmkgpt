37108158|t|Early Steps towards Hearing: Placodes and Sensory Development.
37108158|a|Sensorineural hearing loss is the most prevalent sensory deficit in humans. Most cases of hearing loss are due to the degeneration of key structures of the sensory pathway in the cochlea, such as the sensory hair cells, the primary auditory neurons, and their synaptic connection to the hair cells. Different cell-based strategies to replace damaged inner ear neurosensory tissue aiming at the restoration of regeneration or functional recovery are currently the subject of intensive research. Most of these cell-based treatment approaches require experimental in vitro models that rely on a fine understanding of the earliest morphogenetic steps that underlie the in vivo development of the inner ear since its initial induction from a common otic-epibranchial territory. This knowledge will be applied to various proposed experimental cell replacement strategies to either address the feasibility or identify novel therapeutic options for sensorineural hearing loss. In this review, we describe how ear and epibranchial placode development can be recapitulated by focusing on the cellular transformations that occur as the inner ear is converted from a thickening of the surface ectoderm next to the hindbrain known as the otic placode to an otocyst embedded in the head mesenchyme. Finally, we will highlight otic and epibranchial placode development and morphogenetic events towards progenitors of the inner ear and their neurosensory cell derivatives.
