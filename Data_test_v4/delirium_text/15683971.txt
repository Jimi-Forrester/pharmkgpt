The aim of this article is to evaluate, in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the frequency of apathy and its relations with depressive symptoms and neuroanatomical correlates. We present the results of 3 French studies: the evaluation of behavioural symptoms in 499 AD subjects; the evaluation of depression and apathy in 128 AD subjects; a single photon computed tomography study (SPECT) performed in 31 AD subjects.
