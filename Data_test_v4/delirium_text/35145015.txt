35145015|t|Alzheimer Disease: Standard of Diagnosis, Treatment, Care, and Prevention.
35145015|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia in people 60 y old or older. This white paper summarizes the current standards of AD diagnosis, treatment, care, and prevention. Cerebrospinal fluid and PET measures of cerebral amyloidosis and tauopathy allow the diagnosis of AD even before dementia (prodromal stage) and provide endpoints for treatments aimed at slowing the AD course. Licensed pharmacologic symptomatic drugs enhance cholinergic pathways and moderate excess of glutamatergic transmission to stabilize cognition. Disease-modifying experimental drugs moderate or remove brain amyloidosis, but so far with modest clinical effects. Nonpharmacologic interventions and a healthy lifestyle (diet, socioaffective inclusion, cognitive stimulation, physical exercise, and others) provide some beneficial effects. Prevention targets mainly modifiable dementia risk factors such as unhealthy lifestyle, cardiovascular-metabolic and sleep-wake cycle abnormalities, and mental disorders. A major challenge for the future is telemonitoring in the real world of these modifiable risk factors.
