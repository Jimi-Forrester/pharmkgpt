37852968|t|The role of sphingosine-1-phosphate in autophagy and related disorders.
37852968|a|S1P, also referred to as sphingosine-1-phosphate, is a lipid molecule with bioactive properties involved in numerous cellular processes such as cell growth, movement, programmed cell death, self-degradation, cell specialization, aging, and immune system reactions. Autophagy is a meticulously controlled mechanism in which cells repurpose their elements to maintain cellular balance. There are five stages in autophagy: initiation, nucleation, elongation and maturation, fusion, and degradation. New research has provided insight into the complex connection between S1P and autophagy, uncovering their interaction in both normal and abnormal circumstances. Gaining knowledge about the regulatory mechanism of S1P signaling on autophagy can offer a valuable understanding of its function in well-being and illness, potentially leading to innovative therapeutic concepts for diverse ailments. Hence, this review analyzes the essential stages in mammalian autophagy, with a specific emphasis on recent research exploring the control of each stage by S1P. Additionally, it sheds light on the roles of S1P-induced autophagy in various disorders.
