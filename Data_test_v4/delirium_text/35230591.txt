35230591|t|Postcraniotomy Headache: Etiologies and Treatments.
35230591|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Postcraniotomy headache (PCH) is a highly underappreciated and very common adverse event following craniotomy. RECENT FINDINGS: Analgetic medication with opioids often interferes with neurologic evaluation in the acute phase of recovery and should be kept to a minimal, in general, in the treatment of chronic pain as well. We provide an update on the latest evidence for the management of acute and chronic PCH. Especially in the neurosurgical setting, enhanced recovery after surgery protocols need to include a special focus on pain control. Patients at risk of developing chronic pain must be identified and treated as early as possible.
