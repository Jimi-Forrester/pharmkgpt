32962281|t|The Role of microRNAs in Metabolic Syndrome-Related Oxidative Stress.
32962281|a|Oxidative stress (OxS) is the cause and the consequence of metabolic syndrome (MetS), the incidence and economic burden of which is increasing each year. OxS triggers the dysregulation of signaling pathways associated with metabolism and epigenetics, including microRNAs, which are biomarkers of metabolic disorders. In this review, we aimed to summarize the current knowledge regarding the interplay between microRNAs and OxS in MetS and its components. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar to summarize the most relevant studies. Collected data suggested that different sources of OxS (e.g., hyperglycemia, insulin resistance (IR), hyperlipidemia, obesity, proinflammatory cytokines) change the expression of numerous microRNAs in organs involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism and endothelium. Dysregulated microRNAs either directly or indirectly affect the expression and/or activity of molecules of antioxidative signaling pathways (SIRT1, FOXOs, Keap1/Nrf2) along with effector enzymes (e.g., GPx-1, SOD1/2, HO-1), ROS producers (e.g., NOX4/5), as well as genes of numerous signaling pathways connected with inflammation, insulin sensitivity, and lipid metabolism, thus promoting the progression of metabolic imbalance. MicroRNAs appear to be important epigenetic modifiers in managing the delicate redox balance, mediating either pro- or antioxidant biological impacts. Summarizing, microRNAs may be promising therapeutic targets in ameliorating the repercussions of OxS in MetS.
