25931747|t|Effect of early mobilization on discharge disposition of mechanically ventilated patients.
25931747|a|[Purpose] The purpose of this study was to clarify the benefits of early mobilization for mechanically ventilated patients for their survival to discharge to home from the hospital. [Subjects and Methods] Medical records were retrospectively analyzed of patients who satisfied the following criteria: age >= 18 years; performance status 0-2 and independent living at their home before admission; mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h; and survival after mechanical ventilation. Mechanically ventilated patients in the early mobilization (EM) group (n = 48) received mobilization therapy, limb exercise and chest physiotherapy, whereas those in the control group (n = 60) received bed rest alone. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify clinical variables associated with discharge disposition. [Results] Early mobilization was a positive independent factor and the presence of neurological deficits was a negative factor contributing to discharge to home. Among patients surviving mechanical ventilation without neurological deficits, the rate of discharge to home was significantly higher among patients in the EM group that in the control group (76% vs. 40%). [Conclusion] Early mobilization can improve the rate of discharge to home of patients requiring mechanical ventilation because of non-neurological deficits.
