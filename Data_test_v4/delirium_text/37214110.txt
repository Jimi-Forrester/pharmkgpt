37214110|t|Prevalence of Frailty in ICU and its Impact on Patients' Outcomes.
37214110|a|Introduction: Frailty describes a state or syndrome of reduced physical, physiologic, and cognitive reserve that increases vulnerability to acute illness. To study the prevalence of frailty in critically ill patients and find its association with resource utilization and short-term intensive care unit (ICU) outcomes. Material and methods: This was a prospective observational study. All adult patients >=50 years admitted to the ICU were included and frailty was assessed by the clinical frailty score (CFS). Data were collected on demography, coexisting illness, CFS, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE-II), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score (SOFA) scores. Patients were followed for 30 days. Outcome data were collected on organ supports provided, duration of ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), and ICU and 30-day mortality. Results: 137 patients were enrolled in the study. The prevalence of frailty was 38.6%. Frail patients were older and had a more comorbid illness. APACHE-II and SOFA scores were 22.1 +- 7.0 and 7.2 +- 3.29, significantly higher in frail patients, respectively. There was a trend towards higher requirement for organ supports in frail patients. Median ICU and hospital LOS were 8 vs 6 and 20 vs 12 (frail vs nonfrail) days, respectively (p < 0.05). Intensive care unit mortality in frail and nonfrail patients was 28.3% and 23.8%, respectively (p = 0.56). Thirty-day mortality in frail patients was 49%, significantly higher compared with nonfrail patients (28.5%). Conclusion: The prevalence of frailty in ICU patients was high. Frail patients were quite ill on ICU admission, and they had a prolonged ICU and hospital LOS. Increasing frailty score was associated with higher mortality at 30 days.
