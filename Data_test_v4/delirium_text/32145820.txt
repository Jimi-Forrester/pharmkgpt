32145820|t|A 62-Year-Old Woman With Diffuse Myalgias, Fatigue, and Shortness of Breath.
32145820|a|CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old woman with a history of partially treated Graves disease and hypertension presented with approximately 3 weeks of worsening fatigue, lower extremity myalgias, and shortness of breath. Her medical history included a thyroid radiofrequency ablation several years earlier. Following the ablation, she was found to have some residual thyroid activity, negating the need for therapy. She was lost to follow-up after months of normal thyroid-stimulating hormone values. On this presentation, the patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate, and although she presented alert and oriented initially, she developed progressive inattentiveness and confusion while in the ED. The patient was transferred to the medical ICU for further management of her rapid heart rate and progressive delirium.
