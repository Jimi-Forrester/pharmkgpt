39449010|t|Assessing emergency physicians' competency gaps in caring for acute psychiatric emergencies: a comparative analysis of self-perceived confidence and performance against training program expectations.
39449010|a|BACKGROUND: The increasing trend of patients with mental health conditions seeking emergency care is a global phenomenon. Numerous studies have emphasized the importance of emergency physicians' ability to recognize and manage psychiatric emergencies, both for patient well-being and societal safety nets. With the growing demand for emergency care related to mental health conditions, it is crucial to assess whether emergency physicians possess sufficient confidence and capabilities to adapt to these changes. Against this backdrop, our study aimed to explore the factors influencing emergency physicians' management of acute psychiatric emergencies and to critically evaluate whether current training programs adequately align with societal expectations for psychiatric emergency care. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey, disseminated online by the Taiwan Society of Emergency Medicine, targeted 936 attending physicians and 449 residents in 43 Resident Review Committee approved training hospitals in winter 2021. The questionnaire covered participant demographics, skill requirements, and confidence in managing acute psychiatric patients independently. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, medians (IQRs), and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. RESULTS: Out of 229 participants, 63.8% were attending physicians, and 81.7% were affiliated with medical centers. Psychiatrists led 69.9% of emergency psychiatric training curricula, and 66.8% reported that their clinical psychiatric training outcomes were assessed by psychiatrists. Clinical seniority, training hospital level, and the average number of patients with an acute psychiatric presentation seen in a daily shift influenced physicians' self-reported confidence in managing acute psychiatric patients independently. Medical center training improved capability in managing psychiatric emergencies in the elderly, while encountering a higher average number of patients with an acute psychiatric presentation seen in a daily EM shift was associated with better performance, especially in managing specific populations. CONCLUSIONS: Our nationwide study highlights how clinical seniority, training hospital level, and patient volume per shift influence emergency physicians' confidence in managing acute psychiatric patients. However, there remains room for improvement, particularly in addressing the needs of specific patient populations. These findings underscore the importance of refining training curricula to bridge these gaps and enhance the quality of psychiatric emergency patient care.
