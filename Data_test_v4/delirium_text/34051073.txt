34051073|a|This study aimed to identify long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) involving in the skeletal muscle aging process. Skeletal muscle samples from old and young subjects were collected for lncRNA-sequencing. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and DElncRNAs between young and old groups were identified and a co-expression network was built. Further, a dexamethasone-induced muscle atrophy cell model was established to characterize the function of a critical lncRNA. A total of 424 DEGs, including 271 upregulated genes and 153 downregulated genes as well as 152 DElncRNAs including 76 up-regulated and 76 down-regulated lncRNAs were obtained. Functional analysis demonstrated that the DEGs were significantly related to immune response. Coexpression network demonstrated lncRNA AC004797.1, PRKG1-AS1 and GRPC5D-AS1 were crucial lncRNAs. Their expressions were further validated by qRT-PCR in human skeletal muscle and the muscle atrophy cell model. Further in vitro analysis suggested that knock-down of PRKG1-AS1 could significantly increase cell viability and decrease cell apoptosis. qRT-PCR and western blot analyses demonstrated that knock-down of PRKG1-AS1 could increase the expression of MyoD, MyoG and Mef2c. This study demonstrated that lncRNAs of GPRC5D-AS1, AC004797.1 and PRKG1-AS1 might involve the aging-associated disease processes.
