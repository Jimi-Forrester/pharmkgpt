33066147|t|Pyrene Excimer-Based Fluorescent Labeling of Cysteines Brought into Close Proximity by Protein Dynamics: ASEM-Induced Thiol-Ene Click Reaction for High Spatial Resolution CLEM.
33066147|a|Fluorescence microscopy (FM) has revealed vital molecular mechanisms of life. Mainly, molecules labeled by fluorescent probes are imaged. However, the diversity of labeling probes and their functions remain limited. We synthesized a pyrene-based fluorescent probe targeting SH groups, which are important for protein folding and oxidative stress sensing in cells. The labeling achieved employs thiol-ene click reactions between the probes and SH groups and is triggered by irradiation by UV light or an electron beam. When two tagged pyrene groups were close enough to be excited as a dimer (excimer), they showed red-shifted fluorescence; theoretically, the proximity of two SH residues within ~30 A can thus be monitored. Moreover, correlative light/electron microscopy (CLEM) was achieved using our atmospheric scanning electron microscope (ASEM); radicals formed in liquid by the electron beam caused the thiol-ene click reactions, and excimer fluorescence of the labeled proteins in cells and tissues was visualized by FM. Since the fluorescent labeling is induced by a narrow electron beam, high spatial resolution labeling is expected. The method can be widely applied to biological fields, for example, to study protein dynamics with or without cysteine mutagenesis, and to beam-induced micro-fabrication and the precise post-modification of materials.
