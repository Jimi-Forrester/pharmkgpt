35405261|t|The Cure VCP Scientific Conference 2021: Molecular and clinical insights into neurodegeneration and myopathy linked to multisystem proteinopathy-1 (MSP-1).
35405261|a|The 2021 VCP Scientific Conference took place virtually from September 9-10, 2021. This conference, planned and organized by the nonprofit patient advocacy group Cure VCP Disease, Inc. (https://www.curevcp.org), was the first VCP focused meeting since the 215th ENMC International Workshop VCP-related multi-system proteinopathy in 2016 (Evangelista et al., 2016). Mutations in VCP cause a complex and heterogenous disease termed inclusion body myopathy (IBM) with Paget's disease of the bone (PDB) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (IBMPFD), or multisystem proteinopathy 1 (MSP-1) Kimonis (n.d.), Kovach et al. (2001), Kimonis et al. (2000). In addition, VCP mutations also cause other age-related neurodegenerative disorders including amyptrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinsonism, Charcot-Marie type II-B, vacuolar tauopathy among others (Korb et al., 2022). The objectives of this conference were as follows: (1) to provide a forum that facilitates sharing of published and unpublished information on physiological roles of p97/VCP, and on how mutations of VCP lead to diseases; (2) to bolster understanding of mechanisms involved in p97/VCP-relevant diseases and to enable identification of therapeutics to treat these conditions; (3) to identify gaps and barriers of further discoveries and translational research in the p97/VCP field; (4) to set a concrete basic and translational research agenda for future studies including crucial discussions on biomarker discoveries and patient longitudinal studies to facilitate near-term clinical trials; (5) to accelerate cross-disciplinary research collaborations among p97/VCP researchers; (6) to enable attendees to learn about new tools and reagents with the potential to facilitate p97/VCP research; (7) to assist trainees in propelling their research and to foster mentorship from leaders in the field; and (8) to promote diversity and inclusion of under-represented minorities in p97/VCP research as diversity is critically important for strong scientific research. Given the range of topics, the VCP Scientific Conference brought together over one hundred and forty individuals representing a diverse group of research scientists, trainees, medical practitioners, industry representatives, and patient advocates. Twenty-five institutions with individuals from thirteen countries attended this virtual meeting. In this report, we summarize the major topics presented at this conference by a range of experts.
