39213065|t|A Comparison of an Australian Observational Longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Cohort to Community-Based Australian Data.
39213065|a|Background: Observational Alzheimer's disease (AD) cohorts including the Australian, Biomarkers, Imaging and Lifestyle (AIBL) Study have enhanced our understanding of AD. The generalizability of findings from AIBL to the general population has yet to be studied. Objective: We aimed to compare characteristics of people with AD dementia in AIBL to 1) the general population of older Australians using pharmacological treatment for AD dementia, and to 2) the general population of older Australians who self-reported a diagnosis of dementia. Methods: Descriptive study comparing people aged 65 years of over (1) in AIBL that had a diagnosis of AD dementia, (2) dispensed with pharmacological treatment for AD in Australia in 2021 linked to the Australian census in 2021 (refer to as PBS/census), (3) self-reported a diagnosis of dementia in the 2021 Australian census (refer to as dementia/census). Baseline characteristics included age, sex, highest education attainment, primary language, and medical co-morbidities. Results: Participants in AIBL were younger, had more years of education, and had a lower culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) population compared to the PBS/census cohort and dementia/census cohort (mean age+-standard deviation - AIBL 79+-7 years, PBS/census 81+-7, p < 0.001, dementia/census 83+-8, p < 0.001; greater than 12 years of education AIBL 40%, PBS/census 35%, p = 0.020, dementia/census 29%, p < 0.001; CALD - AIBL 3%, PBS/census 20%, p < 0.001, dementia/census 22%, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that care should be taken regarding the generalizability of AIBL in CALD populations and the interpretation of results on the natural history of AD.
