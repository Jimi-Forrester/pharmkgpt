36425946|t|Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Delirium: A Double-blind, Randomized, Sham-controlled, Pilot Study.
36425946|a|Introduction: Delirium is a fatal but potentially reversible disorder of the central nervous system that imposes high costs on health systems. This study aims to evaluate the effect of intermittent theta-burst stimulation on the severity and course of delirium disorder. Methods: This is a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled pilot study. The study participants were randomly allocated into the active (active intermittent theta-burst stimulation) and sham groups. The severity of delirium was assessed 15 minutes before the intervention and 15 minutes after that by the Neelon and Champagne (NEECHAM) confusion scale. Results: In the active group, total and subscale scores of NEECHAM significantly decreased after intervention (P<0.05). Although no statistical difference was found in the control group regarding the subscale scores of NEECHAM, the difference in the total scores before and after the sham intervention was statistically significant. Conclusion: Carrying one session of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex can reduce the delirium severity in a short period, although it will not decrease the number of delirium cases three days after the intervention. Highlights: Delirium is a CNS disorder;Delirium treatment is based on pharmacological and non-pharmacological;rTMS is quasi-modern treatment of neurocognitive disorders. Plain Language Summary: Delirium is fatal but reversible disorder. regarding the restrictions of routine treatments of delirium and by considering the cognition disturbances as the core symptom of delirium, and the positive effect of rTMS on cognition functions. we hypothesized that rTMS could be effective in the treatment of delirium.
