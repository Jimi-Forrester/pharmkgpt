29095078|a|The Alberta Prion Research Institute, part of Alberta Innovates Bio Solutions, is proud to host the world's largest international prion research congress, PRION 2013: Conquering Frontiers, in Banff, Alberta, Canada from May 26-29, 2013. PRION 2013 will be only the second time this international meeting has been held outside of Europe since it began in 2004. The PRION 2013 International Scientific Advisory Committee includes leading international scholars and policy advisors in both human and animal protein misfolding research from 12 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, England, France, Germany, Japan, The Netherlands, Scotland, Spain and the United States. Prion and protein misfolding science can inform policy, risk management and mitigation, diagnoses and potential treatments in a range of areas from wildlife management to human dementias and neurodegenerative diseases. Compelling evidence is emerging that prion-like mechanisms may underlie a number of the human neurodegenerative diseases and dementias, providing the opportunity to seek out new treatments and for the cross-fertilization of ideas between the two related fields. This approach will be highlighted at PRION 2013. The theme of PRION 2013 is "Conquering Frontiers." It will be a continuation of the science covered in previous meetings with an emphasis on looking toward investigations in the new frontiers created by the relationships between prion diseases and human neurodegenerative diseases and dementias. The four-day session features scientific talks, workshops and posters on the following themes: Prion and Prion-like Diseases in Humans; Prion Diseases in Animals; Protein Structure and Biology; and Socioeconomic Impacts. The knowledge exchange that will take place at PRION 2013 will help to shape the future of prion and protein misfolding research and its application around the world.
