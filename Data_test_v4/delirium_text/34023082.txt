34023082|t|Review of Pharmacologic Sleep Agents for Critically Ill Patients.
34023082|a|Sleep is a dynamic restorative process that is frequently disrupted in critically ill patients. Inadequate sleep can contribute to delirium and impaired healing. The etiology is multifactorial and practitioners often use a combination of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies to promote a healthy sleep cycle. There are many pharmacologic agents that may be used to promote sleep, and they display varying degrees of efficacy and safety. The selection of agent(s) should be based on patient- and disease-specific factors. All members of the treatment team can aid in assessing and optimizing sleep for critically ill patients.
