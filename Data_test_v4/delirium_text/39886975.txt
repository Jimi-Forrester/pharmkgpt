39886975|t|Pin1 as a central node in oncogenic signaling: Mechanistic insights and clinical prospects (Review).
39886975|a|Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (Pin1) is a specific phosphorylated serine/threonine-proline cis-trans isomerase, which is involved in the regulation of a variety of physiological and pathological processes, including cell cycle progression, proliferation and apoptosis. Pin1 plays a key role in tumorigenesis and tumor development and it promotes the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells by regulating the cell cycle, signaling pathways and the function of tumor suppressors. Upregulated expression of Pin1 is closely associated with a poor prognosis in several types of cancers. Thus, Pin1 is may have potential as a novel potential biomarker for tumor diagnosis and prognosis, as well as a promising anticancer target. The aim of the present review was to discuss the mechanism of Pin1 in tumors and recent research progress in this field.
