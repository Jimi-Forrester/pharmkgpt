34237489|a|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a simple delirium-predicting scoring system in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery by incorporating preoperative risk factors and intraoperative surgical Apgar score (SAS). DESIGN: Observational retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A tertiary general hospital in China. PATIENTS: 1055 patients who received major abdominal surgery from January 2015 to December 2019. MEASUREMENTS: We collected data on preoperative and intraoperative variables, and postoperative delirium. A risk scoring system for postoperative delirium in patients after major open abdominal surgery was developed and validated based on traditional logistic regression model. The elastic net algorithm was further developed and evaluated. MAIN RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative delirium was 17.8% (188/1055) in these patients. They were randomly divided into the development (n = 713) and validation (n = 342) cohorts. Both the logistic regression model and the elastic net regression model identified that advanced age, arrythmia, hypoalbuminemia, coagulation dysfunction, mental illness or cognitive impairments and low surgical Apgar score are related with increased risk of postoperative delirium. The elastic net algorithm has an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.842 and 0.822 in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. A prognostic score was calculated using the following formula: Prognostic score = Age classification (0 to 3 points) + arrythmia + 2 * hypoalbuminemia + 2 * coagulation dysfunction + 4 * mental illness or cognitive impairments + (10-surgical Apgar score). The 22-point risk scoring system had good discrimination and calibration with an AUROC of 0.823 and 0.834, and a non-significant Hosmer-Lemeshow test P = 0.317 and P = 0.853 in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. The bootstrapping internal verification method (R = 1000) yielded a C-index of 0.822 (95% CI: 0.759-0.857). CONCLUSION: The prognostic scoring system, which used both preoperative risk factors and surgical Apgar score, serves as a good first step toward a clinically useful predictive model for postoperative delirium in patients undergoing major open abdominal surgery.
