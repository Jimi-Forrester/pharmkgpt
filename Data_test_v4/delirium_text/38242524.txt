38242524|a|Mesenchymal stem cells therapy provides a new perspective of therapeutic approaches in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of intranasally transplanted human "olfactory ecto-mesenchymal stem cells" (OE-MSCs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) rats. In this study, we isolated OE-MSCs from human olfactory lamina propria and phenotypically characterized them using immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry. The undifferentiated OE-MSCs were transplanted either by intranasal (IN) or intrahippocampal (IH) injection to rat models of AD, which were induced by injecting amyloid-beta (Abeta) intrahippocampally. Behavioral, histological, and molecular assessments were performed after a three-month recovery period. Based on the results, intranasal administration of OE-MSCs significantly reduced Abeta accumulation and neuronal loss, improved learning and memory impairments, and increased levels of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and NMDAR (N-methyl-D-Aspartate receptors) in the AD rat model. These changes were more significant in animals who received OE-MSCs by intranasal injection. The results of this study suggest that OE-MSCs have the potential to enhance cognitive function in AD, possibly mediated by BDNF and the NMDA receptors.
