37215485|t|Mapping a network for tics in Tourette syndrome using causal lesions and structural alterations.
37215485|a|Tics are sudden stereotyped movements or vocalizations. Cases of lesion-induced tics are invaluable, allowing for causal links between symptoms and brain structures. While a lesion network for tics has recently been identified, the degree to which this network translates to Tourette syndrome has not been fully elucidated. This is important given that patients with Tourette syndrome make up a large portion of tic cases; therefore, existing and future treatments should apply to these patients. The aim of this study was to first localize a causal network for tics from lesion-induced cases and then refine and validate this network in patients with Tourette syndrome. We independently performed 'lesion network mapping' using a large normative functional connectome (n = 1000) to isolate a brain network commonly connected to lesions causing tics (n = 19) identified through a systematic search. The specificity of this network to tics was assessed through comparison to lesions causing other movement disorders. Using structural brain coordinates from prior neuroimaging studies (n = 7), we then derived a neural network for Tourette syndrome. This was done using standard anatomical likelihood estimation meta-analysis and a novel method termed 'coordinate network mapping', which uses the same coordinates, yet maps their connectivity using the aforementioned functional connectome. Conjunction analysis was used to refine the network for lesion-induced tics to Tourette syndrome by identifying regions common to both lesion and structural networks. We then tested whether connectivity from this common network is abnormal in a separate resting-state functional connectivity MRI data set from idiopathic Tourette syndrome patients (n = 21) and healthy controls (n = 25). Results showed that lesions causing tics were distributed throughout the brain; however, consistent with a recent study, these were part of a common network with predominant basal ganglia connectivity. Using conjunction analysis, coordinate network mapping findings refined the lesion network to the posterior putamen, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus externus (positive connectivity) and precuneus (negative connectivity). Functional connectivity from this positive network to frontal and cingulate regions was abnormal in patients with idiopathic Tourette syndrome. These findings identify a network derived from lesion-induced and idiopathic data, providing insight into the pathophysiology of tics in Tourette syndrome. Connectivity to our cortical cluster in the precuneus offers an exciting opportunity for non-invasive brain stimulation protocols.
