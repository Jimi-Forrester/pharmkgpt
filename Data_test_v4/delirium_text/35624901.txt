35624901|t|Neuropsychiatric Disorders in Pediatric Long COVID-19: A Case Series.
35624901|a|Few data are available regarding the incidence and the evolution of neuropsychiatric manifestations in children with a history of COVID-19. We herein report five consequent cases of pediatric patients with psychiatric and neurological symptoms of long COVID-19. All patients, mainly males, reported asymptomatic-to-mild COVID-19 and underwent home self-isolation. Abnormal movements, anxiety, and emotional dysregulation were the most recurrent symptoms observed from a few weeks to months after the resolution of the acute infection. A later onset was observed in younger patients. Blood tests and brain imaging resulted in negative results in all subjects; pharmacological and cognitive behavioral therapy was set. A multifactorial etiology could be hypothesized in these cases, as a result of a complex interplay between systemic and brain inflammation and environmental stress in vulnerable individuals. Longer follow-up is required to observe the evolution of neuropsychiatric manifestation in the present cohort and other young patients with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.
