20690129|a|OBJECTIVE: Multiple versions of the Boston Naming Test (BNT) exist, which makes comparison of findings from different studies difficult. The current project sought to determine if estimated 60-item BNT scores could be reliably calculated from 30- and 15-item administrations with patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Estimated 60-item scores were created for 30-item (even and odd) and 15-item Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease (CERAD) versions of the BNT from a database containing item-level responses for all BNT items. Correlations were conducted between all three estimated 60-item scores and full 60-item version scores administered to all participants in the sample. RESULTS: The estimated versions were all highly correlated with the standard 60-item version of the BNT across the sample and these findings held when the sample was separated out by case (AD) and control status. Mean difference scores were very small for scores estimated from 30-item administrations; however, difference scores for the 15-item CERAD were much larger. CONCLUSIONS: Estimated 60-item versions of the BNT can be created from 30-item BNT administrations, which will enable comparisons across studies and allow integration of data from various AD research groups for increased power in analytic protocols. Creation of an estimated score from the 15-item CERAD version is not warranted.
