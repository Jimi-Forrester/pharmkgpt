38049442|a|Femoral neck fracture is a common osteoporotic fracture in elderly patients and is effectively managed with arthroplasty. However, the benefits and risks of a surgical drain after arthroplasty in these patients are still debatable. Hence, we conducted this study to investigate the necessity of a surgical drain after hemiarthroplasty in elderly patients with femoral neck fracture. This study enrolled elderly patients (aged >= 70 years) who underwent cementless bipolar hemiarthroplasty for femoral neck fracture between April 2016 and December 2021. The patients were divided into two groups; the control group (199 patients) with a surgical drain after surgery performed between April 2016 and June 2020 and the study group (134 patients) with no surgical drain between July 2020 and December 2021. The demographics, perioperative data, and postoperative complications were compared between the two groups. Estimated blood loss, perioperative transfusion volume and rate, and length of hospital stay were significantly lower in the study group than in the control group (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.008, and p < 0.001, respectively). Although there were no significant intergroup differences in the length of intensive care unit stay and in-hospital, 1-month, and 1-year mortalities, the incidence of postoperative medical complications was significantly lower in the study group than the control group (p = 0.001). A surgical drain may be unnecessary after hemiarthroplasty in elderly patients with femoral neck fracture considering less blood loss and transfusion, lower incidence of postoperative medical complications, and shorter hospital stay in the study group with no surgical drain.
