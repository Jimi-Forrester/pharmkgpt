38974398|t|Relationship Between Sleep Quality and Quality of Life: Analysis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Survivors.
38974398|a|BACKGROUND:  We analyzed the correlation between the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) subcategories (sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, sleep medications, and daytime dysfunction) and a comprehensive measure of quality of life (QOL), the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) items, in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to determine the components that require intervention to improve QOL. METHODS: A total of 75 patients with recurrent HCC admitted to our hospital between May 2021 and May 2023 were included in this study. The QOL score was used for the SF-36 items, and the sleep disorder score was used for PSQI questionnaires. RESULTS: Correlations were found between sleep quality, sleep disturbance, and SF-36 for all QOL items and between sleep onset time and SF-36 for six QOL items: bodily pain, mental health, physical functioning, role-emotional, role-physical, and vitality. Correlations between daytime dysfunction and SF-36 were found for all QOL items, except for physical functioning. No correlation was found between sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep medications, and SF-36 for any QOL item. CONCLUSION: Sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and sleep medications may not contribute to QOL improvement in patients with HCC and sleep disturbances. Factors that improve sleep quality and sleep difficulty may contribute to QOL improvement. Therapeutic interventions aimed at improving general health and social functioning for sleep latency and physical functioning for daytime arousal difficulty are required.
