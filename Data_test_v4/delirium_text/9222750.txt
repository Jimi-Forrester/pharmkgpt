9222750|a|The concentration of malonaldehyde (MDA) was measured in human erythrocytes obtained from subjects suffering from senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT), non-demented elderly subjects, and from young controls by two methods: high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) test. The MDA concentration measured by HPLC showed significant differences between SDAT and young control groups (p < 0.01) and between SDAT and non-demented elderly groups (p < 0.01), respectively. Nevertheless, significant differences were not exhibited between young control and non-demented elderly. Moreover, the rate of accumulation of TBA-reactive substances was not significantly different among the three groups. Our results indicate that the HPLC method is highly specific and accurate and distinguishes between true MDA and other aldehydes that may react with TBA. Significant increases in the concentration of MDA of SDAT subjects were found in comparison with the two other groups, indicating that the measurement of MDA in erythrocytes could be used as a marker of oxidative damage in Alzheimer's disease.
