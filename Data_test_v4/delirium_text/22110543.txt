22110543|t|Genetic Association of NPY Gene Polymorphisms with Dampness-Phlegm Pattern in Korean Stroke Patients.
22110543|a|Neuropeptide Y (NPY), which is widely expressed in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, has an important role in a variety of biological fields. In this study, we analyzed the distribution of NPY polymorphisms in dampness-phlegm pattern and non-dampness-phlegm pattern in elderly Korean subjects with cerebral infarction (CI). A total of 1.097 subjects (498 normal subjects and 599 CI patients, including 198 with dampness-phlegm pattern and 401 with non-dampness-phlegm pattern) participated in this study. Genotyping for five SNPs (G-1484A, C-1471T, C-399T, A1201G, and C5325T) was conducted by primer extension. The results were statistically analyzed for genetic association of NPY-polymorphisms with normal versus dampness-phlegm pattern or non-dampness-phlegm pattern subjects. Among the five SNPs tested, the T allele of C-399T has a negative association with the dampness-phlegm pattern and is marked by a decrease in serum cholesterol levels. Furthermore, serum cholesterol levels were significantly higher in dampness-phlegm pattern patients than in non-dampness-phlegm pattern patients.In this study, for the first time, the association of NPY polymorphisms with pattern identification (PI) of traditional Korean medicine (TKM) was analyzed in a large CI patient population.
