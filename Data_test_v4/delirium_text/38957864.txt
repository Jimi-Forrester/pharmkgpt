38957864|t|Neuroimaging biomarkers for predicting stroke outcomes: A systematic review.
38957864|a|Background and Aims: Stroke is a prominent cause of long-term adult impairment globally and a significant global health issue. Only 14% of stroke survivors achieve full recovery, while 25% to 50% require varying degrees of support, and over half become dependent. The aftermath of a stroke brings profound changes to an individual's life, with early choices significantly impacting their quality of life. This review aims to establish the efficacy of neuroimaging data in predicting long-term outcomes and recovery rates following a stroke. Methods: A scientific literature search was conducted using the Centre of Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) criteria and PRISMA guidelines for a combined meta-narrative and systematic quantitative review. The methodology involved a structured search in databases like PubMed and The Cochrane Library, following inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify relevant studies on neuroimaging biomarkers for stroke outcome prediction. Data collection utilized the Microsoft Edge Zotero plugin, with quality appraisal conducted via the CASP checklist. Studies published from 2010 to 2024, including observational, randomized control trials, case reports, and clinical trials. Non-English and incomplete studies were excluded, resulting in the identification of 11 pertinent articles. Data extraction emphasized study methodologies, stroke conditions, clinical parameters, and biomarkers, aiming to provide a thorough literature overview and evaluate the significance of neuroimaging biomarkers in predicting stroke recovery outcomes. Results: The results of this systematic review indicate that integrating advanced neuroimaging methods with highly successful reperfusion therapies following a stroke facilitates the diagnosis of the condition and assists in improving neurological impairments resulting from stroke. These measures reduce the possibility of death and improve the treatment provided to stroke patients. Conclusion: These findings highlight the crucial role of neuroimaging in advancing our understanding of post-stroke outcomes and improving patient care.
