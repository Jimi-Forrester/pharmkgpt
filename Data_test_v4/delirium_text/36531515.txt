36531515|t|Association of Obesity with Cognitive Impairment and Depression among Oldest Old Population having Frailty syndrome.
36531515|a|Objectives: The objectives were to estimate prevalence of obesity among frail individuals aged >=80 years and examine the association of obesity with cognitive impairment and depression among frail individuals aged >=80 years. Methods: Two-hundred community-dwelling participants aged >=80 years, were enrolled; 166 frail participants were further analyzed. Obesity and adiposity were determined by Body Mass Index (BMI), Waist Circumference (WC) and Body Fat Percentage (BF%). Cognitive impairment and Depression were assessed using Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). Frailty was assessed by Fried criteria. Chi-Square, t-test, trend-analysis and Logistic Regression (LR) were done. Results: Obesity among Frail individuals aged >=80 years was 40% using BMI and 73.2% using WC. Obesity was inversely associated with cognitive impairment and depression among frail individuals. Severity of cognitive impairment and depression was lower among obese frail than non-obese frail. Trend-analysis showed decreasing cognitive impairment and depression with increasing BF%. On LR, obesity among frail individuals had inverse association with cognitive impairment and depression. Conclusion: Obesity among frail individuals aged >=80 years was associated with lower odds of cognitive impairment and depression in our population. Positive effects of weight gain in oldest old frail individuals and development of cognitive impairment and dementia should be explored in further researches.
