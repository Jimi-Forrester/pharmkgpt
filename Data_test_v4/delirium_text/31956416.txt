31956416|a|BACKGROUND: Studies showed potential benefits of recombinant human-soluble thrombomodulin (rhTM) and antithrombin for treating sepsis associated disseminated intravascular coagulation. However, benefits of their combination have been inconclusive. METHODS: Using a nationwide inpatient database in Japan, we performed propensity-score matched analyses to compare outcomes between rhTM combined with antithrombin and rhTM alone for severe community-acquired pneumonia associated disseminated intravascular coagulation from July 2010 to March 2015. The outcomes included in-hospital mortality and requirement of red cell transfusion. RESULTS: Propensity score matching created 189 pairs of patients who received rhTM combined with antithrombin or rhTM alone within 2 days of admission. There was no significant difference between the two groups for in-hospital mortality (40.2% vs. 45.5%). Patients treated with rhTM and antithrombin were more likely to require red cell transfusion than those treated with rhTM alone (37.0% vs. 25.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with rhTM alone, combination of rhTM with antithrombin for severe community-acquired pneumonia-associated disseminated intravascular coagulation may be ineffective for reducing mortality and may increase bleeding.
