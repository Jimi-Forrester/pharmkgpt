29722962|a|Current molecular hypotheses have not yet delivered marketable treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD), arguably due to a lack of understanding of AD biology and an overreliance on conventional drug modalities. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are emerging drug targets, which show promise for the treatment of, e.g., cancer, but are still underexploited for treating neurodegenerative diseases. 14-3-3 binding to phosphorylated Tau is a promising PPI drug target based on its reported destabilizing effect on microtubules, leading to enhanced neurofibrillary tangle formation as a potential cause of AD-related neurodegeneration. Inhibition of 14-3-3/Tau may therefore be neuroprotective. Previously, we reported the structure-guided development of modified peptide inhibitors of 14-3-3/Tau. Here, we report further efforts to optimize the binding mode and activity of our modified Tau peptides through a combination of chemical synthesis, biochemical assays, and X-ray crystallography. Most notably, we were able to characterize two different high-affinity binding modes, both of which inhibited 14-3-3-binding to full-length PKA-phosphorylated Tau protein in vitro as measured by NMR spectroscopy. Our findings, besides producing useful tool inhibitor compounds for studying 14-3-3/Tau, have enhanced our understanding of the molecular parameters for inhibiting 14-3-3/Tau, which are important milestones toward the establishment of our 14-3-3 PPI hypothesis.
