3213321|a|Clinical and epidemiological investigations of mentally ill patients in old and new cities of northern Tyumen Province have revealed a substantial and peculiar impact of demographic dynamics on the indices of hospital dynamics. Thus, the schizophrenia morbidity appeared more than threefold lower in fast-developing cities (Nizhnevartovsk, Surgut, Nefteiugansk) compared to the old ones (Tobolsk, Tyumen). In the former group of cities, the attack form of the disease prevailed. Characteristically, environmental factors played major role in the onset of the disease. The patients were highly adapted in social terms. Alcoholism turned malignant with adaptation disorders progressing rapidly and involving a peculiar type of anosognosia. Alcoholic delirium took shape on the background of an "incomplete" clinical picture of predisposing alcoholism. Adaptation disorders preceded the delirium in which psychotic disorders were colored psycho-organically.
