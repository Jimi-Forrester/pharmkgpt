34829881|t|The Emerging Roles of Autophagy in Human Diseases.
34829881|a|Autophagy, a process of cellular self-digestion, delivers intracellular components including superfluous and dysfunctional proteins and organelles to the lysosome for degradation and recycling and is important to maintain cellular homeostasis. In recent decades, autophagy has been found to help fight against a variety of human diseases, but, at the same time, autophagy can also promote the procession of certain pathologies, which makes the connection between autophagy and diseases complex but interesting. In this review, we summarize the advances in understanding the roles of autophagy in human diseases and the therapeutic methods targeting autophagy and discuss some of the remaining questions in this field, focusing on cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, infectious diseases and metabolic disorders.
