34434387|t|Anesthetic Management of an Asian Pediatric Patient With Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome for Dental Surgery.
34434387|a|Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a rare genetic disorder that is associated with dysmorphism, moderate to severe intellectual disability and abnormalities involving multiple organ systems. For anesthetists, these patients pose unique challenges in the administration of anesthesia and airway management. We describe the anesthetic conduct of a pediatric patient with RTS coming for dental surgery as a day surgery case and will discuss the anesthetic considerations for such patients.
