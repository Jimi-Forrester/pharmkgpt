36983204|t|Gender-Related Discrepancies in Short-Term Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Surgery.
36983204|a|The sex differences in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) surgery are still unclear. Our aim was to investigate the impact of gender on short-term outcomes in males and females after off-pump bypass procedures. Our research was designed as a double-center retrospective analysis. Generally, 343 patients (men (n = 255) and women (n = 88)) who underwent an OPCAB procedure were included in our study. To provide a statistical analysis of unequal cohorts, we created a propensity score-based matching (PSM) analysis (men, n = 61; women, n = 61). The primary endpoint was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Dialysis, transient ischemic attack (TIA), low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), reoperation due to postoperative bleeding, wound infection and duration of hospital stay were secondary outcomes in our analysis. No significant differences were detected within the male and female groups regarding age (p = 0.116), BMI (p = 0.221), diabetes (p = 0.853), cardiogenic shock (0.256), STEMI (p = 0.283), NSTEMI (p = 0.555) and dialysis (p = 0.496). Males underwent significantly more frequently (p = 0.005) total-arterial revascularization with T-graft technique (p = 0.005) than females. In contrast, temporary pacer use was significantly higher (p = 0.022) in females compared to males. The in-hospital mortality rate was not significantly higher (p = 0.496) in the female group compared to the male group. Likewise, secondary outcomes did not differ significantly between the non-adjusted and the adjusted groups. Based on our findings, gender has no impact on short-term outcomes after OPCAB surgery.
