37181848|t|Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in pregnancy and puerperium: A comprehensive review.
37181848|a|Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a distinct neurological emergency caused by occlusion, either partial or complete, of the dural venous sinus and/or the cerebral veins. It occurs more frequently in women during pregnancy and puerperium as compared to the general population. The clinical diagnosis is difficult in some cases due to its variable clinical presentation with numerous causes and risk factors. The diagnosis can be made at an early stage if clinical suspicion is high with the help of advanced neuroimaging techniques that were developed recently. Early therapeutic intervention using anticoagulants allows for preventing complications and improving outcomes. In this article, we review the topic of CVST in pregnancy and the postpartum period with an emphasis on its epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and treatment. We also elaborate on several practical points that are important to the treating team. This review will help obstetricians, neurologists, and emergency physicians diagnose affected pregnant women as early as possible to provide prompt treatment and avoid adverse outcomes.
