39010692|a|BACKGROUND: High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) has been found to ameliorate cognitive impairment. However, the effects of HF-rTMS remain unknown in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). AIM: To investigate the effects of HF-rTMS on cognitive improvement and its potential mechanisms in CCH mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Daily HF-rTMS therapy was delivered after bilateral carotid stenosis (BCAS) and continued for 14 days. The mice were randomly assigned to three groups: the sham group, the model group, and the HF-rTMS group. The Y maze and the new object recognition test were used to assess cognitive function. The expressions of MAP-2, synapsis, Myelin basic protein(MBP), and brain-derived growth factors (BDNF) were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining and western blot to evaluate neuronal plasticity and white matter myelin regeneration. Nissl staining and the expression of caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 were used to observe neuronal apoptosis. In addition, the activation of microglia and astrocytes were evaluated by fluorescence staining. The inflammation levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and Tumor Necrosis Factor(TNF)-alpha were detected by qPCR in the hippocampus of mice in each group. RESULTS: Via behavioral tests, the BCAS mice showed reduced a rate of new object preference and decreased a rate of spontaneous alternations, while HF-rTMS significantly improved hippocampal learning and memory deficits. In addition, the mice in the model group showed decreased levels of MAP-2, synapsis, MBP, and BDNF, while HF-rTMS treatment reversed these effects. As expected, activated microglia and astrocytes increased in the model group, but HF-rTMS treatment suppressed these changes. HF-rTMS decreased BCAS-induced neuronal apoptosis and the expression of pro-apoptotic protein (Caspase-3 and Bax) and increased the expression of anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2). In addition, HF-rTMS inhibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha). CONCLUSIONS: HF-rTMS alleviates cognitive impairment in CCH mice by enhancing neuronal plasticity and inhibiting inflammation, thus serving as a potential method for vascular cognitive impairment.
