36348454|a|BACKGROUND: The intensive care unit (ICU) is an emotionally taxing environment. Patients and family members are at an increased risk of long-term physical and psychological consequences of critical illness, known collectively as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). These environmental strains can lead to a high incidence of staff turnover and burnout. AIM: The ICU Bridge Program (ICUBP) is a student-led organization that attempts to mitigate these stressors on patients, family, and staff, by assigning university volunteers to ICUs across Montreal. SETTING: ICU. PARTICIPANTS: ICU volunteers, staff, patients, and families. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The ICUBP volunteers support staff by orienting patients and families, while using effective communication strategies to provide comfort and promote a calm environment. The presence of volunteer visitors is helpful to patients who do not have the support of family members and/or friends. The program provides students with profound learning experiences by allowing them to shadow multidisciplinary teams, gaining a privileged and varied exposure to an acute medical environment, while developing their communications skills. PROGRAM EVALUATION: The program reassesses its methods and impact via internal student-designed surveys distributed on a yearly basis to staff and volunteers. DISCUSSION: Research is warranted to assess the impact of the program on ICU patients, visitors, staff, and volunteers.
