26650559|t|[MANAGEMENT OF PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS IN HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS].
26650559|a|Here we make a revision about the rational use of psychopharmacological drugs in HIV/AIDS patients. We revised the clinical use of psychotropic drugs in this setting. In the clinical spectrum, the most frequent clinical pictures are the depression, anxiety disorders, psychosis, delirium, and the cognitive and behavioral neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with the HIV/AIDS dementia and the substance abuse-dependence. Also, we analyzed the most important pharmacological interactions between psychotropic drugs and antiretrovirals. The medical education and the interdisciplinary work are the basic topics to an adequate clinical management of this kind of patients.
