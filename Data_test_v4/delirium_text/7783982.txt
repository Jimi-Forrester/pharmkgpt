7783982|a|To investigate the role of IL-6 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) its effect on amyloid precursor protein (APP) mRNA expression was evaluated. The levels of APP mRNA were determined by Northern blot analysis in primary cultured rat cortical neurons and glial cells exposed to IL-6 (50-200 ng/ml). The cytokine increased neuronal APP mRNA expression about 100% at the highest dose after 6 h of exposure. APP mRNA expression was unaffected in astroglial cells exposed to IL-6. Since IL-1 beta also increased neuronal APP mRNA, the combination of IL-1 beta and IL-6 was tested. The effects were partially additive. The ability of beta-amyloid fragment 25-35 to induce IL-1 or IL-6 mRNA was also investigated in astroglial cells. IL-1 beta mRNA was strongly induced by beta 25-35 (25-100 microM) while the expression of IL-6 mRNA remaining unchanged. The results suggest roles for both IL-1 and IL-6 in the neuronal mechanisms related to beta-amyloid protein deposition in AD.
