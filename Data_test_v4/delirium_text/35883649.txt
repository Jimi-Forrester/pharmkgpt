35883649|a|Impaired cerebral autoregulation (CA) may increase the risk of brain hypoperfusion in septic patients. Sepsis dysregulates the autonomic nervous system (ANS), potentially affecting CA. ANS function can be assessed through the pupillary light reflex (PLR). The aim of this prospective, observational study was to investigate the association between CA and PLR in adult septic patients. Transcranial Doppler was used to assess CA and calculate estimated cerebral perfusion pressure (eCPP) and intracranial pressure (eICP). An automated pupillometer (AP) was used to record Neurological Pupil Index (NPi), constriction (CV) and dilation (DV) velocities. The primary outcome was the relationship between AP-derived variables with CA; the secondary outcome was the association between AP-derived variables with eCPP and/or eICP. Among 40 included patients, 21 (53%) had impaired CA, 22 (55%) had low eCPP (<60 mmHg) and 15 (38%) had high eICP (>16 mmHg). DV was lower in patients with impaired CA compared to others; DV predicted impaired CA with area under the curve, AUROC= 0.78 [95% Confidence Interval, CI 0.63-0.94]; DV < 2.2 mm/s had sensitivity 85% and specificity 69% for impaired CA. Patients with low eCPP or high eICP had lower NPi values than others. NPi was correlated with eCPP (r = 0.77, p < 0.01) and eICP (r = -0.87, p < 0.01). Automated pupillometry may play a role to assess brain hemodynamics in septic patients.
