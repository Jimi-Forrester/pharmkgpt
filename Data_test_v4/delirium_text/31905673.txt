31905673|a|Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) receptors are non-selective cation channels responsive to a variety of exogenous irritants and endogenous stimuli including products of oxidative stress. It is mainly expressed by primary sensory neurons; however, expression of TRPA1 by astrocytes and oligodendrocytes has recently been detected in the mouse brain. Genetic deletion of TRPA1 was shown to attenuate cuprizone-induced oligodendrocyte apoptosis and myelin loss in mice. In the present study we aimed at investigating mGFAP-Cre conditional TRPA1 knockout mice in the cuprizone model. These animals were generated by crossbreeding GFAP-Cre+/- and floxed TRPA1 (TRPA1Fl/Fl) mice. Cuprizone was administered for 6 weeks and demyelination was followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). At the end of the treatment, demyelination and glial activation was also investigated by histological methods. The results of the MRI showed that demyelination was milder at weeks 3 and 4 in both homozygous (GFAP-Cre+/- TRPA1Fl/Fl) and heterozygous (GFAP-Cre+/- TRPA1Fl/-) conditional knockout animals compared to Cre-/- control mice. However, by week 6 of the treatment the difference was not detectable by either MRI or histological methods. In conclusion, TRPA1 receptors on astrocytes may transiently contribute to the demyelination induced by cuprizone, however, expression and function of TRPA1 receptors by other cells in the brain (oligodendrocytes, microglia, neurons) warrant further investigation.
