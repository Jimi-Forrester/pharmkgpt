39396099|t|Revealing disease subtypes and heterogeneity in common variable immunodeficiency through transcriptomic analysis.
39396099|a|Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by reduced levels of specific immunoglobulins, resulting in frequent infections, autoimmune disorders, increased cancer risk, and diminished antibody production despite an adequate B cell count. With its clinical manifestations being highly variable, the classification of CVID, including the widely recognized Freiburg classification, is primarily based on clinical symptoms and genetic variations. Our study aims to refine the classification of CVID by analyzing transcriptomics data to identify distinct disease subtypes. We utilized the GSE51405 dataset, examining transcriptomic profiles from 30 CVID patients without complications. Employing a combination of clustering techniques-KMeans, hierarchical agglomerative clustering, spectral clustering, and Gaussian Mixture models-and differential gene expression analysis with R's limma package, we integrated molecular findings with demographic data (age and gender) through correlation analysis and identified common genes among clusters. Three distinct clusters of CVID patients were identified using KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models, highlighting the disease's heterogeneity. Differential expression analysis unveiled 31 genes with variable expression levels across these clusters. Notably, nine genes (EIF5A, RPL21, ANP32A, DTX3L, NCF2, CDC42EP3, CHP1, FOLR3, and DEFA4) exhibited consistent differential expression across all clusters, independent of demographic factors. The study recommends categorizing patients based on the four genes, NCF2, CHP1, FOLR3, and DEFA4-as they may assist in prognostic prediction. Transcriptomic analysis of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) patients identified three distinct clusters based on gene expression, independent of age and gender. Nine differentially expressed genes were identified across these clusters, suggesting potential biomarkers for CVID subtype classification. These findings highlight the genetic heterogeneity of CVID and provide novel insights into disease classification and potential personalized treatment approaches.
