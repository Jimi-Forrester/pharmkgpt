2312077|t|Substance abuse and mental health status of homeless and domiciled low-income users of a medical clinic.
2312077|a|Data were collected on indicators of mental health status and substance abuse among 214 homeless and 250 domiciled but impoverished patients who sought care in a community medical clinic in a California beach community. Although both groups had a high prevalence of problems, homeless patients were significantly more likely to have been hospitalized for alcohol or mental problems, to have been arrested because of drinking, and to have experienced delirium tremens. Homeless persons were also more likely to have made a suicide attempt, to have experienced recent psychotic symptoms, and to be dissatisfied with life. The findings suggest that primary medical care settings serving the poor and homeless may present an excellent opportunity for delivering mental health services and that psychiatrists should expand their involvement in such settings.
