29678619|a|PURPOSE: To explore effect of goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) on early cognitive function in elderly patients with spinal stenosis. METHODS: 83 elderly patients with spinal stenosis were randomly classified into two groups: control group (n = 40) and GDFT group (n = 43). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score, IL-6 and S100beta levels, hemodynamic parameters, cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2), arterial lactic acid values, output of surgery, operation time and cases of hypotension, intraoperative complications within 7 days were recorded for all patients. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) was about 21.67% in this study. The MoCA scores, inflammatory mediators, perfusion indexes (rSO2 and lactic acid)and intraoperative hemodynamics(HR, MAP, and CI)were not all the same at different time points (P < 0.05). The levels of inflammatory mediators (IL-6 and S100beta) in GDFT group were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Total intake, amount of lactated Ringer's solution and cases of hypotension in GDFT group were significantly lower than control group (P < 0.05), but amount of voluven was higher than control group(P < 0.05). Compared with control group, the incidence of postoperative delirium, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension in GDFT group was lower (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: GDFT can maintain the stability of perioperative hemodynamics in the prone position of elderly patients with spinal stenosis, improve the balance between perfusion of tissue and organ and supply and demand of oxygen, reduce the inflammatory response, and reduce the incidence of early POCD in this type of surgery.
