35628295|t|Amyloid Formation in Nanoliter Droplets.
35628295|a|Processes that monitor the nucleation of amyloids and characterize the formation of amyloid fibrils are vital to medicine and pharmacology. In this study, we observe the nucleation and formation of lysozyme amyloid fibrils using a facile microfluidic system to generate nanoliter droplets that can control the flow rate and movement of monomer-in-oil emulsion droplets in a T-junction microchannel. Using a fluorescence assay, we monitor the nucleation and growth process of amyloids based on the volume of droplets. Using the microfluidic system, we demonstrate that the lag phase, which is vital to amyloid nucleation and growth, is reduced at a lower droplet volume. Furthermore, we report a peculiar phenomenon of high amyloid formation at the edge of a bullet-shaped droplet, which is likely due to the high local monomer concentration. Moreover, we discovered that amyloid fibrils synthesized in the nanoliter droplets are shorter and thicker than fibrils synthesized from a bulk solution via the conventional heating method. Herein, a facile procedure to observe and characterize the nucleation and growth of amyloid fibrils using nanoliter droplets is presented, which is beneficial for investigating new features of amyloid fibril formation as an unconventional synthetic method for amyloid fibrils.
