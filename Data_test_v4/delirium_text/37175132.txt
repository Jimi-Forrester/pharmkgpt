37175132|t|Anti-Inflammatory Effect of Izalpinin Derived from Chromolaena leivensis: lambda-Carrageenan-Induced Paw Edema and In Silico Model.
37175132|a|The flavonoid izalpinin was isolated from the aerial parts of Chromolaena leivensis. Its structural determination was carried out using MS and NMR spectroscopic techniques (1H, 13C). This compound was evaluated for its anti-inflammatory effect in a rat model on lambda-carrageenan-induced plantar edema. Paw inflammation was measured at one-hour intervals for seven hours following the administration of lambda-carrageenan. Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels were evaluated, obtaining statistically significant results with the treatments at doses of 10 mg/kg (* p < 0.01) and 20 mg/kg (** p < 0.005). The anti-inflammatory effect of the compound was evaluated by using plethysmography, and the results showed significant differences at the three concentrations (10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg) in the first and third hours after treatment. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001 vs. the negative control group treated with vehicle (DMSO). Lastly, molecular docking analyses reveal that izalpinin has a strong binding affinity with five target proteins involved in the inflammatory process. The analysis using molecular dynamics allowed demonstrating that the ligand-protein complexes present acceptable stability, with RMSD values within the allowed range.
