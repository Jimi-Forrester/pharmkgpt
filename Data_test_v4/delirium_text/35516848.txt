35516848|t|Proteomic analysis reveals the potential neuroprotective effects of tetramethylpyrazine dimer in neuro2a/APPswe cells.
35516848|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by pathological processes, including abnormal amyloid deposits and filament tangles, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neurotrophic insufficiency, leading to chronic and prolonged neuronal loss and cognitive deficits. Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) is one of the main active components of Ligusticum wallichii, a traditional Chinese medicine widely used for brain related disease. Here, we synthesized the TMP derivative tetramethylpyrazine dimer (DTMP), and evaluated the potential mechanisms underlying its potential neuroprotective effects using the murine neuron-like cells (N2a) transfected with the human "Swedish" mutant amyloid precursor protein (N2aAPP). ELISA results indicated that DTMP reduced the levels of Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 in N2aAPP. Then through proteomic analysis we identified a total of 208 differentially expressed proteins in N2aAPP cells compared to the wild-type N2a cells (N2aWT), including 144 increased and 64 decreased proteins. 449 differentially expressed proteins were revealed in N2aAPP cells on DTMP treatment with 69 increased and 380 decreased proteins. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that these proteins are enriched in mitochondrial function, the electronic transmission chain, ATP binding, oxidative phosphorylation, GTPase function, the transcriptional translation process, amino acid metabolism, nucleotide binding and others. Given the vital role of mitochondria in the pathogenesis of AD, we selected the electron transport chain pathway-related molecules to further validate these findings. Western-blot analysis demonstrated that DTMP significantly increased the levels of complex I (NDUAA), complex II (SDHB), complex III (UCRI), complex IV (COX5A) and complex V (ATP5A) in N2aAPP cells. The modulation of dysregulated proteins implicated in AD pathogenesis implies the pharmacological mechanisms of DTMP and its potential as a novel therapeutic choice in AD.
