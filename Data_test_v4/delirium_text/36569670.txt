36569670|t|The Efficacy of Vitamin D Supplementation in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease in Preventing Cognitive Decline: A Systematic Review.
36569670|a|To evaluate the role of vitamin D supplementation in preventing cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), five databases such as PubMed, PubMed Central (PMC), Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar were searched for articles relevant to the research question with filters such as English and human studies from 2011 to 2022. Two investigators extracted the data and assessed the quality of the study using the predefined criteria. We identified 24 relevant articles after the critical screening. There were five randomized controlled trials (RCTs), two observational studies, two systematic reviews and meta-analyses, one pilot study, and 14 review articles.  Most RCTs showed no significant improvement in vitamin D supplementation except for one study, which reported significant improvement in cognition on taking vitamin D in Alzheimer's disease but was not taken much into consideration as it had a small sample size (n=210) and was for a shorter duration. Another study evidenced significant improvement in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score when memantine and vitamin D were taken together compared to when memantine and vitamin D were taken independently. Studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of developing cognitive impairment. But there is no sufficient evidence indicating vitamin D supplementation can improve cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease.
