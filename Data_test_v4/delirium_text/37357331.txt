37357331|a|BACKGROUND: Camelina sativa oil is one of the richest dietary sources of omega-3, with polyunsaturated fatty acids amounts of over 50%, linolenic acid content of around 40-45%, and linoleic acid of about 15%. Moreover, this oil is a valuable source of antioxidants which provide oxidative stability. All those features raise interest in considering Camelina oil as an alternative and sustainable oil source providing stable omega-3-rich emulsions for functional food production. OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to investigate the effects of Camelina oil-enriched crackers on serum omega-3 concentration, inflammatory markers and serum lipid profile. DESIGN: Randomized placebo-controlled pilot trial. SETTING: Research and Development Center (Complife Italia s.r.l.). PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-six free-living older volunteers (aged>=65 years). INTERVENTION: Older adults were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two groups: the camelina group or the placebo group. Subjects consumed daily 35 g of crackers (Camelina enriched crackers or placebo ones) twice daily for 12 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: Serum polyunsaturated fatty acid profile, inflammatory status and serum lipid panel parameters were recorded pre and post-intervention. RESULTS: In the camelina group, alpha-linolenic acid serum concentration was significantly higher (p<0.01) compared to the placebo group at the end of the study. Concerning inflammatory plasma markers, a significant mean pro-inflammatory interleukin-18 plasma concentration decrease in the placebo group compared to the camelina one was observed (p<0.05). No significant differences in other mean inflammatory markers concentrations post-intervention were noted in either group. Lastly, examining the change in lipid profile, it is noteworthy that a higher reduction of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and triglycerides in the camelina group post-intervention, despite the lack of statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Camelina oil significantly elevated the serum alpha-linolenic acid concentration with no significant changes in inflammatory markers and lipid profile.
