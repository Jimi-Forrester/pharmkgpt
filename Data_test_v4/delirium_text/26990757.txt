26990757|a|BACKGROUND: Weight loss is common in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and it could be a marker of impending AD in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and improve prognostic accuracy, if accelerated progression to AD would be shown. AIMS: To assess weight loss as a predictor of dementia and AD in MCI. METHODS: One hundred twenty-five subjects with MCI (age 73.8 +- 7.1 years) were followed for an average of 4 years. Two weight measurements were carried out at a minimum time interval of one year. Dementia was defined according to DSM-IV criteria and AD according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. Weight loss was defined as a >=4% decrease in baseline weight. RESULTS: Fifty-three (42.4%) MCI progressed to dementia, which was of the AD-type in half of the cases. Weight loss was associated with a 3.4-fold increased risk of dementia (95% CI = 1.5-6.9) and a 3.2-fold increased risk of AD (95% CI = 1.4-8.3). In terms of years lived without disease, weight loss was associated to a 2.3 and 2.5 years earlier onset of dementia and AD. CONCLUSIONS: Accelerated progression towards dementia and AD is expected when weight loss is observed in MCI patients. Weight should be closely monitored in elderly with mild cognitive impairment.
