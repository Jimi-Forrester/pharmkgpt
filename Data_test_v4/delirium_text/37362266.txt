37362266|t|DLMBHCO: design of an augmented bioinspired deep learning-based multidomain body parameter analysis via heterogeneous correlative body organ analysis.
37362266|a|Progressive organ-level disorders in the human body are often correlated with diseases in other body parts. For instance, liver diseases can be linked with heart issues, while cancers can be linked with brain diseases (or psychological conditions). Defining such correlations is a complex task, and existing deep learning models that perform this task either showcase lower accuracy or are non-comprehensive when applied to real-time scenarios. To overcome these issues, this text proposes design of an augmented bioinspired deep learning-based multidomain body parameter analysis via heterogeneous correlative body organ analysis. The proposed model initially collects temporal and spatial data scans for different body parts and uses a multidomain feature extraction engine to convert these scans into vector sets. These vectors are processed by a Bacterial Foraging Optimizer (BFO), which assists in identification of highly variant feature sets, which are individually classified into different disease categories. A fusion of Inception Net, XCeption Net, and GoogLeNet Models is used to perform these classifications. The classified categories are linked with other disease types via temporal analysis of blood reports. The temporal analysis engine uses Modified Analytical Hierarchical Processing (MAHP) Model for calculating inter-organ disease dependency probabilities. Based on these probabilities, the model is able to generate a patient-level correlation map, which can be used by clinical experts to suggest remedial treatments, due to which the model was able to identify correlations between brain disorders and kidneys, heart diseases and lungs, heart diseases and liver, brain diseases and different types of cancers with high efficiency when evaluated under clinical scenarios. When validated on MITBIH, DEAP, CT Kidney, RIDER, and PLCO data samples, it was observed that the proposed model was capable of improving accuracy of correlation by 8.5%, while improving precision and recall by 3.2% when compared with existing correlation models under similar clinical scenarios.
