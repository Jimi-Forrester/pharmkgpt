33483903|t|Targeting Insulin Resistance to Treat Cognitive Dysfunction.
33483903|a|Dementia is a devastating disease associated with aging. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, followed by vascular dementia. In addition to clinically diagnosed dementia, cognitive dysfunction has been reported in diabetic patients. Recent studies are now beginning to recognize type 2 diabetes mellitus, characterized by chronic hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive disorders. While studies on insulin action have remained traditionally in the domain of peripheral tissues, the detrimental effects of insulin resistance in the central nervous system on cognitive dysfunction are increasingly being reported by recent clinical and preclinical studies. The findings from these studies suggest that antidiabetic drugs have the potential to be used to treat dementia. In this review, we discuss the physiological functions of insulin in the brain, studies on the evaluation of cognitive function under conditions of insulin resistance, and reports on the beneficial actions of antidiabetic drugs in the brain. This review covers clinical studies as well as investigations in animal models and will further highlight the emerging link between insulin resistance and neurodegenerative disorders.
