33126318|a|Colorectal cancer, especially colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), is associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) has been implicated in tumorigenesis. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the potential diagnostic and prognostic values of lncRNA FRGCA in COAD.The data of 438 COAD patients were retrieved for analysis. Diagnostic significance was evaluated using tumor and nontumor tissues. Prognostic significance was evaluated using a Cox proportional regression model. Stratified analysis was performed to identify associations between clinical factors and lncRNA FRGCA expression. A nomogram was constructed using the clinical factors and lncRNA FRGCA for survival prediction. Enrichment analysis identified gene ontologies and metabolic pathways of mRNAs with high Pearson correlation coefficients with lncRNA FRGCA.lncRNA FRGCA was highly expressed in tumor tissues of COAD and demonstrated diagnostic value (area under curve = 0.763, P < .0001). Prognostic significance analysis indicated that lncRNA FRGCA had prognostic value in COAD [adjusted P < .001, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.444, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.288-0.685] and high expression of lncRNA FRGCA indicated better survival in COAD. A nomogram was evaluated for prediction of survival at 1, 3, and 5 years. Enrichment analysis revealed many mRNAs involved in the structural constituents of the mitochondrial inner membrane and translational termination, protein binding, translation, ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, and metabolic pathways, especially the nucleoplasm.Differentially expressed in tumor vs nontumor tissues, lncRNA FRGCA had both diagnostic and prognostic implications in COAD, which may be associated with ribosome metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and nucleoplasm-related metabolic pathways.
