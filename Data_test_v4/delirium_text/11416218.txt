11416218|t|Gamma -secretase inhibitors repress thymocyte development.
11416218|a|A major therapeutic target in the search for a cure to the devastating Alzheimer's disease is gamma-secretase. This activity resides in a multiprotein enzyme complex responsible for the generation of Abeta42 peptides, precipitates of which are thought to cause the disease. Gamma-secretase is also a critical component of the Notch signal transduction pathway; Notch signals regulate development and differentiation of adult self-renewing cells. This has led to the hypothesis that therapeutic inhibition of gamma-secretase may interfere with Notch-related processes in adults, most alarmingly in hematopoiesis. Here, we show that application of gamma-secretase inhibitors to fetal thymus organ cultures interferes with T cell development in a manner consistent with loss or reduction of Notch1 function. Progression from an immature CD4-/CD8- state to an intermediate CD4+/CD8+ double-positive state was repressed. Furthermore, treatment beginning later at the double-positive stage specifically inhibited CD8+ single-positive maturation but did not affect CD4+ single-positive cells. These results demonstrate that pharmacological gamma-secretase inhibition recapitulates Notch1 loss in a vertebrate tissue and present a system in which rapid evaluation of gamma-secretase-targeted pharmaceuticals for their ability to inhibit Notch activity can be performed in a relevant context.
