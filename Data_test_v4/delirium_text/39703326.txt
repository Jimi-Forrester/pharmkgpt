39703326|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent form of dementia in the elderly, which is clinically characterized by a gradual and progressive deterioration of cognitive functions. The central and early role of beta-amyloid in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is supported by a plethora of studies including genetic analyses, biomarker research and genome-wide association studies in both familial (early-onset) and sporadic (late-onset) forms of Alzheimer's. Monoclonal antibodies directed against beta-amyloid demonstrate slowing of the clinical deterioration of patients with early Alzheimer's disease. Aducanumab, lecanemab and donanemab clinical trials showed slowing of Alzheimer's disease progression on composite scores by 25-40% based on the measure used. Anti-beta-amyloid antibodies can cause side effects of bleeding and swelling in the brain, called amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities typically occur early in treatment and are often asymptomatic, and though in rare cases, they can lead to serious or life-threatening events. The aim of this review is to evaluate the clinical meaningfulness of anti-beta-amyloid therapies amidst amyloid-related imaging abnormalities concern in Alzheimer's disease.
