37660518|t|Knowledge, attitude and practice regarding hypoactive delirium among ICU nurses: A nationwide cross-sectional study.
37660518|a|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of intensive care unit (ICU) nurses in patients with hypoactive delirium in China. BACKGROUND: The presentation of hypoactive delirium is not obvious and tends to be ignored. However, it has a high incidence and can cause critical impairment. Although nurses are the primary caregivers of patients, the evidence of the current status of KAP of hypoactive delirium among ICU nurses is insufficient in China. DESIGN: The study participants were 2835 ICU nurses from 201 hospitals in 69 cities from 31 provinces in China. METHODS: The current status of KAP of hypoactive delirium among ICU nurses was determined using a self-reported structured questionnaire, including 52 questions covering general personal information; three dimensions of KAP; and relevant issues. Descriptive analyses of the sample distribution were reported as percentages and medians. The factors were detected using univariate and multivariate analyses. To guide the reporting of the research, a STROBE checklist of cross-sectional studies was used. RESULTS: Of the 3101 returned questionnaires, 2835 were analyzed. Approximately 64. 94 % and 53. 30 % of them were identified with a positive attitude and appropriate practice, respectively, whereas only 1. 48 % showed a good level of knowledge. The regression analysis showed that age, years of working in the ICU, educational background, professional title, caring for patients with delirium, attending training on hypoactive delirium and hospital grading were significantly associated with their KAP status(P<005). CONCLUSIONS: Hypoactive delirium is an ignored entity by nursing professionals, with no definite nursing procedure. This study shows that receiving relevant training is a factor affecting KAP status, indicating that training should be strengthened. Additionally, appropriate screening and nursing procedures should be developed to standardize the behavior of ICU nurses and improve the quality of care. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: ICU nurses have poor knowledge of hypoactive delirium and related training should be strengthened, especially for middle-aged nurses. Screening and nursing procedures should be set up, which is critical to promote nursing practice. NO PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: None.
