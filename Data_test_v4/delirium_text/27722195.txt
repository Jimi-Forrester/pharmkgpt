27722195|a|INTRODUCTION: Carers' diaries have been used in very few instances in dementia to assist with gathering information about persons with dementia in the community. The main aim of this study was to compare problems identified using diaries kept by family carers for a week with carers' oral recollection of problems. METHOD: Carers were randomly allocated into two groups, diary and control groups. In the diary group, carers received a diary and instructions on how to complete it for 7 days. RESULTS: A total of 78 carers completed the study. The frequency of problems identified in the carers diaries was greater than in the carers' narrative accounts at day 1 and day 8. The most common problems were behavioral and cognitive problems. DISCUSSION: Carers' diaries may complement the assessment of dementia as they can provide more information on the problems faced by the persons with dementia.
