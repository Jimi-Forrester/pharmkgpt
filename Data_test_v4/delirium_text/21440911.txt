21440911|t|The relationship of plasma Abeta levels to dementia in aging individuals with mild cognitive impairment.
21440911|a|Amyloid beta(Abeta) peptides are important components of plaques in Alzheimer's disease(AD). A decrease in the CSF concentration of Abeta40 and Abeta42 is a potential biomarker for incident AD. In contrast, studies on plasma Abeta40 and Abeta42 concentrations have yielded contradictory results. To explore the relationship between plasma Abeta40 and Abeta42 concentrations and AD in aging individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), evaluate the sensitivity and the specificity of plasma Abeta and their ratio as a marker for progression to AD. We measured baseline concentrations of Abeta40 and Abeta42, and their ratio in plasma of patients carefully categorized clinically and neurochemically as having AD or other dementias from a cohort of patients with MCI (n=588) after 4-6 years of follow-up time. Plasma concentrations of Abeta40, Abeta42 were measured using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technology. The association between plasma Abeta concentrations and the risk of dementia was assessed using Cox proportional hazard models. Optimal sensitivity and specificity of Abeta measurements were determined by ROC curve analysis. Plasma Abeta42 concentration and the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio at baseline were significantly decreased in the MCI patients who developed AD as compared to cognitively stable MCI patients. The baseline concentrations of Abeta40 were similar in all MCI groups. The Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio was superior to Abeta42 concentration with regard to identify incipient AD in MCI. The ratio of Abeta42 to Abeta40 rather than absolute levels of the peptides can aid in the identification of incipient AD among MCI patients. A potential role of plasma Abeta concentrations as a marker of incipient dementia warrants further investigation.
