31787880|t|Different Amyloid-beta Self-Assemblies Have Distinct Effects on Intracellular Tau Aggregation.
31787880|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is characterized by the aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau in the form of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. It has been found that a synergistic relationship between these two proteins may contribute to their roles in disease progression. However, how Abeta and tau interact has not been fully characterized. Here, we analyze how tau seeding or aggregation is influenced by different Abeta self-assemblies (fibrils and oligomers). Our cellular assays utilizing tau biosensor cells show that transduction of Abeta oligomers into the cells greatly enhances seeded tau aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, transduced Abeta fibrils slightly reduce tau seeding while untransduced Abeta fibrils promote it. We also observe that the transduction of alpha-synuclein fibrils, another amyloid protein, has no effect on tau seeding. The enhancement of tau seeding by Abeta oligomers was confirmed using tau fibril seeds derived from both recombinant tau and PS19 mouse brain extracts containing human tau. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the specific form and cellular location of Abeta self-assembly when studying the relationship between Abeta and tau in future AD therapeutic development.
