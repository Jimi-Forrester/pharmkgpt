34733419|t|Emerging approaches of wound healing in experimental models of high-grade oral mucositis induced by anticancer therapy.
34733419|a|Clinical guidelines for oral mucositis (OM) still consist in palliative care. Herein, we summarize cellular and molecular mechanisms of OM ulceration in response to chemical therapies in animal models. We discuss evidenced anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant drugs which have not been ever used for OM, such as synthetic peptides as well as cell therapy with mesenchymal stem cells; amniotic membranes, mucoadhesive polymers loaded with anti-inflammatory agents and natural or synthetic electrospun. These approaches have been promising to allow the production of drug-loaded membranes, scaffolds for cells encapsulation or guided tissue regeneration.
