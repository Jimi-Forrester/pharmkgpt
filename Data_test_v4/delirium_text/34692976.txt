34692976|a|INTRODUCTION: Knowledge is limited about behavioral and psychological symptoms of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia in racial and ethnic minorities. METHODS: As part of the Pathology, Alzheimer's and Related Dementias Study (PARDoS), we interviewed knowledgeable informants of 2319 older Brazilian decedents (67% white, 11% black, 22% mixed) using the informant portion of the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale to classify MCI and dementia and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory to assess behavioral and psychological symptoms. RESULTS: We identified four clusters of neuropsychiatric symptoms: agitation, affect/apathy, psychosis, and behavioral problems. On the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, 1407 had no cognitive impairment, 180 had MCI, and 732 had dementia. Both MCI and dementia were associated with symptoms in each behavioral/psychological cluster (all P's < .001). There was little evidence of racial differences in the association of MCI and dementia with these neuropsychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSION: MCI and dementia are associated with elevated behavioral and psychological symptoms in older black and white Brazilians.
