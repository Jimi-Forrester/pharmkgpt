31771334|t|An Evaluation of Risperidone Dosing for Pediatric Delirium in Children Less Than or Equal to 2 Years of Age.
31771334|a|Background: Risperidone dosing and safety data are limited in patients <=2 years of age. Objective: To describe the dosing strategies, safety, and tolerability of risperidone in infants <=2 years of age. Methods: An institutional review board-approved retrospective study was conducted in a 24-bed pediatric intensive care unit at an academic medical center in patients <=2 years of age receiving risperidone for the management of ICU delirium. The primary outcome was mean initial daily dose of risperidone. Secondary outcomes included mean daily dose, dosing frequency, treatment duration, and adverse effects. Results: Seventeen patients who received at least 1 dose of risperidone were included in the study. The initial daily dose ranged from 0.1 to 0.25 mg (0.01-0.04 mg/kg), with a mean of 0.17 mg (0.02 mg/kg). Most patients were initiated on once-daily dosing (76.5%) versus twice-daily dosing (17.6%). More than 80% of patients required a dose increase during therapy. Median daily doses of fentanyl, morphine, ketamine, and midazolam were decreased following initiation of risperidone. No adverse events that led to discontinuation of risperidone were reported. Conclusion and Relevance: Risperidone was found to be safe and well tolerated at daily doses of risperidone of 0.1 to 0.25 mg in 1 or 2 doses per day in patients <=2 years old for the management of ICU delirium. To our knowledge, these results provide the largest cohort describing dosing recommendations specific for risperidone in this age group. Further investigation on the effect of antipsychotic administration on other sedation and analgesic regimens is necessary.
