36143095|t|Multimorbidity and Frailty Are the Key Characteristics of Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19 Breakthrough Infection during Delta Variant Predominance in Italy: A Retrospective Study.
36143095|a|The aims of this study were to describe the characteristics of patients hospitalized with delta SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection, and to identify factors associated with pneumonia on chest Computed Tomography (CT) and mortality. The clinical records of 229 patients (105 F), with a median age of 81 (interquartile range, IQR, 73-88) years old, hospitalized between June and December 2021 after completion of the primary vaccination cycle, were retrospectively analyzed, retrieving data on comorbidities, Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), clinical presentation and outcomes. Multimorbidity (91.7% with >=2 chronic illnesses) and frailty (61.6% with CFS >= 5) were highly prevalent. CFS (OR 0.678, 95% CI 0.573-0.803, p < 0.001) and hypertension were independently associated with interstitial pneumonia. Mortality was 25.1% and unrelated with age. PaO2/FiO2 on blood gas analysis performed upon admission (OR 0.986, 95% CI 0.977-0.996, p = 0.005), and CFS (OR 1.723, 95% CI 1.152-2.576, p = 0.008) were independently associated with mortality only in subjects < 85 years old. Conversely, serum PCT levels were associated with mortality in subjects >= 85 years old (OR 3.088, 95% CI 1.389-6.8628, p = 0.006). In conclusion, hospitalization for COVID-19 breakthrough infection mainly involved geriatric patients, with those aged >= 85 more characterized by decompensation of baseline comorbidities rather than typical COVID-19 respiratory symptoms.
