35761809|a|Rare neurodegenerative disorders may be considered in the differential diagnosis of Parkinsonism in patients with schizophrenia who show worsening signs of Parkinsonism under treatment with antipsychotics. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first report describing probable progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) in a patient with chronic schizophrenia. A 64-year-old man presented with hallucinations, delusions and asociality. He had received treatment with both typical and atypical antipsychotics for ~13 years. He began experiencing short-term memory impairment and bradykinesia two years before presentation, and then showed increased dysphagia, upper-limb muscle rigidity, extrapyramidal symptoms, vision loss and photophobia. Psychological manifestations included chronic depression, irritability and, occasionally, euphoria. His gait worsened, leading to repeated falls. Antipsychotics were discontinued, and the patient was almost completely dependent on a wheelchair in daily life. In a neurology consultation, he was diagnosed with probable progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson's syndrome presenting as vertical supranuclear gaze palsy and prominent postural instability with falls. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed atrophy of the mesencephalic tegmentum, and 123I-ioflupane single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) revealed reduced bilateral striatal reuptake. Overall, PSP should be considered in patients with schizophrenia with worsening Parkinsonism, especially when it is accompanied by supranuclear ophthalmoplegia, pseudobulbar palsy, dysarthria and dystonic stiffness of the neck and upper body. In the present case, the combination of brain MRI and 123I-ioflupane SPECT helped to discriminate PSP from other Parkinsonian syndromes, including drug-induced Parkinsonism, in the differential diagnosis.
