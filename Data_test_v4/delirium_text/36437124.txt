36437124|a|BACKGROUND: Ischaemic brain infarction can occur without acute neurological symptoms (covert strokes) or with symptoms (overt strokes), both associated with poor health outcomes. We conducted a pilot study of the incidence of preoperative and postoperative (intraoperative or postoperative) covert strokes, and explored the relationship of postoperative ischaemic brain injury to blood levels of neurofilament light, a biomarker of neuronal damage. METHODS: We analysed 101 preoperative (within 2 weeks of surgery) and 58 postoperative research MRIs on postoperative days 2-9 from two prospective cohorts collected at the University of Wisconsin (NCT01980511 and NCT03124303). Participants were aged >65 yr and undergoing non-intracranial, non-carotid surgery. RESULTS: Preoperative covert stroke was identified in 2/101 participants (2%; Bayesian 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2-5.4). This rate was statistically different from the postoperative ischaemic brain injury rate of 7/58 (12%, 4.9-21.3%; P=0.01) based on postoperative imaging. However, in a smaller group of participants with paired imaging (n=30), we did not identify the same effect (P=0.67). Patients with postoperative brain injury had elevated peak neurofilament light levels (median [inter-quartile range], 2.34 [2.24-2.64] log10 pg ml-1) compared with those without (1.86 [1.48-2.21] log10 pg ml-1; P=0.025). Delirium severity scores were higher in those with postoperative brain injury (19 [17-21]) compared with those without (7 [4-12]; P=0.01). CONCLUSION: Although limited by a small sample size, these data suggest that preoperative covert stroke occurs more commonly than previously anticipated. Plasma neurofilament light is a potential screening biomarker for postoperative ischaemic brain injury.
