39125105|t|Synthesis and Evaluation of Chloride-Substituted Ramalin Derivatives for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment.
39125105|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, leading to cognitive decline and neuronal death. However, despite extensive research, there are still no effective treatments for this condition. In this study, a series of chloride-substituted Ramalin derivatives is synthesized to optimize their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and their potential to target key pathological features of Alzheimer's disease. The effect of the chloride position on these properties is investigated, specifically examining the potential of these derivatives to inhibit tau aggregation and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) activity. Our findings demonstrate that several derivatives, particularly RA-3Cl, RA-4Cl, RA-26Cl, RA-34Cl, and RA-35Cl, significantly inhibit tau aggregation with inhibition rates of approximately 50%. For BACE-1 inhibition, Ramalin and RA-4Cl also significantly decrease BACE-1 expression in N2a cells by 40% and 38%, respectively, while RA-23Cl and RA-24Cl showed inhibition rates of 30% and 35% in SH-SY5Y cells. These results suggest that chloride-substituted Ramalin derivatives possess promising multifunctional properties for AD treatment, warranting further investigation and optimization for clinical applications.
