22740789|t|Glia as a Link between Neuroinflammation and Neuropathic Pain.
22740789|a|Contemporary studies illustrate that peripheral injuries activate glial components of the peripheral and central cellular circuitry. The subsequent release of glial stressors or activating signals contributes to neuropathic pain and neuroinflammation. Recent studies document the importance of glia in the development and persistence of neuropathic pain and neuroinflammation as a connecting link, thereby focusing attention on the glial pathology as the general underlying factor in essentially all age-related neurodegenerative diseases. There is wide agreement that excessive glial activation is a key process in nervous system disorders involving the release of strong pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can trigger worsening of multiple disease states. This review will briefly discuss the recent findings that have shed light on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of glia as a connecting link between neuropathic pain and neuroinflammation.
