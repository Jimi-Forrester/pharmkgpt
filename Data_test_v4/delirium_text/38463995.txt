38463995|t|alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are necessary for basal forebrain activation to increase expression of the nerve growth factor receptor TrkA.
38463995|a|Activation of the basal forebrain leads to increases in the expression of the nerve growth factor receptor, Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) and decreases in expression of the beta amyloid cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) in the cerebral cortex of both sexes of 5xFAD mice. The studies described in this report were designed to determine if these changes were dependent on acetylcholine receptors. Mice were stimulated unilaterally in the basal forebrain for two weeks. Animals were administered a cholinergic antagonist, or saline, 30 minutes prior to stimulation. Animals administered saline exhibited significant increases in TrkA expression and decreases in BACE1 in the stimulated hemisphere relative to the unstimulated. While both nonselective nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor blockade attenuated the BACE1 decline, only the nicotinic receptor antagonism blocked the TrkA increase. Next, we applied selective nicotinic antagonists, and the alpha7 antagonist blocked the TrkA increases, but the alpha4beta2 antagonist did not. BACE1 declines were not blocked by either intervention. Mice with a loxP conditional knockout of the gene for the alpha7 nicotinic receptor were also employed in these studies. Animals were either stimulated bilaterally for two weeks, or left unstimulated. With or without stimulation, the expression of TrkA receptors was lower in the cortical region with the alpha7 nicotinic receptor knockdown. We thus conclude that alpha7 nicotinic receptor activation is necessary for normal expression of TrkA and increases caused by basal forebrain activation, while BACE1 declines caused by stimulation have dependency on a broader array of receptor subtypes.
