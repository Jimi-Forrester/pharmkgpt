39812009|a|INTRODUCTION: Apathy is one of the common neuropsychiatric symptoms in people with dementia (PwD). The aim of this study is to determine the impact of apathy on the patient's quality of life (QoL) and caregiver's burden among PwD. METHODS: Sample of this cross-sectional descriptive study consisted of 88 PwD attending the outpatient clinic of a university hospital in Istanbul and their family caregivers. The evaluation battery included Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI) and Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease Scale (QoL-AD). RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 73.1 +- 11.7, and the time since diagnosis was 3.9 +- 3.1 years; 64.8% had Alzheimer's type dementia, and 53.4% (n = 47) had mild dementia. The mean AES-C score was 52.9 +- 10.2, QoL-AD score was 28.4 +- 5.6 and CBI score 32.6 +- 25.9. Apathy was associated with medical comorbidity, stage of dementia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, functional status and depression. Apathy was found to be predictor of the QoL-AD and also related with CBI. CONCLUSIONS: In dementia patients, apathy was associated with patients' functional status, quality of life, and caregiver burden. It is recommended that patients be evaluated for apathy and its impact on activities of daily living, quality of life and caregiver burden.
