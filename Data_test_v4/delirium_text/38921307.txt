38921307|t|Agreement between Vital Signs Measured Using Mat-Type Noncontact Sensors and Those from Conventional Clinical Assessment.
38921307|a|Vital signs are crucial for assessing the condition of a patient and detecting early symptom deterioration. Noncontact sensor technology has been developed to take vital measurements with minimal burden. This study evaluated the accuracy of a mat-type noncontact sensor in measuring respiratory and pulse rates in patients with cardiovascular diseases compared to conventional methods. Forty-eight hospitalized patients were included; a mat-type sensor was used to measure their respiratory and pulse rates during bed rest. Differences between mat-type sensors and conventional methods were assessed using the Bland-Altman analysis. The mean difference in respiratory rate was 1.9 breaths/min (limits of agreement (LOA): -4.5 to 8.3 breaths/min), and proportional bias existed with significance (r = 0.63, p < 0.05). For pulse rate, the mean difference was -2.0 beats/min (LOA: -23.0 to 19.0 beats/min) when compared to blood pressure devices and 0.01 beats/min (LOA: -11.4 to 11.4 beats/min) when compared to 24-h Holter electrocardiography. The proportional bias was significant for both comparisons (r = 0.49, p < 0.05; r = 0.52, p < 0.05). These were considered clinically acceptable because there was no tendency to misjudge abnormal values as normal. The mat-type noncontact sensor demonstrated sufficient accuracy to serve as an alternative to conventional assessments, providing long-term monitoring of vital signs in clinical settings.
