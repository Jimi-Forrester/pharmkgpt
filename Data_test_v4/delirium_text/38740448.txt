Efficient and rapid detection plays a crucial role in mitigating and managing AD progression. Deep learning-assisted smartphone-based microfluidic paper analysis devices (muPADs) offer the advantages of low cost, good sensitivity, and rapid detection, providing a strategic pathway to address large-scale disease screening in resource-limited areas. However, existing smartphone-based detection platforms usually rely on large devices or cloud servers for data transfer and processing. Additionally, the implementation of automated colorimetric enzyme-linked immunoassay (c-ELISA) on muPADs can further facilitate the realization of smartphone muPADs platforms for efficient disease detection. RESULTS: This paper introduces a new deep learning-assisted offline smartphone platform for early AD screening, offering rapid disease detection in low-resource areas. The proposed platform features a simple mechanical rotating structure controlled by a smartphone, enabling fully automated c-ELISA on muPADs. Our platform successfully applied sandwich c-ELISA for detecting the beta-amyloid peptide 1-42 (Abeta 1-42, a crucial AD biomarker) and demonstrated its efficacy in 38 artificial plasma samples (healthy: 19, unhealthy: 19, N = 6). Moreover, we employed the YOLOv5 deep learning model and achieved an impressive 97 % accuracy on a dataset of 1824 images, which is 10.16 % higher than the traditional method of curve-fitting results. The trained YOLOv5 model was seamlessly integrated into the smartphone using the NCNN (Tencent's Neural Network Inference Framework), enabling deep learning-assisted offline detection. A user-friendly smartphone application was developed to control the entire process, realizing a streamlined "samples in, answers out" approach. SIGNIFICANCE: This deep learning-assisted, low-cost, user-friendly, highly stable, and rapid-response automated offline smartphone-based detection platform represents a good advancement in point-of-care testing (POCT). Moreover, our platform provides a feasible approach for efficient AD detection by examining the level of Abeta 1-42, particularly in areas with low resources and limited communication infrastructure.
