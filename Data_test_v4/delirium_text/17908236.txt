17908236|a|Impaired cognition and memory may be associated with down-regulation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) in the brain in patients with Alzheimer disease, but the molecular mechanism leading to the down-regulation is not understood. In this study, we found a selective reduction in the levels of the regulatory subunits (RIIalpha and RIIbeta) and the catalytic subunit (Cbeta) as well as the enzymatic activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which is the major positive regulator of CREB. We also observed that PKA subunits were proteolyzed by calpain and the levels of PKA subunits correlated negatively with calpain activation in the human brain. These findings led us to propose that in the brain in patients with Alzheimer disease, over-activation of calpain because of calcium dysregulation causes increased degradation and thus decreased activity of PKA, which, in turn, contributes to down-regulation of CREB and impaired cognition and memory.
