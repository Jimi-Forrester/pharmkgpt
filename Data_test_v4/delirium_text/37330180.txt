37330180|t|Paraoxonase 1 activity in patients with Alzheimer disease: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
37330180|a|Cumulating evidence links environmental toxicants, such as organophosphate (OP) pesticides, to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The calcium-dependent Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) can neutralize these toxicants with good catalytic efficiency, thus protecting from OP-induced biological damage. Although different previous studies have already partially described an association between PON1 activity and AD, this intriguing relationship has not yet been comprehensively examined. To fill this gap, we performed a meta-analysis of existing data comparing the PON1 arylesterase activity in AD and healthy subjects from the general population. Data were obtained by searching MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL, Google Scholar, and SCOPUS electronic databases for all studies published at any time up to February 2023, reporting and comparing the PON1- paraoxonase activity between AD patients and controls. Seven studies, based on 615 subjects (281 AD and 356 controls) met the inclusion criteria and were included into the final analysis. A random effect model revealed that PON1 arylesterase activity was significantly lower in the AD group compared to controls, exhibiting low level of heterogeneity (SMD = - 1.62, 95% CI = -2.65 to -0.58, p = 0.0021, I2 = 12%). These findings suggest that PON1 activity might be reduced in AD reflecting a major susceptibility to OPs neurotoxicity. Further studies should be conducted to definitely ascertain this link and to establish the cause-effect relationship between PON1 reduction and AD onset.
