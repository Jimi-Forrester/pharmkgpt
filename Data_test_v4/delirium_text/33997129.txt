33997129|a|PURPOSE: The guidelines on the management of patients with heart failure support intensive patient education on self-care. The present study aimed to evaluate the short-term and long-term impacts of a structured education provided by a qualified heart failure nurse on patients' self-care behavior and disease knowledge. METHODS: One hundred fifty patients (66 +- 12 years) hospitalized for heart failure participated in a structured one-hour educational session by a heart failure nurse. Patients completed a questionnaire comprising 15 questions (nine questions from the European Heart Failure Self-Care Behavior Scale [EHFScB-9] and six on the patients' disease knowledge) one day before and one day and six months after the educational session. Possible responses for each question ranged from 1 (complete agreement) to 5 (complete disagreement). RESULTS: After the educational session, the total EHFScB-9 score improved from 24.31 +- 6.98 to 14.94 +- 6.22, and the disease knowledge score improved from 18.03 +- 5.44 to 10.74 +- 4.30 (both P < 0.001). Scores for individual questions ranged from 1.26 +- 0.81 (adherence to the medication protocol) to 3.66 +- 1.58 (everyday weighing habits) before the education. The greatest improvement after education was observed on response to weight gain (-2.00+-1.57), daily weight control (-1.77 +- 1.64), and knowledge on the cause of patients' heart failure (-1.53 +- 1.43). At 6-month follow-up, EHFScB-9 score was 17.33 +- 7.23 and knowledge score was 12.34 +- 5.30 (both P < 0.001 compared with baseline). No factor was predictive of an insufficient teaching effect. CONCLUSIONS: The educational program led by a qualified nurse improves patients' self-care behavior and disease knowledge with a persistent effect at 6-month follow-up. There are no patient characteristics which preclude the implementation of an educational session.
