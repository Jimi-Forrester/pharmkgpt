39057095|t|Ashwagandha-Induced Programmed Cell Death in the Treatment of Breast Cancer.
39057095|a|The aim of this review is to provide experimental evidence for the programmed-death activity of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) in the anti-cancer therapy of breast cancer. The literature search was conducted using online electronic databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus). Collection schedule data for the review article covered the years 2004-2024. Ashwagandha active substances, especially Withaferin A (WA), are the most promising anti-cancer compounds. WS exerts its effect on breast cancer cells by inducing programmed cell death, especially apoptosis, at the molecular level. Ashwagandha has been found to possess a potential for treating breast cancer, especially estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PR)-positive and triple-negative breast cancer.
