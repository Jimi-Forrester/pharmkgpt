24894167|a|Some of the complexities of surgical interventions include neurological and psychiatric disturbances. Prompt identification and early treatment of these complications are pivotal in achieving excellent clinical results. Recognizing major adverse events such as stroke, seizure or delirium is usually straight-forward, however the discovery of less frequent or more subtle post-operative changes such as cognitive dysfunction might be delayed due to lack of appropriate diagnostic tools. This review summarizes biological markers that can be utilized as surrogates in evaluating surgery-related neuro-psychiatric disorders.
