38408521|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia in elderly individuals, characterized by memory deficits, cognitive decline, and neuropathology. The identification of preclinical markers for AD remains elusive. We employed an ultrasound-evoked spatial memory assay to investigate path integration (PI) in wild type C57BL/6 J and 5xFAD mice. We observed significant recruitment of the mammillary bodies (MB) and subiculum (Sub) - core regions of the Papez circuit during PI, as indicated by increased expression of the immediate early gene c-Fos in C57BL/6 J mice. In 5xFAD mice, amyloid-beta (Abeta) vulnerability in the MB and Sub was evident at 3-months of age, preceding widespread pathology at 5-months of age. In parallel, we detected significant behavioral deficits in PI in the 5XFAD mice at 5- but not 3-months of age. Sex based analysis revealed a more profound deficit in males compared to females at 5-months of age. Our data suggest PI may be as an early indicator of AD, potentially associated with dysfunction within the Papez circuit.
