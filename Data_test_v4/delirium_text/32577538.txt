32577538|t|Common neurodegenerative disorders in the perioperative setting: Recommendations for screening from the Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI).
32577538|a|Aging is associated with normal and abnormal brain and cognitive changes. Due to the expected increase in older adults requiring surgery, perioperative clinicians will be increasingly encountering patients with neurodegenerative disease. To help perioperative clinicians understand signs of abnormal behaviors that may mark an undiagnosed neurodegenerative disorder and alert additional patient monitoring, The Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) worked with experts in dementia, neuropsychology, geriatric medicine, neurology, and anesthesiology to provide a summary of cognitive and behavioral considerations for patients with common neurodegenerative disorders being evaluated at preoperative centers. Patients with neurodegenerative disorders are at high risk for delirium due to known neurochemical disruptions, medication interactions, associated frailty, or vascular risk profiles presenting risk for repeat strokes. We provide basic information on the expected cognitive changes with aging, most common neurodegenerative disorders, a list of behavioral features and considerations to help differentiate neurodegenerative disorders. Finally, we propose screening recommendations intended for a multidisciplinary team in the perioperative setting.
