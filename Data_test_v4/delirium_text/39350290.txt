39350290|a|BACKGROUND: Discomfort can be the cause of noninvasive respiratory support (NRS) failure in up to 50% of treated patients. Several studies have shown how analgosedation during NRS can reduce the rate of delirium, endotracheal intubation, and hospital length of stay in patients with acute respiratory failure. The purpose of this project was to explore consensus on which medications are currently available as analgosedatives during NRS, which types of patients may benefit from analgosedation while on NRS, and which clinical settings might be appropriate for the implementation of analgosedation during NRS. METHODS: The Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) selected a panel of experts and asked them to define key aspects of the use of analgesics and sedatives during NRS treatment. The methodology applied is in line with the principles of the modified Delphi and RAND-UCLA methods. The experts developed statements and supportive rationales which were then subjected to blind votes for consensus. RESULTS: The use of an analgosedation strategy in adult patients with acute respiratory failure of different origins may be useful where there is a need to manage discomfort. This strategy should be considered after careful assessment of other potential factors associated with respiratory failure or inappropriate noninvasive respiratory support settings, which may, in turn, be responsible for NRS failure. Several drugs can be used, each of them specifically targeted to the main component of discomfort to treat. In addition, analgosedation during NRS treatment should always be combined with close cardiorespiratory monitoring in an appropriate clinical setting. CONCLUSIONS: The use of analgosedation during NRS has been studied in several clinical trials. However, its successful application relies on a thorough understanding of the pharmacological aspects of the sedative drugs used, the clinical conditions for which NRS is applied, and a careful selection of the appropriate clinical setting.
