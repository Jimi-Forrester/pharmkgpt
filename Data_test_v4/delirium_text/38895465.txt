38895465|t|Acetaminophen Overdose Reveals Protease-Activated Receptor 4 as a Low-Expressing but Potent Receptor on the Hepatic Endothelium.
38895465|a|Background & Aims: Hepatic endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction and centrilobular hepatocyte necrosis occur with acetaminophen (APAP) overdose. The protease thrombin, which is acutely generated during APAP overdose, can signal through protease-activated receptors 1 and 4 (PAR1/PAR4). PAR1 is a high-affinity thrombin receptor that is known to signal on ECs, whereas PAR4 is a low-affinity thrombin receptor, and evidence for its expression and function on ECs is mixed. This study aims to exploit the high levels of thrombin generated during APAP overdose to determine (1) if hepatic endothelial PAR4 is a functional receptor, and (2) endothelial-specific functions for PAR1 and PAR4 in a high thrombin setting. Methods: We generated mice with conditional deletion(s) of Par1/Par4 in ECs and overdosed them with APAP. Hepatic vascular permeability, erythrocyte congestion/bleeding, and liver function were assessed following overdose. Additionally, we investigated the expression levels of endothelial PARs and how they influence transcription in APAP-overdosed liver ECs using endothelial Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification followed by next-generation sequencing (TRAPseq). Results: We found that mice deficient in high-expressing endothelial Par1 or low-expressing Par4 had equivalent reductions in APAP-induced hepatic vascular instability but no effect on hepatocyte necrosis. Additionally, mice with loss of endothelial Par1 and Par4 had reduced permeability at an earlier time point after APAP overdose when compared to mice singly deficient in either receptor in ECs. We also found that endothelial PAR1-but not PAR4-can regulate transcription in hepatic ECs. Conclusions: Low-expressing PAR4 can react similarly to high-expressing PAR1 in APAP-overdosed hepatic ECs, demonstrating that PAR4 is a potent thrombin receptor. Additionally, these receptors are functionally redundant but act divergently in their expression and ability to influence transcription in hepatic ECs.
