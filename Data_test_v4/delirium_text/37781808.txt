37781808|t|Cross-Sectional Analysis of Periodontal Disease and Cognitive Impairment Conducted in a Memory Clinic: The Pearl Study.
37781808|a|BACKGROUND: Periodontal disease (PeD) is a risk factor of Alzheimer's disease and is associated with cognitive decline in older adults. However, the relationships between subitems of neuropsychological tests and PeD have not been fully clarified. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associations between PeD and subitems of neuropsychological tests. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of data of 183 participants (women: 50% , mean age: 79 years) from a clinical study. We enrolled patients who visited our memory clinic and assessed demographics, dementia-related risk factors, neuropsychological tests, brain magnetic resonance images, and a dental screening check. We evaluated the relationships between cognitive function and PeD using multivariable logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Participants with dementia were less likely to make periodical visits to the dentist, had fewer teeth, had less frequent tooth brushing habits, and were more likely to have PeD. Impaired cognitive function was significantly associated with an increasing degree of PeD. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, impaired visuospatial function and attention were associated with twice the risk of moderate or severe PeD compared with individuals with preserved visuospatial function and attention (odds ratio: 2.11, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-4.29, p = 0.037). Impaired word recall and recognition and following commands were associated with increased risk of PeD (odds ratio: 2.80, 95% confidence interval: 1.41-5.32, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive decline, such as impaired visuospatial function, attention, word recall and recognition, and inability to follow commands were independently and strongly associated with PeD. These items can be assessed easily on a daily basis.
