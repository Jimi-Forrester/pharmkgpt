29079999|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP), one key player in Alzheimer's disease (AD), is extensively processed by different proteases. This leads to the generation of diverging fragments including the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, which accumulates in brains of AD patients. Subcellular trafficking of APP is an important aspect for its proteolytic conversion, since the various secretases which cleave APP are located in different cellular compartments. As a consequence, altered subcellular targeting of APP is thought to directly affect the degree to which Abeta is generated. The mechanisms underlying intracellular APP transport are critical to understand AD pathogenesis and can serve as a target for future pharmacological interventions. In the recent years, a number of APP interacting proteins were identified which are implicated in sorting of APP, thereby influencing APP processing at different angles of the secretory or endocytic pathway. This review provides an update on the proteolytic processing of APP and the interplay of the transmembrane proteins low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1, sortilin-receptor with A-type repeats, SorCS1c, sortilin, and calsyntenin. We discuss the specific interactions with APP, the capacity to modulate the intracellular itinerary and the proteolytic conversion of APP, a possible involvement in the clearance of Abeta, and the implications of these transmembrane proteins in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.
