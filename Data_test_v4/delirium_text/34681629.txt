34681629|a|A series of novel hybrid chalcone N-ethyl-piperazinyl amide derivatives of oleanonic and ursonic acids were synthesized, and their cytotoxic potential was evaluated in vitro against the NCI-60 cancer cell line panel. Compounds 4 and 6 exhibited the highest overall anticancer activity, with GI50 values in some cases reaching nanomolar values. Thus, the two compounds were further assessed in detail in order to identify a possible apoptosis- and antiangiogenic-based mechanism of action induced by the assessed compounds. DAPI staining revealed that both compounds induced nuclei condensation and overall cell morphological changes consistent with apoptotic cell death. rtPCR analysis showed that up-regulation of pro-apoptotic Bak gene combined with the down-regulation of the pro-survival Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 genes caused altered ratios between the pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins' levels, leading to overall induced apoptosis. Molecular docking analysis revealed that both compounds exhibited high scores for Bcl-XL inhibition, suggesting that compounds may induce apoptotic cell death through targeted anti-apoptotic protein inhibition, as well. Ex vivo determinations showed that both compounds did not significantly alter the angiogenesis process on the tested cell lines.
