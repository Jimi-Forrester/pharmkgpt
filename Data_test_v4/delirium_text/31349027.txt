31349027|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The fruit of Crataegus pinnatifida is a traditional medicine widely used as digestive drug in East Asia. Although Chinese herbal medicine used it for mental health, scientific evidence does not exist, yet. AIMS OF STUDY: The aim of this study is to show that the ethanol extract of the fruit of Crataegus pinnatifida (CPE) has neuroprotective effect on Alzheimer' disease model mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta was used to induce Alzheimer's disease-like pathology. Passive avoidance and Y-maze tasks were used to examine the effect of CPE on memory impairments by Abeta. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the effect of CPE on glial activation. ThT assay was used to observe the effect of CPE on Abeta aggregation. MTT and LDH release assays were utilized to examine effects of CPE on Abeta-induced cytotoxicity. RESULTS: CPE prevented memory deficit in Abeta-induced memory impairment model. Moreover, CPE prevented glial activation in the hippocampus of Abeta-injected model. In in vitro test, CPE inhibited Abeta fibril formation in a concentration-dependent manner. CPE also caused disaggregation of Abeta fibrils. Along with this, CPE blocked neuronal cell death induced by Abeta. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these experimental findings demonstrated that CPE could be a candidate for development of AD therapy.
