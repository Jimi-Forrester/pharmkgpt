11442892|t|A survey on the drug therapy for delirium.
11442892|a|Delirium, which is experienced by 10-30% of inpatients, is commonly seen in daily practice. A survey was conducted of the delirium medications, and results were obtained from 28 psychiatric departments and related facilities. Haloperidol was used in 67% cases for the treatment of delirium. Ninety-seven per cent of facilities considered haloperidol as the drug of first choice, while 57% thought this drug had few side-effects and was easy to use. However, because the use of this drug is not covered by health insurance in Japan, its use is limited. We expect that this study on medication for the treatment of delirium will be a first step in increasing the approved indications for drugs used for the treatment of delirium, and to reduce off-label use.
