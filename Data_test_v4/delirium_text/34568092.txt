34568092|t|Oral Microbiota Profile of Individuals Who Abuse Methamphetamine.
34568092|a|The poor oral health condition of individuals who abuse methamphetamine (MA) is well known. The roles of the oral and fecal microbiomes in addiction and nervous system diseases have been the focus of many studies. However, changes in the microbiota composition of MA users have not been reported. This was addressed in the present study in 20 MA users and 14 sex-matched healthy subjects. Saliva samples were collected and high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis were performed to evaluate oral microbiome profiles. The results showed that species richness was significantly lower in the MA group than in the control group. Bacterial taxa that are known to be related to oral diseases such as Negativicutes, Veillonellaceae, Veillonella, and Selenomonadales had higher relative abundance in the MA group than in the control group, and the relative abundance of Prevotella melaninogenica-a putative etiologic agent of periodontal disease-was also higher. Avoiding MA use and improving oral hygiene practices over a short term (i.e., during hospitalization for 2 weeks) did not alter the oral microbiota composition of MA users. Although the causal relationship between changes in oral microbiome profile and MA abuse remains to be determined, our results suggest that oral disease prevention and treatment strategies are important for MA users.
