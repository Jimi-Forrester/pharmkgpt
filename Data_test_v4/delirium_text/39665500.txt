39665500|t|Reducing in-hospital complications in older patients undergoing plastic surgery through a collaborative model of care.
39665500|a|BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence to support collaborative care and proactive comprehensive geriatric assessment and management in a number of surgical specialties. Data are lacking in older people under the care of plastic surgeons. This before/after study evaluates the impact of the introduction of a shared care model between geriatric medicine and plastic surgery in an Australian metropolitan teaching hospital. METHODS: A shared care model was implemented for all patients aged 75 years and older admitted electively and emergently under the plastic surgery team with patients admitted jointly under a plastic surgeon and geriatrician. Comprehensive geriatric assessment and management was undertaken on admission with tailored intervention along with regular inpatient review. The primary outcome of interest was rate of in-hospital complications. Secondary outcome measures included individual complications, length of stay, readmission, and discharge disposition. RESULTS: A total of 123 consecutive patients were eligible for inclusion (63 pre-intervention, 60 intervention). The rate of complications was significantly lower in the intervention group (47.6% vs. 28.3%, P = 0.03). There was a non-significant reduction in rate of delirium and new discharge to residential aged care facility. Subgroup analysis of frailer patients (Clinical Frailty Scale >=4) demonstrated a significant reduction in rates of delirium (44.4% vs. 15.6%, P = 0.02) and new institutionalization (18.5% vs. 0.0%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: A shared care model between geriatricians and plastic surgeons has the potential to improve patient outcomes with the greatest benefit likely to be seen in older patients with frailty.
