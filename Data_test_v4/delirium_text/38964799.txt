38964799|t|HAP-FAST: a feasibility study incorporating qualitative, mechanistic and costing sub-studies alongside a randomised pilot trial comparing chest x-ray to low-dose CT scan and empirical antibiotics to antibiotics guided by the BIOFIRE  FILM ARRAY  pneumonia plus panel in adults with suspected non-ventilator-associated hospital-cquired pneumonia.
38964799|a|INTRODUCTION: Non-ventilator-associated hospital-acquired pneumonia (nv-HAP) is the most common healthcare-associated infection (HCAI), is associated with high mortality and morbidity and places a major burden on healthcare systems. Diagnosis currently relies on chest x-rays to confirm pneumonia and sputum cultures to determine the microbiological cause. This approach leads to over-diagnosis of pneumonia, rarely identifies a causative pathogen and perpetuates unnecessary and imprecise antibiotic use. The HAP-FAST study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a randomised trial to evaluate the clinical impact of low-dose, non-contrast-enhanced thoracic CT scans and rapid molecular sputum analysis using the BIOFIRE  FILMARRAY  pneumonia plus panel (FAPP) for patients suspected with nv-HAP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The HAP-FAST feasibility study consists of a pilot randomised trial, a qualitative study, a costing analysis and exploratory analyses of clinical samples to investigate the immune-pathophysiology of HAP. Participants are identified and recruited from four acute hospitals in the Northwest of the UK. Using a Research Without Prior Consent model, the pilot trial will recruit 220 adult participants, with or without mental capacity, and with suspected HAP. HAP-FAST is a non-blinded, sequential, multiple assignment, randomised trial with two possible stages of randomisation: first, chest x-ray (CXR) or CT; second, if treated as nv-HAP, FAPP or standard microbiological processing alone (no FAPP). Pathogen-specific antibiotic guidance will be provided for FAPP results. Randomisation uses a web-based platform and followed up for 90 days. The feasibility of a future trial will be determined by assessing trial processes, outcome measures and patient and staff experiences. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has undergone combined review by the UK NHS Research Ethics Committee and Health Research Authority. Results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed journals, via the funders' website and through a range of media to engage the public. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05483309.
