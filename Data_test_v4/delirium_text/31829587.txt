31829587|t|Design, Synthesis, and Properties of a Chemically Tethered Amyloid-beta Segment Trimer Resistant to Intertrimer Mis-aggregation.
31829587|a|The oligomer species of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) may be relevant to the development of Alzheimer's disease. Isolating specific oligomer species of Abeta (i.e., dimers, trimers, tetramers, etc.), however, is difficult due to the transient, labile property of the oligomers. Here, we improved the resistance to intertrimer mis-aggregation of chemically tethered Abeta25-35 trimers by introducing charged structures to the cyclic peptide tether that is covalently attached to the Abeta chain. The resistance to aggregation of the chemically tethered trimers positively correlated with the number of negative charges at the tether. Thus, a chemical trimer possessing three malonic acids at the tether exhibited high resistance because of the attenuated self-association by anionic repulsion. In addition, the malonic acid trimer possessed amyloidogenic properties such as cross-beta-sheet structures, seeding activity, and cytotoxicity. This is the first study demonstrating that chemical modifications at the non-Abeta component enhance the resistance to aggregation of chemically tethered Abeta oligomers, by which the structural integrity of Abeta is maintained. Biological/biophysical evaluations of the intertrimer aggregation-resistant trimer may offer new, useful insights into the pathological functions of Abeta oligomers.
