35407569|t|Mortality and Epidemiological Changes in Proximal Hip Fractures in the Course of a Pandemic.
35407569|a|BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had an immense impact on the treatment protocols of orthopedic and trauma departments, yet its specific effect on mortality in patients with hip fractures due to possible surgical delays is still unclear. The purpose of this paper was to investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic worsened the mortality rate of hip fracture patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study comprised 175 prospectively included patients who (1) suffered from hip fractures, (2) presented during the Austrian state of emergency period from 15 March 2020 to 30 May 2021, and (3) were admitted to a level I trauma center. This cohort was compared with a retrospective control group of 339 patients admitted for hip fractures during the same timeframe in 2017, 2018, and 2019. RESULTS: An admission reduction of 22% in the COVID period compared with the pre-COVID period was evident (p = 0.018). The 30-day mortality rate was 14.67% (pre-COVID) compared with 15.18% (p = 0.381). No differences in surgical complication rates or relationships between comorbidity burden and survival were observed. There were no significant changes in demographic variables, except for admission rate, gender (p = 0.013), and place of accident (p = 0.049). CONCLUSION: Surgeons should be reassured to take COVID-19 precautions, as this study did not show higher perioperative mortality due to COVID-19 measures. Under the current circumstances, with possibly reduced surgical and hospital bed capacities, it is expected that hip fractures may continue to require a high degree of resources.
