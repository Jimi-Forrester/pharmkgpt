15749829|t|Interaction of N-terminal acetyltransferase with the cytoplasmic domain of beta-amyloid precursor protein and its effect on A beta secretion.
15749829|a|The processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) generates the amyloid beta-protein (A beta) and contributes to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Elucidating the regulation of APP processing will, therefore, contribute to the understanding of AD. Many APP-binding proteins, such as FE65, X11s, and JNK-interacting proteins (JIPs), bind the motif 681-GYENPTY-687 within the cytoplasmic domain of APP. Here we found that the human homologue of yeast amino-terminal acetyltransferase ARD1 (hARD1) interacts with a novel motif, 658-HGVVEVD-664, in the cytoplasmic domain of APP695. hARD1 expressed its acetyltransferase activity in association with a human subunit homologous to another yeast amino-acetyltransferase, hNAT1. Co-expression of hARD1 and hNAT1 in cells suppressed A beta40 secretion and the suppression correlated with their enzyme activity. These observations suggest that the association of APP with hARD1 and hNAT1 and/or their N-acetyltransferase activity contributes to the regulation of A beta generation.
