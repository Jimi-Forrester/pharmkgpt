28861608|t|Donepezil effects on cholesterol and oxysterol plasma levels of Alzheimer's disease patients.
28861608|a|Cholesterol is an essential component in the structure and function of cell membranes and has been associated with the major pathological signatures of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To maintain brain cholesterol homeostasis, it is converted into 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24OHC) which can be driven through the blood-brain barrier. Several studies have already described a decrease in 24OHC and an increase of 27(S)-hydroxycholesterol (27OHC) in AD, as a reflection of disease burden, the loss of metabolically active neurons and the degree of structural atrophy. It is also well known that peripheral cholesterol is altered in AD patients. However, there are no data regarding effects of AD treatment in this cholesterol pathway. Since a study from our group indicated a significant increase in membrane phospholipid metabolism by donepezil, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of short- and long-term donepezil treatment on cholesterol and metabolites 24OHC and 27OHC in plasma of AD patients and in healthy volunteers. At baseline, we found a decrease of 24OHC (p = 0.003) in AD patients. Cholesterol levels increased with donepezil treatment (p = 0.04) but no differences were observed regarding 24OHC and 27OHC. However, these results confirm and extend previous studies demonstrating disturbed cholesterol turnover in Alzheimer's disease.
