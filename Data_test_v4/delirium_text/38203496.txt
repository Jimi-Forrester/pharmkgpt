38203496|t|Comparative 4D Label-Free Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Bombus terrestris Provides Insights into Proteins and Processes Associated with Diapause.
38203496|a|Diapause, an adaptative strategy for survival under harsh conditions, is a dynamic multi-stage process. Bombus terrestris, an important agricultural pollinator, is declining in the wild, but artificial breeding is possible by imitating natural conditions. Mated queen bees enter reproductive diapause in winter and recover in spring, but the regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we conducted a comparative 4D label-free proteomic analysis of queen bees during artificial breeding at seven timepoints, including pre-diapause, diapause, and post-diapause stages. Through bioinformatics analysis of proteomic and detection of substance content changes, our results found that, during pre-diapause stages, queen bees had active mitochondria with high levels of oxidative phosphorylation, high body weight, and glycogen and TAG content, all of which support energy consumption during subsequent diapause. During diapause stages, body weight and water content were decreased but glycerol increased, contributing to cold resistance. Dopamine content, immune defense, and protein phosphorylation were elevated, while fat metabolism, protein export, cell communication, signal transduction, and hydrolase activity decreased. Following diapause termination, JH titer, water, fatty acid, and pyruvate levels increased, catabolism, synaptic transmission, and insulin signaling were stimulated, ribosome and cell cycle proteins were upregulated, and cell proliferation was accelerated. Meanwhile, TAG and glycogen content decreased, and ovaries gradually developed. These findings illuminate changes occurring in queen bees at different diapause stages during commercial production.
