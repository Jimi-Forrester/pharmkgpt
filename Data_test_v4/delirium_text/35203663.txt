35203663|t|Immunohistochemical Analysis of Neurotransmitters in Neurosecretory Protein GL-Producing Neurons of the Mouse Hypothalamus.
35203663|a|We recently discovered a novel neuropeptide of 80 amino acid residues: neurosecretory protein GL (NPGL), in the hypothalamus of birds and rodents. NPGL is localized in the lateral posterior part of the arcuate nucleus (ArcLP), and it enhances feeding behavior and fat accumulation in mice. Various neurotransmitters, such as catecholamine, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), produced in the hypothalamus are also involved in energy metabolism. The colocalization of neurotransmitters and NPGL in neurons of the ArcLP leads to the elucidation of the regulatory mechanism of NPGL neurons. In this study, we performed double immunofluorescence staining to elucidate the relationship between NPGL and neurotransmitters in mice. The present study revealed that NPGL neurons did not co-express tyrosine hydroxylase as a marker of catecholaminergic neurons and vesicular glutamate transporter-2 as a marker of glutamatergic neurons. In contrast, NPGL neurons co-produced glutamate decarboxylase 67, a marker for GABAergic neurons. In addition, approximately 50% of NPGL neurons were identical to GABAergic neurons. These results suggest that some functions of NPGL neurons may be related to those of GABA. This study provides insights into the neural network of NPGL neurons that regulate energy homeostasis, including feeding behavior and fat accumulation.
