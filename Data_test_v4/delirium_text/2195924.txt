2195924|t|[Proteins, genes and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease].
2195924|a|Proteic (neuritic plaques, amyloid substances...) and genetic characteristics of Alzheimer's disease are reviewed. An infectious origin appears unlikely. After production of specific antibodies, the reported abnormal Tau proteins might represent peripheral markers of the disease. Changes in olfactory neurons, accessible for biopsy specimens, might give rise to new biological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
