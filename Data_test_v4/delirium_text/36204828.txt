36204828|t|Agomelatine: a potential novel approach for the treatment of memory disorder in neurodegenerative disease.
36204828|a|Agomelatine is a selective agonist of melatonin receptor 1A/melatonin receptor 1B (MT1/MT2) and antagonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C receptors. It is used clinically to treat major depressive episodes in adults. The pro-chronobiological activity of agomelatine reconstructs sleep-wake rhythms and normalizes circadian disturbances via its agonistic effect of melatonin receptor 1A/melatonin receptor 1B, which work simultaneously to counteract depression and anxiety disorder. Moreover, by antagonizing neocortical postsynaptic 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C receptors, agomelatine enhances the release of dopamine and noradrenaline in the prefrontal cortex, increases the activity of dopamine and noradrenaline, and thereby reduces depression and anxiety disorder. The combination of these two effects means that agomelatine exhibits a unique pharmacological role in the treatment of depression, anxiety, and disturbance of the circadian rhythm. Emotion and sleep are closely related to memory and cognitive function. Memory disorder is defined as any forms of memory abnormality, which is typically evident in a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Memory impairment and cognitive impairment are common symptoms of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. Therefore, whether agomelatine can improve memory and cognitive behaviors if used for alleviating depression and circadian-rhythm sleep disorders has become a research "hotspot". This review presents the latest findings on the effects of agomelatine in the treatment of psychologic and circadian-rhythm sleep disorders in clinical trials and animal experiments. Our review evaluates recent studies on treatment of memory impairment and cognitive impairment in neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases.
