36163004|t|Dexmedetomidine pretreatment alleviates ropivacaine-induced neurotoxicity via the miR-10b-5p/BDNF axis.
36163004|a|BACKGROUND: Ropivacaine is commonly applied for local anesthesia and may cause neurotoxicity. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) exhibits neuroprotective effects on multiple neurological disorders. This study investigated the mechanism of DEX pretreatment in ropivacaine-induced neurotoxicity. METHODS: Mouse hippocampal neuronal cells (HT22) and human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) were treated with 0.5 mM, 1 mM, 2.5 mM, and 5 mM ropivacaine. Then the cells were pretreated with different concentrations of DEX (0.01 muM, 0.1 muM, 1 muM, 10 muM, and 100 muM) before ropivacaine treatment. Proliferative activity of cells, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and apoptosis rate were measured using CCK-8 assay, LDH detection kit, and flow cytometry, respectively. miR-10b-5p and BDNF expressions were determined using RT-qPCR or Western blot. The binding of miR-10b-5p and BDNF was validated using dual-luciferase assay. Functional rescue experiments were conducted to verify the role of miR-10b-5p and BDNF in the protective mechanism of DEX on ropivacaine-induced neurotoxicity. RESULTS: Treatment of HT22 or SH-SY5Y cells with ropivacaine led to the increased miR-10b-5p expression (about 1.7 times), decreased BDNF expression (about 2.2 times), reduced cell viability (about 2.5 times), elevated intracellular LDH level (about 2.0-2.5 times), and enhanced apoptosis rate (about 3.0-4.0 times). DEX pretreatment relieved ropivacaine-induced neurotoxicity, as evidenced by enhanced cell viability (about 1.7-2.0 times), reduced LDH release (about 1.7-1.8 times), and suppressed apoptosis rate (about 1.8-1.9 times). DEX pretreatment repressed miR-10b-5p expression (about 2.5 times). miR-10b-5p targeted BDNF. miR-10b-5p overexpression or BDNF silencing reversed the protective effect of DEX pretreatment on ropivacaine-induced neurotoxicity, manifested as reduced cell viability (about 1.3-1.6 times), increased intracellular LDH level (about 1.4-1.7 times), and elevated apoptosis rate (about 1.4-1.6 times). CONCLUSIONS: DEX pretreatment elevated BDNF expression by reducing miR-10b-5p expression, thereby alleviating ropivacaine-induced neurotoxicity.
