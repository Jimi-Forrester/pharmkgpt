39402135|t|Comprehensive risk factor-based nomogram for predicting one-year mortality in patients with sepsis-associated encephalopathy.
39402135|a|Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a frequent and severe complication in septic patients, characterized by diffuse brain dysfunction resulting from systemic inflammation. Accurate prediction of long-term mortality in these patients is critical for improving clinical outcomes and guiding treatment strategies. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the MIMIC IV database to identify adult patients diagnosed with SAE. Patients were randomly divided into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and multivariate logistic regression were employed to identify significant predictors of 1-year mortality, which were then used to develop a prognostic nomogram. The model's discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility were assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis, respectively. A total of 3,882 SAE patients were included in the analysis. The nomogram demonstrated strong predictive performance with AUCs of 0.881 (95% CI: 0.865, 0.896) in the training set and 0.859 (95% CI: 0.830, 0.888) in the validation set. Calibration plots indicated good agreement between predicted and observed 1-year mortality rates. The decision curve analysis showed that the nomogram provided greater net benefit across a range of threshold probabilities compared to traditional scoring systems such as Glasgow Coma Scale and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment. Our study presents a robust and clinically applicable nomogram for predicting 1-year mortality in SAE patients. This tool offers superior predictive performance compared to existing severity scoring systems and has significant potential to enhance clinical decision-making and patient management in critical care settings.
