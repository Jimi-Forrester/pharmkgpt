32526825|t|Insights into the Conserved Regulatory Mechanisms of Human and Yeast Aging.
32526825|a|Aging represents a significant biological process having strong associations with cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disorders, which leads to progressive loss of cellular functions and viability. Astonishingly, age-related disorders share several genetic and molecular mechanisms with the normal aging process. Over the last three decades, budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has emerged as a powerful yet simple model organism for aging research. Genetic approaches using yeast RLS have led to the identification of hundreds of genes impacting lifespan in higher eukaryotes. Numerous interventions to extend yeast lifespan showed an analogous outcome in multi-cellular eukaryotes like fruit flies, nematodes, rodents, and humans. We collected and analyzed a multitude of observations from published literature and provide the contribution of yeast in the understanding of aging hallmarks most applicable to humans. Here, we discuss key pathways and molecular mechanisms that underpin the evolutionarily conserved aging process and summarize the current understanding and clinical applicability of its trajectories. Gathering critical information on aging biology would pave the way for future investigation targeted at the discovery of aging interventions.
