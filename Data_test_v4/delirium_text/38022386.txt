38022386|t|Transient receptor potential channels as an emerging therapeutic target for oropharyngeal dysphagia.
38022386|a|Oropharyngeal dysphagia is a serious health concern in older adults and patients with neurological disorders. Current oropharyngeal dysphagia management largely relies on compensatory strategies with limited efficacy. A long-term goal in swallowing/dysphagia-related research is the identification of pharmacological treatment strategies for oropharyngeal dysphagia. In recent decades, several pre-clinical and clinical studies have investigated the use of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels as a therapeutic target to facilitate swallowing. Various TRP channels are present in regions involved in the swallowing process. Animal studies have shown that local activation of these channels by their pharmacological agonists initiates swallowing reflexes; the number of reflexes increases when the dose of the agonist reaches a particular level. Clinical studies, including randomized clinical trials involving patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia, have demonstrated improved swallowing efficacy, safety, and physiology when TRP agonists are mixed with the food bolus. Additionally, there is evidence of plasticity development in swallowing-related neuronal networks in the brain upon TRP channel activation in peripheral swallowing-related regions. Thus, TRP channels have emerged as a promising target for the development of pharmacological treatments for oropharyngeal dysphagia.
