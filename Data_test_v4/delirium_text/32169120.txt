32169120|t|Do epigenetic changes caused by commensal microbiota contribute to development of ocular disease? A review of evidence.
32169120|a|There is evidence that genetic polymorphisms and environmentally induced epigenetic changes play an important role in modifying disease risk. The commensal microbiota has the ability to affect the cellular environment throughout the body without requiring direct contact; for example, through the generation of a pro-inflammatory state. In this review, we discuss evidence that dysbiosis in intestinal, pharyngeal, oral, and ocular microbiome can lead to epigenetic reprogramming and inflammation making the host more susceptible to ocular disease such as autoimmune uveitis, age-related macular degeneration, and open angle glaucoma. Several mechanisms of action have been proposed to explain how changes to commensal microbiota contribute to these diseases. This is an evolving field that has potentially significant implications in the management of these conditions especially from a public health perspective.
