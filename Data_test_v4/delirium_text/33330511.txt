33330511|t|When Friendship Turns Sour: Effective Communication Between Mitochondria and Intracellular Organelles in Parkinson's Disease.
33330511|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease with pathological hallmarks including progressive neuronal loss from the substantia nigra pars compacta and alpha-synuclein intraneuronal inclusions, known as Lewy bodies. Although the etiology of PD remains elusive, mitochondrial damage has been established to take center stage in the pathogenesis of PD. Mitochondria are critical to cellular energy production, metabolism, homeostasis, and stress responses; the association with PD emphasizes the importance of maintenance of mitochondrial network integrity. To accomplish the pleiotropic functions, mitochondria are dynamic not only within their own network but also in orchestrated coordination with other organelles in the cellular community. Through physical contact sites, signal transduction, and vesicle transport, mitochondria and intracellular organelles achieve the goals of calcium homeostasis, redox homeostasis, protein homeostasis, autophagy, and apoptosis. Herein, we review the finely tuned interactions between mitochondria and surrounding intracellular organelles, with focus on the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, peroxisomes, and lysosomes. Participants that may contribute to the pathogenic mechanisms of PD will be highlighted in this review.
