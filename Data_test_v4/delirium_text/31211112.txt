31211112|a|The aim of this editorial is to evaluate the evidence for using pimavanserin for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We only identified two published trials that evaluated the use of pimavanserin among individuals with PDP. Both studies found that pimavanserin improved psychotic symptoms among individuals with PDP when compared to placebo. Pimavanserin was fairly well tolerated in both studies and did not appear to cause significant sedation or worsen motor symptoms among individuals with PDP. However, given the limited data, additional confirmatory studies are required before pimavanserin can be considered as a first line agent for the treatment of psychotic symptoms among individuals with PD.
