36209284|t|Association between multidimensional prognostic index (MPI) and pre-operative delirium in older patients with hip fracture.
36209284|a|Pre-operative delirium may cause delay in surgical intervention in older patients hospitalized for hip fracture. Also it has been associated with higher risk of post-surgical complications and worst functional outcomes. Aim of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate whether the multidimensional prognostic index (MPI) at hospital admission was associated with pre-operative delirium in older individuals with hip fracture who are deemed to require surgical intervention. Consecutive older patients (>= 65 years) with hip fracture underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment to calculate the MPI at hospital admission. According to previously established cut-offs, MPI was expressed in three grades, i.e. MPI-1 (low-risk), MPI-2 (moderate-risk) and MPI-3 (high risk of mortality). Pre-operative delirium was assessed using the four 'A's Test. Out of 244 older patients who underwent surgery for hip fracture, 104 subjects (43%) received a diagnosis of delirium. Overall, the incidence of delirium before surgery was significantly higher in patients with more severe MPI score at admission. Higher MPI grade (MPI-3) was independently associated with higher risk of pre-operative delirium (OR 2.45, CI 1.21-4.96). Therefore, the MPI at hospital admission might help in early identification of older patients with hip fracture at risk for pre-operative delirium.
