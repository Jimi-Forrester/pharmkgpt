33976542|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) in the old ages seriously delays the rapid recovery. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) against POCD in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic radical colon cancer surgery, as well as the potential mechanism. METHODS: A prospective, single-center, parallel-group, randomized trial was designed. A total of 100 patients (age >=65 years) undergoing laparoscopic radical resection of colon cancer were involved and randomly divided into TEAS (Group T) and control (Group C) groups. The patients in Group T were performed with percutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation in bilateral Hegu, Neiguan and Zusanli points from 30 minutes before anesthesia induction to the end of surgery. A Z-score based on Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) was used to assess the incidence of POCD. The levels of serum IL-6, hs-CRP, CGRP at 0 min before TEAS (T0), 1 h after beginning of surgery (T1) and the end of surgery (T2) were evaluated. RESULTS: Our data showed that the cumulative duration of POCD on postoperative day 2 and 3 in Group T was significantly decreased compared to Group C (P < 0.05). Compared with T0, the levels of serum IL-6, hs-CRP, and CGRP in both Group T and C were statistically elevated at T1 and T2 (P < 0.05). Moreover, the levels of serum IL-6 and hs-CRP were decreased, but the level of CGRP was increased in Group T compared to Group C at T1 and T2 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: TEAS is associated with a lower cumulative duration of POCD in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic radical colon cancer surgery, which may be related to the regulation of inflammatory factors and neuropeptides interacted with gut-brain axis.
