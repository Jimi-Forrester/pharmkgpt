34613845|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in elderly people with a high incidence rate and complicated pathogenesis, and causes progressive cognitive deficit and memory impairment. Some natural products and bioactive compounds from natural sources show great potential in the prevention and treatment of AD, such as apple, blueberries, grapes, chili pepper, Monsonia angustifolia, cruciferous vegetables, Herba epimedii, Angelica tenuissima, Embelia ribes, sea cucumber, Cucumaria frondosa, green tea, Puer tea, Amanita caesarea and Inonotus obliquus, via reducing amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition, decreasing Tau hyperphosphorylation, regulating cholinergic system, reducing oxidative stress, inhibiting apoptosis and ameliorating inflammation. This review mainly summarizes the effects of some natural products and their bioactive compounds on AD with the potential molecular mechanisms.
