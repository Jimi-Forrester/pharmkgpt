23813611|a|We previously developed remote reminiscence conversation and schedule prompter systems via the videophone to improve psychological stability and to assist individuals with dementia to perform household tasks. Our results showed that the psychological stability of 1 patient persisted for 3 hours after remote conversations. The task completion rate afforded by the schedule prompter system, which displays a video reminder series automatically, was 52%. In the present study, we also investigated whether psychological stability was sustained in other patients. Furthermore, motivational prompter videos were added to enhance the original schedule prompter system. We found that 1 in 4 patients living at home showed greater stability while conversing with a conversation partner on the videophone than while watching television programs, and that she remained stable for 3 hours after remote conversations. The task completion rate afforded by the revised schedule prompter system was 82%. These 2 remote systems are promising tools for assisting individuals with dementia in their daily lives.
