34352509|a|OBJECTIVE: Although histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) have been shown to be more likely to cause delirium than proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), these results were not adjusted for potential confounding factors. Accordingly, we investigated whether H2RAs and PPIs are risk factors for delirium, even when adjusting for other risk factors by analyzing adverse drug event reports compiled in the post-marketing stages of drugs provided by the Japanese regulatory authorities. METHOD: We analyzed 577,431 reports in the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database from April 2004 to July 2020. RESULTS: Of all reports analyzed, 2532 described delirium, and 574,899 described other adverse events. Delirium was associated with H2RAs (crude reporting odds ratio, ROR, 4.17; 95% CI, 3.34-5.22) but not PPIs (crude ROR 0.62; 95% CI 0.43-0.90). Even with adjustment for age, sex, history of dementia or depression, and concomitant drugs reported as risk factors for delirium, the use of H2RAs showed a significantly higher adjusted ROR than that of PPIs (H2RAs: adjusted ROR 3.99; 95% CI 3.18-5.01 and PPIs: adjusted ROR 0.58; 95%CI 0.40-0.84). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, from a cognitive perspective, PPIs may be preferable to H2RAs for patients with or at risk for delirium.
