39046944|t|Music-Based Interventions for Symptom Management in Critically Ill, Mechanically Ventilated Adults: A Scoping Review of the Literature.
39046944|a|Background: Patients in intensive care units experience high symptom burden during mechanical ventilation (MV). Pharmacologic symptom management is associated with side effects and increased morbidity. Music-based interventions (MBIs) have been associated with reductions in both anxiety in MV adults and pain for critically ill adults, yet their use for the management of other burdensome symptoms has not been evaluated. The purpose of this scoping review is to map the state of evidence for the use of prerecorded music listening MBIs for symptom management in MV adults. Methods: A systematic search of the literature was conducted across four electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science) for experimental designed studies that measured the efficacy of MBIs for the management of physical and psychological symptoms including anxiety, sedation/agitation, dyspnea, distress, delirium, sleep, stress, fear, loneliness, or depression in critically ill, MV adults between January 1, 1998, and April 18, 2023. Results: A total of 643 abstracts and 29 clinical trials were included. Overall, the risk of bias, assessed using the Evidence Project tool, was moderate. MBIs were mostly delivered with headphones using music selected either by investigators or from a limited selection. MBIs were associated with reduced pain, agitation, dyspnea, distress and anxiety, and improved tolerance of MV and sedative weaning. Outcomes of delirium were mixed. No studies explored sleep disturbances, fear, or loneliness. Conclusions: Use of MBIs improved symptom experience for critically ill adults during MV. Future studies employing unrestricted patient-preferred music selections and exploring outcomes of sleep quality, psychological distress, and delirium are needed in this highly symptomatic patient population.
