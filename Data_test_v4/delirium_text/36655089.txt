36655089|t|Chia seeds (Salvia hispanica L.): A therapeutic weapon in metabolic disorders.
36655089|a|The growth of functional components containing agricultural foods is enhancing because these components aid the human body against different chronic diseases. Currently, chia seeds basically belong to the mint family and are edible seeds of Salvia hispanica. These seeds are composed of different functional components including fiber, polyphenols, antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acid vitamins, minerals, and peptides. Besides, these seeds are also a good source of vegetable protein, unsaturated fat, carbohydrates, and ash. Chia seed components are helpful in cardiovascular disease (CVD) by reducing blood pressure, platelet aggregation, cholesterol, and oxidation. In GI-tract-related diseases like diabetes and constipation, chia fiber reduces the blood glucose level and provides bulk to stool. However, antioxidants and polyphenols are protected beta cells of the pancreas from inflammation. These components are protected from the cell damage of the different body parts, which can provide help in different types of cancer including breast, colorectal, liver, and pancreatic. Conclusively, some pervious studies approved that chia seed components are played important role in chronic diseases.
