38459768|a|AIMS/INTRODUCTION: We aimed to evaluate factors that influence changes in blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels after treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of outpatients newly initiated on SGLT2 inhibitors (n = 176) and other oral antidiabetic drugs (n = 227). The patients were classified into four subgroups according to statin administration and baseline LDL-C levels (<120 or >=120 mg/dL). Clinical characteristics were compared among the subgroups. Multivariate analysis was carried out to identify factors contributing to changes in LDL-C. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 13.0 weeks (range 11.9-14.1 weeks, min 8 weeks, maximum 16 weeks) in the SGLT2i group, and 12.0 weeks (range 10.0-14.0 weeks, min 8 weeks, maximum 16 weeks) in the control group. Both groups showed a significant decrease in LDL-C (SGLT2i group -3.8 +- 24.7 mg/dL, control group -3.4 +- 15.0 mg/dL). Multivariate regression analyses showed that in both groups, the change in LDL-C depended on statin use and baseline LDL-C levels. Stratified analyses showed that LDL-C level was significantly decreased in statin users with baseline LDL-C >=120 mg/dL (from 148.9 +- 33.5 to 109.3 +- 17.9 mg/dL, P = 0.002), and significantly increased in statin non-users with baseline LDL-C <120 mg/dL (from 96.3 +- 27.3 to 104.7 +- 24.8 mg/dL, P = 0.002). These changes were more characteristic for SGLT2 inhibitors than for other oral antidiabetic drugs (P for interaction = 0.010 and <0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: LDL-C levels and statin medication at baseline influence changes in LDL-C after SGLT2 inhibitors treatment in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.
