38912305|t|TOMM40 and APOC1 variants differentiate the impacts of the APOE epsilon4 allele on Alzheimer's disease risk across sexes, ages, and ancestries.
38912305|a|INTRODUCTION: The variability in apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4-attributed susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (AD) across ancestries, sexes, and ages may stem from the modulating effects of other genetic variants. METHODS: We examined associations of compound genotypes (CompGs) comprising the epsilon4-encoding rs429358, TOMM40 rs2075650, and APOC1 rs12721046 polymorphisms with AD in White (7181/16,356 AD-affected/unaffected), Hispanic/Latino (2305/2921), and Black American (547/1753) participants across sexes and ages. RESULTS: The absence and presence of the rs2075650 and/or rs12721046 minor alleles in the epsilon4-bearing CompGs define lower- and higher-AD-risk profiles, respectively, in White participants. They differentially impact AD risks in men and women of different ancestries, exhibiting an increasing, decreasing, flat, and nonlinear-with lower risks at ages younger than 65/70 years and older than 85 years compared to the ages in between-patterns across ages. DISCUSSION: The epsilon4-bearing CompGs have a potential to differentiate biological mechanisms of sex-, age-, and ancestry-specific AD risks and serve as AD biomarkers. Highlights: Younger White women carrying the lower-risk (LR) CompG are at small risk of AD.Black carriers of the LR CompG are at negligible risk of AD at 85 years and older.The higher-risk (HR) CompGs confer high AD risk in Whites and Blacks at 70 to 85 years.AD risk decreases with age for Hispanic/Lation women carrying the HR CompGs.Hispanic/Lation carriers of the LR CompG but not HR CompGs have higher AD risk than Blacks.
