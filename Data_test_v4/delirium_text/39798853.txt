39798853|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of diseases that pose a serious threat to human health, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). In recent years, it has been found that mitochondrial remodeling plays an important role in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial remodeling refers to the dynamic regulatory process of mitochondrial morphology, number and function, which can affect neuronal cell function and survival by regulating mechanisms such as mitochondrial fusion, division, clearance and biosynthesis. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an important intrinsic cause of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial remodeling abnormalities are involved in energy metabolism in neurodegenerative diseases. Pathological changes in mitochondrial function and morphology, as well as interactions with other organelles, can affect the energy metabolism of dopaminergic neurons and participate in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Since the number of patients with PD and AD has been increasing year by year in recent years, it is extremely important to take effective interventions to significantly reduce the number of morbidities and to improve people's quality of life. More and more researchers have suggested that mitochondrial remodeling and related dynamics may positively affect neurodegenerative diseases in terms of neuronal and self-adaptation to the surrounding environment. Mitochondrial remodeling mainly involves its own fission and fusion, energy metabolism, changes in channels, mitophagy, and interactions with other cellular organelles. This review will provide a systematic summary of the role of mitochondrial remodeling in neurodegenerative diseases, with the aim of providing new ideas and strategies for further research on the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
