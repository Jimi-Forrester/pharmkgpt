36470450|a|BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic presented unique and unprecedented challenges due to limited knowledge regarding the virus's transmissibility. With guidance from the Center for Disease Control (CDC), healthcare systems instituted widespread visitor restrictions. Hospitalization is a stressful time for patients. Visitor support can help minimize this during and after discharge. METHODS: A telephone interview was conducted among hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients discharged between March 1st - August 31st, 2021 to explore the patients and visitors' experiences and the impact of the visitor policy during their hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 238 patients were interviewed. For patients with visitors, 98% felt that the presence of visitors improved their overall wellbeing and satisfaction. Additionally, 86% reported that visitors were involved in helping with their care upon discharge. For patients with no visitors, 59% felt that having a visitor would have improved their hospital stay. Nearly 50% reported that the absence of visitors made it difficult for family members to remain updated and informed of their hospital care. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that visitation for COVID-19 patients can be done safely and that there is a positive impact on patient wellbeing with increased visitor access. As we move towards COVID-19 endemicity, implementing evidence-based visitation policies that maximize patient wellbeing will be essential.
