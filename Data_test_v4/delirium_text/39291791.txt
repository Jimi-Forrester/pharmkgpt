39291791|t|Atomically dispersed single-atom catalysts (SACs) and enzymes (SAzymes): synthesis and application in Alzheimer's disease detection.
39291791|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss. Conventional diagnostic methods, such as neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, typically detect AD at advanced stages, limiting the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Early detection is crucial for improving patient condition by enabling timely administration of treatments that may decelerate disease progression. In this context, single-atom catalysts (SACs) and single-atom nanozymes (SAzymes) have emerged as promising tools offering highly sensitive and selective detection of Alzheimer's biomarkers. SACs, consisting of isolated metal atoms on a support surface, deliver unparalleled atomic efficiency, increased reactivity, and reduced operational costs, although certain challenges in terms of stability, aggregation, and other factors persist. The advent of SAzymes, which integrate SACs with natural metalloprotease catalysts, has further advanced this field by enabling controlled electronic exchange, synergistic productivity, and enhanced biosafety. Particularly, M-N-C SACs with M-Nx active sites mimic the selectivity and sensitivity of natural metalloenzymes, providing a robust platform for early detection of AD. This review encompasses the advancements in SACs and SAzymes, highlighting their pivotal role in bridging the gap between conventional enzymes and nanozyme and offering enhanced catalytic efficiency, controlled electron transfer, and improved biosafety for Alzheimer's detection.
