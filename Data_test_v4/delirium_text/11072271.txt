11072271|t|Family issues in dementia: finding a new normal.
11072271|a|Caring for individuals with dementia poses significant hazards and can have lasting effects on the health, well being, and quality of life of family members. Families need guidance from physicians to support and maintain the dignity of the patient with dementia throughout the degenerative disease trajectory. There is a rational basis for family education and counseling strategies aimed at increasing effectiveness and reducing risks to families who provide care. Family care for patients with Alzheimer's should be directed toward defining a "new normal."
