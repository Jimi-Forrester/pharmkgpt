39860486|a|Background: Repetitive intramuscular injections of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) have become the treatment of choice for a variety of disease entities. But with the onset of BoNT therapy, the natural course of a disease is obscured. Nevertheless, the present study tries to analyze patients' "suspected" course of disease severity under the assumption that no BoNT therapy had been performed and compares that with the "experienced" improvement during BoNT treatment. Methods: For this cross-sectional study, all 112 BoNT long-term treated patients in a botulinum toxin out-patient department were recruited who did not interrupt their BoNT/A therapy for more than two injection cycles during the last ten years. Patients had to assess the remaining severity of their disease as a percentage of the severity at onset of BoNT therapy and to draw three different graphs: (i) the CoDB-graph showing the course of severity of patient's disease from onset of symptoms to onset of BoNT/A therapy, (ii) the CoDA-graph illustrating the course of severity from onset of BoNT/A therapy until recruitment, and (iii) the CoDS-graph visualizing the suspected development of disease severity from onset of BoNT/A therapy until recruitment under the assumption that no BoNT/A therapy had been performed. Three different types of graphs were distinguished: the R-type indicated a rapid manifestation or improvement, the C-type a continuous worsening or improvement, and the D-type a delayed manifestation or response to BoNT therapy. Four patient subgroups (cervical dystonia, other cranial dystonia, hemifacial spasm, and the migraine subgroup) comprised 91 patients who produced a complete set of graphs which were further analyzed. The "experienced" improvement and "suspected" worsening of disease severity since the onset of BoNT/A therapy were compared and correlated with demographical and treatment related data. Results: Improvement was significant (p < 0.05) and varied between 45 and 70% in all four patient subgroups, the "suspected" worsening was also significantly (p < 0.05) larger than 0, except in the migraine patients and varied between 10 and 70%. The "total benefit" (sum of improvement and prevented "suspected" worsening) was the highest in the other cranial dystonia group and the lowest in the migraine subgroup. The distributions of R-,C-,D-type graphs across CoDB-, CoDS-, and CoDB-graphs and across the four patient subgroups were significantly different. Conclusions: (i) Most BoNT long-term treated patients have the opinion that their disease would have further progressed and worsened if no BoNT/A therapy had been performed, (ii) The type of response to BoNT/A is different across different subgroups of BoNT/A long-term treated patients.
