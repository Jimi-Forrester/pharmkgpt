122459|t|[Pathophysiology of delirium].
122459|a|Based on a series of known facts on clinical findings and changes in the metabolism of chronic alcoholics and delirious people the possible pathomechanism of cerebral imbalances is presented according to a synopsis. The clinical symptomatology, in particular vegetative symptoms and the coordination of reflexes - to which more attention should be paid than has been up to now - make delirium appear a diencephalic illness, the sympathicotonic and ergotropic development of which together with a preponderance of noradrenergic-adrenergic mechanisms, remains unexplained to this day.
