38745220|t|Incidence and risk factors of postoperative delirium following hepatic resection: a retrospective national inpatient sample database study.
38745220|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication after major surgery and can cause a variety of adverse effects. However, no large-scale national database was used to assess the occurrence and factors associated with postoperative delirium (POD) following hepatic resection. METHODS: Patients who underwent hepatic resection from 2015 to 2019 were screened using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10th edition clinical modification code from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) Database. Peri-operative factors associated with delirium were screened and underwent statistical analysis to identify independent predictors for delirium following hepatic resection. RESULTS: A total of 80,070 patients underwent hepatic resection over a five-year period from 2015 to 2019. The overall occurrence of POD after hepatic resection was 1.46% (1039 cases), with a slight upward trend every year. The incidence of elective admission was 6.66% lower (88.60% vs. 81.94%) than that of patients without POD after hepatic resection and 2.34% (45.53% vs. 43.19%) higher than that of patients without POD in teaching hospitals (P < 0.001). In addition, POD patients were 6 years older (67 vs. 61 years) and comprised 9.27% (56.69% vs. 47.42%) more male patients (P < 0.001) compared to the unaffected population. In addition, the occurrence of POD was associated with longer hospitalization duration (13 vs. 5 days; P < 0.001), higher total cost ($1,481,89 vs. $683,90; P < 0.001), and higher in-hospital mortality (12.61% vs. 4.11%; P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression identified hepatic resection-independent risk factors for POD, including non-elective hospital admission, teaching hospital, older age, male sex, depression, fluid and electrolyte disorders, coagulopathy, other neurological disorders, psychoses, and weight loss. In addition, the POD after hepatic resection has been associated with sepsis, dementia, urinary retention, gastrointestinal complications, acute renal failure, pneumonia, continuous invasive mechanical ventilation, blood transfusion, respiratory failure, and wound dehiscence / non-healing. CONCLUSION: Although the occurrence of POD after hepatic resection is relatively low, it is beneficial to investigate factors predisposing to POD to allow optimal care management and improve the outcomes of this patient population.
