37033977|a|High-content imaging techniques in conjunction with in vitro microphysiological systems (MPS) allow for novel explorations of physiological phenomena with a high degree of translational relevance due to the usage of human cell lines. MPS featuring ultrathin and nanoporous silicon nitride membranes (microSiM) have been utilized in the past to facilitate high magnification phase contrast microscopy recordings of leukocyte trafficking events in a living mimetic of the human vascular microenvironment. Notably, the imaging plane can be set directly at the endothelial interface in a microSiM device, resulting in a high-resolution capture of an endothelial cell (EC) and leukocyte coculture reacting to different stimulatory conditions. The abundance of data generated from recording observations at this interface can be used to elucidate disease mechanisms related to vascular barrier dysfunction, such as sepsis. The appearance of leukocytes in these recordings is dynamic, changing in character, location and time. Consequently, conventional image processing techniques are incapable of extracting the spatiotemporal profiles and bulk statistics of numerous leukocytes responding to a disease state, necessitating labor-intensive manual processing, a significant limitation of this approach. Here we describe a machine learning pipeline that uses a semantic segmentation algorithm and classification script that, in combination, is capable of automated and label-free leukocyte trafficking analysis in a coculture mimetic. The developed computational toolset has demonstrable parity with manually tabulated datasets when characterizing leukocyte spatiotemporal behavior, is computationally efficient and capable of managing large imaging datasets in a semi-automated manner.
