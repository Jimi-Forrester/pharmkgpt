33153102|t|Is There Any Difference in the Outcome of Geriatric and Non-Geriatric Severely Injured Patients?-A Seven-Year, Retrospective, Observational Cohort Study with Matched-Pair Analysis.
33153102|a|Geriatric trauma is expected to increase due to the lifestyle and activity of the aging population and will be among the major future challenges in health care. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate differences between polytraumatized geriatric and non-geriatric patients regarding mortality, length-of-stay and complications with a matched pair analysis. We included patients older than 17 years with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 16 or more admitted to our level 1 trauma center between January 2008 and December 2015. The cohort was stratified into two groups (age < 70 and >= 70 years). One-to-one matching was performed based on gender, ISS, mechanism of injury (penetrating/blunt), Glasgow coma scale (GCS), base excess, and the presence of coagulopathy (international normalized ratio (INR) >= 1.4). Outcome was compared using the paired t-test and McNemar-test. A total of 1457 patients were identified. There were 1022 male (70%) and 435 female patients. Three hundred and sixty-four patients (24%) were older than 70 years. Matching resulted in 57 pairs. Mortality as well as length-of-stay were comparable between geriatric and non-geriatric polytraumatized patients. Complication rate (34% vs. 56%, p = 0.031) was significantly higher in geriatric patients. This indicates the possibility of similar outcomes in geriatric polytraumatized patients receiving optimal care.
