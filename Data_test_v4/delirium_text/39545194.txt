39545194|a|Escherichia coli is a bacterium with command and pathogenic variants. It has been implicated in the induction of several inflammatory conditions. Finding a biomarker for infection began many years ago. The challenge of using acute phase proteins (APPs) as biomarkers for infection is a promising target for many researchers in this field. Many APPs have been studied for their roles as biomarkers of E. coli infection. The following review aims to highlight recent trials that have approved the use of adiponectin, amyloid A, ceruloplasmin, C-reactive protein, Haptoglobin, and Pentraxin 3 as biomarkers for E. coli infection and assess the obtained results. In conclusion, despite the existing approaches for the use of APPs as biomarkers in E. coli infection, we recommend more precise studies to enable these markers to be more specific and applicable in clinical fields. APPs could be markers for systemic inflammatory conditions, regardless of the causative agent.
