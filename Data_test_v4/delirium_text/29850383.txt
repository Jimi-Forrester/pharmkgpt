29850383|t|What a Trainee Surgeon Should Know About Refeeding Syndrome: A Literature Review.
29850383|a|Refeeding syndrome (RFS) is potentially fatal, yet there is limited understanding regarding its management among general surgeons due in part to a lack of universally accepted guidelines for RFS diagnosis. The aim of this review is to equip general surgery trainees with the essentials of RFS including a review of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) best practice guidelines for RFS. We used the keywords "refeeding", "syndrome", and "hypophosphatemia" to search PubMed, Embase, and Medline databases. We reviewed approximately 130 indexed papers for relevance. Having profound knowledge of nutritional needs in critically ill patients will help trainee surgeons prevent illnesses in the spectrum of RFS, and, over time, this would immensely contribute to reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with RFS.
