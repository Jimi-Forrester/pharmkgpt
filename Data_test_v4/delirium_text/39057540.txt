39057540|t|Mapping Quality Indicators to Assess Older Adult Health and Care in Community-, Continuing-, and Acute-Care Settings: A Systematic Review of Reviews and Guidelines.
39057540|a|Quality indicators (QIs) play a vital role in enhancing the care of older adults. This study aimed to identify existing QIs relevant to the health and care of older adults in community-care, continuing-care, and acute-care settings, along with available information such as definitions and calculation methods. A systematic review of published review studies, grey literature, and guidelines was undertaken, utilizing six electronic databases searched for materials dated from 2010 to 2 June 2023. To be included in this study, the literature had to provide data on QIs in a setting involving older adults. This study included 27 reviews and 44 grey literature sources, identifying a total of 6391 QIs. The highest number of indicators (37%) were relevant to continuing care; 32% and 28% were pertinent to community- and acute-care settings, respectively. The process domain had the highest number of QIs (3932), while the structure domain had the fewest indicators (521). A total of 39 focus areas were identified, with the five most common areas being, in descending order, orthopedics/hip fractures, end-of-life/palliative care, appropriate prescribing, neurocognitive conditions, and cardiovascular conditions; these areas ranged between 10% and 6%. When mapped against the Quadruple Aim framework, most QIs (85%) were linked to improving health outcomes. This inclusive compilation of QIs serves as a resource for addressing various focus areas pertinent to the Quadruple Aims. However, few quality indicators have been designed to provide a comprehensive and thorough evaluation of a specific aspect, taking into account all three key domains: structure, process, and outcomes. Addressing the description and psychometric properties of QIs is foundational for ensuring their trustworthiness and effective application.
