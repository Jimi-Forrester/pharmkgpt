39070776|a|Gastric malabsorptive conditions may prevent patients from deriving benefit from orally administered medications intended for enteric absorption. While malabsorption is an increasingly common issue, current data on alternative oral options for agitation in these patients are very sparse. Sublingual (SL) asenapine is absorbed transmucosally, bypassing gut absorption, making it a viable consideration. We report on three patients, one with short bowel syndrome, one with viral gastritis, and one with aortic dissection who were trialed on SL asenapine for agitation after failing alternative antipsychotics. Two of these patients had an extensive history of psychiatric admissions for bipolar disorder and substance-induced psychosis. All three patients had significant reductions in agitation within 1-5 days, with no reported adverse effects. However, benefit of SL asenapine was hindered in two of these patients as they began inappropriately swallowing the medication, reducing bioavailability to nil. Clinicians should consider the use of SL asenapine for medically complex agitated patients where gastric absorption is questionable. There is an urgent need for guidelines on this matter, as well as more, alternative dosage forms for various medications that may help with agitation in this population.
