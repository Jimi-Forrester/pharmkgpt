36036188|t|Risk Factors of Delirium in Children in Pediatric Intensive Care Unit.
36036188|a|OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of delirium and its risk factors among children admitted to a Pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). METHOD: A descriptive study in which consecutive patients admitted to the PICU over a period of 12 months were screened daily for delirium using the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD) score. Treatment-related and demographic variables were collected and analyzed. The statistically significant risk factors for delirium were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression for independent associations. RESULTS: Among the 476 screened patients, 96 (20.2%) developed delirium. The independent risk factors associated with the development of delirium were respiratory failure (P<0.001), administration of benzodiazepines during PICU stay (P<0.001), and presence of multiple (>=2) risk factors for delirium (P<0.001). The mean length of PICU stay was significantly higher among delirious subjects with P<0.001. CONCLUSION: Delirium is a frequent complication in critically ill children, and recognition of associated factors may assist in early diagnosis and focussed management.
