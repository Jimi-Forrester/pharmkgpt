3396647|t|Delayed treatment with nerve growth factor reverses the apparent loss of cholinergic neurons after acute brain damage.
3396647|a|Previous studies have shown that the loss after brain injury of adult rat septal cholinergic neurons whose axons are transected can be prevented by immediate intraventricular nerve growth factor (NGF) administration. This loss of axotomized neurons may be due to a reduction in detectability of neurotransmitter-related enzyme rather than to neuronal death. Here we report that NGF treatment, started after most of the neurons were no longer detectable (i.e., 1, 2, and 3 weeks), induced a dramatic reappearance of the apparently lost cholinergic neurons. These results may have important implications for potential trophic factor treatments of CNS trauma and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's dementia, which are characterized by chronic and progressive losses in the function of specific sets of neurons.
