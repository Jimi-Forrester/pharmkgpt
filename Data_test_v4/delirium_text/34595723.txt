34595723|t|Effect of Different Modes of Administration of Dexmedetomidine Combined with Nerve Block on Postoperative Analgesia in Total Knee Arthroplasty.
34595723|a|INTRODUCTION: Dexmedetomidine (DEX) as a nerve block adjuvant can significantly prolong analgesia. However, whether perineural or systemic administration of DEX is more beneficial in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we evaluated the effects of perineural and systemic DEX administration on postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing TKA surgery. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients undergoing TKA under general anesthesia combined with femoral nerve block and sciatic nerve block to one of three groups: (1) ropivacaine plus perineural dexmedetomidine (DP): 0.25% ropivacaine 40 mL plus 0.5 mug/kg dexmedetomidine; (2) ropivacaine plus systemic dexmedetomidine (DS): 0.25% ropivacaine 40 mL plus systemic 0.5 mug/kg dexmedetomidine; (3) control group (C): 0.25% ropivacaine 40 mL. RESULTS: The average length of time until patients first experienced postoperative pain was significantly longer in the DP group (26.0 h [22.0-30.0 h]) than in the DS group (22.4 h [18-26.8 h]) and the control group (22.9 h [19.5-26.3 h], P = 0.001). For this result there was no significant difference between the DS and the control group. Compared with the DS and control groups, patients in the DP group had lower resting visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at 24, 48, and 72 h after surgery (P < 0.05). VAS activity scores at 12, 24, and 48 h after surgery in the DP group were lower than those in the DS and control groups, with a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). Compared with the DS and control groups, the amount of postoperative opioids in the DP group was also significantly reduced, and the number of people needing postoperative rescue analgesia was significantly lower, with a statistical difference (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the sleep satisfaction of patients in the DP group on the first night after surgery and the satisfaction with pain control at 72 h after surgery were both higher than those in the DS group and control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Perineural administration of DEX can significantly prolong the interval until patients report pain for the first time after TKA, relieve postoperative pain, reduce postoperative opioid dosage, and improve postoperative sleep quality and satisfaction with pain control. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, identifier ChiCTR1900025808.
