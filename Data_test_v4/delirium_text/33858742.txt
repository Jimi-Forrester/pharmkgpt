33858742|t|PKCalpha: Prospects in Regulating Insulin Resistance and AD.
33858742|a|Protein kinase C alpha (PKCalpha) is known to participate in various signaling pathways due to its ubiquitous and dynamic characteristics. Previous studies report that PKCalpha abrogates peripheral insulin resistance, and recent publications show that it takes part in regulating Alzheimer's disease (AD). Based on evidence in the literature, we have highlighted how many of the substrates of PKCalpha in its signal transduction cascades are common in AD and diabetes and may have the capability to regulate both diseases simultaneously. Signaling pathways crosslinking these two diseases by PKCalpha have not been explored. Understanding the complexities of PKCalpha interactions with common molecules will deepen our understanding of its regulation of relevant pathophysiologies and, in the future, may broaden the possibility of using PKCalpha as a therapeutic target.
