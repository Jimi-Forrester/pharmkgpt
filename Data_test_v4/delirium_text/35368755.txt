35368755|a|Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) has been recognized as a prospective target for the development of novel cancer therapeutics. Several PARP-1 inhibitors are currently being considered for anticancer drug development and clinical investigation. Lately, natural compounds seem to be excellent alternative drug candidates for cancer treatment. Rauwolfia serpentina is a medicinal plant traditionally used in Indian subcontinents to treat various diseases. This study has been designed to identify the bioactive compounds derived from R. serpentina for possible binding and inhibition of PARP-1 using the molecular docking approach. Thirteen compounds were found to interact with the target with a binding affinity greater than the value of -9.0 kcal/mol. After screening the physicochemical properties, only 5 ligands (ajmalicine, yohimbine, isorauhimbine, rauwolscine, and 1,2-dihydrovomilenine) were found to obey all the parameters of Lipinski's rule of five, showed maximum drug-likeness, and possess no significant toxicity. These ligands displayed strong interactions with target PARP-1 via several hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Therefore, these identified compounds derived from R. serpentina can be considered for drug development against cancer-targeting PARP-1.
