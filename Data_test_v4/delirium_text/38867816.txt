38867816|a|Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. The disease is characterized by many Lewy bodies appearing in the patient's cerebrum. DLB frequently presents with a variety of autonomic symptoms from the early or prodromal stages of the disease, and these are listed as supportive features in the diagnostic criteria. As several useful assessment methods for evaluating autonomic function in DLB have been reported, this review will focus on cardiovascular and respiratory dysfunction and its assessments. Cardiovascular disorders, such as orthostatic hypotension and abnormal heart rate variability, have been reported in DLB patients. Decreased myocardial uptake by metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy has been added as an indicative biomarker for DLB in the 2017 revision of the diagnostic criteria. We have reported reduced ventilatory response to hypercapnia, abnormal respiratory rhythm, and high frequency of sleep-disordered breathing as abnormalities of the respiratory regulatory system associated with DLB. Since autonomic dysfunction is highly prevalent in DLB from the early or prodromal phase of the disease and is associated with reduced activities of daily living and quality of life, the evaluation of autonomic dysfunction is also useful in the differential diagnosis of DLB from Alzheimer's disease. There are fewer studies on the respiratory regulatory system than on the cardiovascular system, thus further research is needed to explore its role in DLB.
