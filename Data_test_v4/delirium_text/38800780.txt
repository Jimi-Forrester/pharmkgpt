38800780|a|INTRODUCTION: Dementia poses a significant healthcare challenge globally, and healthcare providers must have adequate knowledge about its diagnosis, management, and support services. By assessing the knowledge level of primary care physicians in Riyadh, we can identify potential gaps and areas for improvement in dementia care, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life. This study holds promise in shedding light on the current state of dementia knowledge among primary healthcare physicians in Riyadh and offering insights into strategies to enhance dementia care in this region. METHODS: This cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted from the first of June 2023 to the end of December 2023 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A validated questionnaire was used to assess physicians' knowledge, attitude, and practice toward dementia. RESULTS: A total of 151 physicians completed the questionnaires. The majority were male (55%), below 30 years of age (88.1%), and family medicine residents (84.8%). Most (74.8%) recognized old age as the most significant risk factor; an overwhelming majority of participants (98.7%) could not identify the minimum course of treatment to judge a medication's effectiveness. The average score of correct responses (7.74 -+ 4.11) was equivalent to 38.7%. Furthermore, the average correct responses were significantly different among the different job levels of the participants. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study highlight a lack of knowledge among primary care physicians regarding dementia, emphasizing the crucial importance of physician education in this area. Additionally, the results strongly indicate the need for emphasis on dementia education within the undergraduate medical curriculum, family medicine curriculum, and physician training programs. By addressing these educational gaps, we can better equip physicians to provide optimal care and support for individuals with dementia, ultimately improving patient care and quality of life.
