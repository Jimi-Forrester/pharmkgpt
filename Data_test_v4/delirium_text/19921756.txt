19921756|a|Olivia is a 74-year-old caregiver for her husband of 50 years, Jim. In addition to the usual custodial requirements, she has assumed management of their finances, medical care, and home. During the past year, Jim's sleep has become severely disrupted, such that his nights and days are switched, and he has demonstrated periodic behavioral problems, such as emotional lability and threatening to hit Olivia when he becomes frustrated. Prior to Jim's diagnosis with Alzheimer's disease, Olivia led a very active social life. She has become socially isolated and frequently feels depressed, overwhelmed, and impatient with Jim.
