34345916|a|An uninterrupted energy supply is critical for the optimal functioning of all our organs, and in this regard the human brain is particularly energy dependent. The study of energy metabolic pathways is a major focus within neuroscience research, which is supported by genetic defects in the oxidative phosphorylation mechanism often contributing towards neurodevelopmental disorders and changes in glucose metabolism presenting as a hallmark feature in age-dependent neurodegenerative disorders. However, as recent studies have illuminated roles of cellular metabolism that span far beyond mere energetics, it would be valuable to first comprehend the physiological involvement of metabolic pathways in neural cell fate and function, and to subsequently reconstruct their impact on diseases of the brain. In this Review, we first discuss recent evidence that implies metabolism as a master regulator of cell identity during neural development. Additionally, we examine the cell type-dependent metabolic states present in the adult brain. As metabolic states have been studied extensively as crucial regulators of malignant transformation in cancer, we reveal how knowledge gained from the field of cancer has aided our understanding in how metabolism likewise controls neural fate determination and stability by directly wiring into the cellular epigenetic landscape. We further summarize research pertaining to the interplay between metabolic alterations and neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, and expose how an improved understanding of metabolic cell fate control might assist in the development of new concepts to combat age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease.
