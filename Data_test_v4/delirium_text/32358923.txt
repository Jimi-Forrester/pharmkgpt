Recent reports have pointed out that senescent cells accumulated in the body with aging might cause these aged-related pathologies. Cellular senescence is known as an irreversible cell cycle arrest induced by various stresses, and can function as an important tumor suppression mechanism to exclude the premalignant cells. In contrast, senescent cells provoke the phenomenon, termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, which causes the secretion of various inflammatory proteins, and it is at risk of facilitating chronic inflammation and oncogenic transformation to surrounding cells. We have previously reported that senescent cells secrete not only inflammatory proteins, but also extracellular vesicles (EV). EV include various cellular components, such as proteins, lipids and nucleic acids, which are proven to be important factors for cell-to-cell communication. Recent evidence suggests that EV secreted from senescent cells might contribute to tumorigenesis and age-associated pathologies as new senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors. In addition, we also showed that the EV secretion pathway is one of the essential defense mechanisms to maintain cellular homeostasis by excretion of intercellular toxic substances into extracellular space. Herein, this review shows the biological functions of EV secreted from senescent cells. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2020;   :   -  .
