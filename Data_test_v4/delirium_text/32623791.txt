32623791|t|Incidence and risk factors for acute delirium in older patients with a hip fracture: A retrospective cohort study.
32623791|a|This retrospective cohort study aimed to determine the incidence, and preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors for postoperative delirium in older patients undergoing surgical fixation of a hip fracture. Electronic medical records were examined of 260 patients who underwent a surgical fixation of a hip fracture between June 2017 and October 2018 at a university-affiliated tertiary care hospital in Victoria, Australia. Demographic, clinical, and perioperative data were examined for potential risk factors for postoperative delirium. Of the 260 patients, 63 patients (24.2%) developed delirium postoperatively. Univariate logistic regression analysis indicated that advanced age, comorbidity, cognitive impairment, dementia, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and antipsychotic usage were significant risk factors for delirium, while doses of paracetamol, fentanyl, and diazepam showed complex associations. Multivariate logistic regression analysis determined comorbidity and cognitive impairment as independent risk factors for the development of delirium. This study demonstrates the importance of evaluation of medications prescribed in the perioperative period as modifiable risk factors, in order to identify patients at high risk of delirium and enable targeted monitoring and treatment during patients' hospitalization.
