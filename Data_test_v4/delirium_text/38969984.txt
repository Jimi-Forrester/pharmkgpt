38969984|t|The impact of intraoperative hypotension on postoperative acute kidney injury, mortality and length of stay following off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: a single-center retrospective cohort study.
38969984|a|BACKGROUND: Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCABG) presents distinct hemodynamic characteristics, yet the relationship between intraoperative hypotension and short-term adverse outcomes remains clear. Our study aims to investigate association between intraoperative hypotension and postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI), mortality and length of stay in OPCABG patients. METHODS: Retrospective data of 494 patients underwent OPCABG from January 2016 to July 2023 were collected. We analyzed the relationship between intraoperative various hypotension absolute values (MAP > 75, 65 < MAP <= 75, 55 < MAP <= 65, MAP <= 55 mmHg) and postoperative AKI, mortality and length of stay. Logistic regression assessed the impacts of exposure variable on AKI and postoperative mortality. Linear regression was used to analyze risk factors on the length of intensive care unit stay (ICU) and hospital stay. RESULTS: The incidence of AKI was 31.8%, with in-hospital and 30-day mortality at 2.8% and 3.5%, respectively. Maintaining a MAP greater than or equal 65 mmHg [odds ratio (OR) 0.408; p = 0.008] and 75 mmHg (OR 0.479; p = 0.024) was significantly associated with a decrease risk of AKI compared to MAP less than 55 mmHg for at least 10 min. Prolonged hospital stays were linked to low MAP, while in-hospital mortality and 30-day mortality were not linked to IOH but exhibited correlation with a history of myocardial infarction. AKI showed correlation with length of ICU stay. CONCLUSIONS: MAP > 65 mmHg emerges as a significant independent protective factor for AKI in OPCABG and IOH is related to length of hospital stay. Proactive intervention targeting intraoperative hypotension may provide a potential opportunity to reduce postoperative renal injury and hospital stay. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR2400082518.
