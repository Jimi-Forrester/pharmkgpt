38922460|a|PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to analyse whether optical coherence tomography angiography (angio-OCT, OCTA) measurements can be a useful tool to differentiate central nervous system (CNS) involvement in rheumatic disorders (RD) from multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: A total of 85 patients- 41 with MS, 21 with RD with CNS involvement and 23 healthy controls were included in the study. All individuals underwent OCTA and the following parameters were measured in each eye separately: average foveal and parafoveal vessel density (VD), average foveal and parafoveal vessel length (VL) of the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP), as well as area, perimeter, and circularity of the foveal avascular zone. RESULTS: OCTA showed a VD reduction in the foveal region of the SCP in eyes of RD patients when compared to MS patients (21.96 +- 3.39 vs.23.88 +- 3.05 (p = 0.003)). There have been no significant differences in any of the assessed parameters that is average VD and total average VL in the foveal area of the SCP as well as of the DCP in the general population comprising healthy controls, MS and RD groups (p > 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that an OCTA finding of decreased VD in the foveal region of the SCP may be considered as a potentially useful biomarker of RD in comparison with MS patients.
