39408336|t|Activation of the Gut-Brain Interaction by Urolithin A and Its Molecular Basis.
39408336|a|Background: Urolithin A (Uro-A), a type of polyphenol derived from pomegranate, is known to improve memory function when ingested, in addition to its direct effect on the skin epidermal cells through the activation of longevity gene SIRT1. However, the molI ecular mechanism by which orally ingested Uro-A inhibits cognitive decline via the intestine remains unexplored. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the role of Uro-A in improving cognitive function via improved intestinal function and the effect of Uro-A on the inflammation levels and gene expression in hippocampus. Methods: Research to clarify the molecular basis of the functionality of Uro-A was also conducted. Results: The results demonstrated that Uro-A suppressed age-related memory impairment in Aged mice (C57BL/6J Jcl, male, 83 weeks old) by reducing inflammation and altering hippocampal gene expression. Furthermore, exosomes derived from intestinal cells treated with Uro-A and from the serum of Aged mice fed with Uro-A both activated neuronal cells, suggesting that exosomes are promising candidates as mediators of the Uro-A-induced activation of gut-brain interactions. Additionally, neurotrophic factors secreted from intestinal cells may contribute to the Uro-A-induced activation of gut-brain interactions. Conclusions: This study suggests that Uro-A suppresses age-related cognitive decline and that exosomes and other secreted factors may contribute to the activation of the gut-brain interaction. These findings provide new insights into the therapeutic potential of Uro-A for cognitive health.
