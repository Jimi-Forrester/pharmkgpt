34155260|a|There are increasing evidences showing the contribution of somatic genetic variants to non-cancer diseases. However, their detection using massive parallel sequencing methods still has important limitations. In addition, the relative importance and dynamics of somatic variation in healthy tissues are not fully understood. We performed high-depth whole-exome sequencing in 16 samples from patients with a previously determined pathogenic somatic variant for a primary immunodeficiency and tested different variant callers detection ability. Subsequently, we explored the load of somatic variants in the whole blood of these individuals and validated it by amplicon-based deep sequencing. Variant callers allowing low frequency read thresholds were able to detect most of the variants, even at very low frequencies in the tissue. The genetic load of somatic coding variants detectable in whole blood is low, ranging from 1 to 2 variants in our dataset, except for one case with 17 variants compatible with clonal haematopoiesis under genetic drift. Because of the ability we demonstrated to detect this type of genetic variation, and its relevant role in disorders such as primary immunodeficiencies, we suggest considering this model of gene mosaicism in future genetic studies and considering revisiting previous massive parallel sequencing data in patients with negative results.
