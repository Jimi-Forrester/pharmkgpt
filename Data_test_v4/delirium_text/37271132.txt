37271132|t|The Utility of Visual and Spatial Perception Tests in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.
37271132|a|Introduction Visual and spatial perception (VSP) are cognitive domains frequently assessed in the screening and neuropsychological assessment of dementia. Evidence suggests that VSP impairment is common in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite this evidence, the ability of VSP tests to discriminate between healthy older adults and people with AD remains mixed. The purpose of this literature review was to employ a systematic search strategy to identify empirical evidence supporting the diagnostic utility of VSP tests which may be used in the screening and diagnosis of AD. Methods Specified criteria were used to perform a systematic literature search of the PsycINFO and PubMed databases with no date restrictions. Relevant data from the selected studies was extracted and a published appraisal tool (The QUADAS-2) was used to evaluate methodological quality. Results Of the 144 articles returned, six studies and 11 VSP tests met review inclusion criteria. Four tests demonstrated both sensitivity and specificity values above 80%. A computerized 3D Visual Task demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity values (90% and 95% respectively). The quality of the identified studies was considered to be satisfactory. Identified limitations, and the implications of issues relating to study methodology are discussed, and recommendations for future research are suggested. Conclusion In conclusion, the evidence from this review suggest that certain tests of VSP may be a useful addition to the routine screening of AD.
