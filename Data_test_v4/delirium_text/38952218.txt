38952218|a|The hallmark of amyloidosis, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, is the deposition of amyloid fibrils in various internal organs. The onset of the disease is related to the strength of cytotoxicity caused by toxic amyloid species. Furthermore, amyloid fibrils show polymorphism, where some types of fibrils are cytotoxic while others are not. It is thus essential to understand the molecular mechanism of cytotoxicity, part of which is caused by the interaction between amyloid polymorphic fibrils and cell membranes. Here, using amyloid polymorphs of hen egg white lysozyme, which is associated with hereditary systemic amyloidosis, showing different levels of cytotoxicity and liposomes of DMPC and DMPG, changes in the secondary structure of the polymorphs and the structural state of phospholipid membranes caused by the interaction were investigated using vacuum-ultraviolet circular dichroism (VUVCD) and Laurdan fluorescence measurements, respectively. Analysis has shown that the more cytotoxic polymorph increases the antiparallel beta-sheet content and causes more disorder in the membrane structure while the other less cytotoxic polymorph shows the opposite structural changes and causes less structural disorder in the membrane. These results suggest a close correlation between the structural properties of amyloid fibrils and the degree of structural disorder of phospholipid membranes, both of which are involved in the fundamental process leading to amyloid cytotoxicity.
