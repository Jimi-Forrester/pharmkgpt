37837039|t|Dynamic Characterization of a Low-Cost Fully and Continuously 3D Printed Capacitive Pressure-Sensing System for Plantar Pressure Measurements.
37837039|a|In orthopedics, the evaluation of footbed pressure distribution maps is a valuable gait analysis technique that aids physicians in diagnosing musculoskeletal and gait disorders. Recently, the use of pressure-sensing insoles to collect pressure distributions has become more popular due to the passive collection of natural gait data during daily activities and the reduction in physical strain experienced by patients. However, current pressure-sensing insoles face the limitations of low customizability and high cost. Previous works have shown the ability to construct customizable pressure-sensing insoles with capacitive sensors using fused-deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing. This work explores the feasibility of low-cost fully and continuously 3D printed pressure sensors for pressure-sensing insoles using three sensor designs, which use flexible thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) as the dielectric layer and either conductive TPU or conductive polylactic acid (PLA) for the conductive plates. The sensors are paired with a commercial capacitance-to-voltage converter board to form the sensing system. Dynamic sensor performance is evaluated via sinusoidal compressive tests at frequencies of 1, 3, 5, and 7 Hz, with pressure levels varying from 14.33 to 23.88, 33.43, 52.54, and 71.65 N/cm2 at each frequency. Five sensors of each type are tested. Results show that all sensors display significant hysteresis and nonlinearity. The PLA-TPU sensor with 10% infill is the best-performing sensor with the highest average sensitivity and lowest average hysteresis and linearity errors. The range of average sensitivities, hysteresis, and linearity errors across the entire span of tested pressures and frequencies for the PLA-TPU sensor with 10% infill is 11.61-20.11 10-4 V/(N/cm2), 11.9-31.8%, and 9.0-22.3%, respectively. The significant hysteresis and linearity error are due to the viscoelastic properties of TPU, and some additional nonlinear effects may be due to buckling of the infill walls of the dielectric.
