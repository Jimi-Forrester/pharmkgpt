32490138|a|PURPOSE: To describe results of the Amyloid, Tau, Neurodegeneration (ATN) research framework classification in the Argentine-Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (arg-ADNI) cohort. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 12 dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT), and 14 normal controls were studied following the ADNI2 protocol. Patients were categorized according to presence or absence of the biomarkers for amyloid beta (Abeta; A: amyloid positron emission tomography [PET] scan or cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] Abeta42), tau (T: CSF phosphorylated-tau), and neurodegeneration (N: CSF total-tau, fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]-PET scan, or structural magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scan). RESULTS: A+T+N+ biomarker profile was identified at baseline in 91% of mild dementia patients, 20% of early MCI patients, 46% of late MCI patients, and 14% of control subjects. Suspected non-AD pathophysiology (SNAP, A-T-N+) was found in 8% of mild dementia, 20% of early MCI, 15% of late MCI, and 7% of control subjects. Conversion rates to dementia after 5-year follow-up were 85% in A+T+N+ MCI patients and 50% in A-T-N+ patients. CONCLUSIONS: We present initial 5-year follow-up results of a regional ADNI based on AD biomarkers and the ATN classification.
