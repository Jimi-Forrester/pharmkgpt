38178165|t|"VR is the future": perspectives of healthcare professionals on virtual reality as a diagnostic tool for dementia status in primary care.
38178165|a|BACKGROUND: Healthcare professionals (HPs) hold critical perspectives on the barriers and facilitating factors for the implementation of virtual reality (VR) dementia diagnosis tools in the clinical setting. This study aims to explore HP perspectives regarding the clinical implementation of dementia diagnosis tools using VR platforms. METHODS: An exploratory qualitative interview study was carried out between July and September 2022. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with HPs (n = 7) with clinical expertise in dementia diagnoses drawn from medicine, nursing and allied health practices. A hermeneutic phenomenological approach was used to frame the interview data across the dementia diagnosis pathway and application of new technology. RESULTS: HPs were on average 36.29 years old (SD = 11.56) with 11.85 years of experience (SD = 12.80, range:4-42). Analyses identified three main themes related to the contemporary methods of dementia diagnosis, dementia diagnosis and the medical landscape and HP perspectives on the usefulness and barriers of VR implementation. VR was considered an innovative prospect, with improved ecological validity compared to commonplace, current cognitive assessments. Concerns of time commitments, monetary costs and the validity of the new technology were identified as key barriers to implementation. Overall, implementation of a new diagnostic tool was considered a complex process. CONCLUSIONS: Our insight into general practice and nursing clinics can be supported to embed and integrate virtual reality platforms in primary care settings. Primary healthcare organizations require more funding and time related resources to produce a context in which VR tools could be implemented in a beneficial manner.
