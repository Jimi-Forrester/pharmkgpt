34066591|t|Serious Neurological Adverse Events of Ceftriaxone.
34066591|a|We described ceftriaxone-induced CNS adverse events through the largest case series of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) reports, from 1995 to 2017, using the French Pharmacovigilance Database. In total, 152 cases of serious CNS ADRs were analyzed; 112 patients were hospitalized or had a prolonged hospitalization (73.7%), 12 dead (7.9%) and 16 exhibited life-threatening ADRs (10.5%). The median age was 74.5 years, mainly women (55.3%), with a median creatinine clearance of 35 mL/min. Patients mainly exhibited convulsions, status epilepticus, myoclonia (n = 75, 49.3%), encephalopathy (n = 45, 29.6%), confused state (n = 34, 22.4%) and hallucinations (n = 16, 10.5%). The median time of onset was 4 days, and the median duration was 4.5 days. The mean daily dose was 1.7 g mainly through an intravenous route (n = 106, 69.7%), and three patients received doses above maximal dose of Summary of Product Characteristics. Ceftriaxone plasma concentrations were recorded for 19 patients (12.5%), and 8 were above the toxicity threshold. Electroencephalograms (EEG) performed for 32.9% of the patients (n = 50) were abnormal for 74% (n = 37). We described the world's biggest case series of ceftriaxone-induced serious CNS ADRs. Explorations (plasma concentrations, EEG) are contributive to confirm the ceftriaxone toxicity-induced. Clinicians may be cautious with the use of ceftriaxone, especially in the older age or renal impairment population.
