33233619|t|Sigma-2 Receptor-A Potential Target for Cancer/Alzheimer's Disease Treatment via Its Regulation of Cholesterol Homeostasis.
33233619|a|The sigma receptors were classified into sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptor based on their different pharmacological profiles. In the past two decades, our understanding of the biological and pharmacological properties of the sigma-1 receptor is increasing; however, little is known about the sigma-2 receptor. Recently, the molecular identity of the sigma-2 receptor has been identified as TMEM97. Although more and more evidence has showed that sigma-2 ligands have the ability to treat cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD), the mechanisms connecting these two diseases are unknown. Data obtained over the past few years from human and animal models indicate that cholesterol homeostasis is altered in AD and cancer, underscoring the importance of cholesterol homeostasis in AD and cancer. In this review, based on accumulated evidence, we proposed that the beneficial roles of sigma-2 ligands in cancer and AD might be mediated by their regulation of cholesterol homeostasis.
