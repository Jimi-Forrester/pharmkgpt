23723695|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of soybean-derived phosphatidylserine (SB-PS) (300 mg/day) in improving cognitive performance in elderly with memory complaints, following a short duration of 12 weeks' SB-PS administration. METHODS: SB-PS was administered daily for 12 weeks to 30 elderly volunteers with memory complaints (age range 50-90 years). Cognitive performance was determined by a computerized test battery and by the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (Rey-AVLT). Physical examination and blood safety parameters were part of the extensive safety analysis of PS that was performed. RESULTS: The computerized test results showed that SB-PS supplementation significantly increased the following cognitive parameters: memory recognition (P = 0.004), memory recall (P = 0.006), executive functions (P = 0.004), and mental flexibility (P = 0.01). The Rey-AVLT indicated that, following SB-PS administration, total learning and immediate recall improved significantly (P = 0.013 and P = 0.007, respectively). Unexpected results from the safety tests suggested that SB-PS significantly reduces both systolic (P = 0.043) and diastolic (P = 0.003) blood pressure. SB-PS consumption was well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported during the study. CONCLUSION: This exploratory study demonstrates that SB-PS may have favorable effects on cognitive function in elderly with memory complaints. In addition, the study suggests that SB-PS is safe for human consumption and may serve as a safe alternative to phosphatidylserine extracted from bovine cortex. These results encourage further extended studies in order to establish the safety and efficacy of SB-PS treatment.
