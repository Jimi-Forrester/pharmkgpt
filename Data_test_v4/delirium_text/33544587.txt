33544587|t|Component of Cannabis, Cannabidiol, as a Possible Drug against the Cytotoxicity of Abeta(31-35) and Abeta(25-35) Peptides: An Investigation by Molecular Dynamics and Well-Tempered Metadynamics Simulations.
33544587|a|In this work cannabidiol (CBD) was investigated as a possible drug against the cytotoxicity of Abeta(31-35) and Abeta(25-35) peptides with the help of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) and well-tempered metadynamics simulations. Four interrelated mechanisms of possible actions of CBD are proposed from our computations. This implies that one mechanism can be a cause or/and a consequence of another. CBD is able to decrease the aggregation of peptides at certain concentrations of compounds in water. This particular action is more prominent for Abeta(25-35), since originally Abeta(31-35) did not exhibit aggregation properties in aqueous solutions. Interactions of CBD with the peptides affect secondary structures of the latter ones. Clusters of CBD are seen as possible adsorbents of Abeta(31-35) and Abeta(25-35) since peptides are tending to aggregate around them. And last but not least, CBD exhibits binding to MET35. All four mechanisms of actions can possibly inhibit the Abeta-cytotoxicity as discussed in this paper. Moreover, the amount of water also played a role in peptide clustering: with a growing concentration of peptides in water without a drug, the aggregation of both Abeta(31-35) and Abeta(25-35) increased. The number of hydrogen bonds between peptides and water was significantly higher for simulations with Abeta(25-35) at the higher concentration of peptides, while for Abeta(31-35) that difference was rather insignificant. The presence of CBD did not substantially affect the number of hydrogen bonds in the simulated systems.
