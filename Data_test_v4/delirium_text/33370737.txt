33370737|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal levels of isoprostanes (IsoPs) have been established as biomarkers of oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD). The value of peripheral levels in the diagnostics of these diseases is less conclusive. The aim of this study was to determine serum 8-iso-prostaglandin-F2alpha (8-iso-PGF2alpha) levels in Bosnian AD and VD patients and to establish whether there is an association between 8-iso-PGF2alpha serum concentration and cognitive impairment (CI) in patients with dementia. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Serum levels of 8-iso-PGF2alpha were measured by enzyme immunoassay method in AD (n=30) and VD patients (n=30) and control subjects (CG, n=30). The AD and VD group were further stratified according to the level of CI. RESULTS: The serum 8-iso-PGF2alpha levels were significantly higher in the AD (74.00 pg/mL) and VD groups (38.00 pg/mL) compared to the CG (17.50 pg/mL). A significant difference in serum 8-iso-PGF2alpha levels between patients with moderate and severe CI was not established in either AD or VD. CONCLUSION: Serum 8-iso-PGF2alpha proved to be a good biomarker in AD and VD, however it cannot be recommended for the differentiation of moderate and severe CI.
