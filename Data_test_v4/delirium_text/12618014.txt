12618014|t|Preliminary studies on Alzheimer's disease using cDNA microarrays.
12618014|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a progressive impairment of memory and intellectual functioning. The disease is a complex multi-factorial disease with the involvement of several possible genes. To study AD, a high-density cDNA array was developed to characterize the mRNA expression profile of 14160 genes. The preliminary results support the amyloid cascade hypothesis as the mechanism of the disease.
