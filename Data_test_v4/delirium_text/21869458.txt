21869458|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and associated with the progressive accumulation of amyloid beta-peptides (Abeta) in form of extracellular amyloid plaques in the human brain. A critical role of Abeta in the pathogenesis of AD is strongly supported by gene mutations that cause early-onset familial forms of the disease. Such mutations have been identified in the APP gene itself and in presenilin 1 and 2. Importantly, all the identified mutations commonly lead to early deposition of extracellular plaques likely by increasing the generation and/or aggregation of Abeta. However, such mutations are very rare and molecular mechanisms that might trigger aggregation and deposition of Abeta, in the most common late onset AD are largely unknown. We recently demonstrated that extracellular Abeta undergoes phosphorylation by a cell surface-localized or secreted form of protein kinase A. The phosphorylation of serine residue 8 promotes aggregation by stabilization of beta-sheet conformation of Abeta and increased formation of oligomeric Abeta aggregates that represent nuclei for fibrillization. Phosphorylated Abeta was detected in the brains of transgenic mice and human AD brains and showed increased toxicity in Drosophila models as compared with non-phosphorylated Abeta. Together, these findings demonstrate a novel molecular mechanism that triggers aggregation and toxicity of Abeta. Thus, phosphorylation of Abeta could be relevant in the pathogenesis of late onset AD. The identification of extracellular protein kinase A should also stimulate pharmacological approaches to decrease Abeta phosphorylation in the therapy and/or prevention of AD.
