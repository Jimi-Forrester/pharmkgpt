37944734|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid-beta (Abeta) plays a crucial role in pathogenesis. Clearing Abeta from the brain is considered as a key therapeutic strategy. Previous studies indicated that Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen) could protect against AD. However, the main anti-AD components in Danshen and their specific mechanisms are not clear. In this study, pharmacological network analysis indicated that Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) was identified as the key active compound in Danshen contributing to protect against AD. Then, APP/PS1 double transgenic mice were employed to examine the neuroprotective effect of Tan IIA. APP/PS1 mice (age, 6 months) were administered (10 and 20 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. Tan IIA improved learning and anxiety behaviors in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, Tan IIA reduced oxidative stress, inhibited neuronal apoptosis, improved cholinergic nervous system and decreased endoplasmic reticulum stress in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, Tan IIA treatment reduced the level of Abeta. Molecular docking result showed that Tan IIA might block AD by upregulating Abeta-degrading enzymes. Western blot results confirmed that the expressions of insulin degrading enzymes (IDE) and neprilysin (NEP) were significantly increased after Tan IIA treatment, which demonstrated that Tan IIA improved AD by increasing Abeta-degrading enzymes.
