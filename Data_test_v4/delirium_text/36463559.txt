36463559|t|Macular function in patients with medium myopia.
36463559|a|PURPOSE: This work aims at assessing whether electrophysiological functional changes in the macular region appear in medium myopia, even in the presence of a normal macular OCT scan and how axial length correlates with macular OCT parameters in medium myopia. METHODS: The study included right eyes of 17 patients with myopia of medium degree (SE <  - 6D to >  - 3D). Control group consisted of 20 eyes of patients of age and sex that matched healthy controls with normal macular and optic nerve OCT results and normal axial length. Full ophthalmic examination (the distance best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, refractive error, the anterior and posterior segment of the eye in a slit lamp, the axial length of the eyeball) with OCT of the macular and optic disk and the PERG test were performed in the study and control groups. Only the patients with normal ophthalmic and OCT examination results were qualified. The interview covering questions on risk factors of myopia onset and progression such as prematurity, family history of myopia was carried out in both groups. In myopic group, the question relating to time of near work was also asked. Study and control groups were tested with the use of Shapiro-Wilk, Mann-Whitney, Student's t test, Pearson and Spearman's rank correlation tests. RESULTS: AL was significantly longer in myopia group (p < 0.01), and SE value was lower (p < 0.01). Longer implicit time of P50 was found in the study group, but amplitudes of P50 and N95 waves were not significantly reduced (p < 0.05). AL showed correlations with P50 implicit time (p < 0.05) and with reduction in retinal fiber nerve layer and ganglion cells and inner plexus layer (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Patients with myopia of medium degree have a dysfunction of retinal cone system of the macular region even when OCT scans show no abnormalities. Elongation of AL correlates with reduction in retinal fiber nerve layer and ganglion cells and inner plexus layer. Longitudinal follow-up studies may answer the question whether this increase in implicit time may be indicative of a faster myopia progression or of myopic retinal pathology, i.e., whether it may help to determine which patient would benefit from earlier or more intensive management of myopia progression.
