35086946|a|BACKGROUND: ADP-A2M10 specific peptide enhanced affinity receptor (SPEAR) T cells (ADP-A2M10) are genetically engineered autologous T cells that express a high-affinity melanoma-associated antigen A10 (MAGE-A10)-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) targeting MAGE-A10+ tumors in the context of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02. ADP-0022-003 was a phase I dose-escalation trial that aimed to evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of ADP-A2M10 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (NCT02592577). METHODS: Eligible patients were HLA-A*02 positive with advanced NSCLC expressing MAGE-A10. Patients underwent apheresis; T cells were isolated, transduced with a lentiviral vector containing the TCR targeting MAGE-A10, and expanded. Patients underwent lymphodepletion with varying doses/schedules of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide prior to receiving ADP-A2M10. ADP-A2M10 were administered at 0.08-0.12x109 (dose group 1), 0.5-1.2x109 (dose group 2), and 1.2-15x109 (dose group 3/expansion) transduced cells. RESULTS: Eleven patients (male, n=6; female, n=5) with NSCLC (adenocarcinoma, n=8; squamous cell carcinoma, n=3) were treated. Five, three, and three patients received cells in dose group 1, dose group 2, and dose group 3/expansion, respectively. The most frequently reported grade >=3 adverse events were lymphopenia (n=11), leukopenia (n=10), neutropenia (n=8), anemia (n=6), thrombocytopenia (n=5), and hyponatremia (n=5). Three patients presented with cytokine release syndrome (grades 1, 2, and 4, respectively). One patient received the highest dose of lymphodepletion (fludarabine 30 mg/m2 on days -5 to -2 and cyclophosphamide 1800 mg/m2 on days -5 to -4) prior to a second infusion of ADP-A2M10 and had a partial response, subsequently complicated by aplastic anemia and death. Responses included: partial response (after second infusion; one patient), stable disease (four patients), clinical or radiographic progressive disease (five patients), and not evaluable (one patient). ADP-A2M10 were detectable in peripheral blood and in tumor tissue. Peak persistence was higher in patients who received higher doses of ADP-A2M10. CONCLUSIONS: ADP-A2M10 demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and no evidence of toxicity related to off-target binding or alloreactivity. There was persistence of ADP-A2M10 in peripheral blood as well as ADP-A2M10 trafficking into the tumor. Given the discovery that MAGE-A10 and MAGE-A4 expression frequently overlap, this clinical program closed as trials with SPEAR T cells targeting MAGE-A4 are ongoing.
