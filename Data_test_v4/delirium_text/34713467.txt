34713467|t|Faim knockout leads to gliosis and late-onset neurodegeneration of photoreceptors in the mouse retina.
34713467|a|Fas Apoptotic Inhibitory Molecule protein (FAIM) is a death receptor antagonist and an apoptosis regulator. It encodes two isoforms, namely FAIM-S (short) and FAIM-L (long), both with significant neuronal functions. FAIM-S, which is ubiquitously expressed, is involved in neurite outgrowth. In contrast, FAIM-L is expressed only in neurons and it protects them from cell death. Interestingly, FAIM-L is downregulated in patients and mouse models of Alzheimer's disease before the onset of neurodegeneration, and Faim transcript levels are decreased in mouse models of retinal degeneration. However, few studies have addressed the role of FAIM in the central nervous system, yet alone the retina. The retina is a highly specialized tissue, and its degeneration has proved to precede pathological mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we describe that Faim depletion in mice damages the retina persistently and leads to late-onset photoreceptor death in older mice. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that Faim knockout (Faim-/- ) mice present ubiquitinated aggregates throughout the retina from early ages. Moreover, retinal cells released stress signals that can signal to Muller cells, as shown by immunofluorescence and qRT-PCR. Muller cells monitor retinal homeostasis and trigger a gliotic response in Faim-/- mice that becomes pathogenic when sustained. In this regard, we observed pronounced vascular leakage at later ages, which may be caused by persistent inflammation. These results suggest that FAIM is an important player in the maintenance of retinal homeostasis, and they support the premise that FAIM is a plausible early marker for late photoreceptor and neuronal degeneration.
