38645516|t|The untold story of starch as a catalyst for organic reactions.
38645516|a|Starch is one of the members of the polysaccharide family. This biopolymer has shown many potential applications in different fields such as catalytic reactions, water treatment, packaging, and food industries. In recent years, using starch as a catalyst has attracted much attention. From a catalytic point of view, starch can be used in organic chemistry reactions as a catalyst or catalyst support. Reports show that as a catalyst, simple starch can promote many heterocyclic compound reactions. On the other hand, functionalized starch is not only capable of advancing the synthesis of heterocycles but also is a good candidate catalyst for other reactions including oxidation and coupling reactions. This review tries to provide a fair survey of published organic reactions which include using starch as a catalyst or a part of the main catalyst. Therefore, the other types of starch applications are not the subject of this review.
