30777088|a|There has been a dramatic increase of deaths due to illicit fentanyl. We examined the pharmacology of fentanyl and reviewed data on the number of repeat doses of naloxone used to treat fentanyl overdoses. Multiple sequential doses of naloxone have been required in a certain percentage of opioid overdoses due to fentanyl. In addition, fentanyl appears to differ from other opioids as having a very rapid onset with high systemic levels found in overdose victims. A rapid competition is required by naloxone to out-compete large numbers of opioid receptors occupied by fentanyl in the CNS. Taken together, we propose that higher doses of naloxone are needed to combat the new era of overdoses due to the more potent synthetic opioids such as fentanyl.
