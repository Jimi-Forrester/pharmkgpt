37555919|t|A Comprehensive Overview of the Neural Mechanisms of Light Therapy.
37555919|a|Light is a powerful environmental factor influencing diverse brain functions. Clinical evidence supports the beneficial effect of light therapy on several diseases, including depression, cognitive dysfunction, chronic pain, and sleep disorders. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the effects of light therapy are still not well understood. In this review, we critically evaluate current clinical evidence showing the beneficial effects of light therapy on diseases. In addition, we introduce the research progress regarding the neural circuit mechanisms underlying the modulatory effects of light on brain functions, including mood, memory, pain perception, sleep, circadian rhythm, brain development, and metabolism.
