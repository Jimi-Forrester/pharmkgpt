37843214|t|The pathogenic mechanism of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
37843214|a|The onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is usually characterized by focal death of both upper and/or lower motor neurons occurring in the motor cortex, basal ganglia, brainstem, and spinal cord, and commonly involves the muscles of the upper and/or lower extremities, and the muscles of the bulbar and/or respiratory regions. However, as the disease progresses, it affects the adjacent body regions, leading to generalized muscle weakness, occasionally along with memory, cognitive, behavioral, and language impairments; respiratory dysfunction occurs at the final stage of the disease. The disease has a complicated pathophysiology and currently, only riluzole, edaravone, and phenylbutyrate/taurursodiol are licensed to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in many industrialized countries. The TAR DNA-binding protein 43 inclusions are observed in 97% of those diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This review provides a preliminary overview of the potential effects of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, including the abnormalities in nucleoplasmic transport, RNA function, post-translational modification, liquid-liquid phase separation, stress granules, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, axonal transport, protein quality control system, and non-cellular autonomous functions (e.g., glial cell functions and prion-like propagation).
