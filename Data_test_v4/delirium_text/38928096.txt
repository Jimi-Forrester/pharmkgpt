38928096|t|Exploring the Pathophysiology of Long COVID: The Central Role of Low-Grade Inflammation and Multisystem Involvement.
38928096|a|Long COVID (LC), also referred to as Post COVID-19 Condition, Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC), and other terms, represents a complex multisystem disease persisting after the acute phase of COVID-19. Characterized by a myriad of symptoms across different organ systems, LC presents significant diagnostic and management challenges. Central to the disorder is the role of low-grade inflammation, a non-classical inflammatory response that contributes to the chronicity and diversity of symptoms observed. This review explores the pathophysiological underpinnings of LC, emphasizing the importance of low-grade inflammation as a core component. By delineating the pathogenetic relationships and clinical manifestations of LC, this article highlights the necessity for an integrated approach that employs both personalized medicine and standardized protocols aimed at mitigating long-term consequences. The insights gained not only enhance our understanding of LC but also inform the development of therapeutic strategies that could be applicable to other chronic conditions with similar pathophysiological features.
