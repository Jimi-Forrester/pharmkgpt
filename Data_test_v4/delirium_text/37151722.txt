37151722|a|Objective: Evaluating clinical factors associated with mortality in older patients who underwent surgical correction of hip fractures. Methods: This observational and retrospective study analyzed the medical records of 67 patients (aged older than 60 years), both men and women, who underwent surgical correction of hip fractures from 2019 to 2020 at Hospital Sao Paulo. The following variables were analyzed: age, sex, presence of comorbidities, affected hip region, and trauma mechanism. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software. Results: The mean age of patients was 78.12 +- 9.80 years and 80.6% of the sample were women. The prevalence of hip fractures on the right side (52.2%), in the transtrochanteric region (53.7%), and due to fall on the same level (88.1%) was higher. Systemic arterial hypertension (77.6%), diabetes mellitus (37.3%), and dementia (16.4%) were frequent comorbidities. The prevalence of death after fracture was 17.9% and it was associated with longer hospital stay after surgery (p = 0.028). Conclusion: The prevalence of mortality of patients with hip fractures who underwent surgery was 17.9%. A longer hospital stay due to pre-existing comorbidities was the main factor related to this outcome. Level of Evidence III, Retrospective Study.
