25241759|t|Pilot study on the European Portuguese version of the Confusion Assessment Method.
25241759|a|OBJECTIVE: To present the pilot study on the European Portuguese validation of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). METHODS: The translation process was carried out according to International Society Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research guidelines with trained researchers and inter-rater reliability assessment. The study included 50 elderly patients, admitted (>=24 h) to two intermediate care units. Exclusion criteria were: Glasgow Coma Scale (total score <=11), blindness/deafness, inability to communicate and not able to speak Portuguese. The sensitivity and specificity of CAM were assessed, with DSM-IV-TR criteria of delirium used as a reference standard. RESULTS: Findings revealed excellent inter-rater reliability (k>0.81), moderate sensitivity (73%) and excellent specificity (95%). CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggested that this version emerges as a promising diagnostic instrument for delirium.
