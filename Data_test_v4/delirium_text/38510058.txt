38510058|a|Perimenopausal syndrome (PMS) encompasses neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as hot flashes and depression, which are associated with alterations in the 5-HTergic neural pathway in the brain. However, the specific changes and mechanisms underlying these alterations remain unclear. In this study, ovariectomized mice were used to successfully establish a perimenopause model, and the changes in the expression of 5-HT and its receptors (5-HT1AR and 5-HT2AR) across 72 brain regions in these ovariectomized mice were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Although both 5-HT and 5-HT1AR were widely expressed throughout the brain, only a limited number of regions expressed 5-HT2AR. Notably, decreased expression of 5-HT was observed across almost all brain regions in the ovariectomy (OVX) group compared with the Sham group. Altered expression of both receptors was found within areas related to hot flashes (the preoptic area) or mood disorders (the amygdala). Additionally, reduced oestrogen receptor (ER)alpha/beta expression was detected in cells in the raphe nucleus (RN), an area known to regulate body temperature. Results showed that ERalpha/beta positively regulate the transcriptional activity of the enzymes TPH2/MAOA, which are involved in serotonin metabolism during perimenopause. This study revealed the changes in 5-HT neuropathways (5-HT, 5-HT1AR and 5-HT2AR) in perimenopausal mice, mainly in brain regions related to regulation of the body temperature, mood, sleep and memory. This study clarified that the expression of oestrogen receptor decreased in perimenopause, which regulated the transcription levels of TPH2 and MAOA, and ultimately led to the reduction of 5-HT content, providing a new target for clinical diagnosis and treatment of perimenopausal diseases.
