30824517|t|Delirium Monitoring: Yes or No? That Is The Question.
30824517|a|Delirium, one of the most common manifestations of acute brain dysfunction, is a serious complication in patients receiving care throughout the hospital and a strong predictor of worse outcome. Although delirium monitoring is advocated in numerous evidence-based guidelines as part of routine clinical care, it is still not widely and consistently performed at the bedside in different patient care settings. In a debate on delirium monitoring in hospitalized patients at the 7th American Delirium Society meeting in Nashville, Tennessee, June 2017, areas related to the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of routine delirium monitoring of hospitalized patients were identified, and arguments both for (pro) and against (con) the practice were presented. These arguments and others arising in the discussion were subsequently expanded. The goals were to present a conversation among clinicians and researchers from different settings and to identify the evidence-practice gaps for delirium monitoring for future research and organizational quality improvement programs. Further research is needed to determine whether or not delirium monitoring should become routine clinical care for every patient in every hospital setting.
