36810468|t|Thwarting Alzheimer's Disease through Healthy Lifestyle Habits: Hope for the Future.
36810468|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that slowly disintegrates memory and thinking skills. Age is known to be the major risk factor in AD, but there are several nonmodifiable and modifiable causes. The nonmodifiable risk factors such as family history, high cholesterol, head injuries, gender, pollution, and genetic aberrations are reported to expediate disease progression. The modifiable risk factors of AD that may help prevent or delay the onset of AD in liable people, which this review focuses on, includes lifestyle, diet, substance use, lack of physical and mental activity, social life, sleep, among other causes. We also discuss how mitigating underlying conditions such as hearing loss and cardiovascular complications could be beneficial in preventing cognitive decline. As the current medications can only treat the manifestations of AD and not the underlying process, healthy lifestyle choices associated with modifiable factors is the best alternative strategy to combat the disease.
