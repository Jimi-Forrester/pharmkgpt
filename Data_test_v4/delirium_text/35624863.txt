35624863|t|Comparative Proteomic Analysis Reveals the Effect of Selenoprotein W Deficiency on Oligodendrogenesis in Fear Memory.
35624863|a|The essential trace element selenium plays an important role in maintaining brain function. Selenoprotein W (SELENOW), the smallest selenoprotein that has been identified in mammals, is sensitive to selenium levels and abundantly expressed in the brain. However, its biological role in the brain remains to be clarified. Here, we studied the morphological and functional changes in the brain caused by SELENOW deficiency using its gene knockout (KO) mouse models. Histomorphological alterations of the amygdala and hippocampus, specifically in the female SELENOW KO mice, were observed, ultimately resulting in less anxiety-like behavior and impaired contextual fear memory. Fear conditioning (FC) provokes rapidly intricate responses involving neuroplasticity and oligodendrogenesis. During this process, the females generally show stronger contextual FC than males. To characterize the effect of SELENOW deletion on FC, specifically in the female mice, a Tandem mass tag (TMT)-based comparative proteomic approach was applied. Notably, compared to the wildtype (WT) no shock (NS) mice, the female SELENOW KO NS mice shared lots of common differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) with the WT FC mice in the hippocampus, enriched in the biological process of ensheathment and oligodendrocyte differentiation. Immunostaining and Western blotting analyses further confirmed the proteomic results. Our work may provide a holistic perspective of gender-specific SELENOW function in the brain and highlighted its role in oligodendrogenesis during fear memory.
