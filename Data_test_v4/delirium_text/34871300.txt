34871300|t|New correlations between ocular parameters and disease severity in Spanish patients with Gaucher's disease Type I.
34871300|a|BACKGROUND: Gaucher's disease is associated with a high variety of structural and functional abnormalities in the eye, which do not always affect visual acuity. The purpose of this study was to analyse ocular features in Spanish patients with Gaucher's disease type I, and to investigate their possible correlation with phenotypic and burden parameters of this entity. METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study compared parameters belonging to 18 eyes from 9 Spanish patients with Gaucher's disease Type I with 80 eyes from 40 healthy controls. Complete ophthalmological examination included choroidal and retinal thickness maps with swept source optical coherence tomography. Systemic analysis included genotype, plasmatic biomarkers, [ferritin, chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18) and chitotriosidase (ChT)] and severity scoring systems results ["Gaucher Disease Severity Score Index Type I" (GauSSI-I) and "Gaucher disease severity scoring system" (GD-DS3)]. RESULTS: Nine subjects (18 eyes) were cases (female: 55.5%, mean age 45 years; male: 44.5%, mean age 36 years) and 40 subjects (80 eyes) were controls (female: 49%, mean age 50 years; male: 51%, mean age 55 years). There were no statistically significant differences when comparing ocular parameters (visual acuity; axial length, refractive errors, corneal parameters, lens, retinal and choroidal thickness) between case and control subjects (p>0.05). A statistically significant moderate correlation was observed between lower retinal thickness and choroidal quadrants thickness and greater disease severity scores. A lower central retinal thickness also correlates with higher biological plasmatic levels, and has a statistically significant association with the most affected patient with genotype N370S/Del 55pb. Conversely, higher pachymetry involves a more severe plasmatic concentration of biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that pachymetry, and retinal and choroidal thickness, are associated with burden biomarkers and disease severity index scores in Spanish patients with Gaucher's disease Type I.
