28572899|t|Luminescent chemosensors by using cyclometalated iridium(iii) complexes and their applications.
28572899|a|Luminescent metal complexes have found increasing use in multiple areas of science and technology, including in chemosensing, light-emitting devices and photochemistry. In particular, the use of cyclometalated iridium(iii) complexes as chemosensors has received increasing attention in the recent literature. Phosphorescent metal complexes enjoy a number of advantages (e.g., long-lived phosphorescence, high quantum efficiency and modular syntheses) that render them as suitable alternatives to organic dyes for sensing a variety of analytes. This review describes recent examples of cyclometalated iridium(iii) complexes that act as luminescent chemosensors for cations, anions or small molecules.
