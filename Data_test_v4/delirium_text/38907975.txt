38907975|a|A case is presented of a 64-year-old male patient who was admitted because of delirium, jaundice, a pattern of cholestasis in the liver profile and a right lung mass in the context of a constitutional syndrome and weight loss in the last eight months. The lung mass was punctured and the culture of the obtained material developed white colonies, identified by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) as Nocardia cyriacigeorgica. Regarding the clinical diagnosis, it was considered as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), on the basis of fulfilling 8 criteria according to SLICC 2012 group, and 24 points according to EULAR/ACR 2019. The liver biopsy showed a mixt cellular infiltrate in portal spaces, with absence of interphase hepatitis and presence of peripheral ductular reaction. These findings were interpreted as liver compromise relate to SLE. Delirium was also considered as a neurological manifestation related to SLE on the basis of ruling out other causes. After being treated with antibiotics and documenting a reduction in the size of the lung mass he received cyclophosphamide in intravenous pulses, achieving normalization of his liver profile and his state of consciousness, and a progressively weight recovering. A year after he was in good health. The report of this case is justified because of the rare presenting form of late onset SLE, as well as the concomitant pulmonary nocardiosis in the absence of previous immunosuppressant treatment.
