28222510|t|Visuospatial Functioning in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy: A Pilot Study.
28222510|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a contributor to cognitive impairment in the elderly. We hypothesized that the posterior cortical predilection of CAA would cause visual-processing impairment. We systematically evaluated visuospatial abilities in 22 non-demented CAA patients. Neurocognitive evaluation demonstrated visuoperceptual impairment (23% on Benton Facial Recognition Test [BFRT] and 13.6% on Benton Judgment of Line Orientation Test [BJLO]). BFRT was inversely correlated with white matter hyperintensities volume and BJLO with parietal cerebral microbleeds. This pilot study highlights the presence of visual-processing deficits in CAA. The impairment could be related to global disease severity in addition to local brain injury.
