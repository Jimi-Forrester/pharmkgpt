38998736|t|Ultra-Sensitive Simultaneous Detection of Dopamine and Acetaminophen over Hollow Porous AuAg Alloy Nanospheres.
38998736|a|Hollow porous AuAg nanospheres (AuAg HPNSs) were obtained through a simple solvothermal synthesis, complemented by a dealloying strategy. The hollow interior, open pore voids, and integral interconnected skeleton shell in AuAg HPNSs are beneficial for providing sufficient electrolyte diffusion and contacts, abundant active sites, and efficient electron transport. This specific structure and the favorable alloy synergism contribute to the superior electrocatalytic activity toward dopamine (DA) and acetaminophen (AC). AuAg HPNSs show high sensitivity, good selectivity, excellent sensing durability, and outstanding repeatability for amperometric assays of AC and DA. In particular, the AuAg-based sensors achieve effective ultrasensitive simultaneous analyses of AC and DA, exhibiting the characteristics of the wide linear range and low detection limit. With their prominent electrocatalytic activity and simple preparation methods, AuAg HPNSs present broad application prospects for constructing a highly responsive electrochemical sensing system.
