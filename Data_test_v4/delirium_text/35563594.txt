35563594|t|Statins Inhibit the Gliosis of MIO-M1, a Muller Glial Cell Line Induced by TRPV4 Activation.
35563594|a|We characterized Muller cell gliosis induced by the activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid-type 4 (TRPV4) and assessed whether statins could modulate the gliosis. The human Muller cell line, MIO-M1, was used to analyze the gliosis caused by glaucomatous stimulation. To induce Muller gliosis in MIO-M1 cells, GSK101 was used to activate TRPV4, and Muller gliosis was evaluated by analyzing vimentin, nestin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression. The expression level of TNF-alpha was determined by ELISA. To evaluate the GSK101 activation of the NF-kappaB pathway, p65 phosphorylation was measured by Western blotting, and the nuclear translocation of p65 and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation were assessed by immunostaining. To assess the effect of statins on MIO-M1 gliosis, cells were pretreated for 24 h with statins before GSK101 treatment. Vimentin, nestin, and GFAP expression were upregulated by GSK101, while statins effectively inhibited them. The expression of TNF-alpha was increased by GSK101. The phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65 and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, which occurs prior to p65 activation, were induced. Statins suppressed the GSK101-mediated phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and p65 translocation. Statins can mitigate gliosis in the human Muller cell line. Because TRPV4 activation in Muller cells reflects glaucoma pathophysiology, statins may have the potential to prevent RGC death.
