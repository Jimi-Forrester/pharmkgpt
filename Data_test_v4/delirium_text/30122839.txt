30122839|t|Multimodality Neuroimaging in Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Cross-sectional Comparison Study.
30122839|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a focus of considerable research. The present study aimed to test the utility of a logistic regression-derived classifier, combining specific quantitative multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for the early objective phenotyping of MCI in the clinic, over structural MRI data. METHODS: Thirty-three participants with cognitively stable amnestic MCI; 15 MCI converters to early Alzheimer's disease (AD; diseased controls) and 20 healthy controls underwent high-resolution T1-weighted volumetric MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MR spectroscopy). The regional volumes were obtained from T1-weighted MRI. The fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps were derived from DTI over multiple white matter regions. The 1H MRS voxels were placed over posterior cingulate gyri, and N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr), choline (Cho)/Cr, myoinositol (mI/Cr), and NAA/mI ratios were obtained. A multimodal classifier comprising MR volumetry, DTI, and MRS was prepared. A cutoff point was arrived based on receiver operator characteristics analysis. Results were considered significant, if P < 0.05. RESULTS: The most sensitive individual marker to discriminate MCI from controls was DTI (90.9%), with a specificity of 50%. For classifying MCI from AD, the best individual modality was DTI (72.7%), with a high specificity of 87.9%. The multimodal classifier approach for MCI control classification achieved an area under curve (AUC) (AUC = 0.89; P < 0.001), with 93.9% sensitivity and 70% specificity. The combined classifier for MCI-AD achieved a highest AUC (AUC = 0.93; P < 0.001), with 93% sensitivity and 85.6% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The combined method of gray matter atrophy, white matter tract changes, and metabolite variation achieved a better performance at classifying MCI compared to the application of individual MRI biomarkers.
