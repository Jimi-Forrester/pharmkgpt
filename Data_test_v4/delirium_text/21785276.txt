21785276|a|The amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is the derivative of amyloid precursor protein (APP) generated through sequential proteolytic processing by beta- and gamma-secretases. Excessive accumulation of Abeta, the main constituent of amyloid plaques, has been implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It was found recently that the impairments of neurogenesis in brain were associated with the pathogenesis of AD. Furthermore recent findings implicated that APP could function to influence proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPC) and might regulate transcriptional activity of various genes. Studies demonstrated that influence of neurogenesis by APP is conferred differently via its two separate domains, soluble secreted APPs (sAPPs, mainly sAPPalpha) and APP intracellular domain (AICD). The sAPPalpha was shown to be neuroprotective and important to neurogenesis, whereas AICD was found to negatively modulate neurogenesis. Furthermore, it was demonstrated recently that microRNA could function to regulate APP expression, APP processing, Abeta accumulation and subsequently influence neurotoxicity and neurogenesis related to APP, which was implicated to AD pathogenesis, especially for sporadic AD. Based on data accumulated, secretase balances were proposed. These secretase balances could influence the downstream balance related to regulation of neurogenesis by AICD and sAPPalpha as well as balance related to influence of neuron viability by Abeta and sAPPalpha. Disruption of these secretase balances could be culprits to AD onset.
