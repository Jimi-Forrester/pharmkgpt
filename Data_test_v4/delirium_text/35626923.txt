35626923|a|COVID-19 has affected millions of children and, while it was previously considered as a respiratory disease, neurologic involvement has also been documented. The objective of this study was to identify the neurological manifestations (NMs) and the outcomes of children with COVID-19 who attended the National Medical Center "20 de Noviembre". METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of children hospitalized for COVID-19 from April 2020 to March 2021 was conducted. Clinical-demographic data were registered. Neurologic manifestations were defined as any clinical neurological expression of the central and/or peripheral nervous system that occurred during admission or hospitalization. RESULTS: In total, 46 children with a confirmed COVID-19 result, 26 (56.5%) boys and 20 (43.5%) girls with a median age of 8.9 +- 4.6 years, constituted the study population. Half of the children showed some NMs, and this group of patients concomitantly showed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, 56%), obesity (17.3%), or acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML, 4.3%). The most frequently described NMs were headache (13, 56%), encephalopathy (10, 43.47%), and epilepsy (4, 17.39%). The mortality rate in children with NMs was 21.7% and they had a higher mortality rate when compared to those without NM p <= 0.025. CONCLUSIONS: NMs occurred predominantly in male children aged 6 to 12 years; ALL was the most frequent comorbidity. Headache prevailed and hypoxemia, hypocalcemia, elevated ferritin, and C-reactive protein were associated with NM. Finally, NMs were a risk factor for mortality.
