23051147|a|Using all-atom explicit water model and replica exchange molecular dynamics, we study the interactions between Abeta monomer and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen, which is known to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Ibuprofen binding to Abeta is largely governed by hydrophobic effect, and its binding site in Abeta peptide is entirely composed of hydrophobic amino acids. Electrostatic interactions between negatively charged ibuprofen ligands and positively charged side chains make a relatively small contribution to binding. This outcome is explained by the competition of ligand-peptide electrostatic interactions with intrapeptide salt bridges. Consistent with the experiments, the S-isomer of ibuprofen binds with stronger affinity to Abeta than the R-isomer. Conformational ensemble of Abeta monomer in ibuprofen solution reveals two structured regions, 19-25 (R1) and 29-35 (R2), composed of turn/helix and helix structure, respectively. The clustering technique and free energy analysis suggest that Abeta conformational ensemble is mainly determined by the formation of Asp23-Lys28 salt bridge and the hydrophobic interactions between R1 and R2. Control simulations of Abeta peptide in ligand-free water show that ibuprofen binding changes Abeta structure by promoting the formation of helix and Asp23-Lys28 salt bridge. Implications of our findings for Abeta amyloidogenesis are discussed.
