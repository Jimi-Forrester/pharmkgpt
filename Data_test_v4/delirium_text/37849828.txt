37849828|t|A review on the relationship between Arachidonic acid 15-Lipoxygenase (ALOX15) and diabetes mellitus.
37849828|a|Arachidonic acid 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), as one of the lipoxygenase family, is mainly responsible for catalyzing the oxidation of various fatty acids to produce a variety of lipid components, contributing to the pathophysiological processes of various immune and inflammatory diseases. Studies have shown that ALOX15 and its related products are widely distributed in human tissues and related to multiple diseases such as liver, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and other diseases. Diabetes mellitus (DM), the disease studied in this article, is a metabolic disease characterized by a chronic increase in blood glucose levels, which is significantly related to inflammation, oxidative stress, ferroptosis and other mechanisms, and it has a high incidence in the population, accompanied by a variety of complications. Figuring out how ALOX15 is involved in DM is critical to understanding its role in diseases. Therefore, ALOX15 inhibitors or combination therapy containing inhibitors may deliver a novel research direction for the treatment of DM and its complications. This article aims to review the biological effect and the possible function of ALOX15 in the pathogenesis of DM.
