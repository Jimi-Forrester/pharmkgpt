31889192|a|INTRODUCTION: The 2017 Joint Trauma System Clinical Practice Guideline for Pain, Anxiety, and Delirium (JTS CPG) provides an evidence-based framework for managing pain, anxiety, and delirium in combat settings. In this study, we evaluate the use of multimodal analgesia and assess pain outcomes, as indicated by the JTS CPG, at the combat support hospital (CSH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this quality improvement project, data were collected for all patients, presenting to the CSH in Baghdad, Iraq, who received consultation from the acute pain service from October 10, 2017 to February 27, 2018. Univariate analyses described patient demographic and clinical characteristics. Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) scores, physical therapy completion, and sleep duration were recorded for each patient daily. Correlations assessed relationships between variables, including clinical characteristics and DVPRS scores. RESULTS: 34 patients were included in this study. About 65% of the patients included in this study were Iraqi military, while the other 35% were U.S. or Coalition Forces. Over half received more than one class of analgesic medication. The majority of patients received regional anesthesia, with 17 different techniques utilized. The DVPRS had acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0.87, 95% CI 0.80, 0.95). There was a significant difference in median DVPRS pain intensity scores between those who met physical therapy goals and those who did not. Sleep duration was negatively correlated with both the DVPRS pain intensity and sleep scores. CONCLUSIONS: This report indicates that acute pain service teams integrated in a CSH can feasibly implement JTS CPGs using a team-based approach. Given the military's emphasis on managing complex pain and disability among survivors beginning in the combat environment, it is imperative that innovations and best practices, like the JTS CPG, be assessed in the combat setting.
