36326545|t|Psychiatric and neurological complications of long COVID.
36326545|a|COVID-19 was primarily considered a pulmonary disease with extrapulmonary manifestations. As the pandemic spread, there has been growing evidence that the disease affects various organs/systems, including the central and peripheral nervous systems. Accumulation of clinical data demonstrates that in a large population of survivors impairments in the function of one or more organs may persist for a long time, a phenomenon commonly known as post COVID or long COVID. Fatigue and cognitive dysfunction, such as concentration problems, short-term memory deficits, general memory loss, a specific decline in attention, language and praxis abilities, encoding and verbal fluency, impairment of executive functions, and psychomotor coordination, are amongst the most common and debilitating features of neuropsychatric symptoms of post COVID syndrome. Several patients also suffer from compromised sleep, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Patients with long COVID may demonstrate brain hypometabolism, hypoperfusion of the cerebral cortex and changes in the brain structure and functional connectivity. Children and adolescents represent a minority of COVID-19 cases, so not surprisingly data on the long-term sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infections in these age groups are scarce. Although the pathogenesis, clinical characteristics, epidemiology, and risk factors of the acute phase of COVID-19 have been largely explained, these areas are yet to be explored in long COVID. This review aims to provide an update on what is currently known about long COVID effects on mental health.
