35103391|a|The diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is deemed a formative phase of dementia, may greatly assist clinicians in delaying its headway toward dementia. This article proposes a deep learning approach based on a triploid genetic algorithm, a proposed variant of genetic algorithms, for classifying MCI converts and non-converts using structural magnetic resonance imaging data. It also explores the effect of the choice of activation functions and that of the selection of hyper-parameters on the performance of the model. The proposed work is a step toward automated convolutional neural networks. The performance of the proposed method is measured in terms of accuracy and empirical studies exhibit the preeminence of our proposed method over the existing ones. The proposed model results in a maximum accuracy of 0.97961. Thus, it may contribute to the effective diagnosis of MCI and may prove important in clinical settings.
