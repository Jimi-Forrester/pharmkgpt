METHOD: A series of consecutive AD patients from the Memory Disorders Clinic of the Veterans General Hospital, Taipei were studied. Psychiatric diagnosis was made according to DSM-III-R criteria with the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID). The Chinese version of the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) were also applied. Primary caregivers were interviewed for the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, the Barthel Index and the Alzheimer's Deficit Scale (ADS). RESULTS: Among 141 AD patients, seven (5.0%) were diagnosed with major depression, 11 (7.8%) with dysthymia and five (3.5%) with depressive disorder not otherwise specified. Women were at elevated risk for depressive disorders and had more severe symptoms of depression. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depressive disorders among Chinese AD patients is in the middle of the range of western findings. The risk factor for depression is female gender.
