34064822|t|Regulation of Tissue Inflammation by 12-Lipoxygenases.
34064822|a|Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are lipid metabolizing enzymes that catalyze the di-oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids to generate active eicosanoid products. 12-lipoxygenases (12-LOXs) primarily oxygenate the 12th carbon of its substrates. Many studies have demonstrated that 12-LOXs and their eicosanoid metabolite 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoate (12-HETE), have significant pathological implications in inflammatory diseases. Increased level of 12-LOX activity promotes stress (both oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum)-mediated inflammation, leading to damage in these tissues. 12-LOXs are also associated with enhanced cellular migration of immune cells-a characteristic of several metabolic and autoimmune disorders. Genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme in animal models of various diseases has shown to be protective against disease development and/or progression in animal models in the setting of diabetes, pulmonary, cardiovascular, and metabolic disease, suggesting a translational potential of targeting the enzyme for the treatment of several disorders. In this article, we review the role of 12-LOXs in the pathogenesis of several diseases in which chronic inflammation plays an underlying role.
