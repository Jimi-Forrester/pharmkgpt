15359561|t|Discussions about cognitive impairment in first medical visits: older patients' perceptions and preferences.
15359561|a|Primary care physicians are the first medical contact for most patients with early-stage dementia. However, little is known about older patients' desire for discussions about cognitive problems or the frequency of discussions about cognitive status during primary care visits. To investigate this question, older patients and accompanying individuals were interviewed separately following the first visit with a primary care physician in an outpatient geriatric medical practice. Patients indicated that memory was discussed in 62 percent of visits. When memory was not discussed, almost one-third of patients stated that they would have wanted to discuss it. Physicians were more likely than patients to initiate discussions about memory. Patient factors, including age, gender, the presence of an accompanying individual, number of diagnoses, and the patient's statement that cognitive function was a main goal of the visit, were examined as predictors of the likelihood of discussion of memory during the first visit. Patients who identified discussing cognitive function as a goal of the visit were more likely to have a discussion about memory than those who did not.
