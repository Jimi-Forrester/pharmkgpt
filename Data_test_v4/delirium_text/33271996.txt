33271996|t|Establishment of a UPLC-PDA/ESI-Q-TOF/MS-Based Approach for the Simultaneous Analysis of Multiple Phenolic Compounds in Amaranth (A. cruentus and A. tricolor).
33271996|a|We used ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with a photodiode-array detector and electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-PDA/ESI-Q-TOF/MS) to rapidly and accurately quantify 17 phenolic compounds. Then, we applied this method to the seed and leaf extracts of two Amaranthus species to identify and quantify phenolic compounds other than the 17 compounds mentioned above. Compounds were eluted within 30 min on a C18 column using a mobile phase (water and acetonitrile) containing 0.1% formic acid, and the specific wavelength and ion information of the compounds obtained by PDA and ESI-Q-TOF/MS were confirmed. The proposed method showed good linearity (r2 > 0.990). Limits of detection and quantification were less than 0.1 and 0.1 mug/mL, respectively. Intra- and interday precision were less than 2.4% and 1.8%, respectively. Analysis of amaranth seed and leaf extracts using the established method showed that the seeds contained high amounts of 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid and kaempferol, and leaves contained diverse phenolic compounds. In addition, six tentatively new phenolic compounds were identified. Moreover, seeds potentially contained 2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, a beneficial bioactive compound. Thus, our method was an efficient approach for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of phenolic compounds, and could be used to investigate phenolic compounds in plants.
