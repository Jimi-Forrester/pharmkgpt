32260293|t|Advances on Chelation and Chelator Metal Complexes in Medicine.
32260293|a|Metal ions such as iron, copper and zinc are essential for life. Chelators (Chele, greek chiepsiloniotalambdaeta-claw of a crab) are organic molecules possessing specific ligands which have high affinity and can bind/carry metal ions and play very important roles in living systems e.g., haemoglobin, transferrin, phytochelators and microbial siderophores [...].
