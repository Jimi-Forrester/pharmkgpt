37928021|t|beta-Hydroxybutyrate as an epigenetic modifier: Underlying mechanisms and implications.
37928021|a|Previous studies have found that beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB), the main component of ketone bodies, is of physiological importance as a backup energy source during starvation or induces diabetic ketoacidosis when insulin deficiency occurs. Ketogenic diets (KD) have been used as metabolic therapy for over a hundred years, it is well known that ketone bodies and BHB not only serve as ancillary fuel substituting for glucose but also induce anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and cardioprotective features via binding to several target proteins, including histone deacetylase (HDAC), or G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Recent advances in epigenetics, especially novel histone post-translational modifications (HPTMs), have continuously updated our understanding of BHB, which also acts as a signal transduction molecule and modification substrate to regulate a series of epigenetic phenomena, such as histone acetylation, histone beta-hydroxybutyrylation, histone methylation, DNA methylation, and microRNAs. These epigenetic events alter the activity of genes without changing the DNA structure and further participate in the pathogenesis of related diseases. This review focuses on the metabolic process of BHB and BHB-mediated epigenetics in cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and complications of diabetes, neuropsychiatric diseases, cancers, osteoporosis, liver and kidney injury, embryonic and fetal development, and intestinal homeostasis, and discusses potential molecular mechanisms, drug targets, and application prospects.
