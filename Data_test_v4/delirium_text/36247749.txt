36247749|a|Introduction: Low ankle-brachial index (ABI) <=0. 9 is a marker for generalized atherosclerosis and a risk factor for cognitive decline in the general population. Objective: To evaluate the impact of ABI <=0.9 on cognitive function up to 3 years after first-ever ischemic stroke. Methods: Data was used from the "PROspective Cohort with Incident Stroke-Berlin" (PROSCIS-B; NCT01363856). ABI was measured at baseline and categorized into normal (1.4-0.9) vs. low (<=0.9). Cognitive function was assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental-State-Examination (MMSE) at baseline and with the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified (TICS-m) at 1-3 years of follow-up. We performed confounder adjusted generalized linear models (GLM) to calculate relative risks (RR) for cognitive impairment at baseline (MMSE<=26; MoCA<=25) and linear mixed models (LMM) to estimate the impact of low ABI on TICS-m over time. Results: We included 325 patients [mean age: 66 (SD = 13); 38% female, median NIHSS = 2 (IQR = 1-4), ABI<=0.9: 59 (18%)]. Patients with low ABI were at increased risk of cognitive impairment at baseline (adjusted RR for MoCA<=25 = 1.98; 95%-CI:1.24 to 3.16). TICS-m scores were consistently lower over time in patients with low ABI (adjusted ss = -1.96; 95%-CI:-3.55 to -0.37). Independent of ABI, cognitive function did not decline over time (adjusted ss:0.29; 95%-CI:-0.06 to 0.64). Conclusion: In patients with mild to moderate first-ever ischemic stroke, low ABI is associated with reduced cognitive function over a 3-year follow-up.
