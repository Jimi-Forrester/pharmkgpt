39416486|a|INTRODUCTION: Apathy is a significant feature in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), though its mechanisms are not well established. METHODS: An effort-based decision-making (EBDM) framework was applied to investigate apathy in 30 AD patients, 41 SCI participants, and 55 healthy controls (HC). Data were analyzed using a drift-diffusion model (DDM) to uncover latent psychological processes. RESULTS: SCI participants reported higher apathy than AD patients and HC. However, informant reports of apathy in AD patients were higher than self-reports and indicated significant apathy compared to HC. Both the AD and SCI groups showed reduced sensitivity to effort changes, linked to executive dysfunction in AD and apathy in SCI. Increased resting functional cortical connectivity with the nucleus accumbens (NA) was associated with higher apathy in SCI. DISCUSSION: These results highlight a similar disruption of EBDM in AD and SCI, differentially related to executive functioning in AD and apathy in SCI. Highlights: This is the first study investigating apathy using an effort-based decision-making (EBDM) framework in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and subjective cognitive impairment (SCI).Self-reports underestimate apathy in AD patients when compared to informant reports and healthy controls (HC). SCI participants, in whom self and informant reports were more concordant, also showed higher degrees of apathy.Both AD and SCI groups showed reduced sensitivity to effort.Reduced sensitivity to effort correlates with executive dysfunction in AD and apathy, but not depression, in SCI.Increased nucleus accumbens (ventral striatum) connectivity with the frontoparietal network was associated with higher apathy scores in SCI.The results thus suggest that while AD and SCI can have similar deficits in EBDM, these deficits correlate with distinct clinical manifestations: executive dysfunction in AD and apathy in SCI.
