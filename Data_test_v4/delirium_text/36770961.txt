36770961|t|H2S Sensors: Synthesis, Optical Properties, and Selected Biomedical Applications under Visible and NIR Light.
36770961|a|Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an essential signaling gas within the cell, and its endogenous levels are correlated with various health diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, Down's syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. Because it plays such diverse biological functions, being able to detect H2S quickly and accurately in vivo is an area of heightened scientific interest. Using probes that fluoresce in the near-infrared (NIR) region is an effective and convenient method of detecting H2S. This approach allows for compounds of high sensitivity and selectivity to be developed while minimizing cytotoxicity. Herein, we report a review on the synthesis, mechanisms, optical properties, and selected biomedical applications of H2S sensors.
