38136151|t|A Peptoid-Chelator Selective to Cu2+ That Can Extract Copper from Metallothionein-2 and Lead to the Production of ROS.
38136151|a|Copper is an essential metal ion that is involved in critical cellular processes, but which can also exhibit toxic effects through its ability to catalyze reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Dysregulation of copper homeostasis has been implicated in the progression of several diseases, including cancer. A novel therapeutic approach, extensively studied in recent years, is to capitalize on the increased copper uptake and dependency exhibited by cancer cells and to promote copper-associated ROS production within the tumor microenvironment, leading to the apoptosis of cancer cells. Such an effect can be achieved by selectively chelating copper from copper-bearing metalloproteins in cancer cells, thereby forming a copper-chelator complex that produces ROS and, through this, induces oxidative stress and initiates apoptosis. Herein, we describe a peptoid chelator, TB, that is highly suitable to carry this task. Peptoids are N-substituted glycine oligomers that can be efficiently synthesized on a solid support and are also biocompatible; thus, they are considered promising drug candidates. We show, by rigorous spectroscopic techniques, that TB is not only selective for Cu(II) ions, but can also effectively extract copper from metallothionein-2, and the formed complex CuTB can promote ROS production. Our findings present a promising first example for the future development of peptoid-based chelators for applications in anti-cancer chelation therapy, highlighting the potential for the prospect of peptoid chelators as therapeutics.
