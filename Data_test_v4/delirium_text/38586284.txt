38586284|t|Elevated risk for psychiatric outcomes in pediatric patients with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C): A review of neuroinflammatory and psychosocial stressors.
38586284|a|Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is a secondary immune manifestation of COVID-19 involving multiple organ systems in the body, resulting in fever, skin rash, abdominal pain, nausea, shock, and cardiac dysfunction that often lead to hospitalization. Although many of these symptoms resolve following anti-inflammatory treatment, the long-term neurological and psychiatric sequelae of MIS-C are unknown. In this review, we will summarize two domains of the MIS-C disease course, 1) Neuroinflammation in the MIS-C brain and 2) Psychosocial disruptions resulting from stress and hospitalization. In both domains, we present existing clinical findings and hypothesize potential connections to psychiatric outcomes. This is the first review to conceptualize a holistic framework of psychiatric risk in MIS-C patients that includes neuroinflammatory and psychosocial risk factors. As cases of severe COVID-19 and MIS-C subside, it is important for clinicians to monitor outcomes in this vulnerable patient population.
