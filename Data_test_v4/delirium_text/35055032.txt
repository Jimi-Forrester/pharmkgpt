35055032|t|Two-Dimensional Interfacial Exchange Diffusion Has the Potential to Augment Spatiotemporal Precision of Ca2+ Signaling.
35055032|a|Nano-junctions between the endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasmic surfaces of the plasma membrane and other organelles shape the spatiotemporal features of biological Ca2+ signals. Herein, we propose that 2D Ca2+ exchange diffusion on the negatively charged phospholipid surface lining nano-junctions participates in guiding Ca2+ from its source (channel or carrier) to its target (transport protein or enzyme). Evidence provided by in vitro Ca2+ flux experiments using an artificial phospholipid membrane is presented in support of the above proposed concept, and results from stochastic simulations of Ca2+ trajectories within nano-junctions are discussed in order to substantiate its possible requirements. Finally, we analyze recent literature on Ca2+ lipid interactions, which suggests that 2D interfacial Ca2+ diffusion may represent an important mechanism of signal transduction in biological systems characterized by high phospholipid surface to aqueous volume ratios.
