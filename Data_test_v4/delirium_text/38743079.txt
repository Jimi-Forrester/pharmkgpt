38743079|a|PURPOSE: The rise of digitization promotes the development of screening and decision support tools. We sought to validate the results from a machine learning based dysphagia risk prediction tool with clinical evaluation. METHODS: 149 inpatients in the ENT department were evaluated in real time by the risk prediction tool, as well as clinically over a 3-week period. Patients were classified by both as patients at risk/no risk. RESULTS: The AUROC, reflecting the discrimination capability of the algorithm, was 0.97. The accuracy achieved 92.6% given an excellent specificity as well as sensitivity of 98% and 82.4% resp. Higher age, as well as male sex and the diagnosis of oropharyngeal malignancies were found more often in patients at risk of dysphagia. CONCLUSION: The proposed dysphagia risk prediction tool proved to have an outstanding performance in discriminating risk from no risk patients in a prospective clinical setting. It is likely to be particularly useful in settings where there is a lower incidence of patients with dysphagia and less awareness among staff.
