28586912|t|Comparison of MicroRNA Expression in Aqueous Humor of Normal and Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Patients Using PCR Arrays: A Pilot Study.
28586912|a|Purpose: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, endogenous noncoding RNAs that have been detected in human aqueous humor (AH). Prior studies have pooled samples to obtain sufficient quantities for analysis or used next-generation sequencing. Here, we used PCR arrays with preamplification to identify and compare miRNAs from individual AH samples between patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and normal controls. Methods: AH was collected before cataract surgery from six stable, medically treated POAG patients and eight age-matched controls. Following reverse transcription and preamplification, individual patient samples were profiled on Taqman Low Density MicroRNA Array Cards. Differentially expressed miRNAs were stratified for fold changes larger than +-2 and for significance of P < 0.05. Significant Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways influenced by the differentially expressed miRNAs were identified using the predicted target module of the miRWalk 2.0 database. Results: This approach detected 181 discrete miRNAs, which were consistently expressed across all samples of both experimental groups. Significant up-regulation of miR-518d and miR-143, and significant down-regulation of miR-660, was observed in the AH of POAG patients compared with controls. These miRNAs were predicted to reduce cell proliferation and extracellular matrix remodeling, endocytosis, Wnt signaling, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and adherens junction function. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrates that miRNA expression within the AH of POAG patients differs from age-matched controls. AH miRNAs exhibit potential as biomarkers of POAG, which merits further investigation in a larger case-controlled study. This technique provides a cost-effective and sensitive approach to assay miRNAs in individual patient samples without the need for pooling.
