34336682|t|Identification of Key Circulating Exosomal microRNAs in Gastric Cancer.
34336682|a|Exosomal miRNAs (EmiRs) can be used for prediction of gastric cancer (GC) development. Supposedly, both plasma and urinary microRNAs can also be potential biomarkers for screening, but the diagnostic values of EmiRs in blood and urine are not fully studied. We here collected both types of samples from GC patients and healthy individuals and conducted miRNA sequencing to identify key members of EmiRs in GC. The exosomes samples derived from blood and urine were collected from 3 healthy individuals and 7 GC patients. Differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were acquired, ontology enrichment analysis and Protein-protein Interaction (PPI) enrichment analysis were performed. There were 8 DEmiRNAs in the serum and 3 DEmiRNAs in the urine. For GC patients, there were three up-regulated DEmiRNAs (hsa-miR-130b-3p, hsa-miR-151a-3p and hsa-miR-15b-3p) in the serum exosomes, and one up-regulated DEmiRNA (hsa-miR-1246) in the urinary exosomes. Using miRNA target prediction databases, we found 418 common targets of hsa-miR-15b-3p, 35 common targets of hsa-miR-151a-3p, 117 common targets of hsa-miR-130b-3p, and 357 common targets of hsa-miR-1246. Some commonly enriched ontology terms were found, including GO BP terms like cell surface receptor signaling pathway involved in cell-cell signaling, positive regulation of catabolic process, morphogenesis of an epithelium, and GO CC terms perinuclear region of cytoplasm. The PPI network show some key nodes, including TAOK1, CMTM6, SCN3A, WASF3, IGF1, CNOT7, GABRG1, PRKD1. Together, this study provided an integrative analysis of expression profile of key circulating exosomal microRNAs. Four key exosomal miRNAs (hsa-miR-130b-3p, hsa-miR-151a-3p and hsa-miR-15b-3p) and the interaction network or enrichments based on their targets (TAOK1, CMTM6, SCN3A, WASF3, IGF1, CNOT7, GABRG1, PRKD1) may provide a reference of the molecular mechanisms in the GC development.
