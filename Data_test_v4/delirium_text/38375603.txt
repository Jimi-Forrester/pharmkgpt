38375603|t|Revealing the binding mechanism of BACE1 inhibitors through molecular dynamics simulations.
38375603|a|Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder, and the Beta-Site Amyloid Precursor Protein Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a key therapeutic target in its treatment. This study employs molecular dynamics simulations and binding energy analysis to investigate the binding interactions between BACE1 and four selected small molecules: CNP520, D9W, NB641, and NB360. The binding model analysis indicates that the binding of BACE1 with four molecules are stable, except the loop regions show significant fluctuation. The binding free energy analyses reveal that NB360 exhibits the highest binding affinity with BACE1, surpassing other molecules (CNP520, D9W, and NB641). Detailed energy component assessments highlight the critical roles of electrostatic interactions and van der Waals forces in the binding process. Furthermore, residue contribution analysis identifies key amino acids influencing the binding process across all systems. Hydrogen bond analysis reveals a limited number of bonds between BACE1 and each small molecule, highlighting the importance of structural modifications to enable more stable hydrogen bonds. This research provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of potential Alzheimer's disease therapeutics, guiding the way for improved drug design and the development of effective treatments targeting BACE1.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
