35186420|t|Preoperative Cognitive Impairment as a Perioperative Risk Factor in Patients Undergoing Total Knee Arthroplasty.
35186420|a|BACKGROUND: The study assessed whether pre-existing cognitive impairment (CI) prior to elective total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is associated with worse postoperative outcomes such as delirium, in-hospital medical complications, 30-day mortality, hospital length of stay and non-home discharge. METHODS: A retrospective database analysis from the NSQIP Geriatric Surgery Pilot Project was used. There was an initial cohort of 6350 patients undergoing elective TKA, 104 patients with CI were propensity score matched to 104 patients without CI. RESULTS: Analysis demonstrated a significantly increased incidence of post-operative delirium (POD) in the cohort with pre-op CI (p = < .001), a worsened functional status (p = < .001) and increased nonhome discharge postoperatively compared to the group without CI (p = 0.029). Other post-operative outcomes included 30-day mortality of 0% in both groups, and low rate of complications such as infection (2.88% vs 0.96%), pneumonia (1.92% vs 0%), failure to wean (0.96% vs 0%), and reintubation (0.96% vs 0%). Some other differences between the CI group and non-CI group, although not statistically significant, included increased rate of transfusion (10.58% vs 6.73%), and sepsis (1.92% vs 0%). The length of stay was increased in the non-CI group (4.28% vs 2.32%, p = 0.122). CONCLUSION: CI in patients undergoing TKA is associated with an increased risk of POD, worsened postoperative functional status, and discharge to non-home facility.
