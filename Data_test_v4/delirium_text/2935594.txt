2935594|a|Post-mortem brain samples from patients with either Huntington's disease, Alzheimer-type dementia or appropriate controls were assayed for endoplasmic reticulum enzymes, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, neutral alpha-glucosidase, inosine diphosphatase, alpha-mannosidase and glucose-6-phosphatase and for Golgi enzymes, fucosyl- and galactosyl-transferases. In Alzheimer-type dementia there was a selective decrease in alpha-glucosidase activity in the temporal cortex. In Huntington's disease there was a selective decrease of putamen alpha-glucosidase and fucosyl-transferase activities. It is suggested that these changes reflect highly specific alterations in glycoprotein synthesis and processing and may contribute to the underlying pathology of these disorders.
