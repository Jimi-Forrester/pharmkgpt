36810471|t|Leukoaraiosis as a Predictor of Depression and Cognitive Impairment among Stroke Survivors: A Systematic Review.
36810471|a|Stroke survivors are at increased risk of developing depression and cognitive decline. Thus, it is crucial for both clinicians and stroke survivors to be provided with timely and accurate prognostication of post-stroke depression (PSD) and post-stroke dementia (PSDem). Several biomarkers regarding stroke patients' propensity to develop PSD and PSDem have been implemented so far, leukoaraiosis (LA) being among them. The purpose of the present study was to review all available work published within the last decade dealing with pre-existing LA as a predictor of depression (PSD) and cognitive dysfunction (cognitive impairment or PSDem) in stroke patients. A literature search of two databases (MEDLINE and Scopus) was conducted to identify all relevant studies published between 1 January 2012 and 25 June 2022 that dealt with the clinical utility of preexisting LA as a prognostic indicator of PSD and PSDem/cognitive impairment. Only full-text articles published in the English language were included. Thirty-four articles were traced and are included in the present review. LA burden, serving as a surrogate marker of "brain frailty" among stroke patients, appears to be able to offer significant information about the possibility of developing PSD or cognitive dysfunction. Determining the extent of pre-existing white matter abnormalities can properly guide decision making in acute stroke settings, as a greater degree of such lesioning is usually coupled with neuropsychiatric aftermaths, such as PSD and PSDem.
