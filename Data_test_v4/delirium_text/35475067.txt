35475067|t|Morbidity and Mortality After Second Hip Fracture With and Without Nursing Care Program.
35475067|a|Background Hip fractures are an increasingly common injury among older people who usually experience significantly worse mobility, independence in function, health, quality of life, and high rates of institutionalization. Studies have shown that only 40-60% of participants recover their pre-fracture level of mobility and ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living, while for those who are independent in self-care prior to the fracture, 20-60% still require assistance for various tasks one or two years after the fracture. As the cumulative incidence of a second hip fracture has been estimated to reach 8.4%, prevention of the second hip fracture is a major concern of the health system and the society focused mainly on lifestyle modifications, osteoporotic treatment, and fall-prevention strategies. The aim of the present study was to compare morbidity/mortality, functional results, and type of recovery between the first and second hip fractures in elderly patients. Methods Patients with a contralateral hip fracture were prospectively recruited during a three-year period (2016-2019). Level of independence, gait aids, type of rehabilitation, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, Harris Hip Score (HHS), and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scale were evaluated at admission for the second fracture and at the last reexamination. Results Twenty-seven out of 33 patients, aged 87.93+-6.6, underwent surgery for contralateral hip fracture and followed up for 42.52+-16.46 months; the mean interval between the two fractures was 39.63 months. The HHS averaged 86.19+-12.18 and 59.01+-32.83 and the WOMAC 86.37+-12.09 and 68.22+-26.18 before and after the second fracture, respectively. The mortality rate was 37.03%, 14.8+-12.93 months after the second operation, with a significant relationship between the mortality time and the interval between fractures (p=0.028). Twelve and 14 of the patients received geriatric nursing care after the first and second fracture, respectively, without significant improvement in their functional results compared to home care. Mobility of nursing care patients after the second fracture was significantly improved (p=0.019). Conclusions Mortality is higher in the second year after the second hip fracture and strongly correlated with the time interval between fractures. A higher possibility to return in previous mobility status occurs after geriatric nursing care.
