22171393|t|<sup>125</sup>I-Labeled heparin-binding peptides that target heparan sulfate proteoglycans for the <i>in vivo</i> imaging of peripheral amyloidosis
22171393|a|Peripheral amyloidosis is the extracellular deposition of insoluble protein fibrils in various organs of animals, including humans, and these deposits are considered to be biomarkers for diseases such as Alzheimer s disease (AD), light chain amyloidosis (AL), etc (1). The fibrils are made up of disease-specific aggregated proteins or peptides (e.g., Ab peptides for AD, light chains for AL or multiple myeloma, and reactive amyloidosis (AA)) that incorporate heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG; heparin belongs to the heparan sulfate family of proteoglycans that contain the (GlcNS6S-IdoA2S)<sub>3</sub> motif) and the serum amyloid P component (SAP) within their structure during disease progression. A characteristic feature of the protein fibrils is that the constituent proteins form a secondary cross-b pleated sheet structure that is resistant to proteolytic digestion (for structural details, see Goldsbury et al. (2)). The HSPG contain diverse types of oligosaccharides that are sulfated on the hydroxyl moieties to varying degrees, and these hypersulfated structures are distinct, are found specifically in the amyloid deposits, and differ from one another depending on the organ where they are located (3). In addition, clinical symptoms in patients are influenced by the degree to which an organ is involved in the disease (4). Because the HSPG are hypersulfated compared to proteoglycans found in normal tissues, HSPG are considered to be relevant biomarkers for use with noninvasive imaging to detect, diagnose, and monitor amyloidosis progression and to determine the prognosis for a patient with amyloidosis (1). Whole-body scintigraphy with radioiodinated SAP is commonly used in Europe for the detection of amyloidosis in the various parts of the body, but this technique is not approved for clinical use in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration because the SAP in the tracer is isolated from human sources (1). In an attempt to develop an amyloid imaging agent that does not require the use of materials of human origin, Wall et al. studied the biodistribution of seven <sup>125</sup>I-labeled synthetic heparin-binding peptides with small-animal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to evaluate their use in the detection of amyloid deposits in mice with severe systemic AA amyloidosis (1).
