29747002|a|Given the paradigm of anti-insulin resistance in therapies for metabolic syndrome, there has been considerable interest in adiponectin (APN), an adipocyte-derived sensitizer of insulin receptor signaling. In contrast to hypoadiponectinemia in metabolic syndrome, evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other diseases, including chronic heart failure (CHF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), are characterized by hyperadiponectinemia as well as the APN/obesity paradoxes, indicating that a decrease in APN might also be beneficial for these diseases. Thus, distinct from metabolic syndrome, it is anticipated that APN receptor antagonists rather than agonists might be effective in therapy for some chronic diseases.
