32649312|t|Association of the serum microRNA-29 family with cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease.
32649312|a|We aimed to examine whether miRNA-29s (miR-29s) in serum are associated with cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD). Thirty-nine PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC), 37 PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), 22 PD patients with dementia (PDD) and 40 healthy controls were recruited. Detailed clinical evaluations and a schedule of neuropsychological tests were administered to all patients. MiR-29s expression in serum samples was assessed using reverse-transcription quantitative real-time PCR. We found that the levels of all three miR-29s in the PDD group were significantly lower than those in the PD-NC group (p < 0.05). In addition, the miR-29b level was downregulated in the PD-MCI group with respect to that in the PD-NC group (p < 0.05). After adjusting for years of education and the UPDRS-III subscore using a multivariate model, miR-29s showed significant associations with PDD. MiR-29b levels were shown to be associated with different subsets of PD cognition and could accurately discriminate PDD from non-PDD (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.859; 95% CI, 0.7817-0.9372). Further analysis of the cognitive domains found that the miR-29s levels were all associated with memory performance in PD patients. In summary, miR-29s are associated with cognitive impairment in PD.
