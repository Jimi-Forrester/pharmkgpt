9330241|t|Abbreviated cognitive test for delirium.
9330241|a|The cognitive test for delirium (CTD) was recently developed to identify delirium in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Stepwise discriminant analyses using the original validation sample indicated that a total score formed by summing only two of the nine content scores (visual attention span and recognition memory for pictures) maintained good reliability (coefficient alpha = 0.79) and the ability to discriminate delirium from dementia, schizophrenia, and depression (p < 0.0001) and delirium from moderate to severe dementia (p < 0.0002). This abbreviated version of the CTD is more practical for use by ICU clinicians.
