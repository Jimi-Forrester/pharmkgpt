26566399|t|Tissue Probability Map Constrained 4-D Clustering Algorithm for Increased Accuracy and Robustness in Serial MR Brain Image Segmentation.
26566399|a|The traditional fuzzy clustering algorithm and its extensions have been successfully applied in medical image segmentation. However, because of the variability of tissues and anatomical structures, the clustering results might be biased by the tissue population and intensity differences. For example, clustering-based algorithms tend to over-segment white matter tissues of MR brain images. To solve this problem, we introduce a tissue probability map constrained clustering algorithm and apply it to serial MR brain image segmentation, i.e., a series of 3-D MR brain images of the same subject at different time points. Using the new serial image segmentation algorithm in the framework of the CLASSIC framework, which iteratively segments the images and estimates the longitudinal deformations, we improved both accuracy and robustness for serial image computing, and at the mean time produced longitudinally consistent segmentation and stable measures. In the algorithm, the tissue probability maps consist of both the population-based and subject-specific segmentation priors. Experimental study using both simulated longitudinal MR brain data and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data confirmed that using both priors more accurate and robust segmentation results can be obtained. The proposed algorithm can be applied in longitudinal follow up studies of MR brain imaging with subtle morphological changes for neurological disorders.
