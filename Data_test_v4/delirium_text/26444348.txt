26444348|t|Entorhinal cortex: a good biomarker of mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease.
26444348|a|Entorhinal cortex (EC), thought to be the location of the earliest lesions in Alzheimer's disease (AD), has been widely studied in recent years. With the irreversible pathological changes of AD, there is an urgent need to find biomarkers that can be used to predict the presence of the disease before it is clinically expressed. The aim of this review is to summarize and analyze recent findings that are relevant to the important role of EC in the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD and to describe a range of neuroimaging techniques used to define the EC boundary. A comprehensive literature search for articles published up to May 2015 was performed. Our research highlights the finding that atrophy in EC reflects the early pathological changes of AD and can be a strong predictor of prodromal AD. The early changes in EC are a good imaging biomarker that can be used to discriminate individuals with MCI from normal control subjects. A larger degree of atrophy in EC predicts increased disease severity, and the right EC in patients with mild AD exhibited greater changes than the left side. In addition, the EC seems to have an obvious advantage over the hippocampus as a biomarker when predicting future conversion to AD in individuals with MCI, and it may be of help in following the course of disease progression. In this review, we also summarize the main differences observed between the hippocampus and the EC when differentiating diseases. These findings will hopefully provide an opportunity for the effective prevention and early treatment of AD.
