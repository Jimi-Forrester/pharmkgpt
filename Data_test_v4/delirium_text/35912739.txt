35912739|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is common in the elderly population. Exploring patterns of white matter damage at the microstructural level would give important indications for the underlying mechanisms. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spatial patterns of white matter microstructure and structural network alternations in relation to different cognition domainsMethods:Participants from the community-based Shunyi Study were included to investigate the association between white matter measurements and cognition cross-sectionally, via both global and local analysis. Cognitive functions were assessed using digit span, trail making test (TMT)-A/B, Fuld object Memory, and 12-Word Philadelphia Verbal Learning Test (PVLT). White matter measurements including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and structural network parameters were calculated based on diffusion tensor imaging. RESULTS: Of the 943 participants included, the mean (SD) age was 55.8 (9.1) years, and the mean (SD) education level was 6.7 (3.2) years. We found the whole set of cognitive measurements was related to diffused white matter microstructural integrity damage and lower global efficiency. Poor executive functions (TMTA/B complete time) were related to lower FA and higher MD predominantly on the anterior white matter skeleton, while verbal memory loss (PVLT test scores) was related to sub-network dysconnectivity in the midline and the right temporal lobe. CONCLUSION: The anterior brain is dominantly involved in executive dysfunction, while midline and right temporal brain disconnection are more prominent in verbal memory loss. Global and regional disruption of white matter integrity and network connectivity is the anatomical basis of the cognitive impairment in the aging population.
