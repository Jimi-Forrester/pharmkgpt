35544296|t|Audio Recording Patient-Nurse Verbal Communications in Home Health Care Settings: Pilot Feasibility and Usability Study.
35544296|a|BACKGROUND: Patients' spontaneous speech can act as a biomarker for identifying pathological entities, such as mental illness. Despite this potential, audio recording patients' spontaneous speech is not part of clinical workflows, and health care organizations often do not have dedicated policies regarding the audio recording of clinical encounters. No previous studies have investigated the best practical approach for integrating audio recording of patient-clinician encounters into clinical workflows, particularly in the home health care (HHC) setting. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the functionality and usability of several audio-recording devices for the audio recording of patient-nurse verbal communications in the HHC settings and elicit HHC stakeholder (patients and nurses) perspectives about the facilitators of and barriers to integrating audio recordings into clinical workflows. METHODS: This study was conducted at a large urban HHC agency located in New York, United States. We evaluated the usability and functionality of 7 audio-recording devices in a laboratory (controlled) setting. A total of 3 devices-Saramonic Blink500, Sony ICD-TX6, and Black Vox 365-were further evaluated in a clinical setting (patients' homes) by HHC nurses who completed the System Usability Scale questionnaire and participated in a short, structured interview to elicit feedback about each device. We also evaluated the accuracy of the automatic transcription of audio-recorded encounters for the 3 devices using the Amazon Web Service Transcribe. Word error rate was used to measure the accuracy of automated speech transcription. To understand the facilitators of and barriers to integrating audio recording of encounters into clinical workflows, we conducted semistructured interviews with 3 HHC nurses and 10 HHC patients. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the transcribed interviews. RESULTS: Saramonic Blink500 received the best overall evaluation score. The System Usability Scale score and word error rate for Saramonic Blink500 were 65% and 26%, respectively, and nurses found it easier to approach patients using this device than with the other 2 devices. Overall, patients found the process of audio recording to be satisfactory and convenient, with minimal impact on their communication with nurses. Although, in general, nurses also found the process easy to learn and satisfactory, they suggested that the audio recording of HHC encounters can affect their communication patterns. In addition, nurses were not aware of the potential to use audio-recorded encounters to improve health care services. Nurses also indicated that they would need to involve their managers to determine how audio recordings could be integrated into their clinical workflows and for any ongoing use of audio recordings during patient care management. CONCLUSIONS: This study established the feasibility of audio recording HHC patient-nurse encounters. Training HHC nurses about the importance of the audio-recording process and the support of clinical managers are essential factors for successful implementation.
