38653158|t|A novel nomogram for the prediction of subsyndromal delirium in patients in intensive care units: A prospective, nested case-controlled study.
38653158|a|BACKGROUND: Subsyndromal delirium is a dynamic, recognizable condition commonly observed in intensive care unit (ICU) patients that can lead to poor patient prognosis, and its prompt recognition and management can prevent disease progression. However, no evidence-based predictive tool has been developed specifically to assess the occurrence of subsyndromal delirium in the ICU. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a novel, simple and effective tool for estimating the risk of subsyndromal delirium among ICU patients. DESIGN: A prospective, nested case-controlled study. DATA SOURCES: A total of 731 patients were recruited from the central ICU of a tertiary hospital in southwestern China from August 2021 to November 2022. METHODS: The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was applied to screen potential features for univariate and multivariate logistic regression. A nomogram was constructed using the selected variables. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by combining the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: The prevalence of subsyndromal delirium among ICU patients was 23.06 %. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the independent predictive factors for subsyndromal delirium among ICU patients were vision impairment, a history of falls, the use of restraint, blood transfusion, the use of antibiotics, surgery, the Caprini score, and the Braden score, all of which were used to construct the nomogram. The AUCs for the model were 0.710 (95 % CI, 0.654-0.766, P < 0.001) and 0.825 (95 % CI, 0.732-0.917, P < 0.001) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively, indicating that the model had high accuracy in distinguishing patients with and without subsyndromal delirium. The calibration curve of the nomogram showed good consistency between the predicted and actual probabilities. The DCA indicated that the nomogram has clinical application for patients in the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: We developed an easy-to-use nomogram for identifying subsyndromal delirium in ICU patients with satisfactory predictive ability based on simple and easily accessible clinical features. The nomogram can identify ICU patients at high-risk for subsyndromal delirium and may be a useful subsyndromal delirium tool for current ICU physicians.
