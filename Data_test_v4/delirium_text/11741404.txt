11741404|a|Trying to decrease the production of Amyloid beta (Abeta) has been envisaged as a promising approach to prevent neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). A chronic inflammatory reaction with activated microglia cells and astrocytes is a constant feature of AD. The participation of the immune system in the disease process is further documented in several retrospective clinical studies showing an inverse relationship between the prevalence of AD and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy. Previously, we demonstrated that the combination of the proinflammatory cytokines TNFalpha with IFNgamma induces the production of Abeta-42 and Abeta-40 in human neuronal cells. In the present study, the neuronal cell line Sk-n-sh was incubated for 12 h with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen and subsequently stimulated with the cytokines TNFalpha and IFNgamma. Ibuprofen treatment decreased the secretion of total Abeta in the conditioned media of cytokine stimulated cells by 50% and prevented the accumulation of Abeta-42 and Abeta-40 in detergent soluble cell extracts. Viability of neuronal cells measured by detection of apoptosis was neither influenced by ibuprofen nor by cytokine treatment. The reduction in the production of Abeta by ibuprofen was presumably due to a decreased production of betaAPP, which in contrast to the control proteins M2 pyruvate kinase, beta-tubulin and the cytokine inducible ICAM-1 was detected at low concentration in ibuprofen treated cells. The data demonstrate a possible mechanism how ibuprofen may decrease the risk and delay the onset of AD.
