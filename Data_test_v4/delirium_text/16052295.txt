16052295|a|BACKGROUND: Several cross-sectional, case-control and prospective studies revealed a relation between homocysteine and cognitive function or dementia. These studies included either patient populations or healthy, community- dwelling elderly people. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study we tested the hypothesis that homocysteine was inversely associated with cognitive function in a population of institutionalised elderly (aged >/= 60 y; n = 157). METHODS: For testing this hypothesis baseline data of a recently conducted intervention study in institutionalised elderly (median age 83 years) were used. Cognitive function was evaluated by the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog). The association between fasting plasma homocysteine level and cognitive function was investigated by multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: In the crude model homocysteine concentration was not significantly related to ADAS-cog score (beta = 0.061; p = 0.45). Age was found to be related to ADAS-cog score (beta = 0.161; p < 0.05). Adjusting for age did however not result in a relation between homocysteine and cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: In our study no association was found between homocysteine and cognitive function in a population of very old institutionalised subjects.
