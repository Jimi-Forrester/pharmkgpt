37993461|a|Human cerebellar development is orchestrated by molecular regulatory networks to achieve cytoarchitecture and coordinate motor and cognitive functions. Here, we combined single-cell transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics and single cell chromatin accessibility states to systematically depict an integrative spatiotemporal landscape of human fetal cerebellar development. We revealed that combinations of transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) play roles in governing progenitor differentiation and cell fate determination along trajectories in a hierarchical manner, providing a gene expression regulatory map of cell fate and spatial information for these cells. We also illustrated that granule cells located in different regions of the cerebellar cortex showed distinct molecular signatures regulated by different signals during development. Finally, we mapped single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of disorders related to cerebellar dysfunction and discovered that several disorder-associated genes showed spatiotemporal and cell type-specific expression patterns only in humans, indicating the cellular basis and possible mechanisms of the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders.
