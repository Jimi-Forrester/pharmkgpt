34874493|t|Is there evidence behind pre- or perioperative cognitive training in gynaecological patients on the prevention of perioperative cognitive dysfunction? A review.
34874493|a|PURPOSE: Perioperative cognitive dysfunction can be observed in all age groups of patients. Sometimes, this is more stressful to the patient than the actual surgical wound. Enhanced recovery after surgery pathways screen for patients at risk and lead to early post-surgical intervention. To prevent cognitive dysfunction, a prehabilitation approach might be useful. METHODS: This systematic literature review provides an overview on the current knowledge on prehabilitation for cognitive dysfunction for gynaecological patients by searching the National Library of Medicine (PubMed) in February 2020 to identify publications regarding presurgical cognitive training with three different search terms. RESULTS: 501 articles were identified and after screening for eligibility five were left for further analysis. Generally, cognitive function is split into several cognitive aspects like anxiety or memory, speed, attention, flexibility or problem-solving functions. Each of these aspects can/need to be trained to show an improvement after general anaesthesia. Training possibilities range from relaxation methods via music, one-on-one personal training sessions to electronically supported training units. CONCLUSION: Prehabilitation of the cognitive function can be split in different cognitive domains. Each of these domains seem to be influenced by training. The training itself can be based on applications or known relaxation methods or even old-fashioned board games. The evidence is, however, still low and there is a need for further studies.
