37869393|t|Green one-step synthesis of mushroom-derived carbon dots as fluorescent sensors for Fe3+ detection.
37869393|a|Blue photoluminescent carbon dots were synthesized from Lentinus polychrous Lev. via a simple hydrothermal process without additional chemical reagents or functionalization. The carbon dots (hereafter referred to as LCDs) were quasi-spherical with an average diameter of 6.0 nm. The strong fluorescence emissions of LCDs were utilized as the basis of efficient turn-off probes for Fe3+. The quenching phenomenon could be used to rapidly determine Fe3+ concentrations in the range of 0.0-2.0 mM in aqueous solution, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 16 muM. In the presence of interference, LCDs demonstrated good sensitivity and selectivity towards Fe3+ in both solution-based and paper-based systems. The LCDs also exhibited excellent photostability and an eco-friendly nature, making them an ideal choice for environmental monitoring with significant potential for diagnostic applications.
