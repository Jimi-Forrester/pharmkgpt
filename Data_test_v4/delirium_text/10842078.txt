10842078|a|The beta-amyloid precursor proteins (betaAPPs) are a family of glycosylated transmembrane proteins that include in their sequences the beta-amyloid peptide, a major component of the characteristic amyloid deposits or senile plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients and aged Down's syndrome subjects. Various betaAPP isoforms, mainly betaAPP-695, betaAPP-714, betaAPP-751 and betaAPP-770, the number corresponding to the number of amino acids they encode, resulting from the alternative splicing of a single primary transcript have been described. Using oligonucleotides recognizing each of the four major Alzheimer's betaAPP mRNAs, we have found that each betaAPP mRNA displays a specific temporal and spatial pattern of expression. The prototype isoform betaAPP-695 occurs early in cells actively implicated in morphogenetic events, as those mesodermal cells invaginating at the level of the primitive streak, and it is later restricted to the neurectodermal (neural tube, neural crest and neurogenic placode) derivatives. By contrast, the longest isoform betaAPP-770 appears later and restricted to mesodermal and endodermal derivatives. The isoforms betaAPP-714 and betaAPP-751 are still expressed later than the other two isoforms and distributed ubiquitously, though betaAPP-714 transcripts predominate typically within the neural tube.
