38089942|t|Midazolam for Anesthetic Premedication in Children: Considerations and Alternatives.
38089942|a|Premedication in anesthesia has long been used to reduce patient anxiety, increase patient compliance, and supplement the overall anesthetic. In pediatric populations, premedication also has the indirect benefits of reducing parental anxiety as well as both the incidence and severity of emergence delirium. Oral midazolam, selected for its ease of administration, short duration of action, and reliable anxiolytic and amnestic effects, has been a favorite choice in this role for decades. The side effect profile of midazolam is also relatively benign, heavily dose-dependent, and easily managed in the perioperative setting. While midazolam appears to be an ideal adjunct in the anesthetic care of pediatric patients, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting prolonged benzodiazepine exposure causes neurodevelopmental changes in infants. This evidence, along with the 2017 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning labels for the use of select anesthetic medications, including midazolam in children under the age of three, has led to some debate in the anesthetic community over the continued use of this anesthetic for premedication in pediatric populations. This article aims to educate the reader on the history of midazolam as a premedication agent in pediatric populations and examine the evidence supporting and against its continued use in this role.
