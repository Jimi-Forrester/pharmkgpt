7871204|t|[Clinical significance of heat shock proteins. Influence of heat shock proteins on the pathomechanism of selected diseases].
7871204|a|The presentation shows the survey of diseases the pathogenesis of which might be connected with the existence of Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs). We discuss the data referring to the influence of the HSPs upon the occurrence and progression of the following diseases: systemic lupus erythematosus, reactive arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. There is also indicated a possible activity of HSPs in the pathogenesis of neoplasia, organ ischaemia and inflammation or degeneration.
