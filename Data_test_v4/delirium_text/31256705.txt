31256705|t|Fluid Stewardship During Critical Illness: A Call to Action.
31256705|a|Intravenous fluids (IVFs) are the most common drugs administered in the intensive care unit. Despite the ubiquitous use, IVFs are not benign and carry significant risks associated with under- or overadministration. Hypovolemia is associated with decreased organ perfusion, ischemia, and multi-organ failure. Hypervolemia and volume overload are associated with organ dysfunction, delayed liberation from mechanical ventilation, and increased mortality. Despite appropriate provision of IVF, adverse drug effects such as electrolyte abnormalities and acid-base disturbances may occur. The management of volume status in critically ill patients is both dynamic and tenuous, a process that requires frequent monitoring and high clinical acumen. Because patient-specific considerations for fluid therapy evolve across the continuum of critical illness, a standard approach to the assessment of fluid needs and prescription of IVF therapy is necessary. We propose the principle of "fluid stewardship," guided by 4 rights of medication safety: right patient, right drug, right route, and right dose. The successful implementation of fluid stewardship will aid pharmacists in making decisions regarding IVF therapy to optimize hemodynamic management and improve patient outcomes. Additionally, we highlight several areas of focus for future research, guided by the 4 rights construct of fluid stewardship.
