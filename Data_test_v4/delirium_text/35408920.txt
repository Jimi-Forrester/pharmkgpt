35408920|t|Curcumin in Retinal Diseases: A Comprehensive Review from Bench to Bedside.
35408920|a|Recent evidence in basic science is leading to a growing interest in the possible role of curcumin in treating retinal diseases. Curcumin has been demonstrated to be able to modulate gene transcription and reduce ganglion cell apoptosis, downgrade VEGF, modulate glucose levels and decrease vascular dysfunction. So far, the use of curcumin has been limited by poor bioavailability; to overcome this issue, different types of carriers have been used. Multiple recent studies disclosed the efficacy of using curcumin in treating different retinal conditions. The aim of this review is to comprehensively review and discuss the role of curcumin in retinal diseases from bench to bedside.
