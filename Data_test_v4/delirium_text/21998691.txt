21998691|t|Xanthene food dye, as a modulator of Alzheimer's disease amyloid-beta peptide aggregation and the associated impaired neuronal cell function.
21998691|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. AD is a degenerative brain disorder that causes problems with memory, thinking and behavior. It has been suggested that aggregation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is closely linked to the development of AD pathology. In the search for safe, effective modulators, we evaluated the modulating capabilities of erythrosine B (ER), a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved red food dye, on Abeta aggregation and Abeta-associated impaired neuronal cell function. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In order to evaluate the modulating ability of ER on Abeta aggregation, we employed transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assay, and immunoassays using Abeta-specific antibodies. TEM images and ThT fluorescence of Abeta samples indicate that protofibrils are predominantly generated and persist for at least 3 days. The average length of the ER-induced protofibrils is inversely proportional to the concentration of ER above the stoichiometric concentration of Abeta monomers. Immunoassay results using Abeta-specific antibodies suggest that ER binds to the N-terminus of Abeta and inhibits amyloid fibril formation. In order to evaluate Abeta-associated toxicity we determined the reducing activity of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells treated with Abeta aggregates formed in the absence or in the presence of ER. As the concentration of ER increased above the stoichiometric concentration of Abeta, cellular reducing activity increased and Abeta-associated reducing activity loss was negligible at 500 microM ER. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings show that ER is a novel modulator of Abeta aggregation and reduces Abeta-associated impaired cell function. Our findings also suggest that xanthene dye can be a new type of small molecule modulator of Abeta aggregation. With demonstrated safety profiles and blood-brain permeability, ER represents a particularly attractive aggregation modulator for amyloidogenic proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases.
