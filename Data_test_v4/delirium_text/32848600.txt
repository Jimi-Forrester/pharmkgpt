32848600|t|Targeting Amyloidogenic Processing of APP in Alzheimer's Disease.
32848600|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of senile dementia, characterized by neurofibrillary tangle and amyloid plaque in brain pathology. Major efforts in AD drug were devoted to the interference with the production and accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), which plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of AD. Abeta is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP), by consecutive cleavage by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase. Therefore, beta-secretase and gamma-secretase inhibition have been the focus for AD drug discovery efforts for amyloid reduction. Here, we review beta-secretase inhibitors and gamma-secretase inhibitors/modulators, and their efficacies in clinical trials. In addition, we discussed the novel concept of specifically targeting the gamma-secretase substrate APP. Targeting amyloidogenic processing of APP is still a fundamentally sound strategy to develop disease-modifying AD therapies and recent advance in gamma-secretase/APP complex structure provides new opportunities in designing selective inhibitors/modulators for AD.
