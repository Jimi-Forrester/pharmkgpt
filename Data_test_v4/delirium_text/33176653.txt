33176653|t|Naturally Inspired Pyrimidines Analogues for Alzheimer's Disease.
33176653|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifarious and developing neurodegenerative disorder. The treatment of AD is still a challenge and availability of drug therapy on the basis of symptoms is not up to the mark. In the context of existence, which is getting worse for the human brain, it is necessary to take care of all critical measures. The disease is caused due to multidirectional pathology of the body, which demands the multi-target-directed ligand (MTDL) approach. This gives hope for new drugs for AD, summarized here in with the pyrimidine based natural product inspired molecule as a lead. The review is sufficient in providing a list of chemical ingredients of the plant to cure AD and screen them against various potential targets of AD. The synthesis of a highly functionalized scaffold in one step in a single pot without isolating the intermediate is a challenging task. In few examples, we have highlighted the importance of this kind of reaction, generally known as multi-component reaction. Multi-component is a widely accepted technique by the drug discovery people due to its high atom economy. It reduces multi-step process to a one-step process, therefore the compounds library can be made in minimum time and cost. This review has highlighted the importance of multicomponent reactions by giving the example of active scaffolds of pyrimidine/fused pyrimidines. This would bring importance to the fast as well as smart synthesis of bio-relevant molecules.
