37836504|t|Effectiveness of Fish Roe, Snow Fungus, and Yeast Supplementation for Cognitive Function: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.
37836504|a|The brain is one of the most critical organs in the human body, regulating functions such as thinking, memory, learning, and perception. Studies have indicated that fish roe, snow fungus, and yeast may have the potential to modulate cognitive, memory, and emotional functions. However, more relevant clinical research in this area still needs to be conducted. This study explored the cognition-enhancing potential of a formula beverage including fish roe, snow fungus, and yeast. Sixty-four subjects were divided into a placebo group (n = 32) and a formula-drink group (n = 32), who consumed the product for 8 weeks. Cognitive tests were administered and analyzed at weeks 0, 4, and 8. After 4 and 8 weeks, there was a significant increase in the number of memory cards, and the response times among those who consumed the formula beverage were significantly faster than those in the placebo group. The subjects remembered the old items better and were more impressed with similar items based on the week effect. There was a significant increase in the cue effect of happy facial expressions after the subjects consumed the formula beverage for 8 weeks. In addition, there was a significant decrease in anxiety and fatigue, and improved quality of life. This formula beverage is a promising option that could be used to prevent further cognitive decline in adults with subjective cognitive complaints.
