34414447|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease amongst the middle-aged and elderly populations. Several studies have confirmed that the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) serves a key role in the pathogenesis of PD. Changes to the gastrointestinal microbiome (GM) cause misfolding and abnormal aggregation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) in the intestine. Abnormal alpha-syn is not eliminated via physiological mechanisms and is transported into the central nervous system (CNS) via the vagus nerve. The abnormal levels of alpha-syn aggregate in the substantia nigra pars compacta, not only leading to the formation of eosinophilic Lewis Bodies in the cytoplasm and mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic (DA) neurons, but also leading to the stimulation of an inflammatory response in the microglia. These pathological changes result in an increase in oxidative stress (OS), which triggers nerve cell apoptosis, a characteristic of PD. This increase in OS further oxidizes and intensifies abnormal aggregation of alpha-syn, eventually forming a positive feedback loop. The present review discusses the abnormal accumulation of alpha-syn in the intestine caused by the GM changes and the increased levels of alpha-syn transport to the CNS via the MGBA, resulting in the loss of DA neurons and an increase in the inflammatory response of microglial cells in the brain of patients with PD. In addition, relevant clinical therapeutic strategies for improving the GM and reducing alpha-syn accumulation to relieve the symptoms and progression of PD are described.
