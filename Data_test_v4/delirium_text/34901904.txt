34901904|t|A dual-targeted multifunctional nanoformulation for potential prevention and therapy of Alzheimer's disease.
34901904|a|Antioxidation and adjustable treatment strategies are critical for the effective treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we design a dual-targeted Prussian blue nanoformulation (PTCN) that can cross the blood-brain barrier and target amyloid beta aggregates further exert antioxidant effects. An adjustable gradient dosing strategy with PTCN is used for the first time to design the preventive and therapeutic trials based on the severity of oxidative stress at different AD stages. The results show that PTCN could effectively ameliorate AD-related pathological processes, improve the cognitive decline, and rescue hippocampal atrophy of APP/PS1 mice in both preventive and therapeutic trials. Altogether, PTCN provided here is a successful combination of three traditional biomaterials with good biosafety, which has broad prospects for the early prevention, mild remission, and late treatment of AD, and is expected to be developed into personalized therapeutic drugs and healthcare products for clinical AD in the future.
