38247982|t|Outcomes of COVID-19-Associated Hospitalizations in Geriatric Patients with Dementia in the United States: A Propensity Score Matched Analysis.
38247982|a|Previous studies have convincingly demonstrated the negative impact of dementia on overall health outcomes. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is burgeoning evidence suggesting a possible association between dementia and adverse outcomes, however the relationship has not been conclusively established. We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving 816,960 hospitalized COVID-19 patients aged 65 or older from the 2020 national inpatient sample. The cohort was bifurcated into patients with dementia (n = 180,845) and those without (n = 636,115). Multivariate regression and propensity score matched analyses (PSM) assessed in-hospital mortality and complications. We observed that COVID-19 patients with dementia had a notably higher risk of in-hospital mortality (23.1% vs. 18.6%; aOR = 1.2 [95% CI 1.1-1.2]). This elevated risk persisted even after PSM. Interestingly, dementia patients had a reduced risk of several acute in-hospital complications, including liver failure and sudden cardiac arrest. Nevertheless, they had longer hospital stays and lower total hospital charges. Our findings conclusively demonstrate that dementia patients face a heightened risk of mortality when hospitalized with COVID-19 but are less likely to experience certain complications. This complexity underscores the urgent need for individualized care strategies for this vulnerable group.
