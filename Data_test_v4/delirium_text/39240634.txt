39240634|a|Background: Aggregated forms of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides which form protofibrils and fibrils in the brain are signatures of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aggregates are also recognized by microglia, which in early phases maybe protective and in later phases contribute to the pathology. We have identified several small molecules, decoys which interfere with Abeta oligomerization and induce other aggregation trajectories leading to aggregated macrostructures which are non-toxic. Objective: This study investigates whether the small-molecule decoys affect microglial activation in terms of cytokine secretion and phagocytosis of Abeta peptide. Methods: The effects of the decoys (NSC 69318, NSC 100873, NSC 16224) were analyzed in a model of human THP-1 monocytes differentiated to microglia-like cells. The cells were activated by Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptides, respectively, and after treatment with each decoy the secreted levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the Abeta phagocytosis were analyzed. Results: NSC16224, which generates a double-stranded aggregate of thin protofibrils, was found to block Abeta40- and Abeta42-induced increase in microglial secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. NSC 69318, selective for neurotoxicity of Abeta42, and NSC 100873 did not significantly reduce the microglial activation in terms of cytokine secretion. The uptake of Abeta42 was not affected by anyone of the decoys. Conclusions: Our findings open the possibility that the molecular decoys of Abeta aggregation may block microglial activation by Abeta40 and Abeta42 in addition to blocking neurotoxicity as shown previously.
