1902089|t|Abnormal and deficient processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein in familial Alzheimer's disease lymphoblastoid cells.
1902089|a|Western blot analysis showed abnormal processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Antibody raised against central APP751 revealed that media of early and late-onset FAD LCLs had highly increased amounts of a 120 kD long-lived. SDS-stable, heat-labile complex of the Kunitz protease inhibitor domain of secreted APP and a approximately 70 kD FAD-specific, yet unidentified serine protease. Antibody against the beta A4-cytoplasmic domain showed a slower APP processing and increased amounts of 16 kD C-terminal preamyloid in lysates of early and late-onset FAD LCLs, first indicating a deficient intra-beta A4 proteolysis in FAD as a possible cause of abundant amyloid deposits in AD brain.
