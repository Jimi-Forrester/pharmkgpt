36468062|t|Segmentation and differentiation of periventricular and deep white matter hyperintensities in 2D T2-FLAIR MRI based on a cascade U-net.
36468062|a|Background: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are a subtype of cerebral small vessel disease and can be divided into periventricular WMHs (pvWMHs) and deep WMHs (dWMHs). pvWMHs and dWMHs were proved to be determined by different etiologies. This study aimed to develop a 2D Cascade U-net (Cascade U) for the segmentation and differentiation of pvWMHs and dWMHs on 2D T2-FLAIR images. Methods: A total of 253 subjects were recruited in the present study. All subjects underwent 2D T2-FLAIR scan on a 3.0 Tesla MR scanner. Both contours of pvWMHs and dWMHs were manually delineated by the observers and considered as the gold standard. Fazekas scale was used to evaluate the burdens of pvWMHs and dWMHs, respectively. Cascade U consisted of a segmentation U-net and a differentiation U-net and was trained with a combined loss function. The performance of Cascade U was compared with two other U-net models (Pipeline U and Separate U). Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), precision, and recall were used to evaluate the performances of all models. The linear correlations between WMHs volume (WMHV) measured by all models and the gold standard were also conducted. Results: Compared with other models, Cascade U exhibited a better performance on WMHs segmentation and pvWMHs identification. Cascade U achieved DSC values of 0.605 +- 0.135, 0.517 +- 0.263, and 0.510 +- 0.241 and MCC values of 0.617 +- 0.122, 0.526 +- 0.263, and 0.522 +- 0.243 on the segmentation of total WMHs, pvWMHs, and dWMHs, respectively. Cascade U exhibited strong correlations with the gold standard on measuring WMHV (R2 = 0.954, p < 0.001), pvWMHV (R2 = 0.933, p < 0.001), and dWMHV (R2 = 0.918, p < 0.001). A significant correlation was found on lesion volume between Cascade U and gold standard (r > 0.510, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Cascade U showed competitive results in segmentation and differentiation of pvWMHs and dWMHs on 2D T2-FLAIR images, indicating potential feasibility in precisely evaluating the burdens of WMHs.
