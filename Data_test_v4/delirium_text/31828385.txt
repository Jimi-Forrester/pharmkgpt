31828385|a|The German population is aging in accordance with the worldwide trend; however, in comparison to most other industrial countries the number of disease-free years of life gained by patients is significantly lower in Germany. Subsequently, the number of hospitalizations and necessary surgical treatment for older and especially frail patients is significantly increasing. Several frailty scoring systems have been published with the aim of improving the assessment of the perioperative risk for these patients; however, these systems for risk assessment have not yet become clinical routine in surgery and therefore this group of frail patients remains underdiagnosed in the field of surgery. Frail patients in particular often need individualized treatment or the adaptation of standard of perioperative care. It has already been clearly shown that frail patients have a markedly higher incidence for certain risk factors (e.g. postoperative delirium, hypovolemia, pharmacological side effects and drug interactions). Additionally, malnutrition is common at the time of hospital admission in up to 70% of this patient group. If not recognized and treated accordingly all these risk factors lead to a compromised rehabilitation, higher complication rates, a prolonged length of hospital stay and a higher mortality. Special preoperative risk assessment scores, which highlight physical, psychological and social evaluation should be widely implemented in surgical departments. A standardized risk assessment embedded in evidence-based prerehabilitation programs and implemented in geriatric surgery centers can help to improve the outcome in this group of fragile patients.
