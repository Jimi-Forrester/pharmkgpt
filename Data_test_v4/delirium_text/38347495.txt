38347495|a|BACKGROUNDS: The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the main screening and follow-up test for neurocognitive disorders. In France, it is often administered by medical students. Conditions allowing to administer the MMSE are strict but not well known by students, leading to mistakes in scoring. Our objectives were to assess the effect of a multimodal training on medical students' ability to administer the MMSE and to describe their previous training. METHODS: 75 medical students between the 4th and 6th year of study were included. Previous MMSE training was assessed by a standardized questionnaire. The teaching material used for our training was the article validating MMSE in French, a video explaining the steps on how to administer the MMSE test, and MMSE's scoring exercises. The ability to administer the MMSE was assessed by a Standardized practical exam (SPE). Students were self-selected and then assigned in two groups, one benefiting from all the training before SPE, and the other receiving only the article before SPE. RESULTS: 41 students were included in the training group and 34 in the control group. There was no difference between groups regarding previous training. 71% of the students had already administered a MMSE test and only 17% had received specific training. Students considered their previous training as insufficient in most cases. The overall score and scores of each subpart of the SPE were significantly higher in the training group than in the control group (overall score: median [IQR]: 71 [62-78] vs. 52 [41-57], p < 0.001). The rate of students able to complete the MMSE was higher in the training group compared to the control (85% vs. 44%, p < 0.001). Quality of the training and its usefulness were judged to be good or very good by all participants. CONCLUSIONS: A multimodal training improves the ability of medical students to administer the MMSE.
