2890144|t|Delirium tremens. Update on an old disorder.
2890144|a|A retrospective study of patients who probably had delirium tremens during hospitalization for alcohol dependency is reported. Predictors of delirium tremens were daily heavy alcohol use, a past history of delirium tremens, and a past history of alcohol withdrawal seizures. Management included general measures and specific therapy for complications. Mortality was only 4.9%, which reflects the improved management techniques now available. The use of multiple interventions proved most effective.
