39370896|a|AIM & BACKGROUND: Delirium frequently occurs in the acute phase of sepsis and is associated with increased ICU and hospital length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and higher mortality rates. We utilized the Near-Infrared Spectroscopy monitor to measure and compare the regional cerebral oxygen saturation in mechanically ventilated patients of sepsis receiving either dexmedetomidine or propofol sedation and assessed the association between delirium and regional cerebral oxygen saturation. METHODS: A single center prospective randomized control trial conducted over a period of two years, 54 patients were included, equally divided between propofol and dexmedetomidine groups. Patients received a blinded study drug, propofol (10 mg/mL) or dexmedetomidine (5 mcg/mL) via infusion pump according to randomization. Infusion rates were adjusted every 10 min based on weight-based titration tables, aiming for target sedation (RASS -2 to 0). Management components included pain monitoring using the CPOT score and delirium assessment using CAM-ICU score. RESULTS: Dexmedetomidine group showed higher mean regional cerebral oxygen saturation as compared to propofol group (P = .036). No significant differences were found in mechanical ventilation or ICU stay durations, delirium-free days, or sedation cessation reasons. Delirium occurred in 36 patients, with lower mean regional cerebral oxygen saturation as compared to non-delirious patients. CONCLUSION: The dexmedetomidine group had higher regional cerebral oxygen saturation compared to the propofol group. Delirious patients showed lower cerebral oxygen saturation than non-delirious patients, suggesting a link between sedation type, cerebral oxygenation, and delirium.CTRI registration: REF/2021/11/048655 N.
