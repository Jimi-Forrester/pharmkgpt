38459140|t|Loss-of-function variant in spermidine/spermine N1-acetyl transferase like 1 (SATL1) gene as an underlying cause of autism spectrum disorder.
38459140|a|Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complicated, lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder affecting verbal and non-verbal communication and social interactions. ASD signs and symptoms appear early in development before the age of 3 years. It is unlikely for a person to acquire autism after a period of normal development. However, we encountered an 8-year-old child who developed ASD later in life although his developmental milestones were normal at the beginning of life. Sequencing the complete coding part of the genome identified a hemizygous nonsense mutation (NM_001367857.2):c.1803C>G; (p.Tyr601Ter) in the gene (SATL1) encoding spermidine/spermine N1-acetyl transferase like 1. Screening an ASD cohort of 28 isolated patients for the SATL1 gene identified another patient with the same variant. Although SATL1 mutations have not been associated with any human diseases, our data suggests that a mutation in SATL1 is the underlying cause of ASD in our cases. In mammals, mutations in spermine synthase (SMS), an enzyme needed for the synthesis of spermidine polyamine, have been reported in a syndromic form of the X-linked mental retardation. Moreover, SATL1 gene expression studies showed a relatively higher expression of SATL1 transcripts in ASD related parts of the brain including the cerebellum, amygdala and frontal cortex. Additionally, spermidine has been characterized in the context of learning and memory and supplementations with spermidine increase neuroprotective effects and decrease age-induced memory impairment. Furthermore, spermidine biosynthesis is required for spontaneous axonal regeneration and prevents alpha-synuclein neurotoxicity in invertebrate models. Thus, we report, for the first time, that a mutation in the SATL1 gene could be a contributing factor in the development of autistic symptoms in our patients.
