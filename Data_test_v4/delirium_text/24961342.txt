24961342|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease. Although early diagnosis of AD is challenging, identification and treatment at the preclinical stage is critical for preventing the severe and irreversible damage to neurons. Thus, during the last few decades, many researchers have sought efficient biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD, monitoring disease progression, and gauging responses to therapies. Recently, various molecular markers have been investigated in blood, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, and other body fluids. This review summarizes the results of some recent studies that searched for biomarkers of AD in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood.
