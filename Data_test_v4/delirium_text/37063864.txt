37063864|a|Background: Glioma is the most lethal and most aggressive brain cancer, and currently there is no effective treatment. Cancer immunotherapy is an advanced therapy by manipulating immune cells to attack cancer cells and it has been studied a lot in glioma treatment. Targeting the immune checkpoint CD47 or blocking the CD47-SIRPalpha axis can effectively eliminate glioma cancer cells but also brings side effects such as anemia. Glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase-like protein (QPCTL) catalyzes the pyroglutamylation of CD47 and is crucial for the binding between CD47 and SIRPalpha. Further study found that loss of intracellular QPCTL limits chemokine function and reshapes myeloid infiltration to augment tumor immunity. However, the role of QPCTL in glioma and the relationship between its expression and clinical outcomes remains unclear. Deciphering the role of QPCTL in glioma will provide a promising therapy for glioma cancer immunotherapy. Methods: QPCTL expression in glioma tissues and normal adjacent tissues was primarily analyzed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and further validated in another independent cohort from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), and Human Protein Atlas (HPA). The relationships between QPCTL expression and clinicopathologic parameters and overall survival (OS) were assessed using multivariate methods and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. And the proteins network with which QPCTL interacted was built using the online STRING website. Meanwhile, we use Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) databases to investigate the relationships between QPCTL expression and infiltrated immune cells and their corresponding gene marker sets. We analyzed the Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) including GO/KEGG and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) based on QPCTL-high and -low expression tumors. Results: In contrast to normal tissue, QPCTL expression was higher in glioma tumor tissue (p < 0.05). Higher QPCTL expression was closely associated with high-grade malignancy and advanced tumor stage. Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated the overall survival of glioma patients with higher QPCTL expression is shorter than those with lower QPCTL expression (p < 0.05). Glioma with QPCTL deficiency presented the paucity of infiltrated immune cells and their matching marker sets. Moreover, QPCTL is essential for glioma cell proliferation and tumor growth and is a positive correlation with glioma cell stemness. Conclusion: High QPCTL expression predicts high grades of gliomas and poor prognosis with impaired infiltration of adaptive immune cells in the tumor microenvironment as well as higher cancer stemness. Moreover, targeting QPCTL will be a promising immunotherapy in glioma cancer treatment.
