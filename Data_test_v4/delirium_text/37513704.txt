37513704|t|Molecular Mimicry Mapping in Streptococcus pneumoniae: Cues for Autoimmune Disorders and Implications for Immune Defense Activation.
37513704|a|Streptococcus pneumoniae contributes to a range of infections, including meningitis, pneumonia, otitis media, and sepsis. Infections by this bacterium have been associated with the phenomenon of molecular mimicry, which, in turn, may contribute to the induction of autoimmunity. In this study, we utilized a bioinformatics approach to investigate the potential for S. pneumoniae to incite autoimmunity via molecular mimicry. We identified 13 S. pneumoniae proteins that have significant sequence similarity to human proteins, with 11 of them linked to autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes. Using in silico tools, we predicted the sequence as well as the structural homology among these proteins. Database mining was conducted to establish links between these proteins and autoimmune disorders. The antigenic, non-allergenic, and immunogenic sequence mimics were employed to design and validate an immune response via vaccine construct design. Mimic-based vaccine construct can prove effective for immunization against the S. pneumoniae infections. Immune response simulation and binding affinity was assessed through the docking of construct C8 to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules and TLR4 receptor, with promising results. Additionally, these mimics were mapped as conserved regions on their respective proteins, suggesting their functional importance in S. pneumoniae pathogenesis. This study highlights the potential for S. pneumoniae to trigger autoimmunity via molecular mimicry and the possibility of vaccine design using these mimics for triggering defense response.
