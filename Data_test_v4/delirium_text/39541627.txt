39541627|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the individual and organizational factors influencing falls among older inpatients, with a particular focus on the risk posed by hospital-induced delirium and the effect of nurse staffing levels. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized data from a national healthcare database to examine falls in hospitalized older adults, applying a mixed-effect logistic regression model RESULTS: Data from 391,902 patients across 580 hospitals revealed that 1.2 % of older inpatients experienced falls. Influential factors for falls included advanced age, the use of multiple medications and treatments, impaired mobility, and hospital-induced delirium. Nurse staffing levels markedly influenced the reduction of fall risks among older patients. CONCLUSION: Falls among hospitalized older adults are a frequent consequence of multifaceted risk components, highlighting the need for comprehensive fall prevention strategies and adequate.
