37239136|t|Biomarkers of Neurodegeneration in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: An Integrative Review.
37239136|a|Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a chronic psychiatric disorder that occurs following exposure to traumatic events. Recent evidence suggests that PTSD may be a risk factor for the development of subsequent neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's dementia and Parkinson's disease. Identification of biomarkers known to be associated with neurodegeneration in patients with PTSD would shed light on the pathophysiological mechanisms linking these disorders and would also help in the development of preventive strategies for neurodegenerative disorders in PTSD. With this background, the PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for studies designed to identify biomarkers that could be associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative disorders in patients with PTSD. Out of a total of 342 citations retrieved, 29 studies were identified for inclusion in the review. The results of these studies suggest that biomarkers such as cerebral cortical thinning, disrupted white matter integrity, specific genetic polymorphisms, immune-inflammatory alterations, vitamin D deficiency, metabolic syndrome, and objectively documented parasomnias are significantly associated with PTSD and may predict an increased risk of subsequent neurodegenerative disorders. The biological mechanisms underlying these changes, and the interactions between them, are also explored. Though requiring replication, these findings highlight a number of biological pathways that plausibly link PTSD with neurodegenerative disorders and suggest potentially valuable avenues for prevention and early intervention.
