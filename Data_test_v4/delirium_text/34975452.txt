34975452|t|Widespread White Matter Microstructure Alterations Based on Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging in Patients With Pontine Infarction.
34975452|a|Neurological deficits after stroke are closely related to white matter microstructure damage. However, secondary changes in white matter microstructure after pontine infarction (PI) in the whole brain remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the correlation of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI)-derived diffusion and kurtosis parameters of abnormal white matter tracts with behavioral function in patients with chronic PI. Overall, 60 patients with unilateral chronic PI (33 patients with left PI and 27 patients with right PI) and 30 normal subjects were recruited and underwent DKI scans. Diffusion parameters derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and DKI and kurtosis parameters derived from DKI were obtained. Between-group differences in multiple parameters were analyzed to assess the changes in abnormal white matter microstructure. Moreover, we also calculated the sensitivities of different diffusion and kurtosis parameters of DTI and DKI for identifying abnormal white matter tracts. Correlations between the DKI-derived parameters in secondary microstructure changes and behavioral scores in the PI were analyzed. Compared with the NC group, both left PI and right PI groups showed more extensive perilesional and remote white matter microstructure changes. The DKI-derived diffusion parameters showed higher sensitivities than did the DTI-derived parameters. Further, DKI-derived diffusion and kurtosis parameters in abnormal white matter regions were correlated with impaired motor and cognitive function in patients with PI. In conclusion, PI could lead to extensive white matter tracts impairment in perilesional and remote regions. Further, the diffusion and kurtosis parameters could be complementary for identifying comprehensive tissue microstructural damage after PI.
