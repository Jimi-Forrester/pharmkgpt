34311709|t|Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) level as a marker for significant coronary artery disease.
34311709|a|BACKGROUND: Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO), the rate-limiting enzyme in the kynurenine (Kyn) pathway of tryptophan (Trp) degradation, is modulated by inflammation, and is regarded as a key molecule driving immunotolerance and immunosuppressive mechanisms. Little is known about IDO activity in patients with active coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients who were scheduled to undergo coronary angiography. Measurement of IDO, high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels was performed at baseline, and IDO activity was monitored at the 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Three hundred and five patients were enrolled. Ninety-eight patients (32.1%) presented with recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Significant difference in IDO, kynurenine, and hs-TnT between patients with and without significant CAD was observed. Baseline IDO activity, kynurenine level, and hs-TnT level were all significantly higher in significant CAD patients with 3-vessel, 2-vessel, and 1-vessel involvement than in those with insignificant CAD [(0.17, 0.13, and 0.16 vs. 0.03, respectively; p = 0.003), (5.89, 4.58, and 5.24 vs. 2.74 microM/g, respectively; p = 0.011), and (18.27, 12.22, and 12.86 vs. 10.89 mg/dL, respectively; p < 0.001)]. One-year mortality was 3.9%. When we compared between patients who survived and patients who died, we found a significantly lower prevalence of left main (LM) disease by coronary angiogram (6.1% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.007), and also a trend toward higher baseline kynurenine (5.07 vs. 0.79 microM/g, p = 0.082) and higher IDO (0.15 vs. 0.02, p = 0.081) in patients who survived. CONCLUSION: Immunometabolic response mediated via IDO function was enhanced in patients with CAD, and correlated with the extent and severity of disease. Patients with LM disease had higher 1-year mortality. Lower level of IDO, as suggested by inadequate IDO response, demonstrated a trend toward predicting 1-year mortality.
