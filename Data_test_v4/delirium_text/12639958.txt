12639958|t|Membrane topology of gamma-secretase component PEN-2.
12639958|a|PEN-2 is an integral membrane protein that is a necessary component of the gamma-secretase complex, which is central in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and is also required for Notch signaling. In the absence of PEN-2, Notch signaling fails to guide normal development in Caenorhabditis elegans, and amyloid beta peptide is not generated from the amyloid precursor protein. Human PEN-2 is a 101-amino acid protein containing two putative transmembrane domains. To understand its interaction with other gamma-secretase components, it is important to know the membrane topology of each member of the complex. To characterize the membrane topology of PEN-2, we introduced single amino acid changes in each of the three hydrophilic regions of PEN-2 to generate N-linked glycosylation sites. We found that the N-linked glycosylation sites present in the N- and C-terminal domains of PEN-2 were utilized, whereas a site in the hydrophilic "loop" region connecting the two transmembrane domains was not. The addition of a carbohydrate structure in the N-terminal domain of PEN-2 prevented association with presenilin 1, whereas glycosylation in the C-terminal region of PEN-2 did not, suggesting that the N-terminal domain is important for interactions with presenilin 1. Immunofluorescence microscopy with selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane of cells expressing epitope-tagged forms of PEN-2 confirmed the lumenal location of both the N and C termini. A protease protection assay also demonstrated that the loop domain of PEN-2 is cytosolic. Thus, PEN-2 spans the membrane twice, with the N and C termini facing the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.
