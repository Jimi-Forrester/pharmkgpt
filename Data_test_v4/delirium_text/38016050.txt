38016050|t|Why Not Offer Routine Screenings for Brain Health?
38016050|a|The merits of routine health screening for cancer and cardiovascular diseases are well established given the strong evidence that early detection can lead to effective interventions. Health systems, insurance providers and public health agencies have incorporated systematic approaches to ensuring that preventive screenings for hypertension, hyperlipidemia and cancers are encouraged, readily accessible and reimbursed. Workplace wellness programs intent on containing preventable healthcare costs have also sponsored age- and risk-adjusted health screenings, often including financial incentives to encourage same. Should we also screen for brain health? Is early detection of value for a condition with no proven treatment or cure? This editorial reviews the pros and cons of testing for cognitive decline, Alzheimer's and related dementias and suggests that with nearly every country in the world getting proportionally older, promoting brain health could emerge as a key intrinsic motivation for promoting healthier lifestyles. I conclude that a person-centered approach to deciding about testing is needed given uncertain evidence connecting health behaviors to cognitive decline.
