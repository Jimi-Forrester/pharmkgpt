32822271|a|OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to determine the risk factors associated with intensive care unit delirium (ICUD) in patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) secondary to acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: Data involving 620 patients undergoing IMV secondary to acute exacerbation of COPD from 2009 to 2019 at the First Hospital of Hebei Medical University were retrospectively analysed. The primary endpoint was the risk factors associated with developing ICUD. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify these risk factors. RESULTS: Of 620 patients, 93 (15.0%) developed ICUD. In the multivariable analysis, risk factors that were significantly associated with ICUD were increased age, male sex, alcoholism with active abstinence, current smoking, stage 3 acute kidney injury (AKI), and an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of III. CONCLUSION: This study showed that increasing age, male sex, alcoholism with active abstinence, current smoking, stage 3 AKI, and an ASA physical status of III might be associated with a risk of developing ICUD. Even if these risk factors are unaltered, they provide a target population for quality improvement initiatives.
