33462306|a|Mounting evidence shows that physical exercise modulates systemic inflammation. However, its effect on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) immune-marker profiles in man are largely unknown. We here report a study on healthy subjects (n = 27, males = 12, mean age 28.7, range 22-52) allocated to either an acute exercise setting over four consecutive days, or a training intervention over 4 weeks. Paired plasma and CSF samples collected at baseline, after 7 days of exercise abstention, and the day after completion of the exercise interventions, were analyzed for protein inflammation markers using a multiplex proximity extension assay and neurotransmitters and kynurenine pathway (KP) metabolites using liquid chromatography, respectively. Routine cell counts, and albumin, immunoglobulin G and neurofilament light chain concentrations in CSF remained unchanged in both paradigms, while several inflammatory proteins became upregulated after acute exercise. However, only changes in three CSF (vascular endothelial growth factor-A, interleukin-7 and matrix metalloproteinase-10) and 12 plasma proteins reached significance levels after adjustment for multiple comparisons and exclusion of less stable proteins. Similarly, KP metabolites only changed among participants after acute exercise, while neurotransmitter levels, except for increased CSF serine, remained stable. Both in plasma and CSF changes in KP metabolites and inflammatory proteins correlated, suggesting that these processes are functionally linked. These findings suggest that acute aerobic physical exercise affects immune markers and KP metabolites systemically and in the CSF.
