37471131|a|Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) is an important invasive pest that poses a serious threat to global crop production. Both emamectin benzoate (EB) and diamide insecticides are effective insecticides used to protect against S. frugiperda. Here, 16S rRNA sequencing was used to characterize the gut microbiota in S. frugiperda larvae exposed to EB or tetrachlorantraniliprole (TE). Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were found to be the dominant bacterial phyla present in the intestines of S. frugiperda. Following insecticide treatment, larvae were enriched for species involved in the process of insecticide degradation. High-level alpha and beta diversity indices suggested that exposure to TE and EB significantly altered the composition and diversity of the gastrointestinal microbiota in S. frugiperda. At 24 h post-EB treatment, Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia abundance was significantly increased relative to the control group, with significant increases in Stenotrophobacter, Nitrospira, Blastocatella, Sulfurifustis, and Flavobacterium also being evident in these larvae. These microbes may play a role in the degradation or detoxification of EB and TE, although further work will be needed to explore the mechanisms underlying such activity. Overall, these findings will serve as a theoretical foundation for subsequent studies of the relationship between the gut microbiota and insecticide resistance in S. frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae).
