31275157|t|Rerouting Geriatric Medicine by Complementing Static Frailty Measures With Dynamic Resilience Indicators of Recovery Potential.
31275157|a|Medicine is still very inadequate in forecasting recovery of tipping points in health and disease, especially in older adults. However, increasingly, diseases and invasive treatments unexpectedly push older patients with low resilience over their tipping points (TPs). These TPs are the points in human physiology that separate more healthy conditions from disease conditions or malfunctioning of the older human's subsystems or organs, such as delirium, syncope and falls in old age, which threaten the functioning of the older person as a whole. Either the person may recover from the perturbation induced by such a subsystem TP and the balance of the whole system is restored, or the TP may set in motion a cascade of events driving the system down to a state of more decline, ultimately leading to death. A main unanswered question here is how to predict whether these older persons will recover or not. To improve this TP-recovery-forecasting, intriguing findings on measures of resilience found in other complex biological systems may be translated to humans. New dynamic resilience biomarkers for resilience can enrich clinical prediction for pathophysiological recovery and could test interventions for their effectiveness in improving resilience. Therefore, we hypothesize that dynamic, stimulus-response measures of recovery rate over time, observed after having received a minor stressor in a healthy condition, can be used to quantify recovery potential following subsystem TPs in disease and following invasive treatments in humans and thus the person's resilience. Current static frailty prognostics can predict risks for death, institutionalization, delirium, falls, and other TP transitions, but it has not been proven that they can predict recovery. Our hypothesis on dynamic indicators of recovery is logical and timely, as it can now be studied with sensor technology to create a fundamentally different approach of variables that may be validated to forecast recovery potential. By generating dynamic measures of systemic resilience over various organ systems, we may subsequently model resilience generically across many chronic diseases, affecting different organ systems. Next, quantifying systemic resilience may reroute scientific and clinical pathways by predicting and preventing irreversible tipping points and by improving recovery by older adults.
