31686447|t|A Case of Sporadic Suprasellar Hemangioblastoma Mimicking Meningioma.
31686447|a|Hemangioblastoma (HBL) in the suprasellar region is very rare and a few cases have been reported. Suprasellar HBL without von Hippel-Lindau disease is much rarer. A 76-year old male patient presented progressively deteriorating visual disturbance. MRI demonstrated solid suprasellar mass of 20 mm in diameter, broadly based to planum sphenoidale and diaphragm sella and dural tail sign after the administration of gadolinium diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA). Preoperative diagnosis was meningioma. Total resection of the tumor was not accomplished because of massive hemorrhage, and the histopathologic examination revealed the tumor to be HBL. The visual disturbance of the patient was not improved. The authors reviewed the literature and considered a differential diagnosis of suprasellar tumors and treatment of suprasellar HBL.
