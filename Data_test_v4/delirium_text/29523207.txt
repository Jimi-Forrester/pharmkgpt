29523207|a|BACKGROUND: Oxysterols are cholesterol derivatives that have been suggested to play a role in inflammatory diseases such as obesity, atherosclerosis, or neuroinflammatory diseases. However, the effect of neuroinflammation on oxysterol levels has only been partially studied so far. METHODS: We used an HPLC-MS method to quantify over ten oxysterols both in in vitro and in vivo models of neuroinflammation. In the same models, we used RT-qPCR to analyze the expression of the enzymes responsible for oxysterol metabolism. Using the BV2 microglial cell line, we explored the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced (M1-type) and IL-4-induced (M2-type) cell activation on oxysterol levels. We also used LPS-activated co-cultures of mouse primary microglia and astrocytes. In vivo, we induced a neuroinflammation by administering LPS to mice. Finally, we used a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, namely the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, that is characterized by demyelination and neuroinflammation. RESULTS: In vitro, we found that LPS activation induces profound alterations in oxysterol levels. Interestingly, we could discriminate between control and LPS-activated cells based on the changes in oxysterol levels both in BV2 cells and in the primary co-culture of glial cells. In vivo, the changes in oxysterol levels were less marked than in vitro. However, we found in both models increased levels of the GPR183 agonist 7alpha,25-dihydroxycholesterol. Furthermore, we studied in vitro the effect of 14 oxysterols on the mRNA expression of inflammatory markers in LPS-activated co-culture of microglia and astrocytes. We found that several oxysterols decreased the LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory markers. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that inflammation profoundly affects oxysterol levels and that oxysterols can modulate glial cell activation. This further supports the interest of a large screening of oxysterol levels when studying the interplay between neuroinflammation and bioactive lipids.
