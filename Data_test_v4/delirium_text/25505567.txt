25505567|a|According to the "amyloid hypothesis," accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain is linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease. The aims of this investigation were to develop a model for the age-dependent amyloid accumulation and to quantify the age- and treatment-duration-dependent efficacy of the gamma-secretase inhibitor MRK-560 in the Tg2576 transgenic mouse model of amyloid deposition. Soluble and insoluble Abeta40 and Abeta42 brain concentrations were compiled from multiple naive, vehicle, and MRK-560-treated animals. The age of Tg2576 mice in the studies ranged between 3.5 and 26 months. Single doses of MRK-560 inhibited soluble Abeta40 levels in animals up to 9 months old. In contrast, MRK-560 did not cause significant acute effects on soluble Abeta40 levels in animals older than 13 months. Absolute levels of Abeta variants increased exponentially over age and reached a plateau at ~20 months. In the final model, it was assumed that MRK-560 inhibited the Abeta production rate with an Abeta level-dependent IC50.The age-dependent increase in Abeta levels was best described by a logistic model that stimulated the production rate of soluble Abeta. The increase in insoluble Abeta was defined as a function of soluble Abeta by using a scaling factor and a different turnover rate. The turnover half-life for insoluble Abeta was estimated at 30 days, explaining that at least a 4-week treatment in young animals was required to demonstrate a reduction in insoluble Abeta. Taken together, the derived knowledge could be exploited for an improved design of new experiments in Tg2576 mice.
