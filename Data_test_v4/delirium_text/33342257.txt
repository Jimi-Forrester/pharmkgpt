33342257|a|Alzheimer's disease is a neuropathological condition with abnormal accumulation of extracellular Amyloid-beta plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of Microtubule-associated protein Tau (Tau) in the brain. In pathological conditions, Tau undergoes post-translational modifications such as hyperphosphorylation by the activity of cellular kinases, which eventually leads to protein aggregation in neurons. Melatonin is a neuro-hormone that is mainly secreted from the pineal gland and functions to modulate the cellular kinases. In our study, we have checked the neuroprotective function of Melatonin by MTT and LDH assay, where Melatonin inhibited the Tau aggregates-mediated cytotoxicity and membrane leakage in Neuro2A cells. The potency of Melatonin has also been studied for the quenching of intracellular reactive oxygen species level by DCFDA assay and caspase 3 activity. Melatonin was shown to reduce the GSK3beta mRNA and subsequent protein level as well as the phospho-Tau level (pThr181 and pThr212-pSer214) in okadaic acid-induced Neuro2A cells, as observed by western blot and immunofluorescence assay. Further, Melatonin has increased the cellular Nrf2 level and its nuclear translocation as an oxidative stress response in Tauopathy. The Melatonin was found to induce pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines levels in N9 microglia. The mRNA level of cellular kinases such as as-GSK3beta, MAPK were also studied by qRT-PCR assay in Tau-exposed N9 and Neuro2A cells. The immunomodulatory effect of Melatonin was evident as it induced IL-10 and TGF-beta cytokine levels and activated MAP3K level in Tau-exposed microglia and neurons, respectively. Melatonin also downregulated the mRNA level of pro-inflammatory markers, IL-1beta and Cyclooxygenase-2 in N9 microglia. Together, these findings suggest that Melatonin remediated the cytokine profile of Tau-exposed microglia, reduced Tau hyperphosphorylation by downregulating GSK3beta level, and alleviated oxidative stress via Nrf2 nuclear translocation.
