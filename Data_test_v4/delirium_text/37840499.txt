37840499|a|BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) that occur in the setting of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) may be dynamic increasing or decreasing volumes or stable over time. Quantifying such changes may prove useful as a biomarker for clinical trials designed to address vascular cognitive-impairment and dementia and Alzheimer's Disease. OBJECTIVE: Conducting multi-site cross-site inter-rater and test-retest reliability of the MarkVCID white matter hyperintensity growth and regression protocol. METHODS: The NINDS-supported MarkVCID Consortium evaluated a neuroimaging biomarker developed to track WMH change. Test-retest and cross-site inter-rater reliability of the protocol were assessed. Cognitive test scores were analyzed in relation to WMH changes to explore its construct validity. RESULTS: ICC values for test-retest reliability of WMH growth and regression were 0.969 and 0.937 respectively, while for cross-site inter-rater ICC values for WMH growth and regression were 0.995 and 0.990 respectively. Word list long-delay free-recall was negatively associated with WMH growth (p < 0.028) but was not associated with WMH regression. CONCLUSIONS: The present data demonstrate robust ICC validity of a WMH growth/regression protocol over a one-year period as measured by cross-site inter-rater and test-retest reliability. These data suggest that this approach may serve an important role in clinical trials of disease-modifying agents for VCID that may preferentially affect WMH growth, stability, or regression.
