29927403|a|AIM: To study the efficacy and safety of cereton (choline alfoscerate) in the treatment of elderly patients with amnestic type of mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), which often represents a pre-dementia (symptomatic) stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty patients (40 women and 10 men; mean age 68,8 years) received three-month therapy with cereton in a dose of 1200 mg/day in 3 divided doses. Fifteen patients received the same treatment again within 1 year. Immediate and delayed (7-9 months after treatment) effects of therapy, including those dependent on the ApoE genotype were assessed with a neuropsychological test battery. RESULTS: Psychometric measures showed a significant improvement after treatment with cereton. ApoE4 allele noncarriers performed better on tests of immediate and delayed reproduction of 10 words. Although, most indicators achieved in the end of therapy course decreased 7-9 months after treatment, the level of patients cognitive functioning remained at a higher level than before treatment. A repeated course of cereton treatment prevents cognitive deficit increasing during the follow-up period (10-12 months). CONCLUSION: The drug is well-tolerated and safe and can be recommended for preventive treatment of dementia in patients with high AD risk, in particular in elderly patients with aMCI syndrome.
