35087696|a|BACKGROUND: Pharmaceutical drug therapy problems (DTPs) are a major public health problem. We examined patient-level risk factors for DTPs among Cambodian Americans. METHODS: Community health workers (CHWs) verbally administered surveys and completed a detailed medication review form with participants. A doctoral-level pharmacist reviewed the form with the patient and CHW to determine DTP number and type (appropriateness, effectiveness, safety, and adherence). RESULTS: Participants (n = 63) averaged 55 years old, 6 years of education, 52% were married, 87% spoke Khmer at home, with modal household income <$20,000 (41%). The percentage of participants with DTPs was: 45% appropriateness, 25% effectiveness, 64% safety, and 30% adherence, averaging 3.7 DTPs per patient. In multiple regressions, patient characteristics uniquely predicted each type of DTP. In a multiple regression controlling for number of medications, being married reduced total DTPs (IRR = 0.70) and being depressed increased total DTPs (IRR = 1.26). CONCLUSIONS: Vulnerable patients should be prioritized for pharmacist/CHW teams to identify DTPs.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02502929.
