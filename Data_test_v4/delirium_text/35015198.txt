35015198|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive impairments that hinder daily activities and lead to personal and behavioral problems. Plasma hyperphosphorylated tau protein at threonine 181 (p-tau181) has recently emerged as a new sensitive tool for the diagnosis of AD patients. We herein investigated the association of plasma P-tau181 and white matter (WM) microstructural changes in AD. We obtained data from a large prospective cohort of elderly individuals participating in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which included baseline measurements of plasma P-tau181 and imaging findings. A subset of 41 patients with AD, 119 patients with mild cognitive impairments (MCI), and 43 healthy controls (HC) was included in the study, all of whom had baseline blood P-tau181 levels and had also undergone Diffusion Tensor Imaging. The analysis revealed that the plasma level of P-tau181 has a positive correlation with changes in Mean Diffusivity (MD), Radial Diffusivity (RD), and Axial Diffusivity (AxD), but a negative with Fractional Anisotropy (FA) parameters in WM regions of all participants. There is also a significant association between WM microstructural changes in different regions and P-tau181 plasma measurements within each MCI, HC, and AD group. In conclusion, our findings clarified that plasma P-tau181 levels are associated with changes in WM integrity in AD. P-tau181 could improve the accuracy of diagnostic procedures and support the application of blood-based biomarkers to diagnose WM neurodegeneration. Longitudinal clinical studies are also needed to demonstrate the efficacy of the P-tau181 biomarker and predict its role in structural changes.
