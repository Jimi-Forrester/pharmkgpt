30321985|t|Management of Pediatric Febrile Seizures.
30321985|a|Febrile seizures (FS), events associated with a fever in the absence of an intracranial infection, hypoglycaemia, or an acute electrolyte imbalance, occur in children between six months and six years of age. FS are the most common type of convulsions in children. FS can be extremely frightening for parents, even if they are generally harmless for children, making it important to address parental anxiety in the most sensitive manner. The aim of this review was to focus on the management of FS in the pediatric age. An analysis of the literature showed that most children with FS have an excellent prognosis, and few develop long-term health problems. The diagnosis of FS is clinical, and it is important to exclude intracranial infections, in particular after a complex FS. Management consists of symptom control and treating the cause of the fever. Parents and caregivers are often distressed and frightened after a FS occurs and need to be appropriately informed and guided on the management of their child's fever by healthcare professionals. Due to the inappropriate use of diagnostic tests and treatments, it is extremely important to improve the knowledge of pediatricians and neurologists on FS management and to standardize the diagnostic and therapeutic work-up.
