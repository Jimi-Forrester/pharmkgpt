36717446|t|SkQ1 as a Tool for Controlling Accelerated Senescence Program: Experiments with OXYS Rats.
36717446|a|According to the concept suggested by V. P. Skulachev and co-authors, aging of living organisms can be considered as a special case of programmed death of an organism - phenoptosis, and mitochondrial antioxidant SkQ1 is capable of inhibiting both acute and chronic phenoptosis (aging). The authors of the concept associate effects of SkQ1 with suppression of the enhanced generation of ROS in mitochondria. Numerous studies have confirmed the ability of SkQ1 to inhibit manifestations of the "healthy", or physiological, aging. According to the results of our studies, SkQ1 is especially effective in suppressing the program of genetically determined accelerated senescence in OXYS rats, which appears as an early development of a complex of age-related diseases: cataracts, retinopathy (similar to the age-related macular degeneration in humans), osteoporosis, and signs of Alzheimer's disease. Accelerated senescence in OXYS rats is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, but no direct associations with oxidative stress have been identified. Nevertheless, SkQ1 is able to prevent and/or suppress development of all manifestations of accelerated senescence in OXYS rats. Its effects are due to impact on the activity of many signaling pathways and processes, but first of all they are associated with restoration of the structural and functional parameters of mitochondria. It could be suggested that the use of SkQ1 could represent a promising strategy in prevention of accelerated phenoptosis - early development of a complex of age-related diseases (multimorbidity) in people predisposed to it.
