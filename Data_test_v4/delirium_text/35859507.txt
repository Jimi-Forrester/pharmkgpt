35859507|a|Aluminum vessels are being used from a long time for various cooking purpose. Using cross-sectional study design, 90 participants, 30 in each category of normal, mild - moderate and severe Alzheimer's disease (AD), aged of 60 years and above were enrolled using SAGE scale. Data on the frequency of usage of aluminum vessel for various types of cooking such as frying, baking, boiling, roasting/sauteing, and packing of food using aluminum foil were collected using the pretested semistructured questionnaire. Results showed that severity of AD was significantly associated (P < 0.05) with usage of aluminum utensils for various cooking purpose in all the three groups, with least total score for usage of aluminum vessels in normal category (3.2) and highest in severe category (18.67). Frying (P < 0.001), boiling (P < 0.05), and roasting/sauteing (P < 0.01) of foods in aluminum vessels was be significantly associated with the AD score. Degree of AD positively correlated with usage of aluminum vessels.
