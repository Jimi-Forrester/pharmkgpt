32280205|t|Nanoparticle Drug Delivery Systems for alpha-Mangostin.
32280205|a|alpha-Mangostin, a xanthone derivative from the pericarp of Garcinia mangostana L., has numerous bioactivities and pharmacological properties. However, alpha-mangostin has low aqueous solubility and poor target selectivity in the human body. Recently, nanoparticle drug delivery systems have become an excellent technique to improve the physicochemical properties and effectiveness of drugs. Therefore, many efforts have been made to overcome the limitations of alpha-mangostin through nanoparticle formulations. Our review aimed to summarise and discuss the nanoparticle drug delivery systems for alpha-mangostin from published papers recorded in Scopus, PubMed and Google Scholar. We examined various types of nanoparticles for alpha-mangostin to enhance water solubility, provide controlled release and create targeted delivery systems. These forms include polymeric nanoparticles, nanomicelles, liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanofibers and nanoemulsions. Notably, nanomicelle modification increased alpha-mangostin solubility increased more than 10,000 fold. Additionally, polymeric nanoparticles provided targeted delivery and significantly enhanced the biodistribution of alpha-mangostin into specific organs. In conclusion, the nanoparticle drug delivery system could be a promising technique to increase the solubility, selectivity and efficacy of alpha-mangostin as a new drug candidate in clinical therapy.
