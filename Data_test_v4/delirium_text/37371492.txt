37371492|t|The Janus-Faced Role of Lipid Droplets in Aging: Insights from the Cellular Perspective.
37371492|a|It is widely accepted that nine hallmarks-including mitochondrial dysfunction, epigenetic alterations, and loss of proteostasis-exist that describe the cellular aging process. Adding to this, a well-described cell organelle in the metabolic context, namely, lipid droplets, also accumulates with increasing age, which can be regarded as a further aging-associated process. Independently of their essential role as fat stores, lipid droplets are also able to control cell integrity by mitigating lipotoxic and proteotoxic insults. As we will show in this review, numerous longevity interventions (such as mTOR inhibition) also lead to strong accumulation of lipid droplets in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and mammalian cells, just to name a few examples. In mammals, due to the variety of different cell types and tissues, the role of lipid droplets during the aging process is much more complex. Using selected diseases associated with aging, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, type II diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, we show that lipid droplets are "Janus"-faced. In an early phase of the disease, lipid droplets mitigate the toxicity of lipid peroxidation and protein aggregates, but in a later phase of the disease, a strong accumulation of lipid droplets can cause problems for cells and tissues.
