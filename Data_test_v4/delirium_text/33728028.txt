33728028|a|General anesthesia is a powerful and indispensable tool to ensure the accomplishment of surgical procedures or clinical examinations. Sevoflurane as an inhalational anesthetic without unpleasant odor is commonly used in clinical practice, especially for pediatric surgery. However, the toxicity caused by sevoflurane has gained growing attention. Mitochondria play a key role in maintaining cellular metabolism and survival. To maintain the stability of mitochondrial homeostasis, they are constantly going through fusion and fission. Also, damaged mitochondria need to be degraded by autophagy, termed as mitophagy. Accumulating evidence proves that sevoflurane exposure in young age could lead to cell toxicity by triggering the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, inducing the abnormalities of mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy. In the present review, we focus on the current understanding of mitochondrial apoptosis, dynamics and mitophagy in cell function, the implications for cell toxicity in response to sevoflurane, and their underlying potential mechanisms.
