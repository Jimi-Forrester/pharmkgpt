37427078|t|Post-COVID-19 Vaccination CNS Magnetic Resonance Imaging Findings: A Systematic Review.
37427078|a|Objective: This systematic review aims to synthesize and analyze the available literature on central nervous system (CNS) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in individuals who have received COVID-19 vaccinations. Our objective is to enhance understanding of potential neurological side effects, inform clinical practice, and guide future research on the neurological implications of COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: In this systematic review, we conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from January 2020 to April 2023, using terms related to COVID-19 vaccination and CNS MRI findings. We evaluated the quality of the study, extracted relevant data, and included 89 eligible studies that covered various vaccines, demographics of patients, symptoms, and MRI findings to provide a thorough understanding of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination-related CNS problems. Results: We investigated CNS MRI findings following COVID-19 vaccination across various vaccine types. Common diseases associated with post-vaccination CNS MRI findings included cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), acute myelitis, autoimmune encephalitis (AE), and others. Patients presented with diverse onset symptoms and neurological manifestations. Abnormalities identified in CNS MRI findings included white matter (WM) hyperintensity. Our analysis offers a comprehensive overview of the current literature on post-vaccination CNS MRI findings. Discussion. We highlight a range of post-COVID-19 vaccination CNS MRI findings, including CVST, with a higher incidence in individuals receiving the ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca) vaccine. Other notable observations include cases of ADEM, myelitis or transverse myelitis (TM), Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), and acute encephalopathy following COVID-19 vaccination. The incidence of these neurological complications is extremely rare, and the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks. The reviewed studies were primarily case reports or case series, and thus large-scale epidemiological studies and controlled clinical trials are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and risk factors associated with these neurological complications following COVID-19 vaccination.
