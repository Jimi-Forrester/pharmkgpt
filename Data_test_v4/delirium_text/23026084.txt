23026084|t|Lead optimization studies towards the discovery of novel carbamates as potent AChE inhibitors for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
23026084|a|The optimization of our previous lead compound 1 (AChE IC(50)=3.31 muM) through synthesis and pharmacology of a series of novel carbamates is reported. The synthesized compounds were evaluated against mouse brain AChE enzyme using the colorimetric method described by Ellman et al. The three compounds 6a (IC(50)=2.57muM), 6b (IC(50)=0.70 muM) and 6i (IC(50)=2.56 muM) exhibited potent in vitro AChE inhibitory activities comparable to the drug rivastigmine (IC(50)=1.11 muM). Among them, the compound 6b has been selected as possible optimized lead for further neuropharmacological studies. In addition, the AChE-carbamate Michaelis complexes of these potent compounds including rivastigmine and ganstigmine have been modeled using covalent docking protocol of GOLD and important direct/indirect interactions contributing to stabilization of the AChE-carbamate Michaelis complexes have been investigated.
