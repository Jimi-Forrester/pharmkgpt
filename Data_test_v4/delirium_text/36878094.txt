36878094|t|A new gentiopicroside derivative improves cognitive deficits of AD mice via activation of Wnt signaling pathway and regulation of gut microbiota homeostasis.
36878094|a|BACKGROUND: In our previous study, we found that gentiopicroside (GPS) isolated from Gentiana rigescens Franch has a significant antiaging activity via regulation of mitophagy and oxidative stress. In order to increase the anti-aging activity of GPS, several compounds based on the chemical structure of GPS were synthesized and evaluated for bioactivity with yeast replicative lifespan assay, and 2H-gentiopicroside (2H-GPS) as leading compound was selected for AD treatment. PURPOSE AND METHODS: To investigate whether 2H-GPS has anti- Alzheimer's disease effects, we used D-galactose (Dgal)-induced model mice to evaluate the effect of 2H-GPS on AD mice. Furthermore, we explored the action mechanism of this compound with RT-PCR, Western Blot, ELISA and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. RESULTS: Memory dysfunction and reduction in the number of neurons in the brain of mice were observed in Dgal treated group. These symptoms of AD mice were significantly relieved by administering 2H-GPS and donepezil (Done), respectively. In the Dgal only treated group, the protein levels of beta-catenin, REST and phosphorylated GSK-3beta, involved in the Wnt signaling pathway were significantly decreased, whereas the protein levels of GSK-3beta, Tau, phosphorylated Tau, P35 and PEN-2 were significantly increased. Importantly, treatment with 2H-GPS resulted in restoration of memory dysfunction and levels of these proteins. Furthermore, the composition of the gut microbiota after 2H-GPS administration was explored through 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Moreover, the mice, in which depleted gut microbiota with antibiotic cocktail (ABX), were used for evaluation of whether the gut microbiota is involved to the effect of 2H-GPS. Significant changes in gut microbiota composition were observed between AD and 2H-GPS-treated AD mice, and ABX partially eliminated the AD-restoring effect of 2H-GPS. CONCLUSION: 2H-GPS improves the symptoms of AD mice through combination of the regulation of Wnt signaling pathway and the microbiota-gut-brain axis, and the mechanism of action of 2H-GPS is distinct from that of Done.
