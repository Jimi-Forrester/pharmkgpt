30589214|a|Numerous studies have reported neurobehavioural effects in dental personnel occupationally exposed to chronic low levels of mercury (Hg). Hg exposure from dental work may also induce various chronic conditions such as elevation of amyloid protein expression, deterioration of microtubules and increase or inhibition of transmitter release at motor nerve terminal endings. Therefore, clinical studies of Hg toxicity in dentistry may provide new knowledge about disturbed metal homeostasis in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and mood disorders. The purpose of this MiniReview is to evaluate the evidence of possible relevance between Hg exposure in dentistry and idiopathic disturbances in motor functions, cognitive skills and affective reactions, as well as dose-response relationships.
