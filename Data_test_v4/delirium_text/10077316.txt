10077316|a|The pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease include neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads and neuritic plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads are comprised of paired helical filaments which are themselves composed of a hyperphosphorylated form of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Neuritic plaques are extracellular deposits of aggregated beta amyloid associated with neurites containing hyperphosphorylated tau. The mechanisms by which the neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques develop in Alzhemier's disease are not clear but it is hypothesized that sulphated glycosaminoglycans are important in their formation. This impression is based on the finding that the glycosaminoglycan, heparan sulphate, is found associated with neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques and neuropil threads while dermatan sulphate, chondroitin sulphate and keratan sulphate immunoreactivity is found around neuritic plaques in brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. Furthermore, in vitro studies demonstrate that sulphated glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulphate and the closely related molecule heparin interact with tau and potentiate its phosphorylation by a number of serine/threonine kinases, reduce its ability to bind to microtubules and induce paired helical filament formation, all properties associated with tau isolated from Alzheimer's disease brain. Thus, we were interested to learn whether intracerebral injection of the sulphated glycosaminoglycan heparin would give rise to alterations in the cytoskeletal protein tau in the rat brain. Although no cytoskeletal changes were observed, to our considerable surprise we found that the intrahippocampal injection of heparin gave rise to seizures. We have investigated this unexpected effect further in vivo and by using in vitro electrophysiological techniques.
