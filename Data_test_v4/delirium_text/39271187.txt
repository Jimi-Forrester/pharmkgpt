39271187|t|Nocturnal Sleep Dynamics Alterations in the Early Stages of Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia.
39271187|a|STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep disorders have been recognized as an integral component of the clinical syndrome in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, limited data exists for rarer types of neurodegenerative diseases, such as behavioral variant Frontotemporal Dementia (bvFTD). This study aims to analyze EEG power spectra and sleep stage transitions in bvFTD patients, hypothesizing that bvFTD may show distinctive sleep stage transitions compared to patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). METHODS: Eighteen probable bvFTD patients and eighteen age- and sex-matched probable AD patients underwent overnight polysomnography (PSG) and completed sleep disorders questionnaires. Sleep questionnaires, full-night EEG spectra, and sleep stage transitions indexes were compared between groups. RESULTS: bvFTD patients had higher Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores (95%CI: 0, 5) and reported poorer sleep quality than AD patients (p<0.01). Compared to AD, bvFTD patients showed higher N1 percentage (95%CI: 0.1, 6), lower N3 percentage (95%CI: -13.6, -0.6), higher sleep-wake transitions (95%CI: 1.49, 8.86) and N1 sleep-wake transitions (95%CI: 0.32, 6.1). EEG spectral analysis revealed higher spectral power in bvFTD compared to AD patients in faster rhythms, especially sigma rhythm, across all sleep stages. In bvFTD patients, sleep-wake transitions were positively associated with ISI. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with bvFTD present higher rates of transitions between wake and sleep than AD patients. The increased frequency of sleep transitions indicates a higher degree of sleep instability in bvFTD, which may reflect an imbalance in sleep-wake promoting systems. Sleep stage transitions analysis may provide novel insights into the sleep alterations of bvFTD patients.
