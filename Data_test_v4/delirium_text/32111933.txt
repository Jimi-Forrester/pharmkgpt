32111933|t|High-Performance Conducting Polymer Nanotube-based Liquid-Ion Gated Field-Effect Transistor Aptasensor for Dopamine Exocytosis.
32111933|a|In this study, ultrasensitive and precise detection of a representative brain hormone, dopamine (DA), was demonstrated using functional conducting polymer nanotubes modified with aptamers. A high-performance aptasensor was composed of interdigitated microelectrodes (IMEs), carboxylated polypyrrole nanotubes (CPNTs) and DA-specific aptamers. The biosensors were constructed by sequential conjugation of CPNTs and aptamer molecules on the IMEs, and the substrate was integrated into a liquid-ion gating system surrounded by pH 7.4 buffer as an electrolyte. To confirm DA exocytosis based on aptasensors, DA sensitivity and selectivity were monitored using liquid-ion gated field-effect transistors (FETs). The minimum detection level (MDL; 100 pM) of the aptasensors was determined, and their MDL was optimized by controlling the diameter of the CPNTs owing to their different capacities for aptamer introduction. The MDL of CPNT aptasensors is sufficient for discriminating between healthy and unhealthy individuals because the total DA concentration in the blood of normal person is generally determined to be ca. 0.5 to 6.2 ng/mL (3.9 to 40.5 nM) by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (this information was obtained from a guidebook "Evidence-Based Medicine 2018 SCL " which was published by Seoul Clinical Laboratory). The CPNTs with the smaller diameters (CPNT2: ca. 120 nm) showed 100 times higher sensitivity and selectivity than the wider CPNTs (CPNT1: ca. 200 nm). Moreover, the aptasensors based on CPNTs had excellent DA discrimination in the presence of various neurotransmitters. Based on the excellent sensing properties of these aptasensors, the DA levels of exogeneous DA samples that were prepared from PC12 cells by a DA release assay were successfully measured by DA kits, and the aptasensor sensing properties were compared to those of standard DA reagents. Finally, the real-time response values to the various exogeneous DA release levels were similar to those of a standard DA aptasensor. Therefore, CPNT-based aptasensors provide efficient and rapid DA screening for neuron-mediated genetic diseases such as Parkinson's disease.
