22075650|t|Features of subsyndromal and persistent delirium.
22075650|a|BACKGROUND: Longitudinal studies of delirium phenomenology are lacking. AIMS: We studied features that characterise subsyndromal delirium and persistent delirium over time. METHOD: Twice-weekly evaluations of 100 adults with DSM-IV delirium using the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (DRS-R98) and Cognitive Test for Delirium (CTD). The generalised estimating equation method identified symptom patterns distinguishing full syndromal from subsyndromal delirium and resolving from persistent delirium. RESULTS: Participants (mean age 70.2 years (s.d. = 10.5)) underwent 323 assessments (range 2-9). Full syndromal delirium was significantly more severe than subsyndromal delirium for DRS-R98 thought process abnormalities, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, retardation, orientation, attention, and short- and long-term memory items, and CTD attention, vigilance, orientation and memory. Persistent full syndromal delirium had greater disturbance of DRS-R98 thought process abnormalities, delusions, agitation, orientation, attention, and short- and long-term memory items, and CTD attention, vigilance and orientation. CONCLUSIONS: Full syndromal delirium differs from subsyndromal delirium over time by greater severity of many cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms. Persistent delirium involves increasing prominence of recognised core diagnostic features and cognitive impairment.
