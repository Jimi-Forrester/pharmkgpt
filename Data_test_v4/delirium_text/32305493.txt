32305493|t|Glycogen synthase kinase-3: The missing link to aberrant circuit function in disorders of cognitive dysfunction?
32305493|a|Elevated GSK-3 activity has been implicated in cognitive dysfunction associated with various disorders including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, type 2 diabetes, traumatic brain injury, major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. Further, aberrant neural oscillatory activity in, and between, cortical regions and the hippocampus is consistently present within these same cognitive disorders. In this review, we will put forth the idea that increased GSK-3 activity serves as a pathological convergence point across cognitive disorders, inducing similar consequent impacts on downstream signaling mechanisms implicated in the maintenance of processes critical to brain systems communication and normal cognitive functioning. In this regard we suggest that increased activation of GSK-3 and neuronal oscillatory dysfunction are early pathological changes that may be functionally linked. Mechanistic commonalities between these disorders of cognitive dysfunction will be discussed and potential downstream targets of GSK-3 that may contribute to neuronal oscillatory dysfunction identified.
