38960745|t|Nurses' perceptions of patient pain, delirium, and sedation assessments in the intensive care unit: A qualitative study.
38960745|a|BACKGROUND: Pain, delirium, and sedation should be assessed routinely using validated assessment scales. Inappropriately managed pain, delirium, and sedation in critically ill patients can have serious consequences regarding mortality, morbidity, and increased healthcare costs. Despite the benefits of a bundled approach to pain, delirium, and sedation assessments, few studies have explored nurses' perceptions of using validated scales for such assessments. Furthermore, no studies have examined nurses' perceptions of undertaking these assessments as a bundled approach. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to explore nurses' knowledge, perceptions, attitudes, and experiences regarding the use of validated pain, delirium, and sedation assessment tools as a bundled approach in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: A qualitative exploratory descriptive design was adopted. We conducted four focus groups and 10 individual interviews with 23 nurses from a 26-bed adult ICU at an Australian metropolitan tertiary teaching hospital. Data were analysed using thematic analysis techniques. FINDINGS: Four themes were identified: (i) factors impacting nurses' ability to undertake pain, delirium, and sedation assessments in the ICU; (ii) use, misuse, and nonuse of tools and use of alternative strategies to assess pain, delirium, and sedation; (iii) implementing assessment tools; and (iv) consequences of suboptimal pain, delirium, and sedation assessments. A gap was found in nurses' use of validated scales to assess pain, delirium, and sedation as a bundled approach, and they were not familiar with using a bundled approach to assessment. CONCLUSION: The practice gap could be addressed using a carefully planned implementation strategy. Strategies could include a policy and protocol for assessing pain, delirium, and sedation in the ICU, engagement of change champions to facilitate uptake of the strategy, reminder and feedback systems, further in-service education, and ongoing workplace training for nurses.
