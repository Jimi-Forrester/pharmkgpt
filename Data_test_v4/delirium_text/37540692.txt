37540692|t|Using gamma-band transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to improve sleep quality and cognition in patients with mild neurocognitive disorders due to Alzheimer's disease: A study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
37540692|a|BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent in patients with age-related neurodegenerative diseases, which severely affect cognition and even lead to accumulated beta-amyloid. Encouraging results from recent studies on transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) showed moderate positive effects on sleep quality in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compared to tDCS, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) enables the entrainment of neuronal activity with optimized focality through injecting electric current with a specific frequency and has significant enhancement effects on slow wave activities. METHODS AND DESIGN: This is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial comparing 40 Hz tACS with tDCS in mild neurocognitive disorders due to AD with sleep disturbances. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is used to construct personalized realistic head model. Treatment outcomes, including sleep quality, cognitive performance and saliva Abeta levels will be conducted at baseline, 4th week, 8th week, 12th week and 24th week. CONCLUSIONS: It is expected that the repeated gamma-band tACS will show significant improvements in sleep quality and cognitive functions compared to tDCS and sham tDCS. The findings will provide high-level evidence and guide further advanced studies in the field of neurodegenerative diseases and sleep medicine.
