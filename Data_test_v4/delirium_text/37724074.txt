37724074|a|Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries, in which atherosclerosis triggered by dyslipidemia is the major pathological basis. Over the past 40 years, small rodent animals, such as mice, have been widely used for understanding of human atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) with the advantages of low cost and ease of maintenance and manipulation. However, based on the concept of precision medicine and high demand of translational research, the applications of mouse models for human ASCVD study would be limited due to the natural differences in metabolic features between mice and humans even though they are still the most powerful tools in this research field, indicating that other species with biological similarity to humans need to be considered for studying ASCVD in future. With the development and breakthrough of novel gene editing technology, Syrian golden hamster, a small rodent animal replicating the metabolic characteristics of humans, has been genetically modified, suggesting that gene-targeted hamster models will provide new insights into the precision medicine and translational research of ASCVD. The purpose of this review was to summarize the genetically-modified hamster models with dyslipidemia to date, and their potential applications and perspective for ASCVD.
