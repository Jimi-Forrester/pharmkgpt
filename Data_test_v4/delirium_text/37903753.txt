37903753|a|Background: The practice of safe emergency medicine requires accurate and adequate assessments. However, screening for cognitive deficits is not performed regularly in the emergency department (ED). This study aimed to determine factors influencing the frequency of cognitive testing by ED doctors. Methods: This study included all doctors working in the EDs of three teaching hospitals. A 17-item online survey instrument that collected information on sex, experience, perceived prevalence, perception, and practice of cognitive assessment was distributed through electronic mail and data messaging services. Results: Of the 210 participants, 72 were male. The estimated mean (SD) prevalence of cognitive impairment in older patients in the ED was 39.5% (19.7%). Among the participating ED doctors, 75.8% performed cognitive testing up to 10% of the time. Moreover, the participants ranked cognitive impairment the lowest compared to the other four chronic conditions in terms of its impact on hospitalization outcomes. Multiple linear regression revealed that the doctors' perceptions of the responsible personnel and the importance of cognitive testing, as well as their lack of expertise, were independently associated with the frequency of testing. Conclusion: Lack of expertise, perception of the importance of cognitive testing, and lack of consensus on which discipline is responsible for performing cognitive testing in older patients in the ED were the limiting factors in performing cognitive testing in the ED. Improving perception and awareness of the importance of cognitive assessment as a screening tool could improve the detection and overall management of older patients.
