36859839|t|[Therapeutic potential of targeting SIRT1 for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease].
36859839|a|Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) is one of the seven mammalian proteins of the sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases. SIRT1 plays a pivotal role in neuroprotection and ongoing research has uncovered a mechanism by which SIRT1 may exert a neuroprotective effect on Alzheimer's disease (AD). Growing evidence demonstrates that SIRT1 regulates many pathological processes including amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) processing, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and mitochondrial dysfunction. SIRT1 has recently received enormous attention, and pharmacological or transgenic approaches to activate the sirtuin pathway have shown promising results in the experimental models of AD. In the present review, we delineate the role of SIRT1 in AD from a disease-centered perspective and provides an up-to-date overview of the SIRT1 modulators and their potential as effective therapeutics in AD.
