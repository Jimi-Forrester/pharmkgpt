38669748|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most prominent form of dementia and has received considerable attention due to its growing burden on economic, healthcare and basic societal infrastructures. The two major neuropathological hallmarks of AD, i.e., extracellular amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide plaques and intracellular hyperphosphorylated Tau neurofibrillary tangles, have been the focus of much research, with an eye on understanding underlying disease mechanisms and identifying novel therapeutic avenues. One often overlooked aspect of AD is how Abeta and Tau may, through indirect and direct mechanisms, affect genome integrity. Herein, we review evidence that Abeta and Tau abnormalities induce excessive genomic stress and impair genome maintenance mechanisms, events that can promote DNA damage-induced neuronal cell loss and associated brain atrophy.
