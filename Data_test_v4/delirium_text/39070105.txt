39070105|t|Predictive Validity of Motor Assessment Scale on Poststroke Discharge Destination.
39070105|a|Background: Stroke frequently leads to hospital admission and subsequent rehabilitation in order to overcome poststroke sequelae, such as motor impairments. Efficient planning of the steps following hospital admission includes early prediction of whether the patient can be discharged home or not. Early assessment of motor performance in patients with stroke-induced motor deficits may be able to function as a predictor of discharge destination but is less explored. Objective: The primary objective was to assess the predictive validity of the Motor Assessment Scale (MAS) on discharge destination both regarding total score and regarding subscores (transfer-mobility items and upper extremity items). Design: The study was designed as a prospective cohort study. Subjects: Thirty-seven consecutively recruited patients with stroke are the subjects of the study. Methods: Logistic regression model was used to calculate the odds of being discharged to own home upon hospital admittance. The predictive ability was examined with a receiving operator characteristic (ROC) curve, and cut-points from the curve were employed in Cox regression. Results: A one-unit higher score on the total MAS significantly increased the odds of being discharged home upon hospital admittance (odds ratio (OR) 1.14, 95% CI 1.04-1.25). The same pattern was observed with the summed items of 1-5 and 6-8. The total MAS showed sensitivity of 91.7% and specificity of 68.0%. Patients having a total MAS score >= 24 were 17 times more likely to be discharged home (HR 17.64, 95% CI 2.23-139.57) compared to patients with a lower score. Conclusion: Motor function measured by the MAS can be applied as a predictor of discharge destination upon hospital admission after stroke in Danish setting.
