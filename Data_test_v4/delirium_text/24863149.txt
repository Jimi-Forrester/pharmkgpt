24863149|a|PURPOSE: To determine whether there are in vivo differences of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in frontal and parietal regions of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, compared with healthy controls using magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1) H-MRS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen AD patients and fifteen age- and gender-matched healthy controls underwent (1) H-MRS of the frontal and parietal lobes using the "MEGA-Point Resolved Spectroscopy Sequence" (MEGA-PRESS) technique, and cognitive levels of subjects were evaluated using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) tests. MRS data were processed using the Gannet program. Because the signal detected by MEGA-PRESS includes contributions from GABA, macromolecules and homocarnosine, it is labeled as "GABA+" rather than GABA. Differences of GABA+/Cr ratios between AD patients and controls were tested using covariance analysis, adjusting for gray matter fraction. The relationship between GABA+/Cr and MMSE scores was also analyzed. RESULTS: Significant lower GABA+/Cr ratios were found in the parietal region of AD patients compared with controls (P = 0.041). In AD patients, no significant correlations between GABA+/Cr and MMSE scores were found in either the frontal (r = -0.164; P = 0.558) or parietal regions (r = 0.025; P = 0.929). CONCLUSION: Decreased GABA+/Cr levels were present in the parietal region of patients with AD in vivo, suggesting that abnormalities of the GABAergic system may be present in the pathogenesis of AD.
