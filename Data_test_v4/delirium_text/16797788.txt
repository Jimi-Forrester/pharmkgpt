16797788|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a widely expressed transmembrane protein of unknown function that is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the involvement of phospholipase D (PLD) in the pathophysiology of AD. We showed dramatic upregulation of PLD1 immunoreactivity in reactive astroglial cells in brain tissue sections from authentic AD patients. Expression and activity of PLD1 were up-regulated in brain tissues from AD patients, especially caveolae membrane fraction, compared with those of control brains. Interestingly, PLD1 physically interacts and colocalizes with APP and caveolin-3. We found that APP was associated with the pleckstrin homology domain of PLD1, and the amyloid region of APP interacted with PLD. Elevated expression of APP stimulated PLD activity in human astroglioma cells. These results suggest that up-regulation of PLD might have a role in the neuronal pathology associated with AD.
