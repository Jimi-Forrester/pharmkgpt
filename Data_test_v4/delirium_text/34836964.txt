34836964|a|Disuse osteoporosis (DO) results from mechanical unloading of weight-bearing bones and causes structural changes that compromise skeletal integrity, leading to increased fracture risk. Although bone loss in DO results from imbalances in osteoblast vs. osteoclast activity, its effects on skeletal stem/progenitor cells (SSCs) is indeterminate. We modeled DO in mice by 8 and 14 weeks of hindlimb unloading (HU) or 8 weeks of unloading followed by 8 weeks of recovery (HUR) and monitored impacts on animal physiology and behavior, metabolism, marrow adipose tissue (MAT) volume, bone density and micro-architecture, and bone marrow (BM) leptin and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein expression, and correlated multi-systems impacts of HU and HUR with the transcript profiles of Lin-LEPR+ SSCs and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) purified from BM. Using this integrative approach, we demonstrate that prolonged HU induces muscle atrophy, progressive bone loss, and MAT accumulation that paralleled increases in BM but not systemic leptin levels, which remained low in lipodystrophic HU mice. HU also induced SSC quiescence and downregulated bone anabolic and neurogenic pathways, which paralleled increases in BM TH expression, but had minimal impacts on MSCs, indicating a lack of HU memory in culture-expanded populations. Although most impacts of HU were reversed by HUR, trabecular micro-architecture remained compromised and time-resolved changes in the SSC transcriptome identified various signaling pathways implicated in bone formation that were unresponsive to HUR. These findings indicate that HU-induced alterations to the SSC transcriptome that persist after reloading may contribute to poor bone recovery.
