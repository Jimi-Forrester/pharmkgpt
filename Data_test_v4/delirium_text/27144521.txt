27144521|a|Recently, a large meta-analysis of five genome wide association studies (GWAS) has identified that a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2718058, adjacent to gene NME8 on chromosome 7p14.1, was associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in Caucasians. However, the effect of rs2718058 on other populations remains unclear. In order to explore the relationship between rs2718058 and LOAD risk in a North Han Chinese population, we recruited 984 LOAD cases and 1354 healthy controls that matched for sex and age in this study. The results showed no significant differences in the genotypic or allelic distributions of rs2718058 polymorphism between LOAD cases and healthy controls, even though after stratification for APOE epsilon4 status and statistical adjustment for age, gender and APOE epsilon4 status (p > 0.05). However, a meta-analysis conducted in a sample of 82513 individuals confirmed a significant association between SNP rs2718058 and LOAD risk (OR = 1.08, 95%CI = 1.05-1.11) in the whole population. But there was still no positive results in Chinese subgroup (OR = 1.05, 95%CI = 0.93-1.17). In conclusion, the rs2718058 near gene NME8 on chromosome 7p14.1 might not play a major role in the genetic predisposition to LOAD in the North Han Chinese.
