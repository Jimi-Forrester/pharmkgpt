35743951|a|Serious diseases caused by Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) include septicaemia and meningitis, which are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Proliferation in the blood can result in a breach of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and provide entry into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where bacteria cause inflammation of the meningeal membranes resulting in meningitis. The molecular mechanisms of how this pathogen crosses the BBB remain unclear. Suilysin (SLY) has been identified as an important secreted virulence factor of S. suis 2 and may play a vital role in provoking meningitis. In this investigation, we demonstrate that SLY can increase the paracellular permeability of BBB, both in vivo and in vitro, via the activation of group III secretory phospholipase A2 (PLA2G3). Our results indicate that at lower, sublytic concentrations, the toxin can stimulate cerebral microvascular endothelial cells to release TNF-alpha, thereby inducing high level expressions of PLA2G3. Abnormal elevations of PLA2G3 might further injure tissues through direct cytolytic effectors or other responses.
