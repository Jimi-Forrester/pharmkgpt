36377594|t|Association of delirium and spatial neglect in patients with right-hemisphere stroke.
36377594|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium, an acute and fluctuating decline in cognitive functioning, increases mortality and length of hospital stays (LOS) and adversely affects functional outcomes. Previous studies suggested that the incidence of delirium may be increased in right-hemisphere strokes. Similarly, spatial neglect, a disabling deficit in unilateral spatial processing, is more common and more severe following a right-sided stroke. Spatial neglect has been established as a risk factor for delirium. OBJECTIVE: It was hypothesized that functionally relevant spatial neglect and delirium are associated in patients with right-hemisphere stroke during acute inpatient rehabilitation. Data were examined from consecutive unilateral stroke patients evaluated with the 3-minute diagnostic interview for confusion assessment method (3D-CAM) and the Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS) via the Kessler Foundation Neglect Assessment Process (KF-NAP). DESIGN: A retrospective, cohort study. SETTING: Data collected in an acute inpatient rehabilitation facility. PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred twenty six patients with stroke were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The measures were the relative risk of patients with right-hemisphere stroke having delirium when also positive for spatial neglect compared to patients with right-hemisphere stroke without spatial neglect, the incidence of 3D-CAM positive results by stroke hemisphere, and the effect of spatial neglect and delirium on functional outcomes for patients with right-brain stroke patients. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher risk of delirium in patients with right-hemisphere stroke with spatial neglect compared to patients with right-hemisphere stroke without spatial neglect. The rates of 3D-CAM positive results were not statistically different for left-compared to right-hemisphere strokes. Both delirium and spatial neglect had significant adverse effects on right-hemisphere stroke patients' functional independence. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate an association between spatial neglect and delirium in patients with right hemisphere stroke in the acute inpatient rehabilitation setting. Because of the negative effect of these impairments on functional outcomes after stroke, prevention, early detection, and targeted treatments should be prioritized for these patients.
