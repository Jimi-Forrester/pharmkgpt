37991540|t|Minocycline as a prospective therapeutic agent for cancer and non-cancer diseases: a scoping review.
37991540|a|Minocycline is an FDA-approved secondary-generation tetracycline antibiotic. It is a synthetic antibiotic having many biological effects, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and neuroprotective functions. This study discusses the pharmacological mechanisms of preventive and therapeutic effects of minocycline. Specifically, it provides a comprehensive overview of the molecular pathways by which minocycline acts on the different cancers, including ovarian, breast, glioma, colorectal, liver, pancreatic, lung, prostate, melanoma, head and neck, leukemia, and non-cancer diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, Huntington, polycystic ovary syndrome, and coronavirus disease 19. Minocycline may be a potential medication for these disorders due to its strong blood-brain barrier penetrance. It is also widely accepted as a specific medication, has a well-known side-effect characteristic, is reasonably priced, making it appropriate for continuous use in managing diseases, and has been demonstrated as an oral approach because it is effectively absorbed and accomplished almost all of the body's parts.
