26255739|t|Cross-Seeding Interaction between beta-Amyloid and Human Islet Amyloid Polypeptide.
26255739|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are two common protein misfolding diseases. Increasing evidence suggests that these two diseases may be correlated with each other via cross-sequence interactions between beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) associated with AD and human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) associated with T2D. However, little is known about how these two peptides work and how they interact with each other to induce amyloidogenesis. In this work, we study the effect of cross-sequence interactions between Abeta and hIAPP peptides on hybrid amyloid structures, conformational changes, and aggregation kinetics using combined experimental and simulation approaches. Experimental results confirm that Abeta and hIAPP can interact with each other to aggregate into hybrid amyloid fibrils containing beta-sheet-rich structures morphologically similar to pure Abeta and hIAPP. The cross-seeding of Abeta and hIAPP leads to the coexistence of both a retarded process at the initial nucleation stage and an accelerated process at the fibrillization stage, in conjunction with a conformational transition from random structures to alpha-helix to beta-sheet. Further molecular dynamics simulations reveal that Abeta and hIAPP oligomers can efficiently cross-seed each other via the association of two highly similar U-shaped beta-sheet structures; thus, conformational compatibility between Abeta and hIAPP aggregates appears to play a key role in determining barriers to cross-seeding. The cross-seeding effects in this work may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of interactions between AD and T2D.
