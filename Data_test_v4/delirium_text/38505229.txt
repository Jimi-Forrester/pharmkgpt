38505229|a|Vascular brain injury results in loss of structural and functional connectivity and leads to cognitive impairment. Its various manifestations, including microinfarcts, microhaemorrhages and white matter hyperintensities, result in microstructural tissue integrity loss and secondary neurodegeneration. Among these, tissue microstructural alteration is a relatively early event compared with atrophy along the aging and neurodegeneration continuum. Understanding its association with cognition may provide the opportunity to further elucidate the relationship between vascular health and clinical outcomes. Magnetic resonance elastography offers a non-invasive approach to evaluate tissue mechanical properties, providing a window into the microstructural integrity of the brain. This retrospective study evaluated brain stiffness as a potential biomarker for vascular brain injury and its role in mediating the impact of vascular dysfunction on cognitive impairment. Seventy-five participants from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging underwent brain imaging using a 3T MR imager with a spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence for magnetic resonance elastography and T1- and T2-weighted pulse sequences. This study evaluated the effects of vascular biomarkers (white matter hyperintensities and cardiometabolic condition score) on brain stiffness using voxelwise analysis. Partial correlation analysis explored associations between brain stiffness, white matter hyperintensities, cardiometabolic condition and global cognition. Mediation analysis determined the role of stiffness in mediating the relationship between vascular biomarkers and cognitive performance. Statistical significance was set at P-values < 0.05. Diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance elastography stiffness for white matter hyperintensities and cardiometabolic condition was evaluated using receiver operator characteristic curves. Voxelwise linear regression analysis indicated white matter hyperintensities negatively correlate with brain stiffness, specifically in periventricular regions with high white matter hyperintensity levels. A negative association between cardiovascular risk factors and stiffness was also observed across the brain. No significant patterns of stiffness changes were associated with amyloid load. Global stiffness (micro) negatively correlated with both white matter hyperintensities and cardiometabolic condition when all other covariables including amyloid load were controlled. The positive correlation between white matter hyperintensities and cardiometabolic condition weakened and became statistically insignificant when controlling for other covariables. Brain stiffness and global cognition were positively correlated, maintaining statistical significance after adjusting for all covariables. These findings suggest mechanical alterations are associated with cognitive dysfunction and vascular brain injury. Brain stiffness significantly mediated the indirect effects of white matter hyperintensities and cardiometabolic condition on global cognition. Local cerebrovascular diseases (assessed by white matter hyperintensities) and systemic vascular risk factors (assessed by cardiometabolic condition) impact brain stiffness with spatially and statistically distinct effects. Global brain stiffness is a significant mediator between vascular disease measures and cognitive function, highlighting the value of magnetic resonance elastography-based mechanical assessments in understanding this relationship.
