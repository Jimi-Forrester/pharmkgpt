37492405|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a critical health issue worldwide that has a negative impact on patients' quality of life, as well as on caregivers, society, and the environment. Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) and neuropsychological scales can be used to identify AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) early, provide a differential diagnosis, and offer early therapies to impede the course of the illness. However, there are few reports of large-scale 11C-PIB-PET/CT investigations that focus on the pathology of AD and MCI. Therefore, further research is needed to determine how neuropsychological test scales and PET/CT measurements of disease progression interact.
