37196515|t|Yokukansan (TJ-54) in patients undergoing surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
37196515|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Yokukansan (TJ-54) in patients undergoing surgery. METHODS: Efficacy was assessed by the onset of delirium, delirium rating scales, anxiety evaluated by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety (HADS-A) score, and safety was assessed by any reported adverse events. RESULTS: Six studies were included. There were no significant differences between the groups in the onset of delirium (risk ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-1.72), delirium rating scales (early postoperative period: standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.24, 95% CI -1.11 to 0.63; late postoperative period: SMD -0.06, 95% CI -1.56 to 1.45), HADS-A score (mean difference -0.47, 95% CI -1.90 to 0.96), and any adverse events (risk ratio 1.18, 95% CI 0.35-4.00). CONCLUSIONS: The use of TJ-54 in patients undergoing surgery is not an effective strategy for postoperative delirium and anxiety. Further research considering target patients and durations of administration should be conducted.
