38347072|a|Urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by spinal cord injury (SCI) can have significant morbidity. There is currently a lack of relevant data in China. This study explores incidence and risk factors of UTI in hospitalized patients with SCI in China, and will help healthcare professionals to make informed clinical decisions to reduce the incidence of UTI. This retrospective study analyzed the medical records of patients with SCI who were hospitalized at three campuses of a hospital in central China between August 2014 and August 2023. The files of patients with SCI were reviewed for demographics and clinical characteristics. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with UTI. A total of 538 patients were included in this study. The incidence of UTI was 49.8%. Sex, hypoproteinemia, urinary incontinence, bladder irrigation, timing of rehabilitation, duration of indwelling urinary catheter were risk factors of UTI. The implementation of specific preventive measures is anticipated to result in a decrease in the occurrence of UTI among individuals with SCI, consequently enhancing their overall quality of life and prognosis.
