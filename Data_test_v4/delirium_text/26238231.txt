26238231|t|Amyloid-Independent Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Serum Apolipoprotein A1 Levels.
26238231|a|OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated the characteristics of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) in subjects with low brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) burden. Furthermore, the relationships between amyloid-independent cognitive decline and serum lipid profiles, particularly apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), were evaluated. DESIGN: Cross-sectional and longitudinal follow-up study. SETTING: University hospital dementia clinic. PARTICIPANTS: 28 aMCI and 35 cognitive normal (CN) elderly. MEASUREMENTS: The study measures included baseline assessments of the subjects' clinical characteristics, lipid profiles, and magnetic resonance imaging and (11)C-labelled Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography scans. Based on PiB retention at baseline, the aMCI subjects were divided into low Abeta (aMCI-) and high Abeta (aMCI+) subgroups. All aMCI subjects were followed up over a 1-year period. RESULTS: The aMCI- group had a longer duration of illness than did the aMCI+ group. None of the aMCI- subjects were diagnosed with Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia during the 1-year follow-up period, whereas 26.7% of aMCI+ subjects developed AD dementia. The aMCI- group also exhibited lower serum APOA1 levels compared with both the aMCI+ and CN groups. Additionally, lower serum APOA1 levels were associated with cognitive decline and brain atrophy independent of Abeta deposition and vascular burden. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with aMCI- likely exhibit different clinical and pathophysiological characteristics than patients with aMCI+. Additionally, APOA1 may be an important contributor underlying amyloid-independent neurodegeneration.
