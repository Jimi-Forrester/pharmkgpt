38515270|a|BACKGROUND: Approximately 50% of patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) experience frailty, which remains unexplored in acute exacerbations of ILD (AE-ILD). A better understanding may help with prognostication and resource planning. We evaluated the association of frailty with clinical characteristics, physical function, hospital outcomes, and post-AE-ILD recovery. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of AE-ILD patients (01/2015-10/2019) with frailty (proportion >=0.25) on a 30-item cumulative-deficits index. Frail and non-frail patients were compared for pre- and post-hospitalization clinical characteristics, adjusted for age, sex, and ILD diagnosis. One-year mortality, considering transplantation as a competing risk, was analysed adjusting for age, frailty, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). RESULTS: 89 AE-ILD patients were admitted (median: 67 years, 63% idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis). 31 were frail, which was associated with older age, greater CCI, lower 6-min walk distance, and decreased independence pre-hospitalization. Frail patients had more major complications (32% vs 10%, p = .01) and required more multidisciplinary support during hospitalization. Frailty was not associated with 1-year mortality (HR: 0.97, 95%CI: [0.45-2.10]) factoring transplantation as a competing risk. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty was associated with reduced exercise capacity, increased comorbidities and hospital complications. Identifying frailty may highlight those requiring additional multidisciplinary support, but further study is needed to explore whether frailty is modifiable with AE-ILD.
