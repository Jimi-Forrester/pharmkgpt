37510480|a|Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies. Currently, the only treatment is surgical resection, which contributes to significant preoperative anxiety, reducing quality of life and worsening surgical outcomes. To date, no standard preventive or therapeutic methods have been established for preoperative anxiety in pancreatic patients. This observational study aims to identify which patients' socio-demographic, clinical and psychological characteristics contribute more to preoperative anxiety and to identify which are their preoperative concerns. Preoperative anxiety was assessed the day before surgery in 104 selected cancer patients undergoing similar pancreatic major surgery, by administering the STAI-S (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form) and the APAIS (Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale). Our data suggest that patients with high STAI-S showed higher levels of APAIS and that major concerns were related to surgical aspects. Among psychological characteristics, depressive symptoms and trait anxiety appeared as risk factors for the development of preoperative anxiety. Findings support the utility of planning a specific psychological screening to identify patients who need more help, with the aim of offering support and preventing the development of state anxiety and surgery worries in the preoperative phase. This highlights also the importance of good communication by the surgeon on specific aspects related to the operation.
