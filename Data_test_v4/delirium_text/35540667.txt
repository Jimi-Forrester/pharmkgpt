35540667|a|Drug delivery systems have been of interest to researchers. The effects of synthesized nano-polymers as silibinin and silymarin extract drug delivery systems on olfactory ensheathing cells under normal and high-glucose conditions were studied. The structure of the nanopolymer was characterized by IR, HNMR, GPC, DLS, and AFM. The toxicity was evaluated by an MTT assay. The production of ROS and the generation of NO were evaluated by a probe of fluorescein diacetate and Griess methods, respectively. The expressions of the protein levels of ILK, VEGF, BDNF, and NGF were investigated by western blotting. The polymer size was between 50 and 150 nm. The loading capacities for silibinin and silymarin were 68.5% and 56.4%, respectively, and the drug release for them was estimated at 54.1% and 50.8%, respectively. In high-glucose conditions, the cells were protected (EC50 = 4.88 +- 0.5 muM) by silibinin and nanopolymer in low concentrations by reducing the amount of ROS and NO, maintaining ILK, reducing VEGF and increasing NGF and BDNF. Incubation with silibinin and nanopolymer at high concentrations increased cell death with LC50 = 57.36 +- 2.5 and 43.18 +- 1.8 muM, respectively, in high-glucose states. Thus, the cells were protected by silibinin and nanopolymer in protective concentrations by reducing the amount of ROS and NO, maintaining ILK, reducing VEGF, and increasing BDNF and NGF. The mentioned mechanisms were totally reversed at high concentrations.
