36154935|a|BACKGROUND: This study aims to characterize the impact of apraxia and visuospatial neglect on stroke patients' cognitive and functional outcomes during early rehabilitation. Prior work implies an unfavorable effect of visuospatial neglect on rehabilitation; however, previous findings remain ambiguous and primarily considered long-term effects. Even less is known about the impact of apraxia on rehabilitation outcomes. Although clinicians agree on the significance of the first few weeks after stroke for the course of rehabilitation, studies exploring the impact of neglect and apraxia in this early rehabilitation period remain scarce. METHODS: Based on a screening of 515 hospitalized stroke patients from an early rehabilitation ward, 150 stroke patients (75 left-hemispheric strokes, 75 right hemispheric strokes) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in this observational, longitudinal study. The patients' cognitive and functional statuses were documented at admission to the early rehabilitation ward and discharge. Also, detailed apraxia and neglect assessments were performed at midterm. The predictive values of age and apraxia and neglect severity (as reflected in two components from a principal component analysis of the neglect and apraxia assessments) for cognitive and functional outcomes at discharge were evaluated by multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: Besides the expected influence of the respective variables at admission, we observed a significant effect of apraxia severity on the cognitive outcome at discharge. Moreover, neglect severity predicted the Early Rehabilitation Barthel Index (Fruhreha-Barthel-Index) at discharge. Supplementary moderator analysis revealed a differential effect of neglect severity on the cognitive outcome depending on the affected hemisphere. CONCLUSION: Data indicate a strong association between apraxia and visuospatial neglect and early rehabilitation outcomes after stroke.
