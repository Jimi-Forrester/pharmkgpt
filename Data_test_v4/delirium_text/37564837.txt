37564837|t|Assessment of potential predictors affecting preoperative anxiety in Indian children- A prospective observational study.
37564837|a|Background and Aims: Preoperative anxiety is a common problem among children undergoing surgery. The aim of the study was to assess the incidence and identify various predictors of preoperative anxiety in Indian children. Material and Methods: A prospective, observational study was conducted on 60 children of the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical status 1/2, aged 2-6 years and scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Preoperative parental anxiety was assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaire. The children's anxiety was assessed in the preoperative room, at the time of parental separation, and at the induction of anesthesia using modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS) scoring by an anesthesiologist and a psychologist. Sedative premedication was employed prior to parental separation. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify the possible predictors of anxiety. Results: The incidence of high preoperative anxiety among the studied children was 76% in the preoperative room, 93% during parental separation, and 96% during anesthetic induction. Among the nine possible predictors identified on univariate regression, the presence of siblings was found to be a significant independent predictor on multivariate regression analysis (P = 0.04). The inter-rater agreement was excellent for the assessment of preoperative anxiety using mYPAS by the anesthesiologist and psychologist (weighted Kappa, k = 0.79). Conclusion: The incidence of preoperative anxiety in Indian children in the age group of 2-6 years is very high. The preop anxiety escalates progressively at parental separation and induction of anesthesia despite sedative premedication. The presence of siblings is a significant predictor of preoperative anxiety.
