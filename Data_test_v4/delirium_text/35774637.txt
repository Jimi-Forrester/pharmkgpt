35774637|a|Globally, aging and diabetes are considered prevalent threats to human health. Chlorella pyrenoidosa polysaccharide (CPP) is a natural active ingredient with multiple health benefits including antioxidant and hypolipidemic activities. In this study, the aging-related diabetic (AD) mice model was established to investigate the underlying hypoglycemic and antioxidant mechanisms of CPP. It improved superoxide dismutase, catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px), and malondialdehyde activities in liver and insulin secretion. CAT and GSH-px activity in the brain increased after CPP administration. In addition, through histopathological examinations, it was evident that injuries in the liver, brain, jejunum, and pancreas were restored by CPP. This restoration was likely mediated via the activation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor/FOXO-1 (forkhead box O1) pathway concurrent with the inhibition of interleukin-6 receptor/FOXO-1 pathway. Furthermore, metabolomics and correlation analysis revealed that CPP possibly relived AD through changes in insulin levels and declined oxidative stress as regulated by phenylpyruvic acid. These findings suggested that CPP exerted antioxidant and hypoglycemic roles in an AD mice model, thereby providing a sound scientific foundation for further development and utilization of CPP.
