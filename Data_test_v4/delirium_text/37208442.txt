Human monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) was isolated from the culture supernatants of not only mitogen-activated peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes but also malignant glioma cells based on its in vitro chemotactic activity toward human monocytes. MCP-1 was subsequently found to be identical to a previously described tumor cell-derived chemotactic factor thought to be responsible for the accumulation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and it became a candidate target of clinical intervention; however, the role of TAMs in cancer development was still controversial at the time of the discovery of MCP-1. The in vivo role of MCP-1 in cancer progression was first evaluated by examining human cancer tissues, including breast cancers. Positive correlations between the level of MCP-1 production in tumors and the degree of TAM infiltration and cancer progression were established. The contribution of MCP-1 to the growth of primary tumors and metastasis to the lung, bone, and brain was examined in mouse breast cancer models. The results of these studies strongly suggested that MCP-1 is a promoter of breast cancer metastasis to the lung and brain but not bone. Potential mechanisms of MCP-1 production in the breast cancer microenvironment have also been reported. In the present manuscript, we review studies in which the role of MCP-1 in breast cancer development and progression and the mechanisms of its production were examined and attempt to draw a consensus and discuss the potential use of MCP-1 as a biomarker for diagnosis.
