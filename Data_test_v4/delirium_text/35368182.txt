35368182|t|Urology and Geriatrics in Korea: Present Status and Future Directions.
35368182|a|Globally, the population aged 65 years and over is growing faster than all other age groups. South Korea, in particular, is one of the most rapidly aging societies worldwide. With the increase in the older population, the incidence of urologic diseases has increased significantly along with that of chronic diseases. Urologic diseases are an important component of the health problems faced by an aging society. Among those, urinary incontinence and voiding dysfunction cause significant health and quality of life problems in older adults. To properly manage these diseases, especially in the field of urology, it is necessary to propose appropriate policies for the health care of older people. Accordingly, the significance of geriatrics, particularly geriatric urology, has increased. Although geriatric urology in South Korea began relatively recently, the founding of the Korean Society of Geriatric Urological Care represents a significant step in the development of geriatric urology as a subspecialty. The goal of this review is to elaborate on the concept of geriatrics and to provide an overview of geriatric urology with a focus on its current status in South Korea. Furthermore, future challenges in the face of rapid demographic changes are reviewed.
