METHODS: Eight hospitalized patients with autoimmune dementia during March 2011 and May 2013 were recruited and retrospectively analyzed for clinical features, as well as therapeutic and prognosis profiles. RESULTS: There were 3 males and 5 females with a onset age range of 45-72 years. Their onsets varied from acute (n = 3), subacute (n = 1) to chronic (n = 4).Six of them had a fluctuating course. The diagnoses were multiple sclerosis (n = 3), paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (n = 2) and Hashimoto's encephalopathy (n = 1), microscopic polyangiitis (n = 1) and unclassified autoimmune encephalopathy (n = 1). Progressive memory loss without delirium was the main symptom.In addition, 3 patients suffered epilepsy, 2 with intractable hyponatremia, 4 with positive serum autoimmune or paraneoplastic antibodies, 7 with inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid, 4 with abnormal electroencephalography (EEG) and 8 with various changes on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Two patients had concurrent Hashimoto's thyroiditis and another with small cell lung cancer. All patients improved after treatment with immunological and antineoplastic therapies. CONCLUSION: Autoimmune dementia has complex causes with a rapidly progressive and fluctuating course. The coexisting conditions include epilepsy, hyponatremia, organ-specific autoimmunity, inflammatory spinal fluid with abnormal EEG and brain MRI findings.Immunotherapy is recommended.
