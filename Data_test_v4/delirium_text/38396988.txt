38396988|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a representative cause of dementia and is caused by neuronal loss, leading to the accumulation of aberrant neuritic plaques and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Oxidative stress is involved in the impaired clearance of amyloid beta (Abeta), and Abeta-induced oxidative stress causes AD by inducing the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Hwangryunhaedok-tang (HHT, Kracie K-09 ), a traditional herbal medicine prescription, has shown therapeutic effects on various diseases. However, the studies of HHT as a potential treatment for AD are insufficient. Therefore, our study identified the neurological effects and mechanisms of HHT and its key bioactive compounds against Alzheimer's disease in vivo and in vitro. In a 5xFAD mouse model, our study confirmed that HHT attenuated cognitive impairments in the Morris water maze (MWM) test and passive avoidance (PA) test. In addition, the prevention of neuron impairment, reduction in the protein levels of Abeta, and inhibition of cell apoptosis were confirmed with brain tissue staining. In HT-22 cells, HHT attenuates tBHP-induced cytotoxicity, ROS generation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. It was verified that HHT exerts a neuroprotective effect by activating signaling pathways interacting with Nrf2, such as MAPK/ERK, PI3K/Akt, and LKB1/AMPK. Among the components, baicalein, a bioavailable compound of HHT, exhibited neuroprotective properties and activated the Akt, AMPK, and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways. Our findings indicate a mechanism for HHT and its major bioavailable compounds to treat and prevent AD and suggest its potential.
