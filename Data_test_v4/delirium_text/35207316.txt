35207316|a|BACKGROUND: The need for minimally invasive biomarkers for the early diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) prior to the clinical onset and monitoring of beta-pancreatic cell loss is emerging. Here, we focused on studying circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) as a liquid biopsy biomaterial for accurate diagnosis/monitoring of T2DM. METHODS: ccfDNA levels were directly quantified in sera from 96 T2DM patients and 71 healthy individuals via fluorometry, and then fragment DNA size profiling was performed by capillary electrophoresis. Following this, ccfDNA methylation levels of five beta-cell-related genes were measured via qPCR. Data were analyzed by automated machine learning to build classifying predictive models. RESULTS: ccfDNA levels were found to be similar between groups but indicative of apoptosis in T2DM. INS (Insulin), IAPP (Islet Amyloid Polypeptide-Amylin), GCK (Glucokinase), and KCNJ11 (Potassium Inwardly Rectifying Channel Subfamily J member 11) levels differed significantly between groups. AutoML analysis delivered biosignatures including GCK, IAPP and KCNJ11 methylation, with the highest ever reported discriminating performance of T2DM from healthy individuals (AUC 0.927). CONCLUSIONS: Our data unravel the value of ccfDNA as a minimally invasive biomaterial carrying important clinical information for T2DM. Upon prospective clinical evaluation, the built biosignature can be disruptive for T2DM clinical management.
