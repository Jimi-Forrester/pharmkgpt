37870162|t|Long-Term Outcomes in Patients With Trisomy 21 and Obstructive Sleep Apnea.
37870162|a|OBJECTIVE: To better understand the long-term health implications of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on patients with Trisomy 21 (T21) and the role of sleep surgery as a therapeutic intervention. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective large database review. SETTING: The prevalence of OSA is as high as 75% in patients with T21. We sought to examine the cardiovascular, neurological, and endocrinological outcomes of patients with T21 10 years after their diagnosis of OSA. METHODS: TriNetX, an electronic medical record database, was queried for health outcomes in patients with T21 after diagnosis of OSA. The group was further analyzed to identify those who underwent sleep surgery, including hypoglossal nerve stimulation, palatopharyngoplasty, or adenotonsillectomy. RESULTS: Ten years after diagnosis, patients with OSA and T21 had a significantly higher incidence of death, myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, essential hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and Alzheimer's disease compared to patients with T21 alone. Patients with OSA and T21 who underwent sleep surgery had significantly reduced incidence of adverse health outcomes compared to patients using continuous positive airway pressure. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that patients with T21 and OSA are at higher risk of poor health outcomes, which may require closer monitoring for earlier diagnosis and management of comorbid conditions. Sleep surgery is a suitable treatment modality for mitigating the risk of adverse outcomes in this population and should be considered in patients who are eligible surgical candidates.
