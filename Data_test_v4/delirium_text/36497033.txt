36497033|a|During meiotic maturation, accurate progression of meiosis is ensured by multiple protein kinases and by signal transduction pathways they are involved in. However, the mechanisms regulating the functions of phosphorylated proteins are unclear. Herein, we investigated the role of Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase family member that regulates protein functions by altering the structure of the peptide bond of proline in phosphorylated proteins in meiosis. First, we analyzed changes in the expression of Pin1 during meiotic maturation and found that although its levels were constant, its localization was dynamic in different stages of meiosis. Furthermore, we confirmed that the spindle rotates near the cortex when Pin1 is inhibited by juglone during meiotic maturation, resulting in an error in the extrusion of the first polar body. In Pin1-/- mice, frequent polar body extrusion errors were observed in ovulation, providing insights into the mechanism underlying the errors in the extrusion of the polar body. Although multiple factors and mechanisms might be involved, Pin1 functions in meiosis progression via actin- and microtubule-associated phosphorylated protein targets. Our results show that functional regulation of Pin1 is indispensable in oocyte production and should be considered while developing oocyte culture technologies for reproductive medicine and animal breeding.
