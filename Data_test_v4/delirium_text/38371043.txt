38371043|a|BACKGROUND: The prevalence of dementia is escalating significantly, posing a substantial societal burden. Currently, there exists a dearth of comprehensive health data about dementia patients in Saudi Arabia, particularly within Al-Baha City. METHODS: A retrospective case-series study was undertaken to ascertain the prevalence of dementia within the populace of the Al-Baha region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This investigation utilized hospital-based records encompassing individuals exhibiting symptoms or diagnosed with dementia and its related forms across the Al-Baha region. Furthermore, the study aimed to evaluate the burden of comorbidities among dementia patients and document the pharmacological therapeutic interventions administered to manage dementia and its associated concurrent health conditions. RESULTS: Our investigation explored the prevalence rates of various forms of dementia and the accompanying comorbidities among affected individuals. The study spanned from August 2020 to August 2023. Our study encompassed 407 patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, vascular dementia (VaD), or other forms of dementia who were either admitted to or attended tertiary hospitals in Al-Baha. Assessment of the comorbidity burden was conducted using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Our findings revealed that among these patients, 13.3% presented with AD, 23.6% with VaD, 33.4% with Parkinson's disease, 15.75% with amnesia, and 14.0% with other types of dementia. The spectrum of comorbidities observed among dementia patients encompassed various conditions, with diabetes mellitus emerging as the predominant comorbidity (19.1%), followed by hypertension (16.4%). Additionally, manifestations of depression were noted in 14% of patients, while 9.82% suffered from paralysis. Chronic conditions such as cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), and cervical spondylosis were also observed among individuals afflicted with dementia and its varied forms. Statistically significant correlations were established between gender, age, nationality, comorbidities, and the prevalence of dementia. Therapeutic interventions in the form of pharmacological treatments were prescribed for dementia patients with comorbidities. Commonly administered medications included Amlod (6.3%), Amlodipine (6.6%), Amlor (5.8%), Aspirin (10.5%), chemotherapeutic drugs (4.4%), Glipizide (8.5%), Lantus (11.3%), Levodopa (23.5%), Metformin (7.8%), acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (6.8%), and Pulmicort (7.86%). These medications aimed to alleviate symptoms associated with dementia and its accompanying comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation underscores the substantial burden of comorbidities experienced by dementia patients. These findings offer crucial insights into the overall health status of individuals grappling with dementia, serving as a catalyst for increased awareness among clinicians and policymakers. Such awareness can drive improvements in medical care and support frameworks tailored to the specific needs of dementia patients.
