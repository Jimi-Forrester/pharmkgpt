34941464|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) represent two major chronic diseases that affect a large percentage of the population and share common pathogenetic mechanisms, including oxidative stress and inflammation. Considering their common mechanistic aspects, and given the current lack of effective therapies for AD, accumulating research has focused on the therapeutic potential of antidiabetic drugs in the treatment or prevention of AD. AREAS COVERED: This review examines the latest preclinical and clinical evidence on the potential of antidiabetic drugs as candidates for AD treatment. Numerous approved drugs for T2DM, including insulin, metformin, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), and sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), are in the spotlight and may constitute novel approaches for AD treatment. EXPERT OPINION: Among other pharmacologic agents, GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i have so far exhibited promising results as novel treatment approaches for AD, while current research has centered on deciphering their action on the central nervous system (CNS). Further investigation is crucial to reveal the most effective pharmacological agents and their optimal combinations, maximize their beneficial effects on neurons, and find ways to increase their distribution to the CNS.
