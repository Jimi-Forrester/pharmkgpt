36407197|a|Objective The study aims to evaluate the primary healthcare practitioner's (PHCP) knowledge, attitude, and practice toward systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and to explore the difficulties of early referral to specialized clinics. Method This is a cross-sectional study conducted between February and March 2022 targeting the PHCP among the primary healthcare centers in Qassim, Saudi Arabia. The study was conducted among 203 participants who enrolled via a cluster random sampling technique depending on the survey. Qualitative categorical variables are expressed as frequencies and percentages, while continuous variables are reported as means and standard deviations (SD). The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test and the independent T-test have been used to explore the relationship between participants' knowledge scores and their socio-demographic characteristics. A P-value <=0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result The study found that only 4.4% of participating PHCPs had good knowledge related to SLE, while 45.8% of them had fair knowledge, and nearly half of them (49.8%) had poor knowledge. It was noted that GPs who specialized in family medicine or saw more than 40 patients each week had comparably better knowledge than others, which was statistically significant (p<0.05). The difficulty in diagnosing SLE patients was mentioned by 48.3% of the PHCPs. Family medicine consultants (p<0.001), those who worked in a tertiary care facility for more than six months (p<0.001) and those who worked in a rheumatology department (p<0.05), reported considerably better levels of comfort when treating SLE patients. Conclusion This study found that included participants' understanding of SLE, its diagnosis, and management was inadequate. Coordination between rheumatologists and experts from many disciplines at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of care is critical for overcoming ambiguities and obstacles in the diagnosis and therapy of SLE patients.
