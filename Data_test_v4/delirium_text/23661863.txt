23661863|t|Quality control parameters for Tamra (copper) Bhasma.
23661863|a|BACKGROUND: Metallic Bhasmas are highly valued and have their own importance in Ayurvedic formulations. To testify the Bhasmas various parameters have been told in Rasashastra classics. Tamra Bhasma (TB) with its different properties is used in the treatment of various diseases is quiet famous among the Ayurvedic physicians (Vaidyas). OBJECTIVES: The present study was carried out to set up the quality control parameters for the TB by making the use of classical tests along with advanced analytical tools. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Copper wire taken for the preparation of Bhasma was first analyzed for its copper content and then subjected to Shodhana, Marana and Amrutikarana procedures as per the classical references. Final product complied with all the classical parameters like Rekhapurnatwa, Varitaratwa etc. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After complying with these tests TB was analyzed by advanced analytical techniques like particle size distribution (PSD) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and inductive coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP). RESULTS: PSD analysis of TB showed volumetric mean diameter of 28.70 mum, 50% of the material was below 18.40 mum size. Particle size less than 2mum were seen in SEM. 56.24 wt % of copper and 23.06 wt % of sulphur was found in ICP-AES. Heavy metals like cadmium, selenium were not detected while others like arsenic, lead and mercury were present in traces. CONCLUSIONS: These observations could be specified as the quality control parameters conforming to all the classical tests under the Bhasma Pariksha.
