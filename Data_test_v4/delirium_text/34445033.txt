34445033|t|The Accumulation and Molecular Effects of Trimethylamine N-Oxide on Metabolic Tissues: It's Not All Bad.
34445033|a|Since elevated serum levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) were first associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), TMAO research among chronic diseases has grown exponentially. We now know that serum TMAO accumulation begins with dietary choline metabolism across the microbiome-liver-kidney axis, which is typically dysregulated during pathogenesis. While CVD research links TMAO to atherosclerotic mechanisms in vascular tissue, its molecular effects on metabolic tissues are unclear. Here we report the current standing of TMAO research in metabolic disease contexts across relevant tissues including the liver, kidney, brain, adipose, and muscle. Since poor blood glucose management is a hallmark of metabolic diseases, we also explore the variable TMAO effects on insulin resistance and insulin production. Among metabolic tissues, hepatic TMAO research is the most common, whereas its effects on other tissues including the insulin producing pancreatic beta-cells are largely unexplored. Studies on diseases including obesity, diabetes, liver diseases, chronic kidney disease, and cognitive diseases reveal that TMAO effects are unique under pathologic conditions compared to healthy controls. We conclude that molecular TMAO effects are highly context-dependent and call for further research to clarify the deleterious and beneficial molecular effects observed in metabolic disease research.
