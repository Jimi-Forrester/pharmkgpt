38638610|a|Objective: In recent years, frailty has been reported to be an important predictive factor associated with worse outcomes in neurosurgical patients. The purpose of the present systematic review was to analyze the impact of frailty on outcomes of chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) patients. Methods: We performed a systematic review of literature using the PubMed, Cochrane library, Wiley online library, and Web of Science databases following PRISMA guidelines of studies evaluating the effect of frailty on outcomes of cSDH published until January 31, 2023. Results: A comprehensive literature search of databases yielded a total of 471 studies. Six studies with 4085 patients were included in our final qualitative systematic review. We found that frailty was associated with inferior outcomes (including mortality, complications, recurrence, and discharge disposition) in cSDH patients. Despite varying frailty scales/indices used across studies, negative outcomes occurred more frequently in patients that were frail than those who were not. Conclusions: While the small number of available studies, and heterogenous methodology and reporting parameters precluded us from conducting a pooled analysis, the results of the present systematic review identify frailty as a robust predictor of worse outcomes in cSDH patients. Future studies with a larger sample size and consistent frailty scales/indices are warranted to strengthen the available evidence. The results of this work suggest a strong case for using frailty as a pre-operative risk stratification measure in cSDH patients.
