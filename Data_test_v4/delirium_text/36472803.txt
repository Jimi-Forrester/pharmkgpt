36472803|a|PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) index is intended to reflect the glymphatic function of the brain; however, head rotation may reduce reproducibility and reliability. This study aimed to evaluate whether reorientation of DTI data improves the reproducibility of the ALPS index using the OASIS-3 dataset. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 234 cognitively normal subjects from the OASIS-3 dataset were included. Original and reoriented ALPS indices were calculated using a technique that registered vector information of DTI to another space and created reoriented diffusivity maps. The F test was used to compare variances of the original and reoriented ALPS indices. Subsequently, subjects with head rotation around the z- (inferior-superior; n = 43) or x axis (right-left; n = 25) and matched subjects with neutral head position were selected for evaluation of intra- and inter-rater reliability. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of the original and reoriented ALPS indices for participants with head rotation and neutral head position were calculated separately. The Bland-Altman plot comparing the original and reoriented ALPS indices was also evaluated. RESULTS: The reoriented ALPS index exhibited a significantly smaller variance than the original ALPS index (p < 0.001). For intra- and inter-reliability, the reorientation technique showed good-to-excellent reproducibility in calculating the ALPS index even in subjects with head rotation (ICCs of original ALPS index: 0.52-0.81; ICCs of reoriented ALPS index: > 0.85). A wider range of the 95% limit of agreement of the Bland-Altman plot for subjects with x axis rotation was identified, indicating that x axis rotation may remarkably affect calculation of the ALPS index. CONCLUSION: The technique used in this study enabled the creation of reoriented diffusivity maps and improved reproducibility in calculating the ALPS index.
