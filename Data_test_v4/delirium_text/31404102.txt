31404102|a|Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) may manifest cognitive and non-cognitive phenotypes including motor impairment, suggesting a shared underlying biology. We tested the hypothesis that five cortical proteins identified from a gene network that drives AD and cognitive phenotypes are also related to motor function in the same individuals. We examined 1208 brains of older adults with motor and cognitive assessments prior to death. Cortical proteins were quantified with SRM proteomics and we collected indices of AD and other related pathologies. A higher level of IGFBP5 was associated with poorer motor function proximate to death but AK4, HSPB2, ITPK1 and PLXNB1 were unrelated to motor function. The association of IGFBP5 with motor function was unrelated to the presence of indices of brain pathologies. In contrast, the addition of a term for cognition attenuated the association of IGFBP5 with motor function by about 90% and they were no longer related. These data lend support for the idea that unidentified cortical proteins like IGFBP5, which may not manifest a known pathologic footprint, may contribute to motor and cognitive function in older adults.
