36929034|t|Time to surgery after proximal femur fracture in geriatric patients depends on hospital size and provided level of care: analysis of the Registry for Geriatric Trauma (ATR-DGU).
36929034|a|PURPOSE: Proximal femur fractures predominantly affect older patients and can mark a drastic turning point in their lives. To avoid complications and reduce mortality, expert associations recommend surgical treatment within 24-48 h after admission. Due to the high incidence, treatment is provided at a wide range of hospitals with different size and level of care, which may affect time to surgery. METHODS: Data from 19,712 patients included from 2016 to 2019 in the Registry for Geriatric Trauma (ATR-DGU) were analyzed in terms of time to surgery, in-house mortality, mobilization on the first postoperative day, ambulation status on the 7th day after surgery, and initiation of osteoporosis therapy. Participating hospitals were grouped according to their classification as level I, II or III trauma centers. Also presence of additional injuries, intake and type of anticoagulants were considered. Linear and logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of hospitals level of care on each item. RESULTS: 28.6% of patients were treated in level I, 37.7% in level II, and 33.7% in level III trauma centers. There was no significant difference in age, sex and ASA-score. Mean time to surgery was 19.2 h (IQR 9.0-29.8) in level I trauma centers and 16.8 h (IQR 6.5-24) in level II/III trauma centers (p < 0.001). Surgery in the first 24 h after admission was provided for 64.7% of level I and 75.0% of level II/III patients (p < 0.001). Treatment in hospitals with higher level of care and subsequent increased time to surgery showed no significant influence on in-house mortality (OR 0.90, 95%-CI 0.78-1.04), but negative effects on walking ability 7 days after surgery could be observed (OR 1.28, 95%-CI 1.18-1.38). CONCLUSION: In hospitals of larger size and higher level of care the time to surgery for patients with a proximal femur fracture was significantly higher than in smaller hospitals. No negative effects regarding in-house mortality, but for ambulation status during in-hospital stay could be observed. As the number of these patients will constantly increase, specific treatment capacities should be established regardless of the hospitals size.
