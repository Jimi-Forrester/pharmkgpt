37942086|t|EEG microstate quantifiers and state space descriptors during anaesthesia in patients with postoperative delirium: a descriptive analysis.
37942086|a|Postoperative delirium is a serious sequela of surgery and surgery-related anaesthesia. One recommended method to prevent postoperative delirium is using bi-frontal EEG recording. The single, processed index of depth of anaesthesia allows the anaesthetist to avoid episodes of suppression EEG and excessively deep anaesthesia. The study data presented here were based on multichannel (19 channels) EEG recordings during anaesthesia. This enabled the analysis of various parameters of global electrical brain activity. These parameters were used to compare microstate topographies under anaesthesia with those in healthy volunteers and to analyse changes in microstate quantifiers and EEG global state space descriptors with increasing exposure to anaesthesia. Seventy-three patients from the Surgery Depth of Anaesthesia and Cognitive Outcome study (SRCTN 36437985) received intraoperative multichannel EEG recordings. Altogether, 720 min of artefact-free EEG data, including 210 min (29.2%) of suppression EEG, were analysed. EEG microstate topographies, microstate quantifiers (duration, frequency of occurrence and global field power) and the state space descriptors sigma (overall EEG power), phi (generalized frequency) and omega (number of uncorrelated brain processes) were evaluated as a function of duration of exposure to anaesthesia, suppression EEG and subsequent development of postoperative delirium. The major analyses involved covariate-adjusted linear mixed-effects models. The older (71 +- 7 years), predominantly male (60%) patients received a median exposure of 210 (range: 75-675) min of anaesthesia. During seven postoperative days, 21 patients (29%) developed postoperative delirium. Microstate topographies under anaesthesia resembled topographies from healthy and much younger awake persons. With increasing duration of exposure to anaesthesia, single microstate quantifiers progressed differently in suppression or non-suppression EEG and in patients with or without subsequent postoperative delirium. The most pronounced changes occurred during enduring suppression EEG in patients with subsequent postoperative delirium: duration and frequency of occurrence of microstates C and D progressed in opposite directions, and the state space descriptors showed a pattern of declining uncorrelated brain processes (omega) combined with increasing EEG variance (sigma). With increasing exposure to general anaesthesia, multiple changes in the dynamics of microstates and global EEG parameters occurred. These changes varied partly between suppression and non-suppression EEG and between patients with or without subsequent postoperative delirium. Ongoing suppression EEG in patients with subsequent postoperative delirium was associated with reduced network complexity in combination with increased overall EEG power. Additionally, marked changes in quantifiers in microstate C and in microstate D occurred. These putatively adverse intraoperative trajectories in global electrical brain activity may be seen as preceding and ultimately predicting postoperative delirium.
