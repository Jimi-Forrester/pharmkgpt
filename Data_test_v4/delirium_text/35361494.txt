We examined the association of depression and COVID-induced PTSD with cognitive symptoms following COVID-19 illness. METHODS: Patients treated for COVID-19 between March 26 and May 27, 2020 were surveyed three months later. Cognitive symptoms were assessed by asking "Since your COVID-19 illness, do you now have more difficulty: 1) Remembering conversations a few days later? 2) Remembering where you placed familiar objects? 3) Finding the right words while speaking?" Patients endorsing at least one such complaint were coded positive for cognitive symptoms. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association of depression (PHQ-8 >= 10) and COVID-induced PTSD (PCL-5 >= 30) with cognitive symptoms, adjusting for demographic and clinical factors. RESULTS: Among 153 participants, 44.4% reported at least one cognitive symptom, 18.3% were depressed, and 23.5% had COVID-induced PTSD. Adjusting for covariates, depression (OR 5.15, 95% CI 1.30-20.35, p = 0.02) and COVID-induced PTSD (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.13-11.89, p = 0.03) were significantly associated with cognitive symptoms; self-reported history of mental illness was also associated (OR 4.90, 95% CI 1.24-19.41, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Depression, COVID-induced PTSD, and prior mental illness were strongly associated with cognitive symptoms three months after acute COVID-19 illness.
