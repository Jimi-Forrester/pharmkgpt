17286590|t|A beta oligomers - a decade of discovery.
17286590|a|Converging lines of evidence suggest that progressive accumulation of the amyloid beta-protein (A beta) plays a central role in the genesis of Alzheimer's disease, but it was long assumed that A beta had to be assembled into extracellular amyloid fibrils to exert its cytotoxic effects. Over the past decade, data have emerged from the use of synthetic A beta peptides, cell culture models, beta-amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice and human brain to suggest that pre-fibrillar, diffusible assemblies of A beta are also deleterious. Although the precise molecular identity of these soluble toxins remains unsettled, accumulating evidence suggests that soluble forms of A beta are indeed the proximate effectors of synapse loss and neuronal injury. Here we review recent progress in understanding the role of soluble oligomers in Alzheimer's disease.
