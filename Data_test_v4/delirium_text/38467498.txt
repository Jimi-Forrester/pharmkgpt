38467498|a|OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of pressing moxibustion at Baihui (GV 20) and Guanyuan (CV 4) combined with donepezil hydrochloride tablets and donepezil hydrochloride tablets alone on cognitive impairment in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease(AD), and to explore the mechanism of pressing moxibustion in the treatment of mild to moderate AD from the serum levels of beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta1-42), microtubule-associated protein tau and phosphorylated tau (P-tau). METHODS: A total of 76 patients with mild to moderate AD were randomly divided into an observation group (38 cases, 4 cases dropped out) and a control group (38 cases, 2 cases dropped out). Patients in the control group were given oral donepezil hydrochloride tablets (5 mg each time, once a day). On the basis of the control group, patients in the observation group were treated with pressing moxibustion at Baihui (GV 20) and Guanyuan (CV 4), 5 cones per acupoint, once every other day, three times a week. Both groups were treated for 8 weeks. The scores of mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) were compared between the two groups before treatment, after treatment and after 4 and 12 weeks of treatment completion. The serum levels of Abeta1-42, tau and P-tau were detected before and after treatment in the two groups, and the safety was evaluated. RESULTS: At each time point after treatment, the MMSE and MoCA scores of the two groups were higher than those before treatment (P<0.05), and the scores in the observation group were higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). After treatment, the serum levels of Abeta1-42, tau and P-tau in the two groups were lower than those before treatment (P<0.05), and above indexes in the observation group were lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the safety level between the two groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The short-term and long-term effect of pressing moxibustion at Baihui (GV 20) and Guanyuan (CV 4) combined with donepezil hydrochloride tablets in improving cognitive impairment in mild to moderate AD is better than that of donepezil hydrochloride tablets alone, and can reduce serum levels of Abeta1-42, tau and P-tau, which may be one of the mechanisms of pressing moxibustion to improve cognitive impairment.
