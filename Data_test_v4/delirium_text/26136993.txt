26136993|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) in the hippocampal tissue of an insulin-resistant rat model, and thereby explore the roles of BACE1 and insulin resistance (IR) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A total of 36 male Sprague-Dawley rats, aged 2 months, were randomly divided into three groups. These were an insulin-resistant (experimental) group, a high fat control group and a blank control group. The cognitive function and behavioral changes of the rats were tested by a Morris water maze experiment. Amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition was detected by an immunohistochemical method. The expression levels of BACE1 in the rat hippocampal tissues were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction technology. The rats in the experimental group had evident learning and memory impairment, with significantly decreased learning memory. The modeling was successful; in the experimental group, the rats exhibited IR and their glucose metabolism was significantly abnormal. However, there was no characteristic pathology of AD. The expression of BACE1 in the brain tissue of rats in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in high fat control and blank control groups (P<0.01). In conclusion, the expression of BACE1 in the brain tissue of insulin-resistant rats increased, and IR was indicated to participate in the pathogenesis of AD.
