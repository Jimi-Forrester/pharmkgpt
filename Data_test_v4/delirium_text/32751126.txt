32751126|t|Bioactive Peptides and Dietary Polyphenols: Two Sides of the Same Coin.
32751126|a|The call for health-promoting nutraceuticals and functional foods containing bioactive compounds is growing. Among the great diversity of functional phytochemicals, polyphenols and, more recently, bioactive peptides have stood out as functional compounds. The amount of an ingested nutrient able to reach the bloodstream and exert the biological activity is a critical factor, and is affected by several factors, such as food components and food processing. This can lead to unclaimed interactions and/or reactions between bioactive compounds, which is particularly important for these bioactive compounds, since some polyphenols are widely known for their ability to interact and/or precipitate proteins/peptides. This review focuses on this important topic, addressing how these interactions could affect molecules digestion, absorption, metabolism and (biological)function. At the end, it is evidenced that further research is needed to understand the true effect of polyphenol-bioactive peptide interactions on overall health outcomes.
