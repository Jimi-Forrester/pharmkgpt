25865441|a|Cerebrospinal fluid YKL-40 has been described as a marker of glial inflammation. We aimed to study the relationship between YKL-40 and brain structure and its interactions with core Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers. We measured cortical thickness (CTh) and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (amyloid-beta 1-42 [Abeta42], total tau, p-tau, and YKL-40) of 80 cognitively normal controls and 27 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Subjects were classified as Abeta42+ (<550 pg/mL) or Abeta42- (>550 pg/mL). CTh difference maps were derived from the interaction and correlation analyses in the whole sample and within clinical groups. There was a strong correlation between YKL-40 and markers of neurodegeneration (total tau and p-tau). In the whole sample, we found a negative correlation between YKL-40 and CTh in AD vulnerable areas in Abeta42+ subjects but not in Abeta42 participants. Our results suggest that YKL-40 could track the inflammatory processes associated to tau-related neurodegeneration in the presence of the AD pathophysiological process.
