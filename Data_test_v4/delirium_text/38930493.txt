38930493|t|Contribution of pks+ Escherichia coli (E. coli) to Colon Carcinogenesis.
38930493|a|Colorectal cancer (CRC) stands as a significant global health concern, ranking second in mortality and third in frequency among cancers worldwide. While only a small fraction of CRC cases can be attributed to inherited genetic mutations, the majority arise sporadically due to somatic mutations. Emerging evidence reveals gut microbiota dysbiosis to be a contributing factor, wherein polyketide synthase-positive Escherichia coli (pks+ E. coli) plays a pivotal role in CRC pathogenesis. pks+ bacteria produce colibactin, a genotoxic protein that causes deleterious effects on DNA within host colonocytes. In this review, we examine the role of the gut microbiota in colon carcinogenesis, elucidating how colibactin-producer bacteria induce DNA damage, promote genomic instability, disrupt the gut epithelial barrier, induce mucosal inflammation, modulate host immune responses, and influence cell cycle dynamics. Collectively, these actions foster a microenvironment conducive to tumor initiation and progression. Understanding the mechanisms underlying pks+ bacteria-mediated CRC development may pave the way for mass screening, early detection of tumors, and therapeutic strategies such as microbiota modulation, bacteria-targeted therapy, checkpoint inhibition of colibactin production and immunomodulatory pathways.
