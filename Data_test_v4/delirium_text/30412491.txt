30412491|t|Severe Agitation in Dementia: An Explorative Secondary Data Analysis on the Prevalence and Associated Factors in Nursing Home Residents.
30412491|a|BACKGROUND: The phenomena of severe agitation is not well understood and often not adequately treated. OBJECTIVE: This article determines the prevalence and associated factors of severe agitation in nursing home residents with dementia. METHODS: Secondary data analysis within an observational study in German nursing homes with n = 1,967 participants. We assessed severity of agitation with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) and defined the construct of agitation as a composite score of the NPI-Q items agitation/aggression, disinhibition, and irritability/lability; the dependent variable of severe agitation was considered as being present in residents who scored 'severe' in at least one of these symptoms. A binary logistic regression model was calculated to estimate associations. RESULTS: The prevalence of severe agitation was 6.3% (n = 124). The strongest associations were found for elation/euphoria (OR 7.6, CI 3.1-18.5), delusions (OR 7.3, CI 4.0-13.2), apathy/indifference (OR 2.8, CI 1.7-4.7), anxiety (OR 2.2, CI 1.2-3.8), nighttime behaviors (OR 2.4, CI 1.4-4.2), motor disturbances (OR 2.4, CI 1.4-4.1), and male sex (OR 2.4. CI 1.3-4.2). CONCLUSION: Severe agitation in nursing home residents with dementia is a relevant clinical issue as approximately 70% of residents have a dementia. Residents with elation/euphoria and delusions may have a stronger risk of showing severe agitation. We consider delusions as a possible cause of agitation and therefore a prelude to agitation. Although it might be possible that elation/euphoria follows from agitation, we hypothesize that the residents first experience elation/ euphoria and exhibit agitation afterwards.
