15250242|a|OBJECTIVE: To identify an interaction between the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene polymorphism and risk of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: The study included 117 healthy controls, 85 patients with Alzheimer's disease in a Northeastern Chinese population of Han nationality. Genotypes were determined by a polymerase chain reaction amplification of the intron 2 fragment, harbouring a variable number of short tandem nucleotide sequences. Amplification products were separated on a 2% agarose gel. RESULTS: The allele 2 frequency was 27% in healthy controls, and 21% in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Thus for allele 2 as well as for all other alleles, genotypes, or carriage rates, no significant differences compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: No association of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene polymorphism with Alzheimer's disease was identified in this population. It is also possible that the increased risk and disease modifying effects are caused by linkage disequilibrium with other genomic variants in other nearby genes.
