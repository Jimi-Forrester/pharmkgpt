38480559|t|A novel mouse model for N-terminal truncated Abeta2-x generation through meprin beta overexpression in astrocytes.
38480559|a|Neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides cause neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients' brains. They are released upon proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) extracellularly at the beta-secretase site and intramembranously at the gamma-secretase site. Several AD mouse models were developed to conduct respective research in vivo. Most of these classical models overexpress human APP with mutations driving AD-associated pathogenic APP processing. However, the resulting pattern of Abeta species in the mouse brains differs from those observed in AD patients' brains. Particularly mutations proximal to the beta-secretase cleavage site (e.g., the so-called Swedish APP (APPswe) fostering Abeta1-x formation) lead to artificial Abeta production, as N-terminally truncated Abeta peptides are hardly present in these mouse brains. Meprin beta is an alternative beta-secretase upregulated in brains of AD patients and capable of generating N-terminally truncated Abeta2-x peptides. Therefore, we aimed to generate a mouse model for the production of so far underestimated Abeta2-x peptides by conditionally overexpressing meprin beta in astrocytes. We chose astrocytes as meprin beta was detected in this cell type in close proximity to Abeta plaques in AD patients' brains. The meprin beta-overexpressing mice showed elevated amyloidogenic APP processing detected with a newly generated neo-epitope-specific antibody. Furthermore, we observed elevated Abeta production from endogenous APP as well as AD-related behavior changes (hyperlocomotion and deficits in spatial memory). The novel mouse model as well as the established tools and methods will be helpful to further characterize APP cleavage and the impact of different Abeta species in future studies.
