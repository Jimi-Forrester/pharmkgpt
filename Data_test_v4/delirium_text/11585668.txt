11585668|t|Mouse models of human diseases: what can we learn?
11585668|a|Heightened interest in disease models is one very clear outcome of the Human Genome Project. Teams are now racing to identify the genes that cause disease, enabling the study of their function in mouse models for subsequent research into prevention and therapy. The simultaneous evolution of gene knockout and mutation technology in mice has provided the prime opportunity to facilitate the elucidation of genetic etiology of inherited disorders in humans. In this online supplement, leading scientists review such work by disease type, from Alzheimer's disease to DiGeorge syndrome. This valuable collection provides readers with timely, comprehensive reviews of mouse knockout and mutation research, including focus on single candidate gene knockouts to complex transgenics. We hope that you will find this supplement enjoyable and informative reading.
