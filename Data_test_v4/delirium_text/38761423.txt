38761423|t|E3 ligases and DUBs target ferroptosis: A potential therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.
38761423|a|Ferroptosis is a form of cell death mediated by iron and lipid peroxidation (LPO). Recent studies have provided compelling evidence to support the involvement of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that regulate ferroptosis in NDDs may improve disease management. Ferroptosis is regulated by multiple mechanisms, and different degradation pathways, including autophagy and the ubiquitinproteasome system (UPS), orchestrate the complex ferroptosis response by directly or indirectly regulating iron accumulation or lipid peroxidation. Ubiquitination plays a crucial role as a protein posttranslational modification in driving ferroptosis. Notably, E3 ubiquitin ligases (E3s) and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are key enzymes in the ubiquitin system, and their dysregulation is closely linked to the progression of NDDs. A growing body of evidence highlights the role of ubiquitin system enzymes in regulating ferroptosis sensitivity. However, reports on the interaction between ferroptosis and ubiquitin signaling in NDDs are scarce. In this review, we first provide a brief overview of the biological processes and roles of the UPS, summarize the core molecular mechanisms and potential biological functions of ferroptosis, and explore the pathophysiological relevance and therapeutic implications of ferroptosis in NDDs. In addition, reviewing the roles of E3s and DUBs in regulating ferroptosis in NDDs aims to provide new insights and strategies for the treatment of NDDs. These include E3- and DUB-targeted drugs and ferroptosis inhibitors, which can be used to prevent and ameliorate the progression of NDDs.
