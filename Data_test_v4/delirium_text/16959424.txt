16959424|t|APP23 mice display working memory impairment in the plus-shaped water maze.
16959424|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients typically present short-term memory deficits, before long-term memory capacity declines with disease progression. Several studies have described learning and memory deficits in the APP23 mouse model. Our group reported a decline of learning and memory capacities from the age of 3 months onwards using a hidden-platform Morris water maze (MWM). The aim of the present study was to evaluate working and reference memory in APP23 mice in the same plus-shaped water maze. The transgenic mice had slower learning curves; however, consolidation of the learned information appeared intact in this learning paradigm. This report demonstrates impairment of working memory in this transgenic Alzheimer model.
