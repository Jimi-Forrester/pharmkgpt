39563882|t|Anthrax meningoencephalitis: A case report.
39563882|a|The present study describes the case of a patient with anthrax meningoencephalitis with the aim of providing a scientific basis for the control of this disease. The cerebrospinal fluid and blood of the patient were tested for genes and Bacillus anthracis was detected. The patient's meningitis was cured following treatment. Tracing the route of infection, anthrax was detected on the chopping board of the rural cattle and sheep butcher shop where the patient had purchased meat. In 2018, the patient complained of intermittent nasal discharge for 11 days after brain injury and came to the Second People's Hospital of Liaocheng (Linqing, China). Considering the existence of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, the patient's cerebrospinal fluid biochemistry was assessed and showed low sugar and high protein levels, resulting in a diagnosis of bacterial encephalitis. This encephalitis was considered to be related to bacterial retrograde infection after cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea. It is required to strengthen the training of medical personnel according to guidelines and laws and improve the level of early detection, reporting and diagnosis, as well as timely treatment at medical institutions. There is an urgent need to intensify the education of the population regarding the awareness and prevention of the disease. For individuals involved in the breeding, slaughtering and processing of livestock, multiple measures need to be taken to comprehensively intervene and to enhance occupational protection awareness and disease prevention capabilities.
