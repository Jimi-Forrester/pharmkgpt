31623217|t|Outcomes of Total Hip Arthroplasty in Patients with Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head Following Surgical Treatment of Brain Tumors.
31623217|a|Corticosteroids have been widely used in patients with brain tumors to reduce tumor-associated edema and neurological deficits. This study examined the outcomes of total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) following brain tumor surgery. We identified 34 THAs performed in 26 patients with steroid-induced ONFH among 9254 patients undergoing surgical treatment for primary brain tumors. After propensity score matching with demographics, 68 THAs (52 patients) in ONFH unrelated to brain tumors were selected as the control group. At the time of THA, 54% of brain tumor patients had neurological sequelae and 46% had adrenal insufficiency. After THA, patients with brain tumor required longer hospital stay, reported a lower functional score, and showed a higher rate of heterotopic ossification compared to the control group. However, hip pain score improved significantly after THA in the brain tumor group, and did not differ from that of the control group (P-value = 0.168). Major complication rates were similar (2.9% and 1.5% for the brain tumor and control groups, respectively; P-value = 1.000), and implant survivorships were not different at 7 years (100% and 98.1% for the brain tumor and control groups, respectively; P-value = 0.455). Our findings suggest that THA can be safely performed to reduce hip pain in patients with steroid-induced ONFH after surgical treatment of primary brain tumors.
