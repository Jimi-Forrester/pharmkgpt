33029126|a|Compelling evidence from basic molecular biology has demonstrated the crucial role of microglia in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microglia were believed to play a dual role in both promoting and inhibiting Alzheimer's disease progression. It is of great significance to regulate the function of microglia and make them develop in a favorable way. In the present study, we investigated the function of repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST) in Abeta 1-42-induced BV-2 cell dysfunction. We concluded that Abeta 1-42 could promote type I activation of BV-2 cells and induce cell proliferation, migration, and proinflammation cytokine TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 expression. Meanwhile, REST was upregulated, and nuclear translocalization took place due to Abeta 1-42 stimulation. When REST was knocked down by a specific short hairpin RNA (sh-RNA), BV-2 cell proliferation, migration, and proinflammation cytokine expression and secretion induced by Abeta 1-42 were increased, demonstrating that REST may act as a repressor of microglia-like BV-2 cell activation.
