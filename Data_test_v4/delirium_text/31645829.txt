31645829|t|Rhabdomyolysis in Intensive Care Unit: More than One Cause.
31645829|a|Rhabdomyolysis is a serious medical condition, encountered in the intensive care unit (ICU). The etiology of rhabdomyolysis is often multifactorial. It leads to complications like acute kidney injury and life-threatening electrolyte abnormalities. A high index of suspicion and early institution of therapy is required to prevent complications and improve patient outcomes. Herein, we present the case of a young man with alcohol dependence who presented with fever and altered sensorium. He was found to have rhabdomyolysis and was managed successfully. We also discuss the common causes of rhabdomyolysis and a bedside approach to its management in the ICU. How to cite this article: Saxena P, Dhooria S, Agarwal R, Prasad KT, Sehgal IS.
