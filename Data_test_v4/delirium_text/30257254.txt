30257254|a|BACKGROUND: This study examines the efficacy of using quantitative measurements of motor dysfunction, compared to clinical ratings, in Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 49 patients with a diagnosis of AD (n = 17), FTD (n = 19), or DLB (n = 13) were included and underwent cognitive testing, clinical motor evaluation, and quantitative motor tests: pronation/supination hand tapping, grasping and lifting, and finger and foot tapping. RESULTS: Our results revealed significantly higher Q-Motor values in pronation/supination and in grip lift force assessment in AD, FTD, and DLB compared to healthy controls (HC). Q-Motor values detected significant differences between AD and HC, while clinical ratings did not. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that quantitative measurements provide more objective and sensitive measurements of motor dysfunction in dementia.
