23210053|a|Symptoms of deep cerebral vein thrombosis (DCVT) are variable and nonspecific. Radiologic findings are essential for the diagnoses. In the majority of cases of deep internal cerebral venous thrombosis, the thalamus is affected bilaterally, and venous hypertension by thrombosis causes parenchymal edema or venous infarction and may sometimes cause venous hemorrhage. Intravenous injections of mannitol can be administered or decompressive craniectomy can be performed for reduction of intracranial pressure. The objectives of antithrombotic treatment in DCVT include recanalization of the sinus or vein, and prevention of propagation of the thrombus. Herein, the authors report DCVT which was successfully treated by low molecular weight heparin.
