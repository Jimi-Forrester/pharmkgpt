35567203|t|Biological Activities of Some Isoquinoline Alkaloids from Fumaria schleicheri Soy. Will.
35567203|a|Fumaria schleicheri Soy. Will. is a species belonging to the Papaveraceae family, being widespread in East-Central and Southern Europe. As with numerous other species of the genus, it is used in traditional medicine for the treatment of hepatobiliary and digestive disorders. The aim of the present study consisted of the evaluation of its alkaloid content and the assessment of its in vitro antioxidant, anti-cholinesterase and cytotoxic potential. Total alkaloid content in the composition of the species was quantified by a spectrophotometrical method and they were individually identified and quantified by HPLC-DAD. The antioxidant capacity was investigated by the DPPH and FRAP methods, while the anti-cholinesterase activity was assessed by an adapted Ellman's method. The in vitro cytotoxic activity was evaluated on BJ human fibroblasts and DLD-1 human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines. Results showed the presence of bicuculline, protopine, chelidonine, stylopine and sanguinarine, among which bicuculline, protopine, stylopine and sanguinarine were quantified, while the antioxidant and anti-cholinesterase assays showed valuable potentials. No cytotoxic effect was observed on BJ cell lines and selective cytotoxicity was expressed towards tumoral cells. In this context, F. schleicheri appears as an important medicinal species with significant potential of substitution with the officinal species.
