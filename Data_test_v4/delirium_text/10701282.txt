10701282|t|Acute confusion assessment instruments: clinical versus research usability.
10701282|a|Acute confusion (AC), also referred to as delirium (AC/delirium), is a common problem seen by health professionals who work in a variety of care settings. This is an evaluative report on the clinical usability of instruments to assess AC/delirium as a part of nursing practice. Specifically, five instruments [the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), Delirium Rating Scale (DRS), Delirium Symptom Inventory (DSI), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Neelon/Champagne (NEECHAM) Confusion Scale] are discussed. The work demonstrates how the cooperation of nurses in practice, education, and research can improve both patient and staff outcomes.
