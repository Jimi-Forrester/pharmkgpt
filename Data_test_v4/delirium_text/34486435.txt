34486435|t|Evaluation of the Impact of Prior-to-Admission Sleep Aid Prescribing Practices on Sleep and Delirium in the Intensive Care Unit.
34486435|a|BACKGROUND: Sleep disruptions in the intensive care unit (ICU) may lead to complications such as delirium. There is limited evidence addressing how sleep aid use before and during ICU admission affects outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of prior-to-admission sleep aid prescribing practices in the ICU on delirium and sleep outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of adult patients admitted to any ICU from January to June 2018 receiving a sleep aid prior to admission. Patients were categorized based on sleep aid continuation, discontinuation, or alteration during the ICU admission. The primary end point was the incidence of delirium. Secondary end points included the incidence of sleep-wake cycle disturbances, delirium scores, and ICU length of stay. RESULTS: A total of 291 patients were included with 109 in the continued group, 121 in the discontinued group, and 61 in the altered group. There was a similar incidence of delirium at 24 hours (P = 0.71), 48 hours (P = 0.60), 72 hours (P = 0.25), and 5 days (P = 0.48) after ICU admission. There was also no statistical difference in sleep-wake cycle disturbances or delirium scores at any time point. ICU length of stay was similar between the groups. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The incidence of delirium and sleep-wake cycle disturbances was not affected by differences in prior-to-admission sleep aid prescribing patterns during ICU admission.
