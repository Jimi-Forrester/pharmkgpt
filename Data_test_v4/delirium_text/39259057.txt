39259057|a|The underlying mechanism of postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly people remains unclear. Perioperative hyperglycemia (POHG) is an independent risk indicator for POD, particularly in the elderly. Under cerebral desaturation (hypoxia) during general anesthesia, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is neuroprotective during cerebral hypoxia via diverse pathways, like glucose metabolism and angiogenesis. Hyperglycemia can repress HIF expression and activity. On the other hand, POHG occurred among patients undergoing surgery. For surgical stress, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activation and sympathoadrenal activation may increase endogenous glucose production via gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Thus, under the setting of cerebral hypoxia during general anesthesia, we speculate that POHG prevents HIF-1alpha levels and function in the brain of aged patients, thus exacerbating the hypoxic response of HIF-1 and potentially contributing to POD. This paper sketches the underlying mechanisms of HIF in POD in elderly patients and offers novel insights into targets for preventing or treating POD in the same way as POHG.
