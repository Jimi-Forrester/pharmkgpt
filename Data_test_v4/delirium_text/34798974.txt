34798974|t|Approach to Altered Mental Status and Inpatient Delirium.
34798974|a|Altered mental status is a nonspecific diagnosis that encompasses a wide spectrum of disease and is frequently cited as a reason for both hospital admission and inpatient neurologic consultation. There are numerous etiologies of altered mental status, and so although many are facile with the workup of this potentially life-threatening entity, it can nevertheless be overwhelming. Our goal was to provide a practical framework embedded in a current, comprehensive review of the epidemiology, clinical evaluation, and management of undifferentiated altered mental status. We pay particular attention to the management of a critical yet underdiagnosed subtype of altered mental status: delirium.
