16908972|a|BACKGROUND: Psychosis frequently occurs in Alzheimer's disease (AD), being associated with more severe cognitive decline, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of centrally administered beta-amyloid peptide, a model for AD, in the locomotor response to amphetamine, caffeine and MK-801, which are psychoactive drugs related to neurochemical changes occurring in psychosis. METHODS: Mice were intracerebroventricularly injected with beta-amyloid (25-35), and after 1 week they were tested in the passive avoidance, spontaneous alternation and locomotor tasks. RESULTS: Besides impaired performance in inhibitory avoidance and spontaneous alternation tasks, beta-amyloid-treated mice showed increased spontaneous locomotion, augmented response to amphetamine (1.5 mg/kg), blunted response to caffeine (30 mg/kg) and no difference in MK-801 (0.25 mg/kg)-induced locomotor activation when compared to its respective control. CONCLUSION: These results are compatible with the hypothesis that beta-amyloid peptide may predispose to psychotic symptoms of AD by increasing sensitivity of the dopaminergic system, possibly related to a decreased adenosinergic inhibitory tone.
