34943497|a|(1) Background: Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) is preferred over open prostatectomy because it offers superior surgical outcomes and better postoperative recovery. The steep Trendelenburg position and pneumoperitoneum required in Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, however, increase intracranial pressure (ICP). The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of elevated ICP on the quality of emergence from anesthesia. (2) Methods: Sixty-seven patients undergoing RALP were enrolled. We measured optic nerve sheath diameter at four timepoints during surgery. Primary outcome was inadequate emergence in the operating room (OR). Secondary outcomes were postoperative neurologic deficits of dizziness, headache, delirium, cognitive dysfunction, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). (3) Results: A total of 69 patients were screened for eligibility and 67 patients completed the study and were included in the final analysis. After establishing pneumoperitoneum with the Trendelenburg position, ONSD increased compared to baseline by 11.4%. Of the 67 patients, 36 patients showed an increase of 10% or more in optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD). Patients with DeltaONSD >= 10% experienced more inadequate emergence in the OR than those with DeltaONSD < 10% (47.2% vs. 12.9%, p = 0.003). However, other variables related to the quality of emergence from anesthesia did not different significantly between groups. Similarly, neurologic deficits, and PONV during postoperative day 3 showed no significant differences. (4) Conclusions: ICP elevation detected by ultrasonographic ONSD measurement was associated with a transient, inadequate emergence from anesthesia.
