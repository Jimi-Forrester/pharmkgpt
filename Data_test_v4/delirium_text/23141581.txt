Comparison was made between 10 female 11-month-old APP/PS1 double transgenic mice with Alzheimer's disease (model group) and 10 non-transgenic female mice of the same background and age (control group). Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) was retrograde labeled by injecting horse radish peroxidase (HRP) into the bilateral optic nerve layer of the superior colliculus of two groups. After 48 hours, all mice were perfused sacrificed. The brains were frozen, mode slices, stained with methyl-alcohol-Congo. The retina peeled from right eye was conducted HRP histochemistry reaction to count RGC by computerized image analyzer. The left eyes were treated with paraffin-embedded, mode slices, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to count the neuron numbers of each retina layers. The neuron numbers of each retina layer for control group and model group were statistically analyzed using t test for independent samples. RESULTS: The brains showed positive in the model group and the brains showed negative in the control group after stained with methyl-alcohol-Congo. By counting retinal ganglion cells traced with HRP, the number of RGC was statistical different between two groups at 112.78 +- 7.70 within per field for the control group against 78.72 +- 11.35 within per field for the model group. The RGC of the model group was comparatively much less than the control group (t = 27.28, P < 0.01). By counting cells of retina stained with HE, the number of inner and outer nuclear layer cells were not statistical different between two groups of each layer (P > 0.05), the number of RGC in the control group and the model group were respectively 8.17 +- 1.17 within per field, 5.17 +- 0.75 within per field. The cells in retinal ganglion layer in the model group were significantly reduced (t = 52.88, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The results imply that the number of RGC reduced in 11-month-old APP/PS1 double transgenic mice with Alzheimer's disease.
