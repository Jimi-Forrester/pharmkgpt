14769361|a|Several molecules are known to be closely associated with amyloid deposits in human brain. Among these, apolipoproteins such as apolipoproteins E (apo E) and J (apo J) have been found in two neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA): senile plaques (SPs) and cerebrovascular amyloid. These apolipoproteins may be implicated in amyloid fibrillogenesis. Apo D is a multiligand-multifunctional glycoprotein present in SPs, as we previously reported. The aim of this work is to study the link between immunolocalization of apo E and apo D in AD and CAA brains. Both apolipoproteins were found in all types of SPs, but apo E was observed more often than apo D in mature plaques. Whereas apo E is always located overlapping the amyloid core, apo D seems to situate preferably around and near the amyloid. Immunohistochemistry revealed that these apolipoproteins behave differently in cerebral vessels. Apo E labeling in vessels appears mainly linked to amyloid deposits, whereas apo D shows a distribution almost opposite to that of apo E. This could be an indication of the different roles that each apolipoprotein plays in the pathogenesis of amyloid deposition.
