35970046|a|Increasing evidence suggests incomplete recovery of COVID-19 patients, who continue to suffer from cardiovascular diseases, including cerebral vascular disorders (CVD) and neurological symptoms. Recent findings indicate that some of the damaging effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, especially in the brain, may be induced by the spike protein, leading to the disruption of the initial blood-brain barrier (BBB). SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and animals exhibit age-dependent pathogenesis. In this study, we identified endothelial BACE1 as a critical mediator of BBB disruption and cellular senescence induced by the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 subunit protein. Increased BACE1 in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMVEC) decreases the levels of tight junction proteins, including ZO-1, occludin, and claudins. Moreover, BACE1 overexpression leads to the accumulation of p16 and p21, typical hallmarks of cellular senescence. Our findings show that the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 subunit protein upregulated BACE1 expression in HBMVECs, causing endothelial leakage. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 subunit protein induced p16 and p21 expression, indicating BACE1-mediated cellular senescence, confirmed by beta-Gal staining in HBMVECs. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that BACE1-mediated endothelial cell damage and senescence may be linked to CVD after COVID-19 infection.
