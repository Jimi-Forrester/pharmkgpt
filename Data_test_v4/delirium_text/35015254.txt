35015254|a|Antibody drugs that target amyloid beta (Abeta) are considered possible treatments for Alzheimer's disease; however, most have been dropped from clinical trials. We hypothesized that administration route for antiAbeta antibody (AntiAbeta) might affect its therapeutic potential and thus compared delivery of antibodies to the brain and their effect on cognitive dysfunction and amyloid disposition via intravenous (i.v.) and intranasal routes with and without the cell-penetrating peptide, L-penetratin. We demonstrated that intranasal administration with L-penetratin more efficiently delivered human immunoglobulin G (IgG), a model molecule for AntiAbeta, to the brain compared with i.v. injection. We found that multiple intranasal treatments with Alexa 594-labeled AntiAbeta (A594-AntiAbeta) with L-penetratin significantly improved learning by mice with aged amyloid precursor protein (APP) knock-in (App KI mice). Further, intranasal administration of A594-AntiAbeta increased the amount of soluble Abeta (1-42) in the brain, suggesting suppression of Abeta aggregation in insoluble form and involvement of activated microglia in Abeta clearance. Thus, administration route may be critical for efficient delivery of AntiAbeta to the brain, and the nose-to-brain delivery with L-penetratin can maximize its therapeutic efficacy.
