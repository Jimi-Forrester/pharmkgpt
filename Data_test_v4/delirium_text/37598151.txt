37598151|a|BACKGROUND: The application of artificial intelligence patient-controlled analgesia (AI-PCA) facilitates the remote monitoring of analgesia management, the implementation of mobile ward rounds, and the automatic recording of all types of key data in the clinical setting. However, it cannot quantify the quality of postoperative analgesia management. This study aimed to establish an index (analgesia quality index (AQI)) to re-monitor and re-evaluate the system, equipment, medical staff and degree of patient matching to quantify the quality of postoperative pain management through machine learning. METHODS: Utilizing the wireless analgesic pump system database of the Cancer Hospital Affiliated with Nantong University, this retrospective observational study recruited consecutive patients who underwent postoperative analgesia using AI-PCA from June 1, 2014, to August 31, 2021. All patients were grouped according to whether or not the AQI was used to guide the management of postoperative analgesia: The control group did not receive the AQI guidance for postoperative analgesia and the experimental group received the AQI guidance for postoperative analgesia. The primary outcome was the incidence of moderate-to-severe pain (numeric rating scale (NRS) score >= 4) and the second outcome was the incidence of total adverse reactions. Furthermore, indicators of AQI were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 14,747 patients were included in this current study. The incidence of moderate-to-severe pain was 26.3% in the control group and 21.7% in the experimental group. The estimated ratio difference was 4.6% between the two groups (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.2% to 6.0%; P < 0.001). There were significant differences between groups. Otherwise, the differences in the incidence of total adverse reactions between the two groups were nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the traditional management of postoperative analgesia, application of the AQI decreased the incidence of moderate-to-severe pain. Clinical application of the AQI contributes to improving the quality of postoperative analgesia management and may provide guidance for optimum pain management in the postoperative setting.
