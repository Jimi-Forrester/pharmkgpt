19570148|a|AIMS: In this study, the appearance and distribution of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in diffuse neurofibrillary tangles with calcification (DNTC) were investigated neuropathologically in order to elucidate the detailed distribution pattern in this disease. METHODS: The distribution of NFT in six cases neuropathologically diagnosed as DNTC (two men and four women) was studied using Gallyas-Braak silver stain. The age at death ranged from 56 to 73, with an average of 63.5 +/- 7.5 years. RESULTS: NFT were seen throughout the cerebral cortex, and were especially marked in the temporal and limbic cortices. The distribution pattern of NFT in the limbic lobe was similar to that in Alzheimer's disease as reported in the previous studies. In the temporal lobe, more NFT were distributed in the anterior than in the posterior area, which was confirmed in all six cases. The temporal pole showed the highest density of NFT including ghost tangles. CONCLUSIONS: The diffuse appearance of NFT in the cerebral cortex with the highest severity in the temporal pole was found to be a neuropathological characteristic of DNTC.
