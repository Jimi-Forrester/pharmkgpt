29165985|t|Nanoscale Dynamics of Amyloid beta-42 Oligomers As Revealed by High-Speed Atomic Force Microscopy.
29165985|a|Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) oligomers are emerging as potent neurotoxic species in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Detailed characterization of oligomer structure and dynamics is necessary to develop oligomer-specific therapeutic agents. However, oligomers exist transiently, which complicates their structural analysis. One approach to mitigate these problems has been photochemical cross-linking of native oligomers. In these states, the oligomers can be isolated and purified for physical and chemical studies. Here we characterized the structure of isolated cross-linked Abeta42 trimers, pentamers, and heptamers with atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging and probed their dynamics in solution using time-lapse high-speed AFM. This technique enables visualization of the structural dynamics of the oligomers at nanometer resolution on a millisecond time scale. Results demonstrate that cross-linked pentamers and heptamers are very dynamic fluctuating between a compact single-globular and multiglobular assemblies. Trimers remain in their single-globular geometry that elongates adopting an ellipsoidal shape. Biological significance of oligomers dynamics is discussed.
