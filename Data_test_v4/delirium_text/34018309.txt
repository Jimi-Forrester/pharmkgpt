34018309|t|MiR-193b deregulation is associated with Parkinson's disease.
34018309|a|PGC-1alpha/FNDC5/BDNF has found to be a critical pathway in neurodegeneration. MicroRNAs (miR(NA)s) are non-coding regulatory RNAs whose dysregulation has been observed in multiple neurological disorders, and miRNA-mediated gene deregulation plays a decisive role in PD. Here, candidate miRNA was chosen based on the literature survey and in silico studies. Chronic and acute models of PD were created using MPP+-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Twenty PD patients and 20 healthy volunteers were recruited. RT-qPCR was performed to assess the expression of miRNA and genes. Severe mitochondrial dysfunction induced by acute MPP+ treatment instigated compensatory mechanisms through enhancing expression of PGC-1alpha/FNDC5/BDNF pathway genes, while chronic MPP+ toxicity led to down-regulated levels of the genes in SH-SY5Y cells. PD peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) also showed decreased expression of target genes. There were significant changes in the level of miR-193b in both models, as well as PD PBMCs. Moreover, miR-193b overexpression significantly affected PGC-1alpha, FNDC5 and TFAM levels. Interestingly, down-regulations of PGC-1alpha, FNDC5, BDNF and TFAM were inversely correlated with miR-193b up-regulation in PD PBMCs. This study showed the deregulation of PGC-1alpha/FNDC5/BDNF pathway in PD models and PBMCs, verifying its importance in neurodegeneration. Our findings also revealed that miR-193b functions in PD development, possibly through regulating PGC-1alpha/FNDC5/BDNF pathway, suggesting miR-193b as a potential biomarker for PD diagnosis.
