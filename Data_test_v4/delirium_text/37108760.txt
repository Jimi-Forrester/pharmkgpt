37108760|t|Antiepileptic Properties of Scyllo-Inositol on Pentylenetetrazol-Induced Seizures.
37108760|a|Epilepsy, with about 70 million affected people worldwide, is one of the biggest challenges of medicine today. It is estimated that about one-third of epileptic patients receive inadequate treatment. Inositols have proved effective in many disorders; hence, in the current study, we tested potential antiepileptic properties of scyllo-inositol (SCI)-one of the most common commercially available inositols-in zebrafish larvae with pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. First, we studied the general effect of SCI on zebrafish motility, and then we tested SCI antiepileptic properties over short (1 h) and long (120 h) exposure protocols. Our results demonstrated that SCI alone does not reduce zebrafish motility regardless of the dose. We also observed that short-term exposure to SCI groups reduced PTZ-treated larva motility compared to controls (p < 0.05). In contrast, prolonged exposure did not produce similar results, likely due to the insufficient concentration of SCI given. Our results highlight the potential of SCI use in epilepsy treatment and warrant further clinical studies with inositols as potential seizure-reducing drugs.
