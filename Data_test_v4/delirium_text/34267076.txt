34267076|t|Functional outcomes following critical illness: epidemiology, current management strategies and the future priorities.
34267076|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Intensive care unit (ICU) survivorship has gained significant attention over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we summarize the contemporary literature in relation to the epidemiology and management of post-ICU problems. RECENT FINDINGS: Survivors of critical illness can have complex physical, social, emotional and cognitive needs in the months following hospital discharge. Emerging evidence has shown that pre-ICU characteristics such as educational attainment, alongside in-ICU factors such as delirium, may contribute to worsening outcomes. Evidence regarding the impact of post-ICU recovery services is evolving, but models such as post-ICU clinics and peer support programs are gaining rapid momentum. SUMMARY: Future research should focus on modifiable risk factors and how identification and treatment of these can improve outcomes. Furthermore, rigorous evaluation of postacute critical care recovery services is necessary.
