37256004|a|Purpose: This study investigated the effects of an interactive multitouch game-based cognitive intervention (ICI) on cognitive function in community-dwelling older adults. Methods: Thirty-two older adults (19 women) between 65 and 84 years of age (mean age, 74.47 +- 4.30 years) without a history of neurological disease participated. They were randomized into two groups: intervention and control. The intervention group took part in ICI sessions using HAPPYTABLE  (Spring Soft Co. Ltd, Seoul, Korea) (ICI group), and the control group underwent a traditional paper-and-pencil-based cognitive intervention (TCI group). Both groups completed 10 intervention sessions over four consecutive weeks. Cognitive function was assessed before (pre-intervention) and after (post-intervention) intervention. Executive function was evaluated through the Color-Word Stroop Test (CWST) and Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT). Memory was assessed through the Verbal Learning Test (VLT) and Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT). Results: The ICI and TCI groups showed significant improvements in some cognitive functions after the intervention. Both groups showed substantial improvements in VLT and RCFT (P < 0.05), reflecting memory function. Regarding the executive role, the ICI group showed significant post-intervention improvements in the conditions of the CWST incongruent (ICI 76.31 +- 23.82; P = 0.004) compared to the pre-intervention scores. ANCOVA with pre-intervention scores and gender as covariates revealed improved results in the ICI group compared with the VLT delayed (ICI 9.18 +- 1.68, TCI 7.56 +- 2.13; P = 0.015) and VLT recognition task (ICI 22.81 +- 1.22, TCI 21.38 +- 1.09; P = 0.035). Conclusions: These findings revealed that both ICI and TCI helped increase cognitive performance in community-dwelling older persons; nevertheless, ICI showed better improvement in memory function than TCI. Thus, the ICI can be used to improve cognitive performance among older adults living in the community.
