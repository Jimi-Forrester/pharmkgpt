38982148|t|Antidepressant drug use after intensive care: a nationwide cohort study.
38982148|a|Modern intensive care has improved survival rates, but emerging evidence suggests a high prevalence of post-intensive care unit (ICU) health problems, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety. These symptoms may have a detrimental effect on quality of life and increase mortality. The primary objective of this study is to examine the extent of initiation of antidepressant medication among ICU survivors and identify the factors associated with its usage. The secondary objective is to investigate whether the use of these medications is linked to an increased mortality. The nationwide study cohort included 125,130 ICU survivors admitted between 2010 and 2017. Within the first 3 months after ICU discharge, 7% of patients initiated antidepressant medication, by 1 year 15.5% had started medication. We found no tendency to a decrease during the 2-year follow-up period. Factors associated with antidepressant use included middle age, female sex, psychiatric and somatic comorbid conditions, substance dependence, higher illness severity, and longer ICU stay. Antidepressant users had a higher mortality rate, and deaths due to external causes and suicide were more frequent in this group. This study emphasizes the importance of detecting and addressing depression in ICU survivors to improve their quality of life and reduce mortality rates.
