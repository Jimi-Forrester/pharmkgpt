38658886|a|BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in females worldwide. During disease development, breast cancer patients suffer anxious and depressed, which may lead to worse quality of life or even higher mortality. Esketamine has been regarded as an antidepressant in breast cancer patients with mild or moderate depression. Here, we wonder whether the administration of esketamine could reduce the postoperative depressive symptom score of breast cancer patients who have no preoperative depression. METHODS: A total of 64 patients treated with unilateral modified radical mastectomy were randomly divided into an experimental group (esketamine group, Group E) and a control group (Group C), with 32 cases in each one. After anesthesia induction, Group C received 0.2 ml/kg of normal saline intravenously and Group E was administered 0.2 mg/kg intravenous esketamine. The primary outcome was the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores. The secondary outcomes included the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores for pain, inflammatory markers, perioperative-related indicators, and the incidence of postoperative delirium, nausea and vomiting. RESULTS: The PHQ-9 score on postoperative day (POD) 1 in Group E declined from the preoperative level, while the score in Group C was higher than before, and the former was far lower than the latter (P = 0.047). There is no statistically significant difference in PHQ-9 scores between Group E and Group C on POD 3, 7, and 30. Moreover, the postoperative leukocyte level of Group E was higher than that of Group C, and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.030). CONCLUSIONS: A single subanesthetic dose of esketamine can result in lower postoperative score on subthreshold depressive symptoms compared to the Group C on POD 1, without increasing the occurrence of postoperative adverse reactions.
