7535938|t|The utility of salivary amylase as an evaluation of M3 muscarinic agonist activity in Alzheimer's disease.
7535938|a|1. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I study of the safety/tolerance of two doses of xanomeline tartrate (100 mg and 115 mg tid) given to 12 AD patients, the authors measured serum amylase, fractionated into pancreatic and salivary isoenzymes, as a potential marker for M3 activity associated with maximally tolerated dose (MTD). 2. MTD of xanomeline was determined to be 100 mg tid based on intolerable adverse events at 115 mg tid. One patient at the 115 mg tid level presented with moderate hypersalivation and salivary amylase levels 400% of baseline. 3. Overall amylase results were not significant, however a trend in the results for salivary amylase in the 115 mg panel suggests that salivary amylase may be a useful marker for M3 activity.
