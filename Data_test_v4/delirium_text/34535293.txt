34535293|t|Neuroleptic malignant syndrome in a postoperative patient: a case report.
34535293|a|Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare medical emergency associated with the use of antipsychotics and other antidopaminergic drugs. There is no specific test, and diagnosis is based on high clinical suspicion and good differential diagnosis. A clinical picture consistent with hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, altered level of consciousness, together with signs of rhabdomyolysis in analytical studies and a history of taking neuroleptic drugs are the key elements in the detection of this entity. Due to its low incidence and potential mortality, it is essential to publish case reports of neuroleptic malignant syndrome in order to raise awareness of this entity and facilitate diagnostic suspicion when encountering a patient with compatible symptoms. The following is the case of a 79 year old patient with chronic alcohol consumption as the only history of interest, who was given a single dose of haloperidol after an episode of delirium in the postoperative period of conventional trauma surgery. She subsequently developed a picture of progressive deterioration of the level of consciousness, diaphoresis, generalized muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, together with severe metabolic acidosis, hyperlacticaemia, rhabdomyolysis, hypertransaminasemia and hypocalcemia. After ruling out other entities compatible with the clinical picture, neuroleptic malignant syndrome was given as the main diagnostic hypothesis. Diagnosis was confirmed after clinical and analytical improvement following treatment with dantrolene. The patient was discharged from hospital with no sequelae a few days after onset of the condition.
