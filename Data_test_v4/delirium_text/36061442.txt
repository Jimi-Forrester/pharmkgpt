36061442|a|Central nervous system (CNS) diseases have been a growing threat to the health of humanity, emphasizing the urgent need of exploring the pathogenesis and therapeutic approaches of various CNS diseases. Primary neurons are directly obtained from animals or humans, which have wide applications including disease modeling, mechanism exploration and drug development. However, traditional two-dimensional (2D) monoculture cannot resemble the native microenvironment of CNS. With the increasing understanding of the complexity of the CNS and the remarkable development of novel biomaterials, in vitro models have experienced great innovation from 2D monoculture toward three-dimensional (3D) multicellular culture. The scope of this review includes the progress of various in vitro models of primary neurons in recent years to provide a holistic view of the modalities and applications of primary neuron models and how they have been connected with the revolution of biofabrication techniques. Special attention has been paid to the interaction between primary neurons and biomaterials. First, a brief introduction on the history of CNS modeling and primary neuron culture was conducted. Next, detailed progress in novel in vitro models were discussed ranging from 2D culture, ex vivo model, spheroid, scaffold-based model, 3D bioprinting model, and microfluidic chip. Modalities, applications, advantages, and limitations of the aforementioned models were described separately. Finally, we explored future prospects, providing new insights into how basic science research methodologies have advanced our understanding of the CNS, and highlighted some future directions of primary neuron culture in the next few decades.
