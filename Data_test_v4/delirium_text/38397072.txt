38397072|t|Changes in Cells Associated with Insulin Resistance.
38397072|a|Insulin is a polypeptide hormone synthesized and secreted by pancreatic beta-cells. It plays an important role as a metabolic hormone. Insulin influences the metabolism of glucose, regulating plasma glucose levels and stimulating glucose storage in organs such as the liver, muscles and adipose tissue. It is involved in fat metabolism, increasing the storage of triglycerides and decreasing lipolysis. Ketone body metabolism also depends on insulin action, as insulin reduces ketone body concentrations and influences protein metabolism. It increases nitrogen retention, facilitates the transport of amino acids into cells and increases the synthesis of proteins. Insulin also inhibits protein breakdown and is involved in cellular growth and proliferation. On the other hand, defects in the intracellular signaling pathways of insulin may cause several disturbances in human metabolism, resulting in several chronic diseases. Insulin resistance, also known as impaired insulin sensitivity, is due to the decreased reaction of insulin signaling for glucose levels, seen when glucose use in response to an adequate concentration of insulin is impaired. Insulin resistance may cause, for example, increased plasma insulin levels. That state, called hyperinsulinemia, impairs metabolic processes and is observed in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Hyperinsulinemia may increase the risk of initiation, progression and metastasis of several cancers and may cause poor cancer outcomes. Insulin resistance is a health problem worldwide; therefore, mechanisms of insulin resistance, causes and types of insulin resistance and strategies against insulin resistance are described in this review. Attention is also paid to factors that are associated with the development of insulin resistance, the main and characteristic symptoms of particular syndromes, plus other aspects of severe insulin resistance. This review mainly focuses on the description and analysis of changes in cells due to insulin resistance.
