36737349|t|A Descriptive Study of Treatment of Pain in Acute Care for Patients Living With Dementia.
36737349|a|BACKGROUND: During the hospital stay pain is very common among patients living with dementia. METHODS: Descriptive data was obtained from chart review and included age, gender, race, comorbidities and admitting diagnosis. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to describe pain among patients living with dementia, the use of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment, and to compare treatments among those with and without pain. DESIGN: This was a descriptive study using baseline data from the first 233 participants from the study "Testing the Implementation of Function Focused Care for Acute Care Using the Evidence Integration Triangle (FFC-AC-EIT)". PARTICIPANTS/SUBJECTS: The mean age of participants was 83 (SD=5) and the majority was female (65%) and White (67%) with evidence of dementia (based on a mean Saint Louis University Mental Status Test = 7.23, SD=5.85). RESULTS: Overall 98 (42%) participants had pain and 135 (58%) no pain. Only 14 (6%) participants received no nonpharmacologic or pharmacologic interventions for pain and five of these individuals had pain. The most frequently used pharmacologic intervention among all participants was acetaminophen (n = 121, 52%), then tramadol (n = 19, 8%). Comfort measures and general nonpharmacologic approaches were the most frequently used non-pharmacologic approaches, then physical activity and therapeutic communication. From admission to discharge, there was a trend towards a decrease in pain. There was more use of opioids, physical activity, and therapeutic communication in the no pain group versus the pain group. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of hospitalized medical patients living with dementia were treated for pain, but an ongoing focus is needed to assure optimal pain management for all patients.
