35842435|a|Plasmapheresis (PE) is an established form of therapeutic apheresis (TA). Purpose of this longitudinal prospective single center study was to investigate the effect of PE on albumin redox state (ARS), as infusion of commercial albumin during PE may alter albumin oxidation which has an impact on its functional properties and oxidative stress level. 43 subjects with autoimmune-mediated neurological disorders were included. 20 subjects in the experimental group received five treatments of PE. 13 subjects received five treatments of immunoadsorption and 10 subjects received no TA as controls. ARS was determined before and after TA and 12 days after the last TA by fractionating it into human mercaptalbumin (HMA), human non-mercaptalbumin 1 (HNA-1), and human non-mercaptalbumin 2 (HNA-2) by high-performance liquid chromatography. Irreversibly oxidised HNA-2 increased over the course of five PE treatments from 2.8% (IQR 1.3-3.7%) to 13.6% (IQR 10.9-15.9) (P < 0.01) and remained elevated 12 days after the last PE procedure (7.7% IQR 7.1-10.5, P < 0.05). The study showed for the first time that PE exerts a severe and long-lasting alteration on ARS indicating a new adverse effect of PE, that may influence oxidative stress level.
