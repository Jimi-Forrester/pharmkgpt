39704370|a|BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in elderly individuals is a transitional stage between normal cognition and dementia. Understanding the risk factors for MCI and identifying those at high risk are extremely important for the elderly population. AIM: To analyze the risk factors for MCI in the elderly population and construct a clinical prediction model. METHODS: Total 295 elderly individuals presenting with memory loss diagnosed at Wuxi People's Hospital between March 2021 and March 2024 were included. Comprehensive demographic, clinical, and serological data were collected for analysis. Participants were categorized into either an MCI group or a normal group based on their performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale. An elaborate clinical predictive model was developed to predict the likelihood of MCI in stroke patients; its accuracy was evaluated using area under curve values and calibration curves. RESULTS: The results of the study showed that old age, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, high-salt diet, high-cholesterol diet, decreased red blood count, increased neutrophil lymphocyte ratio and increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were risk factors for the onset of MCI, with A high vitamin diet and elevated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol being protective factors. In addition, the prediction model constructed in this study exhibits good degrees of differentiation and calibration. CONCLUSION: The risk factors for MCI are diverse. Early identification of individuals at high risk of MCI can better intervene and improve their quality of life of MCI patients.
