28749428|a|A large body of evidence in humans and preclinical models supports a role for the endocannabinoid system in the proper execution of motivated or goal-directed behaviors. Operant sensation seeking (OSS) is a task that uses varied sensory stimuli as a reinforcer to maintain operant responding in mice. The purpose of the studies in this report was to begin to explore the role of endocannabinoid signaling in OSS utilizing cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) knock out mice. Compared to wild type littermate controls, CB1R knock out mice exhibited significantly fewer active responses and earned significantly fewer reinforcers in fixed ratio and progressive ratio schedules. On the other hand, FAAH knock out mice exhibited increased active responses and earned more reinforcers than wild type littermates in fixed ratio but not progressive ratio schedules. These findings support the role of endocannabinoid signaling in motivated behaviors and also expand our understanding of the signaling processes involved in OSS.
