37666547|t|Development of a core outcome set for ventilation trials in neurocritical care patients with acute brain injury: protocol for a Delphi consensus study of international stakeholders.
37666547|a|INTRODUCTION: There is little consensus and high heterogeneity on the optimal set of relevant clinical outcomes in research studies regarding extubation in neurocritical care patients with brain injury undergoing mechanical ventilation. The aims of this study are to: (1) develop a core outcome set (COS) and (2) reach consensus on a hierarchical composite endpoint for such studies. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study will include a broadly representative, international panel of stakeholders with research and clinical expertise in this field and will involve four stages: (1) a scoping review to generate an initial list of outcomes represented in the literature, (2) an investigator meeting to review the outcomes for inclusion in the Delphi surveys, (3) four rounds of online Delphi consensus-building surveys and (4) online consensus meetings to finalise the COS and hierarchical composite endpoint. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study received ethical approval from the French Society of Anesthesia and Critical Care Medicine Institutional Review Board (SFAR CERAR-IRB 00010254-2023-029). The study results will be disseminated through communication to stakeholders, publication in a peer-reviewed journal, and presentations at conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: This study is registered with the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative.
