36506527|t|Mechanism of action of paclitaxel for treating glioblastoma based on single-cell RNA sequencing data and network pharmacology.
36506527|a|Paclitaxel is an herbal active ingredient used in clinical practice that shows anti-tumor effects. However, its biological activity, mechanism, and cancer cell-killing effects remain unknown. Information on the chemical gene interactions of paclitaxel was obtained from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, SwishTargetPrediction, Binding DB, and TargetNet databases. Gene expression data were obtained from the GSE4290 dataset. Differential gene analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and Gene Ontology analyses were performed. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed to evaluate disease pathway activation; weighted gene co-expression network analysis with diff analysis was used to identify disease-associated genes, analyze differential genes, and identify drug targets via protein-protein interactions. The Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) analysis of critical subgroup networks was conducted to identify essential genes affected by paclitaxel, assess crucial cluster gene expression differences in glioma versus standard samples, and perform receiver operator characteristic mapping. To evaluate the pharmacological targets and signaling pathways of paclitaxel in glioblastoma, the single-cell GSE148196 dataset was acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and preprocessed using Seurat software. Based on the single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset, 24 cell clusters were identified, along with marker genes for the two different cell types in each cluster. Correlation analysis revealed that the mechanism of paclitaxel treatment involves effects on neurons. Paclitaxel may affect glioblastoma by improving glucose metabolism and processes involved in modulating immune function in the body.
