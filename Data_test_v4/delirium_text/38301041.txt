38301041|t|GV1001 reduces neurodegeneration and prolongs lifespan in 3xTg-AD mouse model through anti-aging effects.
38301041|a|GV1001, which mimics the activity of human telomerase reverse transcriptase, protects neural cells from amyloid beta (Abeta) toxicity and other stressors through extra-telomeric function, as noted in our prior in vitro studies. As per a recent phase II clinical trial, it improves cognitive function in patients with moderate to severe dementia. However, the underlying protective mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of GV1001 on neurodegeneration, senescence, and survival in triple transgenic Alzheimer's disease (3xTg-AD) mice. GV1001 (1 mg/kg) was subcutaneously injected into old 3xTg-AD mice thrice a week until the endpoint for sacrifice, and survival was analysed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Prussian blue staining (PBS) were performed to evaluate entry of GV1001 entrance into the brain. Diverse molecular studies were performed to investigate the effect of GV1001 on neurodegeneration and cellular senescence in AD model mice, with a particular focus on BACE, amyloid beta1-42 (Abeta1-42), phosphorylated tau, volume of dentate gyrus, beta-galactosidase positive cells, telomere length, telomerase activity, and ageing-associated proteins. GV1001 crossed the blood-brain barrier, as confirmed by assessing the status of ferrocenecarboxylic acid-conjugated GV1001 using magnetic resonance imaging and PBS. GV1001 increased the survival of 3xTg-AD mice. It decreased BACE and Abeta1-42 levels, neurodegeneration (i.e., reduced CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus volume, decreased levels of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase positive cells, and increased telomere length and telomerase activity), and levels of ageing-associated proteins. We suggest that GV1001 exerts anti-ageing effects in 3xTg-AD mice by reducing neurodegeneration and senescence, which contributes to improved survival.
