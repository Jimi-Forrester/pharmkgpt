39083321|a|BACKGROUND: The relationship between noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and human diseases has been a hot topic of research, but the study of ncRNAs in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is still in its infancy. PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA), a small ncRNA that binds to the PIWI protein to maintain genome stability by silencing transposons, was widely studied in germ lines and stem cells. In recent years, piRNA has been shown to be involved in key events of multiple CVDs through various epigenetic modifications, revealing the potential value of piRNA as a new biomarker or therapeutic target. CONCLUSION: This review explores origin, degradation, function, mechanism and important role of piRNA in CVDs, and the promising therapeutic targets of piRNA were summarized. This review provide a new strategy for the treatment of CVDs and lay a theoretical foundation for future research. KEY POINTS: piRNA can be used as a potential therapeutic target and biomaker in CVDs. piRNA influences apoptosis, inflammation and angiogenesis by regulating epigenetic modificaions. Critical knowledge gaps remain in the unifying piRNA nomenclature and PIWI-independent function.
