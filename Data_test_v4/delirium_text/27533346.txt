27533346|a|Here, we investigated the possible role of the Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate oxidase NOX2-derived brain oxidative stress in a fatal case of cocaine-related neurotoxicity, associated to excited delirium syndrome. We detected a strong NOX2 immunoreactivity, mainly in cortical GABAergic neurons and astrocytes, with a minor presence in microglia, glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurons as well as a significant immunostaining for other markers of oxidative stress (8OhDG, HSP70, HSP90, and NF-kappaB) and apoptotic phenomena. These results support a crucial role of NOX2-derived brain oxidative stress in cocaine-induced brain dysfunctions and neurotoxicity.
