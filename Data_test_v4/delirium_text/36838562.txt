36838562|a|Levodopa (L-DOPA) is an essential drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Currently, L-DOPA can be produced by chemical synthesis and can also be found naturally in many herbs, especially Mucuna Pruriens (MP). According to clinical research, the MP extract containing L-DOPA for the treatment of Parkinson's disease could reduce side effects more than the synthetic one. Unfortunately, MP extracts can be easily degraded. Changes in physical and chemical properties such as the appearance (color, melt, solid lump) and the reduction of L-DOPA content in the extract were commonly observed. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an extraction procedure to stabilize the extract of L-DOPA. This study attempted to enhance the extraction process by modifying the traditional acidification approach using hydrochloric acid, citric acid, or ascorbic acid. According to the stability test results, using Phyllanthus emblica water (PEW) as a solvent improved the preservative properties more than other solvents. The color of the PEW-MP powder changed slightly after 12 months of accelerated storage, but the amount of L-DOPA remained the highest (73.55%). Moreover, L-DOPA was only detected in MP and PEW-MP, but not PEW alone (the HPTLC chromatogram at Rf 0.48 and the HPLC chromatogram at Rt 6.0 min). The chemical profiles of PEW and L-DOPA observed in the chromatograms indicated that they are independently separated. As a result, they can be applied to a quality control process. Therefore, PEW was proven to be a powerful solvent for L-DOPA herbal extract that could be readily used as a raw material for herbal products.
