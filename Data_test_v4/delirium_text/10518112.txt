10518112|a|We studied the expression of the mannose receptor (ManR) in rat microglial cells. Microglial cells are the central nervous system resident macrophages, key participants of the innate immune response. ManR is a differentiation marker and a relevant glycoprotein for the phagocytic and endocytic function of macrophages. Because there is evidence suggesting that ManR could mediate some of the nonenzymatic effects of acetilcholinesterase (AchE) and the enzyme seems to be involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we looked for ManR in microglia, evaluating the functionality of the receptor. We isolated microglial cells from the brain of 2-day-old neonatal rats. Microglial cells, identified by their specific staining with the lectin Griffonia simplicifolia, expressed ManR, being detected by immunocytochemistry, Western blot, and immunoprecipitation. Microglial ManR was downregulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and upregulated by dexamethasone, as described for peripheral macrophages. Microglial ManR was functional and able to internalize horseradish peroxidase (HRP), a known ManR ligand, in a mannan-inhibitable manner. The presence of a functional ManR in microglia opens the possibility that ManR could participate in multiple physiologic and pathologic conditions in the central nervous system (CNS), including inflammation, ischaemia, and neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.
