35566734|t|Predictors of Moderate or Severe Cognitive Impairment at Six Months of the Hip Fracture in the Surgical Patient over 65 Years of Age.
35566734|a|BACKGROUND: cognitive impairment is known to be very common in patients with hip fractures, but studies are needed to help understand the relationship between both events. Our goal was to determine the relationship between moderate or severe cognitive impairment and hip fractures during the six months following that episode. METHODS: a retrospective longitudinal study was conducted on a sample of 665 people over 65 years of age. The main variable of the study was cognitive impairment at six months of fracture, assessed using the Pfeiffer scale (PS). Other data related to clinical features were also collected for further analysis. RESULTS: binary logistic regression analyses showed that the main factors related to moderate or severe cognitive impairment at the sixth month of the fracture were age (OR = 1.078), initial cognitive impairment (OR = 535.762), and discharge (OR = 547.91), cognitive worsening at the sixth month with respect to the time of admission (OR = 7.024), moderate dependence on admission (OR = 15.474) and at six months (OR = 8.088), poor ambulation at discharge (OR = 5.071) and institutionalization prior to admission (OR = 5.349) or during the first semester after fracture (OR = 6.317). CONCLUSIONS: this research provides evidence about the clinical factors that predict moderate or severe cognitive decline at the sixth month in patients undergoing surgery for a hip fracture.
