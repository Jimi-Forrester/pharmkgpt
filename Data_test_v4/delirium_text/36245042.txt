36245042|t|What Has Immunology Brought to Periodontal Disease in Recent Years?
36245042|a|Recent decades have shed a new light on the pathomechanism of periodontal inflammation. While classic periodontology concentrates on biofilm control, oral hygiene improvement, professional tooth cleaning and surgical correction of damaged periodontal tissues, new aspects of the destruction mechanisms are being raised. Among them, the greatest attention is paid to the influence of host response on the clinical manifestations of the disease. Numerous studies have proved that the shift from gingivitis to periodontitis is not a simple progress of the disease, but an event occurring only in susceptible individuals. Susceptibility may result from appearance of local factors facilitating biofilm accumulation and/or maturation, or from systemic features, among which over-reaction and prolonged agitation of non-specific component of inflammatory response is crucial. The present paper summarizes the association between periodontology and immunology and updates the knowledge accrued mostly in the recent years. After a brief explanation of advances in understanding of the disease aetiology, the most studied and potentially viable immunological markers of periodontal disease are presented. Possible new therapeutic strategies, exploiting knowledge about the nature of host response-immunomodulation and reduction of chronic oxidative stress-are also presented.
