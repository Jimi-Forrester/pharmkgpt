37729344|a|Astrocytes with their specialised morphology are essential for brain homeostasis as metabolic mediators between blood vessels and neurons. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), astrocytes adopt reactive profiles with molecular and morphological changes that could lead to the impairment of their metabolic support and impact disease progression. However, the underlying mechanisms of how the metabolic function of human astrocytes is impaired by their morphological changes in AD are still elusive. To address this challenge, we developed and applied a metabolic multiscale modelling approach integrating the dynamics of metabolic energy pathways and physiological astrocyte morphologies acquired in human AD and age-matched control brain samples. The results demonstrate that the complex cell shape and intracellular organisation of energetic pathways determine the metabolic profile and support capacity of astrocytes in health and AD conditions. Thus, our mechanistic approach indicates the importance of spatial orchestration in metabolism and allows for the identification of protective mechanisms against disease-associated metabolic impairments.
