37480461|a|Concussive head injury (CHI) is one of the major risk factors in developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in military personnel at later stages of life. Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in CHI leads to extravasation of plasma amyloid beta protein (AlphabetaP) into the brain fluid compartments precipitating AD brain pathology. Oxidative stress in CHI or AD is likely to enhance production of nitric oxide indicating a role of its synthesizing enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in brain pathology. Thus, exploration of the novel roles of nanomedicine in AD or CHI reducing NOS upregulation for neuroprotection are emerging. Recent research shows that stem cells and neurotrophic factors play key roles in CHI-induced aggravation of AD brain pathologies. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that CHI exacerbates AD brain pathology in model experiments. Accordingly, it is quite likely that nanodelivery of NOS antibodies together with cerebrolysin and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will induce superior neuroprotection in AD associated with CHI. In this review, co-administration of TiO2 nanowired cerebrolysin - a balanced composition of several neurotrophic factors and active peptide fragments, together with MSCs and monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to neuronal NOS is investigated for superior neuroprotection following exacerbation of brain pathology in AD exacerbated by CHI based on our own investigations. Our observations show that nanowired delivery of cerebrolysin, MSCs and neuronal NOS in combination induces superior neuroprotective in brain pathology in AD exacerbated by CHI, not reported earlier.
