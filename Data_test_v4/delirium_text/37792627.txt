37792627|t|Beneficial Effect of Societal Factors on APOE-epsilon2 and epsilon4 Carriers' Brain Health: A Systematic Review.
37792627|a|Apolipoprotein-E (APOE) epsilon4 and epsilon2 are the most prevalent risk-increasing and risk-reducing genetic predictors of Alzheimer's disease, respectively. However, the extent to which societal factors can reduce the harmful impact of APOE-epsilon4 and enhance the beneficial impact of APOE-epsilon2 on brain health has not yet been examined systematically. To fill this gap, we conducted a systematic review searching for studies in Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Scopus until June 2023, that included: a) one of five social determinants of health (SDH) identified by Healthy People 2030, b) APOE-epsilon2 or APOE-epsilon4 allele carriers, c) cognitive or brain-biomarker outcomes, and d) studies with an analysis of how APOE-epsilon2 and/ or APOE-epsilon4 carriers differ on outcomes when exposed to SDH. From 14,076 articles retrieved, 124 met inclusion criteria. In most of the studies, the exposure to favorable SDH reduced APOE-epsilon4's detrimental effect and enhanced APOE-epsilon2's beneficial effect on cognitive and brain-biomarker outcomes (cognition: 70.5%, n: 74/105; brain-biomarkers: 71.4%, n: 20/28). A similar pattern of results emerged in each of the five Healthy People 2030 SDH categories, where finishing high school, having resources to satisfy basic needs, less air pollution, less negative external stimuli that can generate stress (e.g., negative age stereotypes), and exposure to multiple favorable SDH were associated with better cognitive and brain health among APOE-epsilon4 and APOE-epsilon2 carriers. Societal factors can reduce the harmful impact of APOE-epsilon4 and enhance the beneficial impact of APOE-epsilon2 on cognitive outcomes. This suggests that plans to reduce dementia should include community-level policies promoting favorable SDH.
