2557962|t|The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor complex in Alzheimer's disease: reduced regulation by glycine but not zinc.
2557962|a|The binding of [3H]MK-801 to the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor complex of well-washed cortical membranes from brains of examples of Alzheimer's disease and controls has been determined in incubations containing either glutamate or glycine plus glutamate. No changes were detected in the IC50 values for inhibition by zinc in the Alzheimer's samples compared to control although 'glycine-dependent' binding of the [3H]-ligand was significantly reduced in Alzheimer's disease.
