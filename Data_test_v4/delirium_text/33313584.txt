In the new suprainguinal technique, the 'bowtie' sign is detected with an ultrasound probe, and local anaesthetic is injected into the fascial plane with in-plane approach. In this retrospective study, we compared the postoperative analgesic efficacy of suprainguinal fascia iliaca compartment block (S-FICB) and patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) after major hip surgery in elderly patients. METHODS: We retrospectively recorded visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, morphine consumptions and opioid side effects who underwent either a S-FICB (n=67) or PCA (n=61). In the S-FICB group, 25-40 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine was administered with a single-shot S-FICB technique after induction of anaesthesia. VAS scores during resting (VAS-S) and movement (VAS-D); morphine consumption at 0, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours; total morphine consumption; and opioid-related complications were recorded. RESULTS: Morphine consumptions in each measurement period and in total were significantly lower in the S-FICB group (694.03+-2,007.47 mug vs. 13,368.85+-4,834.68 mug; p<0.05). The total number of opioid-related complications were also significantly lower in the S-FICB group (17/67 vs. 48/62; p<0.05). More than half of the patients (38/67, 56%) did not need morphine administration in the S-FICB group. VAS-S during the first 6 hours and VAS-D up to 24 hours postoperatively were significantly lower in the S-FICB group (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: In our study, S-FICB provided better analgesia than the PCA technique after hip surgery in elderly patients. Moreover, S-FICB reduced opioid consumption and opioid-related complications in the first 24 hours postoperatively.
