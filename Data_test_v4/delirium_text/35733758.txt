35733758|t|Sleep and Alzheimer: The Link.
35733758|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia which has both cognitive and non-cognitive disabilities. Recent research has proved that sleep deprivation and insomnia have been related to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and would influence the symptoms and progression of the disease. We look at the current research that supports the idea that the lack of sleep relates to cognitive decline and dementia, with an emphasis on Alzheimer's disease. We integrated the various possible mechanisms of sleep deprivation leading to Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline. The role of neuroinflammation, generation of reactive oxidative species and sleep disturbances play a central role in tau generation and Abeta deposition. An approach to manage sleep changes can widely prevent the cognitive decline of Alzheimer's disease.
