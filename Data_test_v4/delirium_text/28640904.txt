28640904|a|Obesity in many current pre-clinical animal models of obesity and diabetes is mediated by monogenic mutations; these are rarely associated with the development of human obesity. A new mouse model, the FATZO mouse, has been developed to provide polygenic obesity and a metabolic pattern of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, that support the presence of insulin resistance similar to metabolic disease in patients with insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes. The FATZO mouse resulted from a cross of C57BL/6J and AKR/J mice followed by selective inbreeding for obesity, increased insulin and hyperglycemia. Since many clinical studies have established a close link between higher body weight and the development of type 2 diabetes, we investigated whether time to progression to type 2 diabetes or disease severity in FATZO mice was dependent on weight gain in young animals. Our results indicate that lighter animals developed metabolic disturbances much slower and to a lesser magnitude than their heavier counterparts. Consumption of a diet containing high fat, accelerated weight gain in parallel with disease progression. A naturally occurring and significant variation in the body weight of FATZO offspring enables these mice to be identified as low, mid and high body weight groups at a young age. These weight groups remain into adulthood and correspond to slow, medium and accelerated development of type 2 diabetes. Thus, body weight inclusion criteria can optimize the FATZO model for studies of prevention, stabilization or treatment of type 2 diabetes.
