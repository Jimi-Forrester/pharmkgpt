33607107|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive memory loss, declining language skills and other cognitive disorders. AD has brought great mental and economic burden to patients, families and society. However due to the complexity of AD's pathology, drugs developed for the treatment of AD often fail in clinical or experimental trials. The main problems of current anti-AD drugs are low efficacy due to mono-target method or side effects, especially high hepatotoxicity. To tackle these two main problems, multi-target-directed ligand (MTDL) based on "one molecule, multiple targets" has been studied. MTDLs can regulate multiple biological targets at the same time, so it has shown higher efficacy, better safety. As a natural active small molecule, alpha-mangostin (alpha-M) has shown potential multi-factor anti-AD activities in a series of studies, furthermore it also has a certain hepatoprotective effect. The good availability of alpha-M also provides support for its application in clinical research. In this work, multiple activities of alpha-M related to AD therapy were reviewed, which included anti-cholinesterase, anti-amyloid-cascade, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidative stress, low toxicity, hepatoprotective effects and drug formulation. It shows that alpha-M is a promising candidate for the treatment of AD.
