39088076|t|Prolonged vs shorter awake prone positioning for COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure: a multicenter, randomised controlled trial.
39088076|a|PURPOSE: Awake prone positioning has been reported to reduce endotracheal intubation in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF). However, it is still unclear whether using the awake prone positioning for longer periods can further improve outcomes. METHODS: In this randomized, open-label clinical trial conducted at 12 hospitals in China, non-intubated patients with COVID-19-related AHRF were randomly assigned to prolonged awake prone positioning (target > 12 h daily for 7 days) or standard care with a shorter period of awake prone positioning. The primary outcome was endotracheal intubation within 28 days after randomization. The key secondary outcomes included mortality and adverse events. RESULTS: In total, 409 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to prolonged awake prone positioning (n = 205) or standard care (n = 204). In the first 7 days after randomization, the median duration of prone positioning was 12 h/d (interquartile range [IQR] 12-14 h/d) in the prolonged awake prone positioning group vs. 5 h/d (IQR 2-8 h/d) in the standard care group. In the intention-to-treat analysis, intubation occurred in 35 (17%) patients assigned to prolonged awake prone positioning and in 56 (27%) patients assigned to standard care (relative risk 0.62 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42-0.9]). The hazard ratio (HR) for intubation was 0.56 (0.37-0.86), and for mortality was 0.63 (0.42-0.96) for prolonged awake prone positioning versus standard care, within 28 days. The incidence of pre-specified adverse events was low and similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: Prolonged awake prone positioning of patients with COVID-19-related AHRF reduces the intubation rate without significant harm. These results support prolonged awake prone positioning of patients with COVID-19-related AHRF.
