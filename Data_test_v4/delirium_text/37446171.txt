37446171|t|Serum 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate Status Is Associated with One-Carbon Metabolism-Related Metabolite Concentrations and Enzyme Activity Indicators in Young Women.
37446171|a|Maintaining optimal one-carbon metabolism (OCM) is essential for health and pregnancy. In this cross-sectional study, folate status was assessed based on 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) levels, and the association between 5-MTHF and OCM-related metabolites was investigated in 227 female Japanese university students aged 18-25 years. The participants were divided into high and low 5-MTHF groups based on their folate status. Serum samples of the participants were collected while they were fasting, and 18 OCM-related metabolites were measured using stable-isotope dilution liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The association between serum 5-MTHF and OCM-related metabolite concentrations was assessed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Serum 5-MTHF concentrations were negatively correlated with total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations and positively correlated with S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and total cysteine (tCys) concentrations. Serum 5-MTHF concentrations demonstrated a stronger negative correlation with tHcy/tCys than with tHcy alone. The negative correlation between betaine and tHcy concentrations was stronger in the low 5-MTHF group than in the high 5-MTHF group. The 5-MTHF status could be linked to Hcy flux into the transsulfuration pathway via SAM. Therefore, the tHcy/tCys ratio may be a more sensitive indicator of the 5-MTHF status than tHcy alone. Furthermore, a low 5-MTHF status can enhance Hcy metabolism via betaine.
