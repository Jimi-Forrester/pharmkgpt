34766258|t|E2F4-Based Gene Therapy Mitigates the Phenotype of the Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model 5xFAD.
34766258|a|After decades of unfruitful work, no effective therapies are available for Alzheimer's disease (AD), likely due to its complex etiology that requires a multifactorial therapeutic approach. We have recently shown using transgenic mice that E2 factor 4 (E2F4), a transcription factor that regulates cell quiescence and tissue homeostasis, and controls gene networks affected in AD, represents a good candidate for a multifactorial targeting of AD. Here we show that the expression of a dominant negative form of human E2F4 (hE2F4DN), unable to become phosphorylated in a Thr-conserved motif known to modulate E2F4 activity, is an effective and safe AD multifactorial therapeutic agent. Neuronal expression of hE2F4DN in homozygous 5xFAD (h5xFAD) mice after systemic administration of an AAV.PHP.B-hSyn1.hE2F4DN vector reduced the production and accumulation of Abeta in the hippocampus, attenuated reactive astrocytosis and microgliosis, abolished neuronal tetraploidization, and prevented cognitive impairment evaluated by Y-maze and Morris water maze, without triggering side effects. This treatment also reversed other alterations observed in h5xFAD mice such as paw-clasping behavior and body weight loss. Our results indicate that E2F4DN-based gene therapy is a promising therapeutic approach against AD.
