35661021|a|Given the clear role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and its impact on incidence and phenotypical characteristics, this review provides an overview with focus on inflammatory biofluid markers in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in PD patient cohorts. In preparation for clinical trials targeting the immune system, we specifically address the following questions: 1) What evidence do we have for pro-inflammatory profiles in blood and in CSF of sporadic and genetic PD patients? 2) Is there a role of anti-inflammatory mediators in blood/CSF? 3) Do inflammatory profiles in blood reflect those in CSF indicative of a cross-talk between periphery and brain? 4) Do blood/CSF inflammatory profiles change over the disease course as assessed in repeatedly taken biosamples? 5) Are blood/CSF inflammatory profiles associated with phenotypical trajectories in PD? 6) Are blood/CSF inflammatory profiles associated with CSF levels of neurodegenerative/PD-specific biomarkers? Knowledge on these questions will inform future strategies for patient stratification and cohort enrichment as well as suitable outcome measures for clinical trials.
