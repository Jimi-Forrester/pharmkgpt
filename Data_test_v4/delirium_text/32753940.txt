32753940|a|PURPOSE: The quadratus lumborum block (QLB) is a relatively new regional analgesic technique that could provide analgesia to the abdominal wall and reduce postoperative opioid consumption. We investigated the opioid-sparing effect of a unilateral lateral QLB in laparoscopic nephrectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 60 patients undergoing laparoscopic nephrectomy were included in the study. Patients were randomized into two groups as QLB and control group. QLB group received QLB with 25mL 0.25% ropivacaine, and the control group received 25mL 0.9% saline at anterolateral border of quadratus lumborum muscle preoperatively. Opioid consumption and the pain intensity at rest and on movement were measured at 2nd, 6th, 24th, and 48th hour postoperatively. We also assessed the time to first flatus to measure the extent of paralytic ileus and the quality of recovery-15 (QoR-15) questionnaire. RESULTS: Postoperative opioid consumption was significantly lower in the QLB group than in the control group at 6, 24, and 48h after surgery (P < 0.05). The pain intensity at rest and on movement was significantly lower in the QLB group than in the control group during the first 24 hours after surgery (P < 0.05). The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, time to first flatus, and QoR-15 score did not show significant differences. CONCLUSION: Preoperative unilateral QLB successfully decreased postoperative pain and opioid consumption after laparoscopic nephrectomy and could be an option for analgesia after laparoscopic nephrectomy.
