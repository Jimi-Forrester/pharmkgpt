28930185|t|Bioprospecting for Exopolysaccharides from Deep-Sea Hydrothermal Vent Bacteria: Relationship between Bacterial Diversity and Chemical Diversity.
28930185|a|Many bacteria biosynthesize structurally diverse exopolysaccharides (EPS) and excrete them into their surrounding environment. The EPS functional features have found many applications in industries such as cosmetics and pharmaceutics. In particular, some EPS produced by marine bacteria are composed of uronic acids, neutral sugars, and N-acetylhexosamines, and may also bear some functional sulfate groups. This suggests that they can share common structural features with glycosaminoglycans (GAG) like the two EPS (HE800 and GY785) originating from the deep sea. In an attempt to discover new EPS that may be promising candidates as GAG-mimetics, fifty-one marine bacterial strains originating from deep-sea hydrothermal vents were screened. The analysis of the EPS chemical structure in relation to bacterial species showed that Vibrio, Alteromonas, and Pseudoalteromonas strains were the main producers. Moreover, they produced EPS with distinct structural features, which might be useful for targeting marine bacteria that could possibly produce structurally GAG-mimetic EPS.
