30458577|t|[3D-CAM Guideline-Conform Translation for German-Speaking Countries].
30458577|a|Postoperative delirium (POD) is an acute change in the mental state with consciousness and attention deficits. It is a common complication after surgical procedures and can have serious consequences. Thus, the evidence- and consensus-based guidelines for POD appeals with the highest recommendation level that patients be regularly screened for delirium in the postoperative phase, from the recovery room to the fifth postoperative day and at least once per shift, using a validated test instrument for the detection of POD. In 2014, Marcantonio et al. published the 3D-CAM (3-Minute Diagnostic Interview for CAM-defined Delirium). In the 3D-CAM, the algorithm of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is maintained by using individual elements that operationalize the evaluation of the criteria. Therefore, it requires less training, be faster to use, and, due to a standardized approach, has less interrater variability than the CAM, whereas the high sensitivity and specificity are maintained. Our goal was to translate the 3D-CAM from English to German, so as to make this instrument available to German-speaking countries. The translation of the 3D-CAM was based on the 2005 published guideline on Translation and Cultural Adaptation of Patient Reported Outcome Measures of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcome Research. Three independent forward translations were harmonized to a preliminary translation, which then was translated back into the original language. Original authors reviewed the back translation. According to a cognitive debriefing, the translation was revised and in addition was adapted for use in the recovery room. Due to close contact with the original authors during the translation process, it was possible to ensure that the contents of the test instrument were remained intact during the translation process.
