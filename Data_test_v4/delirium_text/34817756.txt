34817756|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with increasing incidence in aged populations, second only to Alzheimer's disease. Increasing evidence has shown that inflammation plays an important role in the occurrence and development of Parkinson's disease. Growing evidence has shown that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and NF-kappaB are closely related to inflammation. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a hormone that is primarily secreted by intestinal endocrine L cells, and it has a variety of physiology through binding to GLP-1 receptor. GLP-1can be used for treatment of type 2 diabetes. In addition, GLP-1 also has anti-neuroinflammation activity. However, the exact mechanism behind how GLP-1 regulates neuroinflammation remains unclear. This study was designed to examine the effect of liraglutide on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced injury in mice and its potential mechanism of action. Results showed that liraglutide dose-dependently ameliorated mouse behavior including swimming time and locomotor activity, increased the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons and protein level, and reduced Iba1 and GFAP expression in the substantia nigra (SN). Liraglutide treatment also increased p-AMPK expression and reduced NF-kappaB protein level. Applying the AMPK inhibitor Dorsomorphin (Compound C) reversed the effect of liraglutide-reducing p-AMPK and increasing NF-kappaB expression. Finally, GFAP protein level increased, along with a decrease in TH expression. In conclusion, these results suggest that liraglutide can suppress neuroinflammation. Moreover, this effect is mediated through the AMPK/NF-kappaB signaling pathway.
