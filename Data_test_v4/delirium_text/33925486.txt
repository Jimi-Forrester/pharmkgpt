33925486|t|Associations of Dietary omega-3, omega-6 Fatty Acids Consumption with Sleep Disorders and Sleep Duration among Adults.
33925486|a|The relationship between omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids consumption and sleep disorders or duration are controversial. Therefore, we used the data of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2016 in this cross-sectional study to explore their relationships. omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids consumption was assessed using two 24 h dietary recall interviews. Sleep disorders and sleep duration were based on self-reported data. Logistic regression models and restricted cubic spline analyses were used. Compared with tertile one, the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of sleep disorders for the second tertile of omega-6 fatty acid intake and the highest tertile of omega-6:omega-3 ratio were 1.30 (1.04-1.62) and 1.36 (1.08-1.70), respectively. Inverse U-shaped and linear dose-response relationships were observed between dietary omega-6 fatty acid intake and omega-6:omega-3 ratio and sleep disorders, respectively. In addition, omega-3 fatty acid consumption was adversely related to sleep disorders in men and the OR (95% CI) was 0.68 (0.49-0.95). Compared with normal sleep duration, omega-3 fatty acid consumption was negatively related to very short, short, and long sleep duration risk. The relative risk ratios (RRRs) were 0.53 (0.35-0.81), 0.79 (0.67-0.93), and 0.81 (068-0.98), respectively. The RRR of very short sleep for omega-6 fatty acid consumption was 0.57 (0.45-0.73). Our study indicates that omega-6 fatty acid consumption and the omega-6:omega-3 ratio are positively associated with the risk of sleep disorders, while the negative association between omega-3 fatty acids and sleep disorders may exist only in men. Furthermore, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid consumption are negatively related to the risk of non-normal sleep duration.
