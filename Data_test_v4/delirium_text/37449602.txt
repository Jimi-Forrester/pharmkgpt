37449602|t|Molecular chaperones in stroke-induced immunosuppression.
37449602|a|Stroke-induced immunosuppression is a process that leads to peripheral suppression of the immune system after a stroke and belongs to the central nervous system injury-induced immunosuppressive syndrome. Stroke-induced immunosuppression leads to increased susceptibility to post-stroke infections, such as urinary tract infections and stroke-associated pneumonia, worsening prognosis. Molecular chaperones are a large class of proteins that are able to maintain proteostasis by directing the folding of nascent polypeptide chains, refolding misfolded proteins, and targeting misfolded proteins for degradation. Various molecular chaperones have been shown to play roles in stroke-induced immunosuppression by modulating the activity of other molecular chaperones, cochaperones, and their associated pathways. This review summarizes the role of molecular chaperones in stroke-induced immunosuppression and discusses new approaches to restore host immune defense after stroke.
