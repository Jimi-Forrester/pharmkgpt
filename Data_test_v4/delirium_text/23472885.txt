23472885|a|Pathological protein and peptide aggregation are key events in a number of chronic and devastating neurodegenerative conditions including dementias such as Alzheimer's and Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease and other central nervous system diseases such as Parkinson's and Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Analytical methods for studying protein aggregation in these diseases are important for mapping pathophysiological events and ultimately for the development of new therapies and better diagnostic tools.
