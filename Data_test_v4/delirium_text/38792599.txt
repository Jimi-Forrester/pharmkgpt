38792599|t|The Pathophysiological Underpinnings of Gamma-Band Alterations in Psychiatric Disorders.
38792599|a|Investigating the biophysiological substrates of psychiatric illnesses is of great interest to our understanding of disorders' etiology, the identification of reliable biomarkers, and potential new therapeutic avenues. Schizophrenia represents a consolidated model of gamma alterations arising from the aberrant activity of parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons, whose dysfunction is associated with perineuronal net impairment and neuroinflammation. This model of pathogenesis is supported by molecular, cellular, and functional evidence. Proof for alterations of gamma oscillations and their underlying mechanisms has also been reported in bipolar disorder and represents an emerging topic for major depressive disorder. Although evidence from animal models needs to be further elucidated in humans, the pathophysiology of gamma-band alteration represents a common denominator for different neuropsychiatric disorders. The purpose of this narrative review is to outline a framework of converging results in psychiatric conditions characterized by gamma abnormality, from neurochemical dysfunction to alterations in brain rhythms.
