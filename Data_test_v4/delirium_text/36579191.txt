36579191|a|The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every aspect of our lives since its start in December 2019. Among various COVID-19 complications, pleural complications are also increasingly reported but rarely from Nepal. Here, we presented a case of pyopneumothorax in a 52-year-old male patient referred from another center and admitted to the ICU of Nepal Armed Police Force Hospital with a diagnosis of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the background of alcohol withdrawal syndrome with delirium tremens and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. He developed a rapid decline in respiratory status with a right-sided pneumothorax and underwent an immediate needle thoracostomy, followed by chest tube insertion. On the sixth day of admission, he had thick yellowish pus in the chest drain (pyopneumothorax), and despite the rigorous efforts in treatment, he died on the 15th day of admission. Though relatively uncommon, clinicians should consider pleural complications like pneumothorax, pleural effusion, pneumomediastinum, and empyema in patients with impaired immune status. In such patients, we should ensure prompt diagnosis with the earliest intervention and rationale use of antibiotics.
