36196952|t|A Case of Thyroid Storm Caused by Thyroiditis.
36196952|a|Thyroid storm occurs when thyroid hormones are released causing a hyperadrenergic state resulting in potentially life-threatening cardio-respiratory effects. The most common cause of thyroid storm is thyrotoxicosis secondary to Graves disease. Alternatively, subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is usually a self-limited condition consisting of painful inflammation of thyroid gland, often associated with viral illness. Transient hyperthyroidism is a common finding in SAT; however, thyroid storm is an extremely rare complication of SAT. We report the sixth recorded case of SAT associated with thyroid storm.
