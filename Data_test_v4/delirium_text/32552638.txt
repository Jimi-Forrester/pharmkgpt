32552638|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a very common complication in elderly patients with gastric cancer (GC) and associated with poor prognosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) serve as key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression via targeting mRNAs and play important roles in the nervous system. This study aimed to investigate the potential predictive role of miRNAs for POD. METHODS: Elderly GC patients who were scheduled to undergo elective curative resection were consequently enrolled in this study. POD was assessed at 1 day before surgery and 1-7 days after surgery following the guidance of the 5th edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM V, 2013). The demographics, clinicopathologic characteristics and preoperative circulating miRNAs by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were compared between patients with or without POD. Risk factors for POD were assessed via univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 370 participants were enrolled, of which 63 had suffered from POD within postoperative 7 days with an incidence of 17.0%. Preoperative miR-210 was a predictor for POD with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.921, a cut-off value of 1.67, a sensitivity of 95.11%, and a specificity of 92.06%, (P<0.001). In the multivariate logistic regression model, the relative expression of serum miR-210 was an independent risk factor for POD (OR: 3.37, 95%CI: 1.98-5.87, P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the present study highlighted that preoperative miR-210 could serve as a potential predictor for POD in elderly GC patients undergoing curative resection.
