39503930|t|Analysis of key pathways and genes in nodal structure on rat skin surface using gene ontology and KEGG pathway.
39503930|a|BACKGROUND: We have previously reported anatomical, histological, and gene expression characteristics of the nodal structure of rat skin surface and suggested its potential as an acupuncture point. However, the specific characteristics of the interactions among the genes expressed in this structure remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine gene expression changes by analyzing interaction networks of genes up-regulated in nodal structures and to explore relationships with acupuncture points. METHODS: We investigated the relationship between the nodal structures and acupuncture points by analyzing the interactions of up-regulated genes, their Gene Ontology biological functions, and the characteristics of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. RNA-seq and STRING analysis provided comprehensive information on these gene groups. RESULTS: Interactions between up-regulated genes in nodal structures were classified into three groups. The first group, which includes Wnt7b, Wnt3, and Wnt16, showed significant interactions in pathways such as Wnt signaling, Alzheimer's disease, and regulation of stem cell pluripotency. The second group, composed of Fos, Dusp1, Pla2g4e, Pla2g4f, and Fgfr3, demonstrated a notable association with the MAPK signaling pathway. Lastly, the third group, consisting of Adcy1, Pla2g4e, Pla2g4f, and Dusp1 exhibited effective interactions with the inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels and serotonergic synapse. CONCLUSION: Continued research on nodal structures where these genes are expressed is needed to improve our understanding of skin anatomy and physiology as well as their potential clinical utility as acupuncture points.
