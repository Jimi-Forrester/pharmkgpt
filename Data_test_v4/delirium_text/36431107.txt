36431107|t|Postoperative Delirium after Reconstructive Surgery in the Head and Neck Region.
36431107|a|Postoperative delirium (POD) is an acute and serious complication following extended surgery. The aim of this study was to identify possible risk factors and scores associated with POD in patients undergoing reconstructive head and neck surgery. A collective of 225 patients was retrospectively evaluated after receiving reconstructive surgery in the head and neck region, between 2013 to 2018. The incidence of POD was examined with regards to distinct patient-specific clinical as well as perioperative parameters. Uni- and multivariate statistics were performed for data analysis. POD occurred in 49 patients (21.8%) and was strongly associated with an increased age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (ACCI) and a prolonged stay in the ICU (p = 0.009 and p = 0.000, respectively). Analogous, binary logistic regression analysis revealed time in the ICU (p < 0.001), an increased ACCI (p = 0.022) and a Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS) score   0 (p = 0.005) as significant predictors for a diagnosis of POD. In contrast, the extent of reconstructive surgery in terms of parameters such as type of transplant or duration of surgery did not correlate with the occurrence of POD. The extension of reconstructive interventions in the head and neck region is not decisive for the development of postoperative delirium, whereas patient-specific parameters such as age and comorbidities, as well as nutritional parameters, represent predictors of POD occurrence.
