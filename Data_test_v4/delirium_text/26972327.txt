26972327|t|Focal neurocognitive dysfunctions in abstinence delirium: a case report.
26972327|a|Due to abrupt interruption of hidden benzodiazepine-use, a 68-year-old woman developed a full-blown abstinence delirium characterized by epileptic seizures and progressive focal neurocognitive symptoms. The evolution of such rare neuro-linguistic phenomena as an echoism, palilalia and glossomania associated with a progressive visuo-perceptive syndrome and a visual hallucinosis are for the first time reported within the context of withdrawal. Notwithstanding the lack of any neuroradiological evidence for a morphological lesion in the clinically expected brain regions, the anatomo-clinical hypothesis of a focal frontal and parieto-occipital dysfunction was explicitly corroborated by repeated 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT findings.
