26366437|a|There is a growing global prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Current treatment for neurodegenerative diseases is limited due to the blood brain barrier's ability to restrict the entry of therapeutics to the brain. In that context, direct delivery of drugs from nose to brain has gained emerging interest as an important alternative to oral and parenteral routes of administration. Although there are considerable reports showing promising results after intranasal drug delivery in various disease-models and investigatory human clinical trials, there are very few studies showing a detailed pharmacokinetics with regard to the uptake and retention of intranasally delivered material(s) within specific brain regions, which are critical determining factors for dosing conditions and optimal treatment regimen. This investigation compared a time-dependent brain uptake and resident time of various radiolabeled candidate neurotherapeutics after a single bolus intranasal or intraperitoneal administration in mice. Results indicate that the brain uptake of intranasally delivered therapeutic(s) is > 5 times greater than that after intraperitoneal delivery. The peak uptake and resident time of all intranasally delivered test therapeutics for all brain regions is observed to be between 30min-12h, depending upon the distance of brain region from the site of administration, followed by gradual fading of radioactive counts by 24h post intranasal administration. Current study confirms the usefulness of intranasal administration as a non- invasive and efficient means of delivering therapeutics to the brain to treat neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease.
