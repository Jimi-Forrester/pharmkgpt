36106206|t|Depression in Parkinson's Disease: A Narrative Review.
36106206|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative age-related disorder that affects the central nervous system (CNS) and is characterized by uncontrollable movements such as shaking, stiffness, and loss of balance and coordination. Depression is a common non-motor manifestation of PD, but unfortunately, depression remains unrecognized and often undertreated. The underlying pathophysiology of depression in PD is complicated, and many studies have been conducted to know the exact cause, but the question remains unanswered. In this article, we discuss various pathophysiologies by which depression occurs in PD. The most widely accepted theories are neuroinflammation and monoamine oxidase theory. This article also explored the pharmacological treatment of depression in PD; this involves standard antidepressant therapy such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO); non-pharmacological treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) have also been discussed. However, physicians hesitate to prescribe antidepressants to patients with PD due to concerns about harmful drug-drug interactions between antidepressants and antiparkinsonian drugs. Despite the complicated link between PD and depression, the co-administration of antidepressants and antiparkinsonian drugs is safe and beneficial when appropriately managed. However, early recognition and initiation of treatment of depression in PD reduces the longitudinal course and improves the cross-sectional picture. This review article also explored the clinical and diagnostic findings and impact on the quality of life of depression in PD.
