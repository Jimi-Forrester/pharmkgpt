37051221|t|Current Screening Strategies for the Diagnosis of Adrenal Insufficiency in Children.
37051221|a|Adrenal insufficiency can arise from a primary adrenal disorder, secondary to adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency, or by suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis due to exogenous glucocorticoids. Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is usually delayed because the initial presentation is often subtle and nonspecific. Clinician awareness and recognition is crucial for timely diagnosis to avoid adrenal crisis. Current screening strategies for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in children in various clinical situations are discussed in this review.
