39578027|t|Effect of remimazolam besylate versus propofol on haemodynamic profiles in patients undergoing thyroid surgery with recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring: a protocol for a randomised controlled trial.
39578027|a|INTRODUCTION: Thyroid surgery with intraoperative nerve monitoring under total intravenous anaesthesia often requires deeper sedation due to limitations or lack of neuromuscular blocking agents, usually resulting in haemodynamic instability. Remimazolam, a newly developed sedative, is being studied for its effect on the haemodynamic profile of patients undergoing this procedure and compared with propofol. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This will be a single-centre, single-blind, randomised, controlled trial in American Society of Anesthesiologists I-III patients between the ages of 18 and 65 who require recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring for thyroid surgery. Patients will be randomised 1:1 to either remimazolam besylate or propofol, with 142 cases in each group according to a randomised, computer-generated cohort. The primary outcome is the occurrence of hypotension from induction of anaesthesia to full recovery. Secondary outcomes include the administration of vasoactive agents, the number of hypotension or hypertension episodes, the cumulative duration of hypotension or hypertension, the dose of intraoperative rescue sedation and analgesia, the time to extubation and awakening and the incidence of adverse events. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Medical Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Cancer Hospital and Institute of Guangzhou Medical University (2023-2024). The study protocol was modified according to the reviewers' comments, and the revised version was approved by the Ethics Committee (2024 Research Ethics Amendment No. 3). On completion of the study, we will commit to ensuring that the results are made available to the public, regardless of the outcome. This will include either publication in an appropriate journal or oral presentation at academic conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2300076583.
