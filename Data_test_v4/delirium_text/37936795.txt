37936795|t|Diagnostic Value of the Bispectral Index to Assess Sleep Quality after Elective Surgery in Intensive Care Unit.
37936795|a|Purpose: Monitoring and improving sleep quality may help recovery from major illness. Polysomnography is a gold standard for measuring sleep quality, but routine use is not practical. The goal of this study is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of an alternative monitor, the Bispectral Index (BIS), for evaluating the quality of sleep-in postoperative patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Study design: An observational study. Materials and methods: Patients admitted to postoperative ICU after elective major noncardiac surgery were monitored with both BIS and PSG during the first night. The temporally synchronized data from both monitors were obtained for measurement of the association. Clinical outcomes were compared between patients with different postoperative sleep quality. Results: Thirty-three patients were enrolled in this study. For determining the average BIS index associated with good postoperative sleep quality, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was generated. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.65. The cutoff with best discriminability was 75 with a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 56%. Compared with those with good and poor postoperative sleep quality, there were no differences in main postoperative outcomes including duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. Although the quality of sleep after surgery of all subjects with postoperative delirium was poor, the incidence of delirium between the groups did not significantly differ (0% vs 10.3%; p = 0.184). Conclusion: The monitoring of BIS is a viable tool for evaluating sleep quality in mechanically ventilated patients in the postoperative ICU with acceptable precision.
