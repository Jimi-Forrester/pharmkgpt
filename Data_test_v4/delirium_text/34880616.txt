34880616|a|BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a complex multisystem disease comprising multiple organ dysfunctions including neurologic manifestations. Some COVID-19 patients may present neurologic symptoms as the initial presentations of the disease. OBJECTIVE: We aim at investigating the frequency and the predictors of neurological manifestations in patients with confirmed COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional single-center study analyzed COVID-19 positive patients with neurological manifestations from March to June 2020, in Aswan Governorate, Egypt. Demographic data, clinical, radiological and laboratory findings, comorbidities, and treatments were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Out of the 905 confirmed COVID-19 patients; 422 patients (46.6%) had neurological manifestations and fulfilled the study inclusion criteria, 223 patients (52.8%) had central neurological disorders (CNS), 107 (25.4%) had peripheral neurological disorders (PNS), and 92 (21.8%) patients had non-specific neurological disorders. Age >50 years, diabetes mellitus, CORAD> III and smoking were predictors for neurological system affection. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection has been associated with numerous neurological deficits, especially in elderly patients. Central nervous system disorders were the most prevalent deficit with predominance of cerebrovascular events.
