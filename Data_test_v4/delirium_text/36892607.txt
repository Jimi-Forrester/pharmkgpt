36892607|a|In the last decades, the advancement of knowledge in analgesia and sedation for critically ill pediatric patients has been conspicuous and relevant. Many recommendations have changed to ensure patients' comfort during their intensive care unit (ICU) stay and prevent and treat sedation-related complications, as well as improve functional recovery and clinical outcomes. The key aspects of the analgosedation management in pediatrics have been recently reviewed in two consensus-based documents. However, there remains a lot to be researched and understood. With this narrative review and authors' point of view, we aimed to summarize the new insights presented in these two documents to facilitate their interpretation and application in clinical practice, as well as to outline research priorities in the field.    Conclusion: With this narrative review and authors' point of view, we aimed to summarize the new insights presented in these two documents to facilitate their interpretation and application in clinical practice, as well as to outline research priorities in the field. What is Known:   Critically ill pediatric patients receiving intensive care required analgesia and sedation to attenuate painful and stressful stimuli.  Optimal management of analgosedation is a challenge often burdened with complications such as tolerance, iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome, delirium, and possible adverse outcomes. What is New:  The new insights on the analgosedation treatment for critically ill pediatric patients delineated in the recent guidelines are summarized to identify strategies for changes in clinical practice.  Research gaps and potential for quality improvement projects are also highlighted.
