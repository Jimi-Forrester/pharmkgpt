36836008|a|The aim of this study was to evaluate our institutions airway management and complications after submandibular duct relocation (SMDR). We analysed a historic cohort of children and adolescents who were examined at the Multidisciplinary Saliva Control Centre between March 2005 and April 2016. Ninety-six patients underwent SMDR for excessive drooling. We studied details of the surgical procedure, postoperative swelling and other complications. Ninety-six patients, 62 males and 34 females, were treated consecutively by SMDR. Mean age at time of surgery was 14 years and 11 months. The ASA physical status was 2 in most patients. The majority of children were diagnosed with cerebral palsy (67.7%). Postoperative swelling of the floor of the mouth or tongue was reported in 31 patients (32.3%). The swelling was mild and transient in 22 patients (22.9%) but profound swelling was seen in nine patients (9.4%). In 4.2% of the patients the airway was compromised. In general, SMDR is a well-tolerated procedure, but we should be aware of swelling of the tongue and floor of the mouth. This may lead to a prolonged period of endotracheal intubation or a need for reintubation which can be challenging. After extensive intra-oral surgery such as SMDR we strongly recommend a extended perioperative intubation and extubation after the airway is checked and secure.
