38602241|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of memory loss that affects cognitive abilities with the aging of individuals, such as language or visual/spatial comprehension. MCI is considered a prodromal phase of more complicated neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Therefore, accurate diagnosis and better understanding of the disease prognosis will facilitate prevention of neurodegeneration. However, the existing diagnostic methods fail to provide precise and well-timed diagnoses, and the pathophysiology of MCI is not fully understood. Alterations of the serum N-glycoproteome expression could represent an essential contributor to the overall pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and be used as a potential marker to assess MCI diagnosis using less invasive procedures. In this approach, we identified N-glycopeptides with different expressions between healthy and MCI patients from serum glycoproteins. Seven of the N-glycopeptides showed outstanding AUC values, among them the antithrombin-III Asn224 + 4-5-0-2 with an AUC value of 1.00 and a p value of 0.0004. According to proteomics and ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA), our data is in line with recent publications, and the glycoproteins carrying the identified N-sites play an important role in neurodegeneration.
