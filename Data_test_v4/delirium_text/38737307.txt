38737307|t|The barriers to and facilitators of implementing early mobilisation for patients with delirium on intensive care units: A systematic review.
38737307|a|Background: Early mobilisation of critically ill patients remains variable across practice. This study set out to determine barriers to and facilitators of early mobilisation for patients diagnosed with delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: A mixed-methods descriptive systematic review. Electronic databases (AMED, BNI, CINAHL Plus, Cochrane Library, Medline and EMBASE) were searched for publications up to 22nd December 2021. Independent reviewers screened studies and extracted data using Covidence Systematic Review Management software. Data were summarised according to frequency (n/%) of barriers and facilitators. Thematic analysis of qualitative studies was carried out in order to address the secondary aim. Quantitative studies were assessed using the GRADE quality assessment tool. Qualitative studies were analysed according to the GRADE-CERQual quality assessment tool. This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD 42021227655). Results: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. Quantitative findings demonstrated the presence of delirium was the most common reported barrier to early mobilisation. The most common facilitator was ICU staff experience of positive outcomes as a result of early mobilisation interventions. Thematic analysis identified six main themes that may describe potential meanings behind these findings: (1) knowledge, (2) personal preferences, (3) perceived burden of delirium, (4) perceived complexity, (5) decision-making and (6) culture. Conclusion: These findings highlight the reported need to further understand the impact and value of early mobilisation as a non-pharmacological intervention for patients diagnosed with delirium in ICU. Evaluation of early mobilisation interventions involving key stakeholders may address these concerns and provide effective implementation strategies.
