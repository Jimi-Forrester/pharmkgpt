33383698|t|Holistic Metabolomic Laboratory-Developed Test (LDT): Development and Use for the Diagnosis of Early-Stage Parkinson's Disease.
33383698|a|A laboratory-developed test (LDT) is a type of in vitro diagnostic test that is developed and used within a single laboratory. The holistic metabolomic LDT integrating the currently available data on human metabolic pathways, changes in the concentrations of low-molecular-weight compounds in the human blood during diseases and other conditions, and their prevalent location in the body was developed. That is, the LDT uses all of the accumulated metabolic data relevant for disease diagnosis and high-resolution mass spectrometry with data processing by in-house software. In this study, the LDT was applied to diagnose early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD), which currently lacks available laboratory tests. The use of the LDT for blood plasma samples confirmed its ability for such diagnostics with 73% accuracy. The diagnosis was based on relevant data, such as the detection of overrepresented metabolite sets associated with PD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, the ability of the LDT to detect normal composition of low-molecular-weight compounds in blood was demonstrated, thus providing a definition of healthy at the molecular level. This LDT approach as a screening tool can be used for the further widespread testing for other diseases, since 'omics' tests, to which the metabolomic LDT belongs, cover a variety of them.
