Agrypnia excitata describes a triad of three separate conditions: delirium tremens, Morvan's chorea, and familial fatal insomnia (FFI). Each of the aforementioned three conditions have sleep disturbances as a unifying theme and results in distinct neurophysiological findings. The following is an overview of agrypnia excitata with a particular emphasis placed upon each of the three individual conditions that constitute the syndrome with recommendations on appropriate management.
