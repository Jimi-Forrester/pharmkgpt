36611988|t|Sigma-1 Receptor as a Protective Factor for Diabetes-Associated Cognitive Dysfunction via Regulating Astrocytic Endoplasmic Reticulum-Mitochondrion Contact and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress.
36611988|a|The prevalence of diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction (DACD) has increased to 13.5%. Dementia, as the most severe DACD, is the second leading cause of death in patients with diabetes mellitus. Hence, the potential mechanisms of DACD for slowing or halting its progression need to be urgently explored. Given that the sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R), a chaperone protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondrion contact membranes to regulate ER stress (ERS), is associated with cognitive outcomes in neurodegenerative diseases, this study aimed to investigate the role of astrocytic Sig-1R in DACD and its underlying mechanism. Here, we examined the levels of ERS and complement component 3/3a (C3/C3a) from primary astrocytes with different concentrations of glucose and treatment. Subsequently, HT22 neurons were cultured in different astrocyte-conditioned medium, and the expression of synaptic proteins was detected. We constructed type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) model to evaluate the astrocytic Sig-1R mechanism on synapse and cognitive function changes. In vitro, high glucose concentration downregulated Sig-1R and aggravated ERS in astrocytes, resulting in synapse deficits. PRE-084, a high-affinity and selective Sig-1R agonist, inhibited astrocytic ERS and complement cascades and restored synaptic damage, while the Sig-1R antagonist displayed the opposite results. Moreover, C3a receptor antagonist (C3aRA) could mimic the effect of PRE-084 and exerted neuroprotective effects. In vivo, PRE-084 substantially reduced ER-mitochondrion contact, activation of ERS, and C3/C3a secretion in mice with T1DM. Additionally, the synaptic loss and neurobehavioral dysfunction of mice with T1DM were less pronounced in both the PRE-084 and C3aRA treatment groups. These findings demonstrated that Sig-1R activation reduced the astrocytic ER-mitochondrion contact, ERS activation, and complement-mediated synaptic damage in T1DM. This study suggested the mechanisms and potential therapeutic approaches for treating DACD.
