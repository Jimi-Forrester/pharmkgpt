29955471|t|Drug-induced cognitive impairment: Effect of cardiovascular agents.
29955471|a|INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular agents can be associated with a negative effect on cognition, especially in older adults, critically ill people, and those with baseline cognitive impairment. Negative effect on cognition is commonly reported as uncomplicated acute confusion and delirium and, less commonly, chronic cognitive changes due to drug-induced depression and/or dementia. METHODS: A literature review of case reports, case series, prospective cohort studies, clinical trials, and literature reviews were included in this study. Articles were located using online databases PubMed and Medline using the following keywords: antiarrhythmic agents, anticholinergic burden, antihypertensive agents, beta-blockers, cardiovascular agents, cognitive impairment, delirium, cognition, dementia, depression, digoxin, diuretics, and drug-induced cognitive impairment. RESULTS: In general, use of all antihypertensives, especially in the case of polypharmacy or inappropriate dosing, can lead to hypotension and/or bradycardia, and thus lead to mental/cognitive status change due to decreased cerebral perfusion. Use of diuretics can be associated with fluid/electrolyte and/or acid-base imbalance, resulting in the onset of confusion and delirium. In addition, cardiovascular agents with central bioavailability, such digoxin and select antiarrhythmics, and antihypertensives may carry a risk for cognitive impairment due to various mechanisms proposed, such as antagonism of central muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, neurotransmission imbalance in the brain, and disruption of physiologic function of sodium/potassium ATPase in the neuronal cells. DISCUSSION: When dealing with an individual who presents with acute, subacute, and chronic changes in cognitive function, one should perform a thorough medication history as the first step in order to aid in the identification of drug-induced cognitive impairment.
