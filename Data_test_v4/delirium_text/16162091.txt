The target of current treatments is to improve neuronal dysfunction and produce symptomatic benefits based on a clear understanding of neurotransmitter biochemistry. The purpose of this review is to examine the scientific background to currently available treatments, discuss the clinical experience of employing these drugs in Alzheimer's disease patients and review the socioeconomic influences on their use in the future.
