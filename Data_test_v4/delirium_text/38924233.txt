38924233|a|AIMS: This study aims to develop an evidence-based nursing practice program to prevent unplanned endotracheal extubation (UEE) among adult patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). DESIGN: This study uses the Delphi method to develop an evidence-based nursing practice program. METHODS: A comprehensive review of 18 databases and evidence-based websites was conducted to gather, assess and synthesize evidence on preventing UEEs in adult patients. Using this synthesized evidence, a questionnaire was formulated for further investigation. Subsequently, input was solicited from experts through Delphi surveys to establish an evidence-based nursing practice protocol for preventing UEEs in adult ICU patients. Consistency in consultation results guided subsequent rounds of consultation. RESULTS: The developed program comprised 43 evidence items categorized into nine dimensions, including risk assessment for unplanned extubation, sedation, analgesia, delirium, balloon management, psychosocial care, early extubation, catheter immobilization and protective restraints. Two rounds of expert inquiry yielded recovery rates of 94.7% and 100% for the first and second questionnaires, respectively. Kendall W values ranged from .224 to .353 (p < .001). CONCLUSION: This study developed an evidence-based nursing practice program to prevent UEE in adult ICU patients, employing evidence-based practices and Delphi expert consultation methods. However, further validation of the program's effectiveness is warranted. REPORTING METHOD: Findings were reported according to the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research checklist. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Nurses contributed to the study by participating in investigations. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION AND PATIENT CARE: The program developed in this study offers an evidence-based framework for preventing unplanned extubation in hospitals, thereby reducing its incidence and enhancing the quality of nursing care.
