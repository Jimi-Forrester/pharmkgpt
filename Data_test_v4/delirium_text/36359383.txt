36359383|a|The aging of the immune system has recently attracted a lot of attention. Immune senescence describes changes that the immune system undergoes over time. The importance of immune senescence in neurological diseases is increasingly discussed. For this review, we considered studies that investigated cellular changes in the aging immune system and in neurological disease. Twenty-six studies were included in our analysis (for the following diseases: multiple sclerosis, stroke, Parkinson's disease, and dementia). The studies differed considerably in terms of the patient groups included and the cell types studied. Evidence for immunosenescence in neurological diseases is currently very limited. Prospective studies in well-defined patient groups with appropriate control groups, as well as comprehensive methodology and reporting, are essential prerequisites to generate clear insights into immunosenescence in neurological diseases.
