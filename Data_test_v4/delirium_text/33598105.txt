33598105|t|Review on circular RNAs and new insights into their roles in cancer.
33598105|a|Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a very interesting class of conserved single-stranded RNA molecules derived from exonic or intronic sequences by precursor mRNA back-splicing. Unlike canonical linear RNAs, circRNAs form covalently closed, continuous stable loops without a 5'end cap and 3'end poly(A) tail, and therefore are resistant to exonuclease digestion. The majority of circRNAs are highly abundant, and conserved across different species with a tissue or developmental-stage-specific expression. circRNAs have been shown to play important roles as microRNA sponges, regulators of gene splicing and transcription, RNA-binding protein sponges and protein/peptide translators. Emerging evidence reveals that circRNAs function in various human diseases, particularly cancers, and may function as better predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. In consideration of their potential clinical relevance, circRNAs have become a new research hotspot in the field of tumor pathology. In the present study, the current understanding of the biogenesis, characteristics, databases, research methods, biological functions subcellular distribution, epigenetic regulation, extracellular transport and degradation of circRNAs was discussed. In particular, the multiple databases and methods involved in circRNA research were first summarized, and the recent advances in determining the potential roles of circRNAs in tumor growth, migration and invasion, which render circRNAs better predictive biomarkers, were described. Furthermore, future perspectives for the clinical application of circRNAs in the management of patients with cancer were proposed, which could provide new insights into circRNAs in the future.
