35162783|a|Glaucoma affects a wide spectrum of daily essential activities in older adults. This study examined whether older adults with moderate and advanced stages of glaucoma exhibit differences in visuomotor task performance compared with age- and gender-matched ophthalmologically healthy control subjects and estimated the effects of physical activity (PA) levels, age, and severity of visual impairment on patients' visuomotor task performance. Sixty older adults with moderate glaucoma, advanced glaucoma, and normal sight participated in the study. Visuomotor processing was assessed using laboratory-based simple and complex visuomotor reaction tasks. Monocular Humphrey Visual Field and binocular Humphrey Esterman Visual Field tests were used to estimate visual field defect severity. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to assess PA levels. Participants with glaucoma had poorer scores in visuomotor tasks compared to participants with normal sight. Glaucoma patients' PA levels, age, and binocular visual field defect explained 54% of the variation in complex reaction time. Low PA levels were identified as a risk factor for visuomotor processing decline. Compensatory mechanisms to improve the efficiency of visual field scanning in patients with more severe visual field defects may exist.
