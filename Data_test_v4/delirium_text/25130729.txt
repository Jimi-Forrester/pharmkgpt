25130729|a|Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) oligomers, intermediates of Abeta aggregation, cause cognitive impairment and synaptotoxicity in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Immunotherapy using anti-Abeta antibody is one of the most promising approaches for AD treatment. However, most clinical trials using conventional sequence-specific antibodies have proceeded with difficulty. This is probably due to the unintended removal of the non-pathological monomer and fibrils of Abeta as well as the pathological oligomers by these antibodies that recognize Abeta sequence, which is not involved in synaptotoxicity. Several efforts have been made recently to develop conformation-specific antibodies that target the tertiary structure of Abeta oligomers. Here, we review the recent findings of Abeta oligomers and anti-Abeta antibodies including our own, and discuss their potential as therapeutic and diagnostic tools.
