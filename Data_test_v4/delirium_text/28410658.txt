28410658|t|The Role of Neuroimaging in the Assessment of the Cognitively Impaired Elderly.
28410658|a|This article reviews the current diagnostic tools that are available for structural, functional, and molecular imaging of the brain, summarizing some of the key findings that have been reported in individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer disease, mild cognitive impairment, prodromal AD, or other prevalent dementias. Given recent advances in the development of amyloid PET tracers, current guidelines for the use of amyloid PET imaging in patients with cognitive complaints are reviewed. In addition, data addressing the potential value of amyloid PET imaging in the clinical setting are highlighted.
