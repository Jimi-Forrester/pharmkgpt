32366312|a|BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest survivors suffer from neurological dysfunction including cognitive impairment. Cerebral mast cells, the key regulators of neuroinflammation contribute to neuroinflammation-associated cognitive dysfunction. Mast cell tryptase was demonstrated to have a proinflammatory effect on microglia via the activation of microglial protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2). This study investigated the potential anti-neuroinflammatory effect of mast cell tryptase inhibition and the underlying mechanism of PAR-2/p-p38/NFkappaB signaling following asphyxia-induced cardiac arrest in rats. METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats resuscitated from 10 min of asphyxia-induced cardiac arrest were randomized to four separate experiments including time-course, short-term outcomes, long-term outcomes and mechanism studies. The effect of mast cell tryptase inhibition on asphyxial cardiac arrest outcomes was examined after intranasal administration of selective mast cell tryptase inhibitor (APC366; 50 mug/rat or 150 mug/rat). AC55541 (selective PAR-2 activator; 30 mug/rat) and SB203580 (selective p38 inhibitor; 300 mug/rat) were used for intervention. Short-term neurocognitive functions were evaluated using the neurological deficit score, number of seizures, adhesive tape removal test, and T-maze test, while long-term cognitive functions were evaluated using the Morris water maze test. Hippocampal neuronal degeneration was evaluated by Fluoro-Jade C staining. RESULTS: Mast cell tryptase and PAR-2 were dramatically increased in the brain following asphyxia-induced cardiac arrest. The inhibition of mast cell tryptase by APC366 improved both short- and long-term neurological outcomes in resuscitated rats. Such behavioral benefits were associated with reduced expressions of PAR-2, p-p38, NFkappaB, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 in the brain as well as less hippocampal neuronal degeneration. The anti-neuroinflammatory effect of APC366 was abolished by AC55541, which when used alone, indeed further exacerbated neuroinflammation, hippocampal neuronal degeneration, and neurologic deficits following cardiac arrest. The deleterious effects aggregated by AC55541 were minimized by p38 inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of mast cell tryptase attenuated neuroinflammation, led to less hippocampal neuronal death and improved neurological deficits following cardiac arrest. This effect was at least partly mediated via inhibiting the PAR-2/p-p38/NFkappaB signaling pathway. Thus, mast cell tryptase might be a novel therapeutic target in the management of neurological impairment following cardiac arrest.
