38796962|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), as a neurodegenerative disorder, distresses the elderly in large numbers and is characterized by beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation, elevated tau protein levels, and chronic inflammation. The brain's immune system is aided by microglia and astrocytes, which produce chemokines and cytokines. Nevertheless, dysregulated expression can cause hyperinflammation and lead to neurodegeneration. CCL2/CCR2 chemokines are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases exacerbating. Inflicting damage on nerves and central nervous system (CNS) cells is the function of this axis, which recruits and migrates immune cells, including monocytes and macrophages. It has been shown that targeting the CCL2/CCR2 axis may be a therapeutic option for inflammatory diseases. Using the current knowledge about the involvement of the CCL2/CCR2 axis in the immunopathogenesis of AD, this comprehensive review synthesizes existing information. It also explores potential therapeutic options, including modulation of the CCL2/CCR2 axis as a possible strategy in AD.
