39211110|a|Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons project to the hippocampus and cortex, are critical for learning and memory, and are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). GWAS have consistently shown that genomic variants at the CD2AP gene locus are associated with significant increased risk of AD. GWAS studies have also shown that genetic variants in endocytosis genes, including RAB5A , significantly increase susceptibility to AD. Previous work in our lab has shown that CD2AP functions as a docking-scaffold/adaptor protein as a coordinator of nerve growth factor (NGF) and trophic signaling in neurons. We have also demonstrated that CD2AP positively regulates Rab5-mediated mechanisms of endocytosis in primary sensory neurons. The purpose of this study was to perform an in vivo characterization of CD2AP expression in cholinergic neurons of the brain regions most relevant to AD pathogenesis and to investigate the colocalization of CD2AP and Rab5 in cholinergic neurons of the murine basal forebrain. Brain tissue was perfused, harvested from ChAT BAC -eGFP transgenic mice (N=4 male, N=4 female; aged 10 mo), where cholinergic neurons (co-) express green fluorescence protein (GFP) in central and peripheral neurons that express choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Frozen tissue sections were used to assess the specificity of the reporter in mouse brain along with localization of both CD2AP and Rab5 (co-) expression using immunofluorescence (IF) analysis of ChAT-GFP+ neurons and primary antibodies against ChAT, CD2AP and Rab5. Image J software was used to develop and optimize a colocalization assay for CD2AP and Rab5 puncta. Experiments were repeated in a follow-up cohort of aged-adult mice (N=2 male, N=2 female; aged 18 mo). IF expression of CD2AP was quantified in the basal forebrain, diagonal band of Broca (vDB), and striatal regions and compared to results from the cortical regions of the adult mouse brain. Colocalization of CD2AP was observed in the cell bodies of ChAT-GFP+ neurons of the striatum, vDB and basal forebrain regions, where CD2AP expression intensity as well as the number of cell bodies with positive signal increased incrementally. Colocalization analyses revealed near-complete overlap of CD2AP and Rab5 expression in ChAT-GFP+ cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain region. We conclude that cholinergic neurons express CD2AP in healthy adult and aged-adult mouse brains. These data provide the first evidence of quantifiable CD2AP protein expression of cholinergic neurons specific to the diagonal band of Broca (vDB) and basal forebrain. Together with previous research from our lab, these data support a role for CD2AP in the pathogenesis of AD through orchestration of endocytosis and retrograde signaling. Ongoing studies are underway to verify these findings in a novel AD mouse model that incorporates the humanized variant of CD2AP , created by MODEL-AD, where we aim to further investigate how CD2AP variants may affect mechanistic components of Rab5 endocytosis as well as subsequent survival of cholinergic neurons in the context of known amyloid beta and Tau pathologies.
