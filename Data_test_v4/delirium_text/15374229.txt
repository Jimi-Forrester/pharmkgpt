15374229|t|Interaction of aluminum with biomolecules - any relevance to Alzheimer's disease?
15374229|a|The possible involvement of aluminum in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is discussed focusing, on the one hand, on a critical review of the analytical results concerning the brain aluminum content of AD patients, and on the other hand, on the in vitro interactions of AI(III) with biologically relevant potential AI(III) binders occurring in intracellular and/or extracellular fluids. The biomolecules considered are such as amino acids, organic and inorganic phosphates, nucleotides, catecholamines and transferrin. It is quite clear from the results that definition of the actual AI(III) species present in the biological systems is essentially important in any studies of the neurotoxic role of aluminum.
