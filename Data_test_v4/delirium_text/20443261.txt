20443261|t|[The withholding and withdrawing of life-prolonging treatment for end-stage Alzheimer disease patients].
20443261|a|Due to an increase in the number of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, issues relating to the withholding and withdrawing of life-prolonging treatment are in urgent need for discussion. We asked care-givers, nurses, doctors and lawyers what they think about the withholding and withdrawing of artificial hydration and nutrition and pneumonia therapy from end-stage Alzheimer disease patients. The most important factors affecting the withholding and withdrawing of life-prolonging treatment are: (1) advanced directives, (2) the family intention and (3) futility of treatment. In concerning the advanced directives in particular, both medical staffs and lawyers should recognize its importance. Further conversation will help medical, ethical, and legal viewpoints reach a consensus. The prevalence of advanced directives and incorporating the hospice concept in the care for end-stage Alzheimer disease patients are both necessary.
