32468149|a|OBJECTIVE: Brain calcifications are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we describe the occurrence of intracranial calcifications as a new phenotype in transgenic P301L mice overexpressing four repeat tau, a model of human tauopathy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six P301L mice (Thy1.2) and ten age-matched non-transgenic littermates of different ages were assessed. Gradient echo data were acquired in vivo and ex vivo at 7 T and 9.4 T for susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and phase imaging. In addition, ex vivo micro-computed tomography (muCT) was performed. Histochemistry and immunohistochemistry were used to investigate the nature of the imaging lesions. RESULTS: SW images revealed regional hypointensities in the hippocampus, cortex, caudate nucleus, and thalamus of P301L mice, which in corresponding phase images indicated diamagnetic lesions. Concomitantly, microCT detected hyperdense lesions, though fewer lesions were observed compared to MRI. Diamagnetic susceptibility lesions in the hippocampus increased with age. The immunochemical staining of brain sections revealed osteocalcin-positive deposits. Furthermore, intra-neuronal and vessel-associated osteocalcin-containing nodules co-localized with phosphorylated-tau (AT8 and AT100) in the hippocampus, while vascular osteocalcin-containing nodules were detected in the thalamus in the absence of phosphorylated-tau deposition. DISCUSSION: SWI and phase imaging sensitively detected intracranial calcifications in the P301L mouse model of human tauopathy.
