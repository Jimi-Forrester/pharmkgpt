35883088|a|While it is known that air borne ultrafine particulate matter (PM) may pass through the pulmonary circulation of blood at the alveolar level between lung and heart and cross the air-blood barrier, the mechanism and effects are not completely clear. In this study the imaging method fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy is adopted for visualization with high spatial resolution and quantification of ultrafine PM particles in mouse lung and heart tissues. The results showed that the median numbers of particles in lung of mice exposed to ultrafine particulate matter of diameter less than 2.5 microm was about 2.0 times more than that in the filtered air (FA)-treated mice, and about 1.3 times more in heart of ultrafine PM-treated mice than in FA-treated mice. Interestingly, ultrafine PM particles were more abundant in heart than lung, likely due to how ultrafine PM particles are cleared by phagocytosis and transport via circulation from lungs. Moreover, heart tissues showed inflammation and amyloid deposition. The component analysis of concentrated airborne ultrafine PM particles suggested traffic exhausts and industrial emissions as predominant sources. Our results suggest association of ultrafine PM exposure to chronic lung and heart tissue injuries. The current study supports the contention that industrial air pollution is one of the causative factors for rising levels of chronic pulmonary and cardiac diseases.
