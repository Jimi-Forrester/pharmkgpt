34475819|t|Decreased Alpha Peak Frequency Is Linked to Episodic Memory Impairment in Pathological Aging.
34475819|a|The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) is a largely validated neuropsychological test for the identification of amnestic syndrome from the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous electrophysiological data suggested a slowing down of the alpha rhythm in the AD-continuum as well as a key role of this rhythmic brain activity for episodic memory processes. This study therefore investigates the link between alpha brain activity and alterations in episodic memory as assessed by the FCSRT. For that purpose, 37 patients with altered FCSRT performance underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, supplemented by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/structural magnetic resonance imaging (18FDG-PET/MR), and 10 min of resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG). The individual alpha peak frequency (APF) in MEG resting-state data was positively correlated with patients' encoding efficiency as well as with the efficacy of semantic cues in facilitating patients' retrieval of previous stored word. The APF also correlated positively with patients' hippocampal volume and their regional glucose consumption in the posterior cingulate cortex. Overall, this study demonstrates that alterations in the ability to learn and store new information for a relatively short-term period are related to a slowing down of alpha rhythmic activity, possibly due to altered interactions in the extended mnemonic system. As such, a decreased APF may be considered as an electrophysiological correlate of short-term episodic memory dysfunction accompanying pathological aging.
