34986530|a|To investigate the effects of on behavior and blood brain barrier (BBB) in Alzheimer's disease mice. Thirty-eight 4-month-old APP/PS1 double transgenic mice were randomly divided into three groups: model group, low-dose group and high-dose group. Saline, and 12 g kg d were given to each group by continuous gavage once a day for respectively. The changes in activities of daily live and fear conditioning memory behavior of mice were examined by nesting behavior test and fear conditioning test, respectively. The beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) depositions in cortex and hippocampal CA1 area of mice were detected by thioflavin T staining. The CD34 and activities fibrinogen (Fib) immunofluorescence double staining were used to determine the vascular endothelial integrity and BBB exudation. Compared with model mice, activities of daily live were significantly improved in low-dose and high-dose groups (both <0.01), the fear memory ability was significantly increased in high-dose group (<0.01). The amount of Abeta deposition in cortex and hippocampal CA1 decreased significantly in high-dose group, the area ratio decreased significantly; the area ratio of Abeta deposition in hippocampal CA1 region in low-dose group also decreased (all <0.05). The proportions of CD34 positive area of cortex in low and high dose groups increased, the percentage of fibrinogen positive area decreased (all <0.05). The proportion of CD34 positive area in hippocampal CA1 region in high-dose group was significantly increased, the percentage of fibrinogen positive area decreased significantly (both <0.05). especially high-dose can improve the activities of daily live and fear conditioning memory function of APP/PS1 mice, reduce the deposition of Abeta in brain. The mechanism may be related to the reduction of BBB permeability and the protection of the integrity of BBB.
