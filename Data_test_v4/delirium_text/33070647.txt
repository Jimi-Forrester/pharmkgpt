33070647|a|Introduction: The sigma-1 receptor (S1R) is attracting much attention for disease-modifying therapies in neurodegenerative diseases. It is a conserved protein, present in plasma and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and enriched in mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs). It modulates ER-mitochondria Ca2+ transfer and ER stress pathways. Mitochondrial and MAM dysfunctions contribute to neurodegenerative processes in diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Interestingly, the S1R can be activated by small druggable molecules and accumulating preclinical data suggest that S1R agonists are effective protectants in these neurodegenerative diseases.Area covered: In this review, we will present the data showing the high therapeutic potential of S1R drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on pridopidine as a potent and selective S1R agonist under clinical development. Of particular interest is the bi-phasic (bell-shaped) dose-response effect, representing a common feature of all S1R agonists and described in numerous preclinical models in vitro, in vivo and in clinical trials.Expert opinion: S1R agonists modulate inter-organelles communication altered in neurodegenerative diseases and activate intracellular survival pathways. Research will continue growing in the future. The particular cellular nature of this chaperone protein must be better understood to facilitate the clinical developement of promising molecules.
