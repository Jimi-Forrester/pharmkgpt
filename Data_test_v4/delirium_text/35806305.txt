35806305|t|Comparative Use of Contralateral and Sham-Operated Controls Reveals Traces of a Bilateral Genetic Response in the Rat Brain after Focal Stroke.
35806305|a|Ischemic stroke is a multifactorial disease with a complex etiology and global consequences. Model animals are widely used in stroke studies. Various controls, either brain samples from sham-operated (SO) animals or symmetrically located brain samples from the opposite (contralateral) hemisphere (CH), are often used to analyze the processes in the damaged (ipsilateral) hemisphere (IH) after focal stroke. However, previously, it was shown that focal ischemia can lead to metabolic and transcriptomic changes not only in the IH but also in the CH. Here, using a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model and genome-wide RNA sequencing, we identified 1941 overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a cutoff value >1.5 and Padj < 0.05 that reflected the general transcriptome response of IH subcortical cells at 24 h after tMCAO using both SO and CH controls. Concomitantly, 861 genes were differentially expressed in IH vs. SO, whereas they were not vs. the CH control. Furthermore, they were associated with apoptosis, the cell cycle, and neurotransmitter responses. In turn, we identified 221 DEGs in IH vs. CH, which were non-DEGs vs. the SO control. Moreover, they were predominantly associated with immune-related response. We believe that both sets of non-overlapping genes recorded transcriptome changes in IH cells associated with transhemispheric differences after focal cerebral ischemia. Thus, the specific response of the CH transcriptome should be considered when using it as a control in studies of target brain regions in diseases that induce a global bilateral genetic response, such as stroke.
