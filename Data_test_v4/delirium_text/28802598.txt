28802598|a|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate effect of parecoxib sodium pretreatment combined with dexmedetomidine on early postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients after shoulder arthroscopy. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind study. SETTING: University-affiliated teaching hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred and fifty-two elderly patients scheduled for shoulder arthroscopy. INTERVENTIONS: At 15min before the induction of anesthesia, 152 patients received intravenously parecoxib sodium 40mg and dexmedetomidine at a dose of 0.5mug/kg over 15min, followed by a continuous infusion at a rate of 0.5mug/kg/h until the end of surgery. Then all patients who received postoperative patient-controlled intravenous analgesia were divided 2 groups: sufentanil(0.04mug/kg/h, S group), sufentanil (0.04mug/kg/h) plus dexmedetomidine(0.06mug/kg/h) (SD group). MEASUREMENTS: The mini-mental status examination score in SD group was significantly higher than S group at 1, 2 and 7days after surgery. The incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction during 7days after surgery in S and SD groups was respectively 17.1% and 6.7%. Compared with the S group, the visual analogue scale scores at rest and upon movement were significantly lower at 6, 14, 24, 36 and 48h after surgery in SD group; analgesia pump liquid amount during 24h after surgery and number of rescue analgesia during 48h after surgery were significantly lower in SD group. Jugular venous oxygen partial pressure and jugular venous oxygen saturation values in SD group were significantly higher than S group at postoperative 24h. The occurrence of nausea and vomiting within 48h after surgery in SD group were significantly lower than S group. We found no complications including respiratory depression and sinus bradycardia within 48h after surgery in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Parecoxib sodium pretreatment combined with dexmedetomidine could reduce the incidence of early postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients. This might be related to the improvement of postoperative analgesia effect and cerebral oxygen metabolism in patients.
