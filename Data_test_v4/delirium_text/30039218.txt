30039218|a|BACKGROUND: The purpose of this work was to determine the optimal tracer kinetic model of 11C-PIB and to validate the use of the simplified methods retention index (RI) and standardized uptake value (SUV) for quantification of cardiac 11C-PIB uptake in amyloidosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Single-tissue, reversible and irreversible two-tissue models were fitted to data from seven cardiac amyloidosis patients who underwent 11C-PIB PET scans and arterial blood sampling for measurement of blood radioactivity and metabolites. The irreversible two-tissue model (2Tirr) best described cardiac 11C-PIB uptake. RI and SUV showed high correlation with the rate of irreversible binding (Ki) from the 2Tirr model (r2 =0.95 and r2 =0.94). Retrospective data from 10 amyloidosis patients and 5 healthy controls were analyzed using RI, SUV, as well as compartment modelling with a population-average metabolite correction. All measures were higher in amyloidosis patients than in healthy controls (p=.001), but with an overlap between groups for Ki. CONCLUSION: An irreversible two-tissue model best describes the 11C-PIB uptake in cardiac amyloidosis. RI and SUV correlate well with Ki from the 2Tirr model. RI and SUV discriminate better between amyloidosis patients and controls than Ki based on population-average metabolite correction.
