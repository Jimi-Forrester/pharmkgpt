38173031|a|Regional differences in synaptic degeneration may underlie differences in clinical presentation and neuropathological disease progression in Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Here, we mapped and quantified synaptic degeneration in cortical brain regions in PD, PD with dementia (PDD) and DLB, and assessed whether regional differences in synaptic loss are linked to axonal degeneration and neuropathological burden. We included a total of 47 brain donors, 9 PD, 12 PDD, 6 DLB and 20 non-neurological controls. Synaptophysin+ and SV2A+ puncta were quantified in eight cortical regions using a high throughput microscopy approach. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) immunoreactivity, Lewy body (LB) density, phosphorylated-tau and amyloid-beta load were also quantified. Group differences in synaptic density, and associations with neuropathological markers and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores, were investigated using linear mixed models. We found significantly decreased synaptophysin and SV2A densities in the cortex of PD, PDD and DLB cases compared to controls. Specifically, synaptic density was decreased in cortical regions affected at Braak alpha-synuclein stage 5 in PD (middle temporal gyrus, anterior cingulate and insula), and was additionally decreased in cortical regions affected at Braak alpha-synuclein stage 4 in PDD and DLB compared to controls (entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus and fusiform gyrus). Synaptic loss associated with higher NfL immunoreactivity and LB density. Global synaptophysin loss associated with longer disease duration and higher CDR scores. Synaptic neurodegeneration occurred in temporal, cingulate and insular cortices in PD, as well as in parahippocampal regions in PDD and DLB. In addition, synaptic loss was linked to axonal damage and severe alpha-synuclein burden. These results, together with the association between synaptic loss and disease progression and cognitive impairment, indicate that regional synaptic loss may underlie clinical differences between PD and PDD/DLB. Our results might provide useful information for the interpretation of synaptic biomarkers in vivo.
