35566537|t|The Association between Vision Impairment and Depression: A Systematic Review of Population-Based Studies.
35566537|a|We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate whether depression is associated with vision impairment (VI) in population-based studies in adults. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched, from inception to June 2020. Studies were included if they provided two-by-two data for calculating the OR of association between VI and depression, or crude and/or an adjusted odds ratio (OR) with a corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were reported. The proportion of VI and depression was also extracted. ORs were pooled using random-effect models, proportions were pooled using random intercepts logistic regression models. Overall, 29 articles (31 studies) were included: of those, 18 studies used survey data (622,312 participants), 10 used clinical examination data (69,178 participants), and 3 used administrative databases (48,162,290 participants). The proportion of depression (95%CI) was 0.17 (0.13-0.22) overall and 0.27 (0.21-0.33) in VI subjects. The proportion of VI was 0.10 (0.07-0.16) overall and 0.20 (0.13-0.29) in depressed subjects. The association between VI and depression was direct: crude ORs were 1.89 (1.51-2.37) for survey data, 2.17 (1.76-2.67) for clinical examination data, and 3.34 (1.01-11.11) for administrative databases; adjusted ORs were 1.75 (1.34-2.30), 1.59 (1.22-1.96), and 2.47 (0.97-6.33), respectively. In conclusion, VI and depression are prevalent morbidities and should be actively sought when either is identified, especially in older adults.
