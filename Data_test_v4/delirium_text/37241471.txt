37241471|t|Fabricated High-Strength, Low-Elastic Modulus Biomedical Ti-24Nb-4Zr-8Sn Alloy via Powder Metallurgy.
37241471|a|With the huge demands of an aging society, it is urgent to develop a new generation of non-toxic titanium alloy to match the modulus of human bone. Here, we prepared bulk Ti2448 alloys by powder metallurgy technology, and focused on the influence of the sintering process on the porosity, phase composition, and mechanical properties of the initial sintered samples. Furthermore, we performed solution treatment on the samples under different sintering parameters to further adjust the microstructure and phase composition, so as to achieve strength enhancement and reduction of Young's modulus. Solution treatment can effectively inhibit the continuous alpha phase precipitated along the grain boundaries of the beta matrix, which is beneficial to the fracture resistance. Therefore, the water-quenched sample exhibits good mechanical properties due to the absence of acicular alpha-phase. Samples sintered at 1400  C and subsequently water quenched have excellent comprehensive mechanical properties, which benefit from high porosity and the smaller feature size of microstructure. To be specific, the compressive yield stress is 1100 MPa, the strain at fracture is 17.5%, and the Young's modulus is 44 GPa, which are more applicable to orthopedic implants. Finally, the relatively mature sintering and solution treatment process parameters were screened out for reference in actual production.
