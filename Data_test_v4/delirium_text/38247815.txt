38247815|a|The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the forefront the intricate relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on neurological complications, including potential links to neurodegenerative processes, characterized by a dysfunction of the protein quality control systems and ER stress. This review article explores the role of protein quality control systems, such as the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), the Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Degradation (ERAD), the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), autophagy and the molecular chaperones, in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our hypothesis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 produces ER stress and exploits the protein quality control systems, leading to a disruption in proteostasis that cannot be solved by the host cell. This disruption culminates in cell death and may represent a link between SARS-CoV-2 and neurodegeneration.
