18982928|a|Hearing the voices of people living with dementia assists in a better understanding of their experiences. This understanding can pave the way for improved community-based service delivery such as education and counseling, as well as including them more frequently as research participants. The voices of people living with dementia have not been well represented in research, resulting in very few data describing their experiences. This paper describes empirical qualitative data from a study that asked people with Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease about their experiences. Recommendations are provided on education, counseling, and research.
