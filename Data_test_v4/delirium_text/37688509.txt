37688509|t|Oral microbiota in human health and disease: A perspective.
37688509|a|The evolution of medical knowledge about oral microbiota has increased awareness of its important role for the entire human body health. A wide range of microbial species colonizing the oral cavity interact both with each other and with their host through complex pathways. Usually, these interactions lead to a harmonious coexistence (i.e. eubiosis). However, several factors - including diet, poor oral hygiene, tobacco smoking, and certain medications, among others - can disrupt this weak homeostatic balance (i.e. dysbiosis) with potential implications on both oral (i.e. development of caries and periodontal disease) and systemic health. This article is thus aimed at providing an overview on the importance of oral microbiota in mediating several physiological and pathological conditions affecting human health. In this context, strategies based on oral hygiene and diet as well as the role of probiotics supplementation are discussed.
