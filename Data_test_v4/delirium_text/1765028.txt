1765028|t|[SEP monitoring during clonidine therapy of alcohol delirium].
1765028|a|In 12 patients with developing alcohol withdrawal syndrome after abdomino-thoracic surgical procedures who were treated with Clonidine, short latency somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded. Clonidine leads to a good sedation, anxiolysis and moderated the psychotic symptoms. However, there was no significant correlation between the Clonidine medication and the SEP results over the time of drug administration concerning the primary cortical response N20 and the following N20/P25 wave. Therefore, the short-latency SEP-recording cannot provide a reliable monitoring of the good sedative effect of Clonidine in alcoholic withdrawal. The SEP responses after Clonidine are like those of morphine and are thought to have a similar central mode of action.
