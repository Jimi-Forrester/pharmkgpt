34691459|t|Diagnostic significance of fat globules in blood in fulminant-type fat embolism syndrome.
34691459|a|Fat globule detection in the blood in fat embolism syndrome (FES) diagnosis remains controversial. This case illustrates two life-threatening, possibly FES-related, episodes with dramatic increases in blood fat globule level. Future studies should aim at evaluating the significance of the quantitative changes in blood fat levels in diagnosing FES.
