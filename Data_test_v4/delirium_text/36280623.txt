36280623|a|OBJECTIVE: Alternatives to conventional acute hospitalizations have been particularly useful during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known on the management and outcomes of COVID-19 in older patient admitted to non-acute settings. The main aim of this study was to determine the effect of geriatrics syndromes on functional outcomes in older COVID-19 patients cared in sub-acute units. METHODS: Prospective multicenter observational cohort study of patients aged 65 years and older with COVID-19, admitted to sub-acute units in Italy and Spain. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to test the association between geriatric syndromes and other clinical variables, and the functional status at discharge, defined by a Barthel Index >  = 80. RESULTS: A total of 158 patients were included in the study with a median age of 82 [Interquartile Range 81, 83]; of these 102 (65%) patients had a Barthel Index >= 80 at discharge. In the main multivariable logistic regression model a higher severity of frailty-measured with the Clinical Frailty Scale-(OR 0.30; CI 0.18-0.47), and the presence of delirium (OR 0.04; CI 0.00-0.35) at admission were associated with lower odds of a higher functional status at discharge. Other variables associated with lower functional status were female gender (OR 0.36; CI 0.13-0.96), and a higher number of comorbidities (OR 0.48; CI 0.26-0.82). CONCLUSION: The study reports a relatively high prevalence of functional recovery for older COVID-19 patients admitted to sub-acute units. Additionally, it underlines the importance of targeting geriatrics syndromes, in particular frailty and delirium, for their possible effects on functional recovery.
