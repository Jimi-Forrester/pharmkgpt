36442960|t|Brain PET Imaging: Frontotemporal Dementia.
36442960|a|Brain PET adds value in diagnosing neurodegenerative disorders, especially frontotemporal dementia (FTD) due to its syndromic presentation that overlaps with a variety of other neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. 18F-FDG-PET has improved sensitivity and specificity compared with structural MR imaging, with optimal diagnostic results achieved when both techniques are utilized. PET demonstrates superior sensitivity compared with SPECT for FTD diagnosis that is primarily a supplement to other imaging and clinical evaluations. Tau-PET and amyloid-PET primary use in FTD diagnosis is differentiation from Alzheimer disease, although these methods are limited mainly to research settings.
