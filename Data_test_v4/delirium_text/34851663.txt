34851663|a|Skin allo- and xenotransplantation are the standard treatment for major burns when donor sites for autografts are not available. The relationship between the immune response to foreign grafts and their impact on wound healing has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated changes in collagen architecture after xenogeneic implantation of human biologic scaffolds. We show that collagen deposition in response to the implantation of human split-thickness skin grafts (hSTSGs) containing live cells recapitulates normal skin architecture, whereas human acellular dermal matrix (ADM) grafts led to a fibrotic collagen deposition. We show that macrophage differentiation in response to hSTSG implantation is driven toward regenerative Trem2+ subpopulations and found that hydrogel delivery of these cells significantly accelerated wound closure. Our study identifies the preclinical therapeutic potential of Trem2+ macrophages to mitigate fibrosis and promote wound healing, providing a novel effective strategy to develop advanced cell therapies for complex wounds.
