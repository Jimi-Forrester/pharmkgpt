38524052|t|Effect of Low-Dose Aspirin on the Elderly.
38524052|a|Aspirin is a recognized and affordable antiplatelet medicine. Low amounts of aspirin have been used to prevent cardiovascular events, and it is still widely used for primary and secondary stroke prevention. The purpose of this review article is to evaluate the effects of using low doses of aspirin among elderly people. Although taking large dosages of aspirin (500 mg daily) reduces the long-term risk of colorectal cancer, its effectiveness for long-term prevention may be limited by adverse effects. Studies have assessed the relationship between aspirin dosage, incidence, and death in patients with colorectal cancer. Research has indicated that those with diabetes mellitus have an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Low amounts of aspirin have been used to prevent cardiovascular events. However, there is uncertainty regarding the potential benefits and risks associated with preventing the development of cardiovascular problems in individuals with diabetes. The use of aspirin lowers the risk of occlusive vascular events but raises the possibility of bleeding. More attention should be paid to reducing inappropriate aspirin usage in light of its prevalence, particularly among older persons, as the substantial continuous usage of this drug increases the chances of bleeding.
