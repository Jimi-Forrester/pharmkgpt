38569709|t|Protocol for a randomised controlled trial: optimisation of perioperative analgesia protocol for uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.
38569709|a|INTRODUCTION: Postoperative pain after thoracic surgery impairs patients' quality of life and increases the incidence of respiratory complications. Optimised analgesia strategies include minimally invasive incisions, regional analgesia and early chest tube removal. However, little is known about the optimal analgesic regimen for uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (uVATS). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a single-centre, prospective, single-blind, randomised trial. The effects of postoperative analgesia will be tested using thoracic paravertebral block (PVB) in combination with patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PVB+PCIA), erector spinae plane block (ESPB) in combination with patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (ESPB+PCIA) or PCIA alone; 102 patients undergoing uVATS will be enrolled in this study. Patients will be randomly assigned to the PVB group (30 mL of 0.33% ropivacaine with dexamethasone), ESPB group (40 mL of 0.25% ropivacaine with dexamethasone) or control groups. PCIA with sufentanil will be administered to all patients after surgery. The primary outcome will be total opioid consumption after surgery. Secondary outcomes include postoperative pain score; postoperative chronic pain at rest and during coughing; sensations of touch and pain in the chest wall, non-opioid analgesic consumption; length of stay; ambulation time, the total cost of hospitalisation and long-term postoperative analgesia. Adverse reactions to analgesics and adverse events related to the regional blocks will also be recorded. The statisticians will be blinded to the group allocation. Comparison of the continuous data among the three groups will be performed using a one-way analysis of variance to assess differences among the means. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The results will be published in patient education courses, academic conferences and peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT06016777.
