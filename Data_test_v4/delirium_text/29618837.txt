29618837|t|Ventilator Dependence Risk Score for the Prediction of Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation in Patients Who Survive Sepsis/Septic Shock with Respiratory Failure.
29618837|a|We intended to develop a scoring system to predict mechanical ventilator dependence in patients who survive sepsis/septic shock with respiratory failure. This study evaluated 251 adult patients in medical intensive care units (ICUs) between August 2013 to October 2015, who had survived for over 21 days and received aggressive treatment. The risk factors for ventilator dependence were determined. We then constructed a ventilator dependence (VD) risk score using the identified risk factors. The ventilator dependence risk score was calculated as the sum of the following four variables after being adjusted by proportion to the beta coefficient. We assigned a history of previous stroke, a score of one point, platelet count less than 150,000/muL a score of one point, pH value less than 7.35 a score of two points, and the fraction of inspired oxygen on admission day 7 over 39% as two points. The area under the curve in the derivation group was 0.725 (p < 0.001). We then applied the VD risk score for validation on 175 patients. The area under the curve in the validation group was 0.658 (p = 0.001). VD risk score could be applied to predict prolonged mechanical ventilation in patients who survive sepsis/septic shock.
