31058197|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with extensive burns usually develop pro-coagulation soon after the injury if there is no sepsis occurred. We describe the case of an extensive burn adult suffering from hypocoagulation not related to sepsis, but secondary to antibiotic treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a case of an adult male patient suffering from flame burns of 45% total body surface area (40% full thickness) combined with inhalation injury. Hypocoagulopathy with soaring prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time value occurred on third week post-burn while systemic infection had been under control by application of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Investigations showed that not the infection but vitamin K-related coagulation factor deficiency were responsible for unexpected bleeding. However, supplemental vitamin K was not the key as we expected, which prompted us trying to decode the underlying cause of coagulation disturbance in this patient and pick out the most effective treatment for live-saving. After the withdrawal of highly suspected broad-spectrum antibiotic, Meropenem , disturbed vitamin K related coagulation factors gradually restored to their optimal levels so as to maintain normal coagulation status. Therefore, surgical procedures without further risk of bleeding could be carried out in time for wound recovery. The patient was discharged on post-burn day 67 and transferred to a secondary hospital for his rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: Hypocoagulopathy may be devoted to different reasons other than sepsis in extensive burns. Early recognition of the cause for coagulation disturbance is critical to make appropriate treatment and save patients' lives. This case illustrated the importance of unveiling the mist cause for coagulation disturbance occurred in extensive burn patient, which paved the way for optimal life-saving treatments. And we also recommend burn surgeons to be alerted to antibiotic-induced vitamin K deficiency-related coagulopathy among critical burn patients.
