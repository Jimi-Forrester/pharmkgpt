38587958|t|CE-GAN: Community Evolutionary Generative Adversarial Network for Alzheimer's Disease Risk Prediction.
38587958|a|In the studies of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), researchers often focus on the associations among multi-omics pathogeny based on imaging genetics data. However, current studies overlook the communities in brain networks, leading to inaccurate models of disease development. This paper explores the developmental patterns of AD from the perspective of community evolution. We first establish a mathematical model to describe functional degeneration in the brain as the community evolution driven by entropy information propagation. Next, we propose an interpretable Community Evolutionary Generative Adversarial Network (CE-GAN) to predict disease risk. In the generator of CE-GAN, community evolutionary convolutions are designed to capture the evolutionary patterns of AD. The experiments are conducted using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. CE-GAN achieves 91.67% accuracy and 91.83% area under curve (AUC) in AD risk prediction tasks, surpassing advanced methods on the same dataset. In addition, we validated the effectiveness of CE-GAN for pathogeny extraction. The source code of this work is available at https://github.com/fmri123456/CE-GAN.
