39254567|a|JOURNAL/nrgr/04.03/01300535-202507000-00028/figure1/v/2024-09-09T124005Z/r/image-tiff Alzheimer's disease is characterized by deposition of amyloid-beta, which forms extracellular neuritic plaques, and accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau, which aggregates to form intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, in the brain. The NLRP3 inflammasome may play a role in the transition from amyloid-beta deposition to tau phosphorylation and aggregation. Because NLRP3 is primarily found in brain microglia, and tau is predominantly located in neurons, it has been suggested that NLRP3 expressed by microglia indirectly triggers tau phosphorylation by upregulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here, we found that neurons also express NLRP3 in vitro and in vivo, and that neuronal NLRP3 regulates tau phosphorylation. Using biochemical methods, we mapped the minimal NLRP3 promoter and identified FUBP3 as a transcription factor regulating NLRP3 expression in neurons. In primary neurons and the neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2A, FUBP3 is required for endogenous NLRP3 expression and tau phosphorylation only when amyloid-beta is present. In the brains of aged wild-type mice and a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, FUBP3 expression was markedly increased in cortical neurons. Transcriptome analysis suggested that FUBP3 plays a role in neuron-mediated immune responses. We also found that FUBP3 trimmed the 5' end of DNA fragments that it bound, implying that FUBP3 functions in stress-induced responses. These findings suggest that neuronal NLRP3 may be more directly involved in the amyloid-beta-to-phospho-tau transition than microglial NLRP3, and that amyloid-beta fundamentally alters the regulatory mechanism of NLRP3 expression in neurons. Given that FUBP3 was only expressed at low levels in young wild-type mice and was strongly upregulated in the brains of aged mice and Alzheimer's disease mice, FUBP3 could be a safe therapeutic target for preventing Alzheimer's disease progression.
