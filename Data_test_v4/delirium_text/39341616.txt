39341616|t|The Geriatric Patient: Frailty, Prehabilitation, and Postoperative Delirium.
39341616|a|Historically and for ease of classification, the geriatric patient has received a chronologic definition of a person 65 years and older. Chronologic age remains an independent risk of postoperative complications and adverse surgical outcomes. Frailty is an expression of an individual's biological age and as such a more reliable determination of their vulnerabilities or resilience to stress. The concept of prehabilitation has shown promise as a proactive approach to optimize a patient's functional, cognitive, nutritional, and emotional in preparation for surgical interventions. Postoperative delirium is the most common neuropsychological complication after surgery.
