32695433|a|BACKGROUND: Falls represent a major health problem for older adults with cognitive impairment, and the effects of exercise for fall reduction are understudied in this population. This pilot randomized controlled trial evaluated the feasibility, safety, and exploratory effectiveness of a Dalcroze eurhythmics program and a home exercise program designed for fall prevention in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early dementia. METHODS: For this three-arm, single-blind, 12-month randomized controlled pilot trial, we recruited community-dwelling women and men age 65 years and older with MCI or early dementia through participating memory clinics in Zurich, Switzerland. Participants were randomly assigned to a Dalcroze eurhythmics group program, a simple home exercise program (SHEP), or a non-exercise control group. All participants received 800 IU of vitamin D3 per day. The main objective of the study was to test the feasibility of recruitment and safety of the interventions. Additional outcomes included fall rate, gait performance, and cognitive function. RESULTS: Over 12 months, 221 older adults were contacted and 159 (72%) were screened via telephone. Following screening, 12% (19/159) met the inclusion criteria and were willing to participate. One participant withdrew at the end of the baseline visit and 18 were randomized to Dalcroze eurhythmics (n = 7), SHEP (n = 5), or control (n = 6). Adherence was similarly low in the Dalcroze eurhythmics group (56%) and in the SHEP group (62%; p = 0.82). Regarding safety and pilot clinical endpoints, there were no differences between groups. CONCLUSION: The MOVE for your MIND pilot study showed that recruitment of older adults with MCI or early dementia for long-term exercise interventions is challenging. While there were no safety concerns, adherence to both exercise programs was low. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02279316. Registered on 31 October 2014.
