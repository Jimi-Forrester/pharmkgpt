37723384|t|Standardized approach for extubation during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome: a prospective observational study.
37723384|a|BACKGROUND: Extubation during extracorporeal oxygenation (ECMO) in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has not been well studied. Despite the potential benefits of this strategy, weaning from ECMO before liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation remains the most frequent approach. Our aim was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a standardized approach for extubation during ECMO in patients with severe ARDS. RESULTS: We conducted a prospective observational study to assess the safety and feasibility of a standardized approach for extubation during ECMO in severe ARDS among 254 adult patients across 4 intensive care units (ICU) from 2 tertiary ECMO centers over 6 years. This consisted of a daily assessment of clinical and gas exchange criteria based on an Extracorporeal Life Support Organization guideline, with extubation during ECMO after validation by a dedicated intensive care medicine specialist. Fifty-four (21%) patients were extubated during ECMO, 167 (66%) did not reach the clinical criteria, and in 33 (13%) patients, gas exchange precluded extubation during ECMO. At ECMO initiation, there were fewer extrapulmonary organ dysfunctions (lower SOFA score [OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79-0.98; P = .02] with similar PaO2/FiO2) when compared with patients not extubated during ECMO. Extubation during ECMO associated with shorter duration of invasive mechanical ventilation (7 (4-18) vs. 32 (18-54) days; P < .01) and of ECMO (12 (7-25) vs. 19 (10-41) days; P = .01). This was accompanied by a lower incidence of hemorrhagic shock (2 vs. 11%; P = .05), but more cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis (49 vs. 31%; P = .02) and failed extubation (20 vs. 6%; P < .01). There were no increased major adverse events. Extubation during ECMO is associated with a lower risk of all-cause death, independently of measured confounding (adjusted logistic regression OR 0.23; 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.69, P = .008). CONCLUSIONS: A standardized approach was safe and feasible allowing extubation during ECMO in 21% of patients with severe ARDS, selecting patients who will have a shorter duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, ECMO course, and ICU stay, as well as fewer infectious complications, and high hospital survival.
