24254426|a|OBJECTIVE: Feeding disability is a known problem in old people, particularly in those with dementia. This study was aimed to acquire information about feeding problems and factors associated with them in old psychiatric patients. METHODS: This study was part of the Gerontopsychiatry study Berlin (Gepsy-B), an investigation of the data of all older inpatients (>= 65 years) admitted to a psychiatric hospital within 3 years. RESULTS: Of 1266 admissions 284 cases (22.4 %) were identified as having disability of feeding or drinking. Persons living in institutionalized care were frequently referred because of feeding problems. The patients with disability to feed oneself were older than the rest of 80.7 +- 8.2 vs. 77.2 +- 7.7 years, U-test, z = - 6.33; p < 0.001). 84.5 % showed cognitive disorders (dementia or/and delirium), 22.4 % mood disorders and 8.5 % delusions or schizophrenia. 50 % needed parenteral nutrition temporarily. The outcome of patients with feeding problems was worse. CONCLUSIONS: Old psychiatric patients with disability of feeding oneself mostly suffered from cognitive disorders.
