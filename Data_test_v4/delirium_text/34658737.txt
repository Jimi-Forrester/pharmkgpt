34658737|a|Despite the advances in pediatric anesthesia, infants have higher mortality and critical incidents rates than children, especially ex-prematures and those with comorbidity. We present the case of a high-risk infant who underwent elective laparoscopic gastrostomy under opioid-free anesthesia (OFA) combined with transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block with Dexmedetomidine (DEX). Perioperative opioids were entirely avoided, and intraoperative anesthetics and postoperative analgesic were considerably reduced. The infant showed cardiorespiratory stability and optimal analgesia during the uneventful procedure and the postoperative period. We consider OFA and TAP block with DEX a safe and effective anesthetic combination for high-risk infants.
