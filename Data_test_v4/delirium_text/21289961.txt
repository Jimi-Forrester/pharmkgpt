21289961|a|BACKGROUND: The use of statins in secondary prevention of cardiovascular events is well established. However, there is ongoing discussion about the use of statins in the context of primary prevention. Moreover statins - besides cholesterol-lowering effects - are assumed to have pleiotropic effects. Positive impacts on diseases like stroke, Alzheimer's disease or osteoporosis are discussed but still have to be proven. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this report is first to investigate the efficacy and effectiveness of statins in primary prevention of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular events and second to examine the economic implications for Germany - particularly in comparison to existing prevention programs. Finally ethical questions are considered. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed for the period between 1998 and 2004 which yielded 3704 abstracts. Overall 43 articles were included for assessment and 167 for background information, according to predefined selection criteria. RESULTS: Most studies within the context of primary prevention describe significant risk reductions with regard to cardiovascular events; yet no significant results according to the reduction of the overall mortality rate can be seen. With respect to stroke, osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease results are inconsistent. Regarding cost-effectiveness of primary prevention with statins results turn out to be inconsistent as well or even negative for populations with low to moderate risk. For groups with high cardiovascular risk the intervention is mostly assessed to be cost-effective. No cost-effectiveness study for Germany was found. According to a rough estimate of future expenses statin drug expenses of the German legal health insurance might increase at least by 50% in the case of an enlargement of the group of recipients. DISCUSSION: To thoroughly estimate the cost-effectiveness of the use of statins in primary prevention in Germany a model calculation including all relevant parameters has to be done. Moreover - from the economic as well as from the ethic point of view - one of the most important issues in primary prevention therapy is the question of compliance. The amount of risk reduction seen in primary prevention studies can be achieved only if patients as well as doctors follow therapeutic instructions and medical guidelines (as for example the guidelines of the "Adult Treatment Panel III", the "European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice" or the guidelines of the German Association of Cardiology and of the "Arzneimittelkommission der deutschen Arzteschaft fur Koronare Herzkrankheit"). CONCLUSION: For (primary) prevention of cardiovascular diseases the use of statins as suggested in guidelines is recommended - provided that these guidelines are scientifically evaluated at regular intervals. Regarding stroke, osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease definite conclusions cannot be drawn at present. Particular attention has to be paid to the problem of compliance both in statin-therapy as well as in alternative therapies. The cost-effectiveness of primary prevention with statins mainly depends on the development of statin prices.
