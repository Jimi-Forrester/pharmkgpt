33484304|a|INTRODUCTION: Treatment of older adult hip fracture patients can be challenging and requires early postoperative mobilisation to prevent complications. Simple clinical tools to predict mobilisation/weight-bearing difficulties after hip fracture surgery are scarcely available and analysis of handgrip strength could be a feasible approach. In the present study, we hypothesised that patients with reduced handgrip strength show incapability to follow postoperative weight-bearing instructions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-four patients aged >= 65 years with a proximal femur fracture (trochanteric, n = 45 or femoral neck, n = 39), who were admitted to a certified orthogeriatric center, were consecutively enrolled in a prospective study design. Five days after surgery (intramedullary nailing or arthroplasty), a standardised assessment of handgrip strength and a gait analysis (via insole forcesensors) was performed. RESULTS: Handgrip strength showed positive correlation with average peak force during gait on the affected limb (0.259), postoperative Parker Mobility Score (0.287) and Barthel Index (0.306). Only slight positive correlation was observed with gait speed (0.157). These results were congruent with multivariate regression analysis. CONCLUSION: Assessment of handgrip strength is a simple and reliable tool for early prediction of postoperative mobilisation complications like the inability to follow weight-bearing instructions in older hip fracture patients. Follow-up studies should evaluate if these findings also match with other fracture types and result in personalised adjustment of current aftercare patterns. In addition, efforts should be made to combine objectively collected data as handgrip strength or gait speed in a prediction model for long-term outcome of orthogeriatric patients.
