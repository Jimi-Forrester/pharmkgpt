32988369|t|Dexmedetomidine versus midazolam on cough and recovery quality after partial and total laryngectomy - a randomized controlled trial.
32988369|a|BACKGROUND: During emergence from anesthesia after partial and total laryngectomy, excessive airway reflex and systemic hypertension may lead to subcutaneous emphysema, hemorrhage or pneumothorax. METHODS: American Society of Anesthesiologist physical status III and IV male adults undergoing elective laryngectomy were recruited and randomly allocated to receive either dexmedetomidine (group D) or midazolam (group M). The primary outcome was incidence and severity of cough. Pulse oximetry results (SpO2), heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were also recorded. The visual analog scale and the Ramsay sedation scale were recorded at the points of wakefulness and departure from the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Rescue analgesia consumption, the time of spontaneous breath recovery, duration of the PACU stay, and the incidence of adverse effects were also recorded. RESULTS: The prevalence of no coughing was significantly higher in group D than in group M at the points of wakefulness and departure. HR, SBP, and DBP were significantly lower in group D compared with group M, and SpO2 was significantly higher in group D than in group M at the moment of laryngectomy. Pain scores were lower in group D than in group M. The Ramsay score at the point of wakefulness was higher in group D than in group M. There was no difference in time to spontaneous breathing recovery, duration of the PACU stay, and incidence of adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with midazolam, dexmedetomidine is an effective alternative to attenuate coughing and hemodynamic changes with a low incidence of adverse events during emergence from anesthesia after partial and total laryngectomy.
