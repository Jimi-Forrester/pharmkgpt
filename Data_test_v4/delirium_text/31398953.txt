31398953|t|Metabolites from Marine Microorganisms, Micro, and Macroalgae: Immense Scope for Pharmacology.
31398953|a|Marine organisms produce a large array of natural products with relevance in drug discovery. These compounds have biological activities such as antioxidant, antibacterial, antitumor, antivirus, anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and so forth. Consequently, several of the metabolites have made it to the advanced stages of clinical trials, and a few of them are commercially available. In this review, novel information on natural products isolated from marine microorganisms, microalgae, and macroalgae are presented. Given due research impetus, these marine metabolites might emerge as a new wave of promising drugs.
