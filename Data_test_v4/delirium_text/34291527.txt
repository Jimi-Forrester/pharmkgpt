34291527|t|The effect of a game training intervention on cognitive functioning and depression symptoms in the elderly with mild cognitive impairment: A randomized controlled trial.
34291527|a|OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore whether game training could improve cognitive functioning and depression symptoms in the elderly affected by mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: A non-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted. Participants were 72 patients with MCI and depression from a nursing home in Wuhan. Participants were randomized to either the intervention group or the control group (n = 36 each). The intervention group received regular nursing care plus game training for 50 min, three times per week for 8 weeks, whereas the control group received only regular nursing care during the same research period. Cognitive functioning and depression symptoms were tested in both groups at baseline and at the end of the 8-week intervention. We used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale to assess cognitive functioning and depression symptoms, respectively. RESULTS: The 8-week game training intervention significantly improved the cognitive and depression scores when compared with the control group and baseline scores (p < 0.05). No significant difference was observed in the control group (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the implementation of game training can improve the cognitive functioning and depression symptoms of the elderly with MCI, indicated that can be widely used.
