39001502|t|Casein Kinase 1alpha-A Target for Prostate Cancer Therapy?
39001502|a|The androgen receptor (AR) is a key driver of prostate cancer (PCa) and, as such, current mainstay treatments target this molecule. However, resistance commonly arises to these therapies and, therefore, additional targets must be evaluated to improve patient outcomes. Consequently, alternative approaches for indirectly targeting the AR are sought. AR crosstalk with other signalling pathways, including several protein kinase signalling cascades, has been identified as a potential route to combat therapy resistance. The casein kinase 1 (CK1) family of protein kinases phosphorylate a multitude of substrates, allowing them to regulate a diverse range of pathways from the cell cycle to DNA damage repair. As well as its role in several signalling pathways that are de-regulated in PCa, mutational data suggest its potential to promote prostate carcinogenesis. CK1alpha is one isoform predicted to regulate AR activity via phosphorylation and has been implicated in the progression of several other cancer types. In this review, we explore how the normal biological function of CK1 is de-regulated in cancer, the impact on signalling pathways and how this contributes towards prostate tumourigenesis, with a particular focus on the CK1alpha isoform as a novel therapeutic target for PCa.
