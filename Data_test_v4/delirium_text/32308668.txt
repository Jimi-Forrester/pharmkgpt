METHODS: We retrospectively examined the prevalence of clinical and psychiatric symptoms including the mirror and TV signs in 200 subjects with AD and 200 with DLB and evaluated the relationships among the symptoms. RESULTS: The mirror sign was found in 3.0% of AD and 4.5% of DLB subjects. The TV sign was found in 1.5% of AD and 4.0% of DLB subjects. The prevalence of the mirror and TV signs was not significantly different between the AD and DLB groups. Visual hallucination, visual illusion, misidentification of person, and sleep talking were significantly more frequent in DLB than in AD subjects. The mirror sign was significantly associated with lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores, whereas the TV sign was significantly associated with the misidentification of person. CONCLUSIONS: Both the mirror and TV signs were rare even in the moderate to advanced stages of AD and DLB. The mirror sign may be independent from other delusional misidentification syndromes (DMSs). Being associated mainly with global cognitive decline, the mirror sign is unlikely attributed to any specific cognitive impairment or the dysfunction of localized brain areas. In contrast, the TV sign was significantly more often coexistent with the misidentification of person, suggesting that the TV sign may partly share common neuropsychological mechanisms with DMSs.
