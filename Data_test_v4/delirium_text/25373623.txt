25373623|t|Beclin 1 biology and its role in heart disease.
25373623|a|Macroautophagy (hereafter termed autophagy) is a highly evolutionarily conserved pathway that degrades intracellular components such as damaged organelles in lysosome. Autophagy occurs at low basal levels in virtually all types of cells, which is required for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Beclin 1 protein, encoded by the beclin 1 gene, plays a central role in the regulation of autophagy. Beclin 1 primarily functions as a scaffolding protein assembling Beclin 1 interactome to regulate Class III PI3K/VPS34 activity, which in turn, tightly controls autophagy at multiple stages. In addition to autophagy, Beclin 1 participates in the regulation of other biological processes such as endocytosis, apoptosis and phagocytosis. Fine-tuning of Beclin 1 protein levels, intracellular localization and the assembly of its interactome is pivotal for the proper execution of these biological functions. Deregulation of Beclin 1 contributes to the pathogenesis of a variety of human diseases. In this review, we summarize biology of Beclin 1 and its role in human pathology, with an emphasis on heart disease.
