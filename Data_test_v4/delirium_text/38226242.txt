38226242|a|Background: The objective of this study is to investigate the postoperative recovery quality and emotional status of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent robot-assisted and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery using the 15-item Quality of Recovery (QoR-15) scale and to analyze the correlation. Methods: We collected clinical data from 320 patients with NSCLC who underwent lobectomy using either robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS) or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) at our center from January 2021 to December 2022. We compared perioperative parameters and followed up after the operation using the QoR-15 scale to objectively assess the quality of postoperative recovery and physical and emotional status. Results: Apart from a notable distinction in anesthesia time, no significant differences were observed in other general data. Notably, the overall recovery rate for patients in the RATS group surpassed that of the VATS group (P < 0.05). Specifically, the recovery rates in the RATS group were significantly superior to those in the VATS group across nociceptive factors, emotional factors, activities of daily living, physiological factors, and cognitive ability (P < 0.05). Spearman correlation analysis between surgical methods and various indicators of the QoR-15 scale showed significant correlations between surgical methods (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The QoR-15 scale is a valuable tool for assessing the postoperative recovery quality in lung cancer patients. The RATS plays a significant role in promoting the swift postoperative recovery of patients and demonstrates excellent efficacy, safety, and reliability.
