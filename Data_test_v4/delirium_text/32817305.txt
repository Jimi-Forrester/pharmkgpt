32817305|t|Neural compensation in presymptomatic hAPP mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
32817305|a|Largely inspired from clinical concepts like brain reserve, cognitive reserve, and neural compensation, here we review data showing how neural circuits reorganize in presymptomatic and early symptomatic hAPP mice to maintain memory intact. By informing on molecular alterations and compensatory adaptations which take place in the brain before mice show cognitive impairments, these data can help to identify ultra-early disease markers that could be targeted in a therapeutic perspective aimed at preventing rather than treating cognitive deterioration.
