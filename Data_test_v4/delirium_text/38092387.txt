38092387|a|Disturbances in sleep-wake and circadian rhythms may reportedly precede the onset of cognitive symptoms in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the underlying mechanisms of these AD-induced sleep disturbances remain unelucidated. To specifically evaluate the involvement of amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers in AD-induced sleep disturbances, we examined circadian and sleep phenotypes using an Abeta-GFP transgenic (Abeta-GFP Tg) mouse characterized by intracellular accumulation of Abeta oligomers. The circadian rhythm and free-running period of wheel running activity were identical between Abeta-GFP Tg and littermate wild-type mice. The durations of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were elongated in Abeta-GFP Tg mice; however, the durations of non-REM sleep and wakefulness were unaffected. The Abeta-GFP Tg mice exhibited shifts in the electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectra toward higher frequencies in the inactive light phase. These findings suggest that the intracellular accumulation of Abeta oligomers might be associated with sleep quality; however, its impact on circadian systems is limited.
