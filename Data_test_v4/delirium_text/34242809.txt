34242809|a|The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has pushed the medical system to its breaking point. While the virus does not discriminate, the elderly and those with comorbidities, including hypertension severe obesity, diabetes mellitus, coronary disease, pneumonia and dementia, are at a greater risk for adverse outcomes due to COVID-19. While many people navigate their new normal, the question of what the long-lasting effects of the pandemic may be, lingers. To investigate how vulnerable populations are affected by the pandemic, we focused on Alzheimer's disease, a vector to understanding how the virus has impacted AD progression and risk via aging. By assessing the effect of COVID-19 on AD patients, we explore genetics, metabolism, and lifestyle factors in both COVID-19 and Alzheimer's disease that can work synergistically to precipitate adverse outcomes. This article also discusses how age-related conditions and/or age-related comorbidities susceptible to COVID-19. We also discuss possible healthy lifestyle factors reduce and/or combat COVID-19 now and in the future.
