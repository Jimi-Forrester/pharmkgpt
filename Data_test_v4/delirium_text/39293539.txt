39293539|a|BACKGROUND: Emergence delirium (ED) is a common postoperative cognitive dysfunction in children. ED may cause distress to patients and their families in the early post-anesthesia period and have long-term adverse effects on children. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE: was to verify whether dexmedetomidine can reduce the occurrence of ED in children. RESEARCH TYPE: Systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs. DATA ACQUISITION: A search was conducted on Web of Science, WHO Trials, Cochrane Library, Clinical Trials.gov, and PubMed for all published studies from inception to 23 Oct.2022. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomized clinical trials that met the following criteria: patients aged 1-18 years, study site in the PACU (Post-anesthesia care unit), incidence of ED as the primary outcome, and prophylactic use of dexmedetomidine defined as injected before admission to the PACU. RESULTS: A total of 7 randomized trials were included (6 studies during eye and neck surgery, 1 during hernia surgery), involving 512 patients (257 (50.1%) with dexmedetomidine, and 250 (49.9%) with control. ED was observed in 17.51% of the patients treated with dexmedetomidine and in 43.14% of those receiving control (risk ratio (RR) = 0.40, 95 % confidence interval [CI] [0.30 - 0.55], P < 0.00001). Additionally, the prophylactic application of dexmedetomidine also reduced the occurrence of Post-Operating Nausea and Vomiting (RR = 0.24, 95%CI [0.12 - 0.49], P = 0.0001) and PACU stay time after extubation (mean difference (MD) = -1.57, 95%CI [-3.07 to -0.07], P = 0.04). However, sensitivity analysis of RCTs showed that our effect estimates were not stable (MD = -1.78, 95%CI [-4.18 - 0.62], P = 0.15). CONCLUSION: The prophylactic use of dexmedetomidine was associated with a reduction of ED. However, our findings only apply to eye and neck surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO: CRD42022371840.
