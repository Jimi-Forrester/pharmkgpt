32551009|t|Discovery of RO7185876, a Highly Potent gamma-Secretase Modulator (GSM) as a Potential Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease.
32551009|a|gamma-Secretase (GS) is a key target for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease. While inhibiting GS led to serious side effects, its modulation holds a lot of potential to deliver a safe treatment. Herein, we report the discovery of a potent and selective gamma secretase modulator (GSM) (S)-3 (RO7185876), belonging to a novel chemical class, the triazolo-azepines. This compound demonstrates an excellent in vitro and in vivo DMPK profile. Furthermore, based on its in vivo efficacy in a pharmacodynamic mouse model and the outcome of the dose range finding (DRF) toxicological studies in two species, this compound was selected to undergo entry in human enabling studies (e.g., GLP toxicology and scale up activities).
