38790650|t|Exploring Immune Redox Modulation in Bacterial Infections: Insights into Thioredoxin-Mediated Interactions and Implications for Understanding Host-Pathogen Dynamics.
38790650|a|Bacterial infections trigger a multifaceted interplay between inflammatory mediators and redox regulation. Recently, accumulating evidence has shown that redox signaling plays a significant role in immune initiation and subsequent immune cell functions. This review addresses the crucial role of the thioredoxin (Trx) system in the initiation of immune reactions and regulation of inflammatory responses during bacterial infections. Downstream signaling pathways in various immune cells involve thiol-dependent redox regulation, highlighting the pivotal roles of thiol redox systems in defense mechanisms. Conversely, the survival and virulence of pathogenic bacteria are enhanced by their ability to counteract oxidative stress and immune attacks. This is achieved through the reduction of oxidized proteins and the modulation of redox-sensitive signaling pathways, which are functions of the Trx system, thereby fortifying bacterial resistance. Moreover, some selenium/sulfur-containing compounds could potentially be developed into targeted therapeutic interventions for pathogenic bacteria. Taken together, the Trx system is a key player in redox regulation during bacterial infection, and contributes to host-pathogen interactions, offering valuable insights for future research and therapeutic development.
