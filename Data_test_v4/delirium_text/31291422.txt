31291422|a|This paper provides estimates of mortality rates from Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD) in the elderly Brazilian population. Data were obtained from the 2010 Population Census by Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) and microdata on mortality in Brazil's 27 state capitals recorded in the Brazilian Mortality Information System (SIM) for the population 65 years or older by place of residence for the years 2009 to 2013. Corrections were obtained for underreporting of mortality, and final adjustments were made to the specific mortality rates based on Bayesian methods with prior probability distributions built on the basis of information obtained from a meta-analysis. The mortality rates from all dementias and from AD in Brazil were higher than in developed countries. The mortality rates from Alzheimer's disease in 2013 were 140.03 (95%CI: 117.05; 166.4) and 127.07 (95%CI: 103.74; 149.62) per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively, in men and women. The contribution of AD to mortality in elderly Brazilians was 4.4% (95%CI: 3.25; 5.72) in the group with 0 to 3 years of schooling, independently of age and sex. The study aimed to increase knowledge on corrected estimates of mortality rates from Alzheimer's disease based on vital statistics, providing more precise and pertinent evidence-based estimates.
