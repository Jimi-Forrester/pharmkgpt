39666092|a|Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common neurodegenerative dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet it remains under-recognized and frequently misdiagnosed due to heterogenous clinical presentations, the presence of co-pathology, and the lack of specific diagnostic tools. Pathologically, DLB is characterized by the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein (aSyn) aggregates, known as Lewy bodies. Recent advancements have improved in vivo detection of aSyn pathology through techniques such as seed amplification assays, monoclonal antibodies, and positron emission tomography using novel small-molecule ligands. The ability to detect aSyn in vivo has sparked dialogue about using biomarkers to identify individuals with aSyn, similar to the approach influencing the field of AD. Proponents argue that biological staging could facilitate the detection of preclinical disease stages, allowing for earlier intervention and targets for disease modification, and could improve diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy in selecting patients for clinical trials. However, critics caution that this method may oversimplify the complexity of DLB and overlook its clinical heterogeneity, also highlighting practical challenges related to implementation, cost, and global access to advanced diagnostic technologies. Importantly, although significant progress has been made in detecting aSyn for diagnostic purposes, disease-modifying therapies targeting aSyn have yet to demonstrate clear efficacy in slowing disease progression. Elucidating the physiological and pathophysiological roles of aSyn remains an urgent priority in neurodegenerative research. Other experimental research priorities for DLB include developing improved cellular and animal models that reflect epigenetic and environmental factors, mapping post-translational modifications, and systematically characterizing neurons that are vulnerable and resistant to lewy pathology using a multi-omic approach. Clinically, there is an urgent need for international, prospective, longitudinal studies and for validated, disease-specific outcome measures. Addressing these priorities is essential for advancing our understanding of DLB and developing effective therapies.
