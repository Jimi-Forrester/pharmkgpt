31660884|a|BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric conditions such as depression, delirium and cognitive impairment are common in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and individuals suffering from ESKD are more likely to commit suicide than members of the general population. Self-harm gestures are not infrequent for ESKD patients suffering from depression, but not well described in other conditions. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of self-harm in a patient with ESKD suffering from acute delirium. A man in his mid-seventies was admitted with fungal peritoneal dialysis (PD) associated peritonitis. On the first day post operatively, he was found with absent vital signs due to exsanguination from newly inserted central catheter which he which had self-severed. He died a few days later as a result of the self-harm gesture. CONCLUSION: This case highlights that delirium may lead to self-harm events in ESKD and identifies a few strategies to help reduce the risk of self-harm events.
