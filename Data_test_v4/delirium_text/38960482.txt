38960482|t|The crosstalk between extracellular matrix proteins and Tau.
38960482|a|Alzheimer's disease is progressive neurodegenerative disease characterize by the presence of extracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and intracellular deposits of neurofibrillary tangles of Tau. Apart from axonal depositions pathological aggregated Tau protein is known to secrete into extracellular spaces and propagate through seeding mechanism. Microglia, the immune cells of the brain display modest ability to internalize the extracellular Tau and degrade it through endolysosomal pathway. However, the excessive burden of pathoproteins weakens the phagocytic ability of microglia. Extracellular supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids (n-3) may regulate the phagocytosis of microglia as they mediate the anti-inflammatory polarization of microglia through membrane lipid compositions changes. The internalization of extracellular Tau in the microglia is regulated by cortical membrane-associated actin remodeling driven by interplay of actin-binding proteins. On the other hand, Tau display capability bind and interact with various actin-binding protein owing to the presence of proline-rich domain in the structure and regulate their activation. In this study, we hypothesize that internalization of Tau in the presence of omega-3 fatty acids would propagate the Tau-mediated activation of actin-binding proteins as well as extracellular matrix and in turn modulate cortical actin remodeling for phagocytosis.
