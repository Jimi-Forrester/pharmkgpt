33289041|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As a global pandemic, COVID-19 has profoundly disrupted the lives of individuals, families, communities, and nations. This report summarizes the expected impact of COVID-19 on behavioral health, as well as strategies to address mental health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. The state of Michigan in the USA is used to illustrate the complexity of the mental health issues and the critical gaps in the behavioral health infrastructure as they pertain to COVID-19. Scoping review was conducted to identify potential mental health needs and issues during the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. RECENT FINDINGS: The ramifications of COVID-19 on mental health are extensive, with the potential to negatively impact diverse populations including healthcare providers, children and adolescents, older adults, the LGBTQ community, and individuals with pre-existing mental illness. Suicide rates, alone, are expected to rise for Michiganders due to the economic downturn, isolation and quarantine, increased substance use, insomnia, and increased access to guns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This report promotes awareness of a behavioral health crisis due to COVID-19. Increasing access to behavioral health care should minimize COVID-19's negative influence on mental health in Michigan. We propose a three-prong approach to access: awareness, affordability, and technology. Addressing workforce development and fixing gaps in critical behavioral health infrastructure will also be essential. These actions need to be implemented immediately to prepare for the expected "surge" of behavioral health needs in the ensuing months.
