30023479|t|Design, Synthesis and Evaluation of Bifunctional Acridinine-Naphthalenediimide Redox-Active Conjugates as Antimalarials.
30023479|a|A novel class of bifunctional molecules was synthesized integrating acridine (Ac) and redox-active naphthalenediimide (NDI) scaffolds directly and through a flexible linker (en). We evaluated in vitro antiplasmodial activity, physicochemical properties, and a possible mode of action. Theoretical studies suggested electronic segmentation between the electron-rich Ac and electron-deficient NDI scaffolds. Orthogonal Ac-NDI molecules showed activities in the micromolar to submicromolar range against a chloroquine (CQ)-sensitive strain of human malaria pathogen Plasmodium falciparum (maximum activity, IC50: 0.419 muM). The flexible Ac-en-NDI molecules were most potent and showed activity in the nanomolar range against both CQ-sensitive (with most effective compounds, IC50: 3.65 and 4.33 nM) as well as CQ-resistant (with most effective compounds, IC50: 52.20 and 28.53 nM) strains of P. falciparum. Significantly, with CQ-resistant strains, the activity of the most effective compounds was 1 order of magnitude better than that of standard drug CQ. Ac-en-NDI-conjugated molecules were significantly more potent than the individual NDI and Ac-based molecules. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) suggests that the flexible spacer (en) linking the Ac and NDI scaffolds plays a vital role in exhibiting improved potency. None of the molecules triggered hemolysis in culture, and the most potent compounds did not show cytotoxicity in vitro against mammalian fibroblast NIH3T3 cells at their respective IC50 values. The other significant outcome of this work is that some of the investigated molecules have the potential to affect multiple processes in the parasite including the hemozoin formation in digestive vacuoles (DVs), mitochondrial membrane potential, and the redox homeostasis of the parasite.
