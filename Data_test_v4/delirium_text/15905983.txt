15905983|t|[The role of copper in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease].
15905983|a|Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a chronically progressive neurodegenerative disease. The key protein in the pathophysiology of AD is the amyloid precursor protein (APP) which releases the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) by proteolytic cleavage. APP is probably involved in the homeostasis of cellular copper (Cu) metabolism, because significantly changed Cu levels in the brain were found in AD patients as well as in mouse models. In vivo studies with transgenic mice showed that oral Cu supplements can restore lowered Cu levels in the brain to normal, can reduce Abeta production, and can reduce mortality of the animals. Currently, the influence of oral Cu supplementation (in addition to an established acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) on the progression of the disease is being studied in a prospective, double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled longitudinal clinical trial in patients with mild AD.
