31976837|t|Current and Future Neuropharmacological Options for the Treatment of Essential Tremor.
31976837|a|BACKGROUND: Essential Tremor (ET) is likely the most frequent movement disorder. In this review, we have summarized the current pharmacological options for the treatment of this disorder and discussed several future options derived from drugs tested in experimental models of ET or from neuropathological data. METHODS: A literature search was performed on the pharmacology of essential tremors using PubMed Database from 1966 to July 31, 2019. RESULTS: To date, the beta-blocker propranolol and the antiepileptic drug primidone are the drugs that have shown higher efficacy in the treatment of ET. Other drugs tested in ET patients have shown different degrees of efficacy or have not been useful. CONCLUSION: Injections of botulinum toxin A could be useful in the treatment of some patients with ET refractory to pharmacotherapy. According to recent neurochemical data, drugs acting on the extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, the glutamatergic system or LINGO-1 could be interesting therapeutic options in the future.
