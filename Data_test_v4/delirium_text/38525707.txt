38525707|t|Hyperglycaemia Aggravates Oxidised Low-Density Lipoprotein-Induced Schwann Cell Death via Hyperactivation of Toll-like Receptor 4.
38525707|a|Increased low-density lipoprotein levels are risk factors for diabetic neuropathy. Diabetes mellitus is associated with elevated metabolic stress, leading to oxidised low-density lipoprotein formation. Therefore, it is important to investigate the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy in diabetes complicated by dyslipidaemia with increased levels of oxidised low-density lipoprotein. Here, we examined the effects of hyperglycaemia and oxidised low-density lipoprotein treatment on Schwann cell death and its underlying mechanisms. Immortalised mouse Schwann cells were treated with oxidised low-density lipoprotein under normo- or hyperglycaemic conditions. We observed that oxidised low-density lipoprotein-induced cell death increased under hyperglycaemic conditions compared with normoglycaemic conditions. Moreover, hyperglycaemia and oxidised low-density lipoprotein treatment synergistically upregulated the gene and protein expression of toll-like receptor 4. Pre-treatment with TAK-242, a selective toll-like receptor 4 signalling inhibitor, attenuated hyperglycaemia- and oxidised low-density lipoprotein-induced cell death and apoptotic caspase-3 pathway. Our findings suggest that the hyperactivation of toll-like receptor 4 signalling by hyperglycaemia and elevated oxidised low-density lipoprotein levels synergistically exacerbated diabetic neuropathy; thus, it can be a potential therapeutic target for diabetic neuropathy.
