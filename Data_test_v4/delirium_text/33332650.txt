33332650|a|AIM: Peroxisomes play a key role in lipid metabolism, and peroxisome defects have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as X-adrenoleukodystrophy and Alzheimer's disease. This study aims to elucidate the contribution of peroxisomes in lipid alterations of area 8 of the frontal cortex in the spectrum of TDP43-proteinopathies. Cases of frontotemporal lobar degeneration-TDP43 (FTLD-TDP), manifested as sporadic (sFTLD-TDP) or linked to mutations in various genes including expansions of the non-coding region of C9ORF72 (c9FTLD), and of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS) as the most common TDP43 proteinopathies, were analysed. METHODS: We used transcriptomics and lipidomics methods to define the steady-state levels of gene expression and lipid profiles. RESULTS: Our results show alterations in gene expression of some components of peroxisomes and related lipid pathways in frontal cortex area 8 in sALS, sFTLD-TDP and c9FTLD. Additionally, we identify a lipidomic pattern associated with the ALS-FTLD-TDP43 proteinopathy spectrum, notably characterised by down-regulation of ether lipids and acylcarnitine among other lipid species, as well as alterations in the lipidome of each phenotype of TDP43 proteinopathy, which reveals commonalities and disease-dependent differences in lipid composition. CONCLUSION: Globally, lipid alterations in the human frontal cortex of the ALS-FTLD-TDP43 proteinopathy spectrum, which involve cell membrane composition and signalling, vulnerability against cellular stress and possible glucose metabolism, are partly related to peroxisome impairment.
