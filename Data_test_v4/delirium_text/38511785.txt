38511785|t|Effects of training Community Health Agents on dementia: a quasi-experimental study.
38511785|a|OBJECTIVES: to evaluate the knowledge of Community Health Agents about dementia before and after the training workshop for detecting signs of the disease. METHODS: a quasi-experimental study with 33 community agents, in which sociodemographic information and knowledge about dementia were collected and assessed using the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale before and after the workshop. There were 10 weekly, online, synchronous meetings. The Student's t-test for related samples was used, and the effect size was calculated. RESULTS: while the average score on the initial assessment, using the measurement instrument, was 16.3, it was 21.24 in the final assessment. An increase in the scale score was observed after participating in the workshop, with a value of 4.94. CONCLUSIONS: it is urgent to invest in the ongoing education of these professionals for greater awareness in the timely detection of dementia cases in primary care and awareness of potentially modifiable factors.
