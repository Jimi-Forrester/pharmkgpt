34066571|t|Cardiovascular and Pre-Frailty Risk Assessment during Shelter-In-Place Measures Based on Multimodal Biomarkers Collected from Smart Telemedical Wearables.
34066571|a|Wearable devices play a growing role in healthcare applications and disease prevention. We conducted a retrospective study to assess cardiovascular and pre-frailty risk during the Covid-19 shelter-in-place measures on human activity patterns based on multimodal biomarkers collected from smartwatch sensors. For methodology validation we enrolled five adult participants (age range: 32 to 84 years; mean 57 +- 22.38; BMI: 27.80 +- 2.95 kg/m2) categorized by age who were smartwatch users and self-isolating at home during the Covid-19 pandemic. Resting heart rate, daily steps, and minutes asleep were recorded using smartwatch sensors. Overall, we created a dataset of 464 days of continuous measurement that included 50 days of self-isolation at home during the Covid-19 pandemic. Student's t-test was used to determine significant differences between the pre-Covid-19 and Covid-19 periods. Our findings suggest that there was a significant decrease in the number of daily steps (-57.21%; -4321; 95% CI, 3722 to 4920) and resting heart rate (-4.81%; -3.04; 95% CI, 2.59 to 3.51) during the period of self-isolation compared to the time before lockdown. We found that there was a significant decrease in the number of minutes asleep (-13.48%; -57.91; 95% CI, 16.33 to 99.49) among older adults. Finally, cardiovascular and pre-frailty risk scores were calculated based on biomarkers and evaluated from the clinical perspective.
