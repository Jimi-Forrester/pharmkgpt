37347254|t|Dysphagia Prevalence and Outcomes Associated with the Evolution of COVID-19 and Its Variants in Critically Ill Patients.
37347254|a|Data collected during the 2020-21 COVID-19 alpha wave indicated dysphagia prevalence rates up to 93%. Whilst many patients recovered during hospital admission, some experienced persistent dysphagia with protracted recovery. To explore (1) prevalence, (2) treatment, and (3) recovery patterns and outcomes for swallowing, in the ICU patient with Delta and subsequent variants of COVID-19. Prospective observational study. Patients admitted to 26 Intensive Care Units (ICUs) over 12 months, diagnosed with COVID-19, treated for survival and seen by Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) for clinical swallowing assessment were included. Demographic, medical, SLP treatment, and swallowing outcome data were collected. 235 participants (63% male, median age = 58 years) were recruited. Median mechanical ventilation was 16 days, and ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS) were 20 and 42 days, respectively. ICU-Acquired Weakness (54%) and delirium (49%) were frequently observed. Prevalence of dysphagia was 94% with the majority (45%) exhibiting profound dysphagia (Functional Oral Intake Scale = 1) at initial assessment. Median duration to initiate oral feeding was 19 days (IQR = 11-44 days) from ICU admission, and 24% received dysphagia rehabilitation. Dysphagia recovery by hospital discharge was observed in 71% (median duration = 30 days [IQR = 17-56 days]). Positive linear associations were identified between duration of intubation, mechanical ventilation, hospital and ICU LOS, and duration to SLP assessment (p = 0.000), dysphagia severity (p = 0.000), commencing oral intake (p = 0.000), dysphagia recovery (p < 0.01), and enteral feeding (p = 0.000). Whilst older participants had more severe dysphagia (p = 0.028), younger participants took longer to commence oral feeding (p = 0.047). Dysphagia remains highly prevalent in ICU COVID-19 patients. Whilst invasive ventilation duration is associated with swallowing outcomes, more evidence on dysphagia pathophysiology is required to guide rehabilitation.
