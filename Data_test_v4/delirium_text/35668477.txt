35668477|t|Prevalence of palmar crease patterns and associated factors among students at University of Gondar, Northwest Ethiopia.
35668477|a|Palmar creases are unique, permanent, and genetically controlled morphological variables. Recognizing palmar crease types are important for personal identification, criminal investigations, and diagnosis of congenital diseases. This study aimed to reveal the anthropological characteristics as well as contribute to the diagnosing of congenital disease of Ethiopian people. In this study, a cross-sectional study design with a multistage sampling technique were used. Chi-square test, bivariable, and multivariable multinomial logistic regression models were employed. At bivariable analysis variables with a P-value of <=0.2 were selected for multivariable analysis and at multivariable analysis variables with a P-value of <=0.05 were considered as statistically significant factors. Most of study participants had normal palmar crease patterns (90.8%), followed by simian crease patterns (5.0%), whereas sydney crease patterns was the least (1.92%). Being male was more likely to have simian crease and sydney crease than normal crease. Right-handed subjects were less likely to have simian crease and suwon crease than normal crease. The simian crease was more common among students whose fathers were from Gurage ethnicity than normal creases. Students who have one point of origin of the primary palmar creases were more likely to have simian crease, sydney crease, and suwon crease than normal crease. In this study, the normal type of palmar crease patterns was the most prevalent. Whereas the simian crease pattern was the commonest type among the variant palmar creases. Palmar crease patterns are affected by sex, ethnicity, handedness, and points of origin of the primary palmar crease.
