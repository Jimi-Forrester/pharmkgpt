38969680|a|A major challenge in Parkinson's disease is the variability in symptoms and rates of progression, underpinned by heterogeneity of pathological processes. Biomarkers are urgently needed for accurate diagnosis, patient stratification, monitoring disease progression and precise treatment. These were previously lacking, but recently, novel imaging and fluid biomarkers have been developed. Here, we consider new imaging approaches showing sensitivity to brain tissue composition, and examine novel fluid biomarkers showing specificity for pathological processes, including seed amplification assays and extracellular vesicles. We reflect on these biomarkers in the context of new biological staging systems, and on emerging techniques currently in development.
