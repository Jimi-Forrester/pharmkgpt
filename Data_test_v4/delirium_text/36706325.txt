36706325|t|Anticholinergic Drug Burden and Risk of Incident MCI and Dementia: A Population-based Study.
36706325|a|OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether anticholinergic drug use was related to developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia in older adults at the population level. METHODS: We used an Anticholinergic Rating (ACR) scale, Clinical Dementia Rating, APOE genotype, and number of prescription medications. We examined time to incident MCI and incident dementia in a population-based cohort (n=1959). We assessed whether developing MCI or dementia was associated with (1) any anticholinergic drug use, (2) total ACR score, or (3) number of anticholinergic drugs taken. RESULTS: Taking any anticholinergic drug was significantly associated with higher risk of developing MCI; however, higher ACR score or higher number of anticholinergic drugs, compared with lower, were not associated with greater risk of developing MCI. We found no significant relationship between anticholinergic use and developing dementia. The relationship between anticholinergic use and cognitive outcome was not affected by APOE genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Among cognitively normal older adults in a population-based sample, anticholinergic drug use is independently associated with subsequently developing MCI, but not dementia. Thus, anticholinergic drug use may influence risk of MCI that is nonprogressive to dementia and potentially be a modifiable risk factor for MCI.
