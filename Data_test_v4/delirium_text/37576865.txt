37576865|t|YAP/TAZ: Molecular pathway and disease therapy.
37576865|a|The Yes-associated protein and its transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (YAP/TAZ) are two homologous transcriptional coactivators that lie at the center of a key regulatory network of Hippo, Wnt, GPCR, estrogen, mechanical, and metabolism signaling. YAP/TAZ influences the expressions of downstream genes and proteins as well as enzyme activity in metabolic cycles, cell proliferation, inflammatory factor expression, and the transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. YAP/TAZ can also be regulated through epigenetic regulation and posttranslational modifications. Consequently, the regulatory function of these mechanisms implicates YAP/TAZ in the pathogenesis of metabolism-related diseases, atherosclerosis, fibrosis, and the delicate equilibrium between cancer progression and organ regeneration. As such, there arises a pressing need for thorough investigation of YAP/TAZ in clinical settings. In this paper, we aim to elucidate the signaling pathways that regulate YAP/TAZ and explore the mechanisms of YAP/TAZ-induce diseases and their potential therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, we summarize the current clinical studies investigating treatments targeting YAP/TAZ. We also address the limitations of existing research on YAP/TAZ and propose future directions for research. In conclusion, this review aims to provide fresh insights into the signaling mediated by YAP/TAZ and identify potential therapeutic targets to present innovative solutions to overcome the challenges associated with YAP/TAZ.
