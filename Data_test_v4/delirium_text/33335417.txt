33335417|a|BACKGROUND: Agitation and anxiety occur frequently in ICU and affect about 30-80% of patients in ICU present with delirium worldwide, and it is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. This review aimed to systematically review articles and finally draw an evidence-based guideline for an area with limited resources. METHODS: The review was reported based on preferred reporting items for systemic and meta-analysis (PRISMA) protocol. We searched literature from PubMed, Google Scholar, and Medline database using keywords like the level of sedation, sedation score, pain assessment in ICU, and sedative drugs in ICU from an article published in English. After extraction with a patient population and exclusion, five randomized clinical trials, four systemic reviews and meta-analysis, four observation cohort study, and two practical guidelines were used for the review. CONCLUSION: In addition to high validity and reliability, RASS has the advantage of easiness to remember for nurses making it a preferred sedation assessment tool in an adult ICU setting. Light sedation with daily interruption was recommended with an aim of an awake and alert patient ready for the weaning trial. Propofol was preferred when sedation is for a short duration and when intermittent awakening is required. Ketamine is the preferred induction for asthmatic hypotensive and patient requiring prolonged continuous sedation. With a similar time for sedation, diazepam shows a shorter time for intubation compared to midazolam. Besides diazepam has shown a cheaper cost of sedation than midazolam. This makes it a drug of preference in a low resource setting.
