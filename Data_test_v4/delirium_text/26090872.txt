26090872|t|Age-Related Vitamin D Deficiency Is Associated with Reduced Macular Ganglion Cell Complex: A Cross-Sectional High-Definition Optical Coherence Tomography Study.
26090872|a|BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with smaller volume of optic chiasm in older adults, indicating a possible loss of the visual axons and their cellular bodies. Our objective was to determine whether vitamin D deficiency in older adults is associated with reduced thickness of the ganglion cell complex (GCC) and of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL), as measured with high-definition optical coherence tomography (HD-OCT). METHODS: Eighty-five French older community-dwellers without open-angle glaucoma and patent age-related macular degeneration (mean, 71.1+-4.7 years; 45.9% female) from the GAIT study were separated into 2 groups according to serum 25OHD level (i.e., deficient<=25 nmol/L or sufficient>25 nmol/L). Measurements of GCC and RNFL thickness were performed using HD-OCT. Age, gender, body mass index, number of comorbidities, dementia, functional autonomy, intracranial volume, visual acuity, serum calcium concentration and season of testing were considered as potential confounders. RESULTS: Mean serum 25OHD concentration was 58.4+-26.8 nmol/L. Mean logMAR visual acuity was 0.03+-0.06. Mean visual field mean deviation was -1.25+-2.29 dB. Patients with vitamin D deficiency (n=11) had a reduced mean GCC thickness compared to those without vitamin D deficiency (72.1+-7.4 mum versus 77.5+-7.5 mum, P=0.028). There was no difference of the mean RNFL thickness in these two groups (P=0.133). After adjustment for potential confounders, vitamin D deficiency was associated with reduced GCC thickness (ss=-5.12, P=0.048) but not RNFL thickness (ss=-9.98, P=0.061). Specifically, vitamin D deficiency correlated with the superior medial GCC area (P=0.017) and superior temporal GCC area (P=0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency in older patients is associated with reduced mean GCC thickness, which can represent an early stage of optic nerve damage, prior to RNFL loss.
