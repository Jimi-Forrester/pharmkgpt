26023568|a|INTRODUCTION: Dementia is the clinical symptom of alzheimer's disease. Brain cholinesterase levels and behavioural changes are the markers for Alzheimer's disease and aluminium chloride is one causative agent for polymerization of tau protein and amyloid plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease. Effect of piper nigrum and its role in prevention of alzhimer's disease and symptoms are well linked in this study. AIM: To study the effect of piper nigrum for the prevention of alzheimer's associated histopathological, biochemical and behaviour changes in rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty four rats were taken in this study. Their baseline behavioural parameters were noted and group was separated randomly in four. Rats were pretreated with piper nigrum and Alzheimer's disease was induced. Biochemical and histopathological changes were noted at the end of experiment. RESULTS: There was marked decrease in cholinesterase level, amyloidal plaque formation in rats brain who were pretreated with piper nigrum. At the same time there was decrease in escape latency time (ELT) and increase in memory in piper treated rats. CONCLUSION: Piper nigrum prove to be effective for prevention of Alzheimer's disease. This finding has to be confirmed with studies including larger population. Further research on cholinesterase inhibitors, role of flavonoids on prevention of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease can be encouraged.
