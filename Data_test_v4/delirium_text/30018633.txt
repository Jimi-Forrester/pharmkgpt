30018633|t|Thrombin Inhibition Reduces the Expression of Brain Inflammation Markers upon Systemic LPS Treatment.
30018633|a|Systemic inflammation and brain pathologies are known to be linked. In the periphery, the inflammation and coagulation systems are simultaneously activated upon diseases and infections. Whether this well-established interrelation also counts for neuroinflammation and coagulation factor expression in the brain is still an open question. Our aim was to study whether the interrelationship between coagulation and inflammation factors may occur in the brain in the setting of systemic inflammation. The results indicate that systemic injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) upregulate the expression of both inflammatory and coagulation factors in the brain. The activity of the central coagulation factor thrombin was tested by a fluorescent method and found to be significantly elevated in the hippocampus following systemic LPS injection (0.5 +- 0.15 mU/mg versus 0.2 +- 0.03 mU/mg in the control). A panel of coagulation factors and effectors (such as thrombin, FX, PAR1, EPCR, and PC) was tested in the hippocampus, isolated microglia, and N9 microglia cell by Western blot and real-time PCR and found to be modulated by LPS. One central finding is a significant increase in FX expression level following LPS induction both in vivo in the hippocampus and in vitro in N9 microglia cell line (5.5 +- 0.6- and 2.3 +- 0.1-fold of increase, resp.). Surprisingly, inhibition of thrombin activity (by a specific inhibitor NAPAP) immediately after LPS injection results in a reduction of both the inflammatory (TNFalpha, CXL9, and CCL1; p < 0.006) and coagulation responses (FX and PAR1; p < 0.004) in the brain. We believe that these results may have a profound clinical impact as they might indicate that reducing coagulation activity in the setting of neurological diseases involving neuroinflammation may improve disease outcome and survival.
