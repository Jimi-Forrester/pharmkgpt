35940942|t|CD33 isoforms in microglia and Alzheimer's disease: Friend and foe.
35940942|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disease and is considered the main cause of dementia worldwide. Genome-wide association studies combined with integrated analysis of functional datasets support a critical role for microglia in AD pathogenesis, identifying them as important potential therapeutic targets. The ability of immunomodulatory receptors on microglia to control the response to pathogenic amyloid-beta aggregates has gained significant interest. Siglec-3, also known as CD33, is one of these immunomodulatory receptors expressed on microglia that has been identified as an AD susceptibility factor. Here, we review recent advances made in understanding the multifaceted roles that CD33 plays in microglia with emphasis on two human-specific CD33 isoforms that differentially correlate with AD susceptibility. We also describe several different therapeutic approaches for targeting CD33 that have been advanced for the purpose of skewing microglial cell responses.
