35497558|a|The combinatorial use of dietary jujube (Ziziphus jujuba) and ginger play a critical role in traditional Chinese medicines, folk medicine and dietary therapy. Joint effects were investigated from the viewpoint of the antioxidant (scavenging DPPH ) and antitumor activities (against SW620 cells) of jujube polysaccharides and ginger 6-gingerol (G6G) alone and in combination. Jujube polysaccharides were extracted, purified, and characterized, and then their inhibiting and apoptotic effects alone and in combination with G6G were evaluated by the cytological tests, including Cell Counting Kit-8, colony-forming, Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide, TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, and cell cycle assays. Results showed that the purified polysaccharide fraction (ZJPs-II) with average molecular weight of 115 kDa consisted of arabinose, rhamnose, glucose, xylose, and galactose. ZJPs-II and G6G alone dose-dependently scavenged DPPH  and inhibited the proliferation of SW620 cells, while their combination showed synergistic interactions (all combination index < 1). The studies further demonstrated that ZJPs-II and G6G alone reduced the cell colony-formation, induced apoptosis and arrested the cell-cycle at G2/M phase, while their combination achieved better effects and significantly arrested the growth at the G0/G1 phase. Collectively, our findings suggest enhancing the intake of jujube polysaccharides and G6G in a combinatorial approach for maintaining health and preventing cancer.
