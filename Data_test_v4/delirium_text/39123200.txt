39123200|a|BACKGROUND: Most individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) strongly prefer independent living over living in an institution. Independent Supported Housing (ISH) provides housing rehabilitation for persons with SMI in their accommodations. However, most individuals who need housing rehabilitation live in institutional housing settings (housing rehabilitation as usual: HAU). We investigated which housing rehabilitation setting is effective on which variable in the long term to support service users to form an informed preference for either housing rehabilitation setting. METHODS: We conducted a two-year longitudinal observational non-inferiority study to test the effectiveness of ISH in improving participants' social inclusion, quality of life, emotional social support, capabilities, symptom severity, functioning, service utilisation and costs. Participants were assessed at baseline and after six, twelve, and 24 months. Mixed effects models were computed to test between-group and within-group effects. RESULTS: The study included 83 participants in ISH (n = 31) and HAU (n = 52) housing rehabilitation settings with a mean age of 36.2 years. Most participants were male (64%) and had a primary psychotic or schizophrenic (35%) or an affective diagnosis (24%). During the study, ISH participants significantly improved their quality of life (beta = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.82), symptoms (beta = -0.32; 95% CI: -0.60 to -0.03), and capabilities (beta = 4.46; 95% CI: 0.14 to 8.77) and decreased psychiatric hospitalisations (p = 0.04). HAU participants improved their quality of life (beta = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.69). Housing and rehabilitation support costs were almost half with ISH than with HAU. CONCLUSION: ISH has been shown to be much less expensive than HAU and was associated with several improvements like reduced psychiatric hospitalisations and improved quality of life. Therefore, our findings strongly argue for a preference-driven provision of housing rehabilitation services and to end the institutionalisation of persons with SMI. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered on December 04, 2018, at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03815604).
