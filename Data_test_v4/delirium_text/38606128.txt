38606128|t|Pericapsular Hip Block Guided by Ultrasonography in Elderly People with Hip Fracture in the Emergency Sector: Clinical Trial.
38606128|a|Objectives  This study evaluated pain intensity in elderly subjects with hip fractures admitted to the emergency sector and undergoing preoperative pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block. Additionally, the degree of tolerable hip flexion was assessed. Methods  A prospective, randomized, and controlled clinical trial with parallel groups. The control group consisted of elderly subjects with hip fractures undergoing standardized intravenous systemic analgesia. The intervention group consisted of elderly patients with hip fractures undergoing PENG block and standardized systemic analgesia. The groups were evaluated at rest and during movement using the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD) scale. We determined pain intensity and reduction, in addition to the degree of tolerable flexion of the fractured hip. All patient assessments occurred before the medication or block administration and at 45 minutes, 12, 24, and 36 hours postmedication or block. Results  Preoperatively and 24 hours after PENG block, elderly subjects with hip fracture showed a significant reduction in pain at rest or movement compared to control patients ( p  < 0.05), with 60% of patients assessed at rest demonstrating desirable pain reduction (>=50%) and only 13.3% of the control group achieving the desired pain reduction. During movement, after undergoing PENG block, 40% of subjects demonstrated the desired pain reduction and no patient from the control group. The intervention group also showed a significant improvement in the tolerable hip flexion group ( p  < 0.05). Conclusion  Preoperative PENG block in elderly subjects with hip fractures admitted to the emergency sector provided a significant reduction in pain compared with the control group.
