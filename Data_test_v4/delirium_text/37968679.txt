37968679|t|Diabetic microvascular disease in non-classical beds: the hidden impact beyond the retina, the kidney, and the peripheral nerves.
37968679|a|Diabetes microangiopathy, a hallmark complication of diabetes, is characterised by structural and functional abnormalities within the intricate network of microvessels beyond well-known and documented target organs, i.e., the retina, kidney, and peripheral nerves. Indeed, an intact microvascular bed is crucial for preserving each organ's specific functions and achieving physiological balance to meet their respective metabolic demands. Therefore, diabetes-related microvascular dysfunction leads to widespread multiorgan consequences in still-overlooked non-traditional target organs such as the brain, the lung, the bone tissue, the skin, the arterial wall, the heart, or the musculoskeletal system. All these organs are vulnerable to the physiopathological mechanisms that cause microvascular damage in diabetes (i.e., hyperglycaemia-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction) and collectively contribute to abnormalities in the microvessels' structure and function, compromising blood flow and tissue perfusion. However, the microcirculatory networks differ between organs due to variations in haemodynamic, vascular architecture, and affected cells, resulting in a spectrum of clinical presentations. The aim of this review is to focus on the multifaceted nature of microvascular impairment in diabetes through available evidence of specific consequences in often overlooked organs. A better understanding of diabetes microangiopathy in non-target organs provides a broader perspective on the systemic nature of the disease, underscoring the importance of recognising the comprehensive range of complications beyond the classic target sites.
