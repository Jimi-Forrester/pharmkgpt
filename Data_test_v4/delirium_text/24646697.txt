24646697|a|INTRODUCTION: The present work was designed to explore the feasibility and efficacy of articular cartilage repair using composites of human umbilical cord blood derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) and four different hydrogels in a rat model. METHODS: Full-thickness articular cartilage defects were created at the trochlear groove of femur in both knees of rats. Composites of hUCB-MSCs and four different hydrogels (group A, 4% hyaluronic acid; group B, 3% alginate:30% pluronic (1:1, v/v); group C, 4% hyaluronic acid: 3% alginate: 20% pluronic (2:1:1, v/v}; and group D, 4% hyaluronic acid:3% alginate:20% pluronic;chitosan (4:1:1:2, v/v).) were then transplanted into right knee defect in each study group (five rats/group). Left knees were transplanted with corresponding hydrogels without hUCB-MSCs as controls. At 16 weeks post-transplantation, degrees of cartilage repair were evaluated macroscopically and histologically using Masson's Trichrome, safranin-O, Sirius red staining, and type-II collagen immunostaining. RESULTS: Overall, group A with 4% hyaluronic acid hydrogel resulted in superior cartilage repair grossly and histologically and achieved a cellular arrangement and collagen organization pattern mimicking adjacent uninjured articular cartilage. Immunostaining and safranin-O staining also revealed that group A displayed the largest areas of type II collagen staining. Sirius red staining revealed that the organization pattern of collagen bundles was more similar to normal cartilage in group A. No evidence of rejection was found. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that hUCB-MSCs could be used to repair articular cartilage defects in vivo and that hyaluronic acid is an attractive hydrogel candidate for use in combination with hUCB-MSCs.
