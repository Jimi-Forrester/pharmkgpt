29979260|t|Identification of the biological affection of long noncoding RNA BC200 in Alzheimer's disease.
29979260|a|BC200 is a long noncoding RNA expressed at high levels in the Alzheimer's disease (AD), and blocking of BC200 by siRNA is assumed to be an effective method for various disease therapy. We have established an AD cell model overexpressing amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta)1-42 to observe the effects of BC200 on the cell viability and apoptosis, and to investigate the associated underlying mechanisms. Efficient knockdown and overexpression of BC200 were established using BC200 siRNA and BC200 mimics, respectively. Cell viability following BC200 knockdown and overexpression was assessed by 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and cell apoptosis was monitored by flow cytometry. We successfully established an AD cell model overexpressing Abeta1-42 gene, and reported the results of change of BC200 on Abeta1-42 levels. Knockdown of BC200 significantly suppressed b-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression, and overexpression of BC200 increased BACE1 expression. Besides, inhibition of BC200 significantly increased cell viability and reduced cell apoptosis in the AD model via directly targeting BACE1, which can be increased by overexpression of BC200. BC200 regulated AD cell viability and apoptosis via targeting BACE1, and it may be one of the putative target in AD development and provides potential new insights into genetic therapy against AD.
