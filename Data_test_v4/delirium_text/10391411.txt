10391411|a|The incidence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the elderly is higher compared to younger populations. In addition, pneumonia in the elderly is a life-threatening problem. As our demographics have changed, clinicians have developed a heightened interest in managing pneumonia in the elderly. The development of pneumonia in elderly patients differs from that in younger individuals due to a complex array of factors. (1) The organisms involved depend on the setting in which the pneumonia developed: either the nonhospitalized elderly patient with CAP or the institutionalized patient who develops nursing-home-acquired pneumonia. (2) Underlying comorbid conditions commonly exist in the elderly that affect the etiology and outcome of pneumonia. Overall, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are still the most common etiologies of pneumonia in the elderly. The true role of gram-negative bacilli remains unclear although these micro-organisms may be more common etiologic agents in nursing-home pneumonia. Some recent studies from Mediterranean areas have reported high rates of infection by Chlamydia pneumoniae, but the real role of this micro-organism has to be confirmed. Another important issue is that the presenting symptoms of pneumonia in the elderly can be subtle and sometimes difficult to recognize. Fever is frequently absent, and delirium or alteration of functional physical capacity may be the only manifestations. Mortality in the elderly with CAP is higher when compared to younger populations. However, this may be explained by the concomitant presence of comorbid conditions more than by age per se. This statement has to be kept in mind when considering hospital and, particularly, intensive care unit admissions. Finally, antibiotic pharmacokinetics in the elderly populations with CAP ought to be considered to avoid frequent side-effects and complications. Overall, antibiotic regimens in hospitalized elderly patients with CAP do not differ from other hospitalized CAP populations. An organized approach to assessing elderly patients with suspicion of pneumonia and an awareness of common pitfalls in the management of this pulmonary infection in this population are essential to improving outcomes.
