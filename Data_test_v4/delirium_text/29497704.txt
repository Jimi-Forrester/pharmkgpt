29497704|t|Atypical Localization and Dissociation between Glucose Uptake and Amyloid Deposition in Cognitively Normal APOE*E4 Homozygotic Elders Compared with Patients with Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease.
29497704|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) progresses insidiously over decades. Therefore, study of preclinical AD is critical to identify early pathophysiological changes as potential targets for prevention or treatment. The brain processes at the preclinical stage remain minimally understood. Aside from age, the E4 allele of APOE flags a group at particularly high risk of late-onset AD (LOAD). Studies of these individuals could provide insights about the ontogenesis of AD offering clues for novel treatment strategies. To this end, cognitively normal, APOE*E4 homozygotes from the Alzheimer's Diseases Neuroimaging Research Initiative database (ADNI-LONI) provided fluorodeoxyglucose and amyloid (florbetapir) PET scans (n = 8 and 7, respectively; mean age 76 years). Their scans were compared to those of matched cognitively normal elders who were not E4 carriers. There was dissociation in the distribution between glucose uptake and amyloid deposition in the homozygotes. Peak hypometabolism localized bilaterally along the medial temporal cortex. In contrast, peak amyloid deposition localized principally to the putamen, a finding also seen in preclinical carriers of autosomal dominant AD mutations and preclinical AD associated with Down syndrome. Additional regions of amyloid deposition in homozygotes were medial prefrontal cortices including the anterior cingulate, middle and inferior frontal cortices, and middle and inferior occipital cortices. These findings contrast with those reported for LOAD. These data begin to characterize elders with normal cognition despite high AD risk in comparison to the known phenotypes of patients with LOAD.
