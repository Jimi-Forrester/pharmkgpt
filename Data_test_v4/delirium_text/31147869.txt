31147869|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by amyloid beta oligomers (AbetaO), which induce cell death by triggering oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Oxidative stress is regulated by antioxidant enzymes, including peroxiredoxins. Peroxiredoxins (Prx) are classified into six subtypes, based on their localization and cysteine residues, and protect cells by scavenging hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Peroxiredoxin 4 (Prx4) is unique in being localized to the ER; however, whether Prx4 protects neuronal cells from AbetaO-induced toxicity remains unclear, although Prx4 expression is upregulated in AbetaO-induced oxidative stress and ER stress. In this study, we established HT-22 cells in which Prx4 was either overexpressed or silenced to investigate its role in AbetaO-induced toxicity. AbetaO-stimulation of HT-22 cells with overexpressed Prx4 caused decreases in both AbetaO-induced ROS and ER stress (followed by ER expansion). In contrast, AbetaO stimulation caused increases in both ROS and ER stress that were notably higher in HT-22 cells with silenced Prx4 expression than in HT-22 cells. Consequently, Prx4 overexpression decreased apoptotic cell death and ameliorated the AbetaO-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+. Therefore, we conclude that Prx4 has a protective effect against AbetaO-mediated oxidative stress, ER stress, and neuronal cell death. Furthermore, these results suggest that Prx4 may be a target for preventing AbetaO toxicity in AD. Graphical abstract .
