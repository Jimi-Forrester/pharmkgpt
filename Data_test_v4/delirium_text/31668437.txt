31668437|a|BACKGROUND: Open visitation in adult intensive care units report benefits such as reduced frequency and duration of deliriums, improved patient and family satisfaction, and reduced anxiety and depression of family members. 'Being close' is one of the most basic and important needs of family members of critically ill patients. Open visitation provides an increased opportunity of being at the bedside with the patient, however, it is not universally embraced by adult intensive care units worldwide. AIM: To critically appraise the literature concerning open visitation in adult intensive care units. DESIGN: A structured literature review. METHOD: This review was guided by the methodology by Kable et al. (2012). Sixteen articles are included in the review. RESULTS: Despite the documented benefits, several challenges exist which hinder broad application of open visitation in adult intensive care units. CONCLUSION: This review acknowledged challenges faced in adopting an open visiting policy in adult intensive care units such as negative staff perceptions and attitudes; patient protection; family and cultural consideration, as well as organisational challenges. The lack of a clear and consistent definition of open visitation is problematic, and strategies are urgently needed to support staff to provide holistic patient- and family-centred care.
