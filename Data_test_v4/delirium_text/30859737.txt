30859737|t|Motion-induced position mis-localization predicts the severity of Alzheimer's disease.
30859737|a|Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) often exhibit motion processing deficits. It is unclear whether the localization of moving objects - a perceptual process tightly linked to motion - is impaired or intact in AD. In this study, we used the phenomenon of illusory shift of position induced by motion as a behavioural paradigm to probe how the spatial representation differs between AD patients and healthy elderly controls. We measured the magnitudes of motion-induced position shift in a group of AD participants (N = 24) and age-matched elderly observers (N = 24). We found that AD patients showed weakened position mis-localization, but only for motion stimuli of slow speeds. For fast motion, the position mis-localization did not differ significantly between groups. Furthermore, we showed that the magnitudes of position mis-localization can predict the severity of AD; that is, patients with more severe symptoms had less preserved position mis-localization. Our results suggest that AD pathology impacts not only motion processing per se, but also the perceptual process related to motion such as the localization of moving objects.
