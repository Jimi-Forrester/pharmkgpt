29114922|t|Regulation and effects of neurotrophic factors after neural stem cell transplantation in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer disease.
29114922|a|According to much research, neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease (AD) are correlated with alternations of neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor. The experimental illumination of neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation to eliminate AD symptoms is being explored frequently, and we have acknowledged that neurotrophic factors may play a pivotal role in cognitive improvement. However, the relation between the reversal of cognitive deficits after NSC transplantation and directed alternations of neurotrophic factors is not clearly expounded. Meanwhile, reduced inflammatory response, promoted vessel density, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can be reflections of improvement in cerebrovascular function. Three weeks after NSC transplantation, spatial learning and memory function in NSC-injected (Tg-NSC) mice were significantly improved compared with vehicle-injected (Tg-Veh) mice. Meanwhile, results obtained by immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses demonstrated that the levels of neurotrophic factors, VEGF, and vessel density in the cortex of Tg-NSC mice were significantly enhanced compared with Tg-Veh mice, while the levels of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and IL-6 were significantly decreased. Our results suggest that elevated concentrations of neurotrophic factors probably play a critical role in rescuing cognitive dysfunction in APP/PS1 transgenic mice after NSC transplantation, and neurotrophic factors may improve cerebrovascular function by means such as reducing inflammatory response and promoting angiogenesis.
