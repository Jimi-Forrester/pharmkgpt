36593517|t|Incidence and risk factors for surgical site infection (SSI) after primary hip hemiarthroplasty: an analysis of the ACS-NSQIP hip fracture procedure targeted database.
36593517|a|INTRODUCTION: Primary hip hemiarthroplasty (HHA) is frequently utilized to treat geriatric hip fractures, which are associated with significantly higher morbidity and mortality. While not particularly common, surgical site infection (SSI) is a major complication that frequently requires revision surgery in a frail population. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of and risk factors for SSI after HHA in hip fracture patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was performed using the American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database. Geriatric patients (65+) who underwent HHA for non-pathologic, traumatic hip fractures between 2016-2017 were included. Demographic variables, comorbidities, operative variables, and complications were compared between "SSI" and "non-SSI" groups. Multivariate regression identified independent risk factors for postoperative SSI. Significance was set at P = 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 6169 patients were included. The overall incidence of SSI was 1.3%. SSI was significantly associated with body mass index (BMI), preoperative functional status, congestive heart failure, chronic corticosteroid use, intraoperative time, sepsis, wound dehiscence, readmission within 30-days, and reoperation. On multivariate analysis, chronic steroid use (OR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.13-4.70), BMI >= 35 kg/m2 (OR: 3.59, 95% CI: 1.57-8.18), and intraoperative time >=120 mins (OR: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.08-4.27) were found to be independent risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative SSI is a serious complication that is responsible for prolonged hospital stays, increased mortality, and greater healthcare costs. Here, we identified multiple risk factors for SSI after primary HHA in the US elderly population.
