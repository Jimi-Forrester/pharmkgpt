19363264|t|Association of cardiovascular factors and Alzheimer's disease plasma amyloid-beta protein in subjective memory complainers.
19363264|a|A strong link is indicated between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), which may be exacerbated by the major AD genetic risk factor apolipoprotein Eepsilon4 (APOEepsilon4). Since subjective memory complaint (SMC) may potentially be an early indicator for cognitive decline, we examined CVD risk factors in a cohort of SMC. As amyloid-beta (Abeta) is considered to play a central role in AD, we hypothesized that the CVD risk profile (increased LDL, reduced HDL, and increased body fat) would be associated with plasma Abeta levels. We explored this in 198 individuals with and without SMC (average age = 63 years). Correlations between Abeta40 and HDL were observed, which were stronger in non-APOEepsilon4 carriers (rho = -0.315, p < 0.001) and in SMC (rho = -0.322, p = 0.01). There was no relationship between percentage body fat and Abeta40 in this cohort. Age and HDL remained predictive for plasma Abeta40 using multivariate regression analysis. We report a novel negative association between HDL and Abeta, which if demonstrated to be causal has implications for the development of lifestyle interventions and/or novel therapeutics. The relationship between HDL and Abeta and the potential significance of such an association needs to be validated in a larger longitudinal study.
