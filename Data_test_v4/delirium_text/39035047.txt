39035047|a|Primary pulmonary malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a rare soft tissue sarcoma with a low incidence, poor prognosis and limited treatment options. The present study reported a case of lung MPNST in a 63-year-old male patient without any pulmonary symptoms. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor indicated a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression tumor proportion score of 60%. A total of six courses of sintilimab were used in this patient and a remarkable response was achieved. In summary, sintilimab single-agent immunotherapy may be a novel treatment for pulmonary MPNST. When encountering analogous cases in the future, oncologists can test for the expression of PD-L1 in patients to guide the therapy's design.
