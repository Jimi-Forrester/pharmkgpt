21539487|a|Accumulating evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a long preclinical phase, during which time its characteristic pathology accumulates and patient function declines, but symptoms are insufficient to warrant a clinical diagnosis of dementia. There have been increasing reports of noncognitive symptoms, including loss of motor function, reported to be associated with incident AD. To understand the link between motor function and preclinical AD, this article examines: our understanding of motor function and its clinical assessment in cohort studies; the relationship of motor function and loss of cognition in older persons; risk factors for cognitive and motor decline; and the relation of post-mortem indices of AD and motor function prior to death. Together, these data suggest that age-related cognitive and motor decline may share a common causation. Furthermore, individuals with a clinical diagnosis of AD may represent the 'tip of the iceberg', since AD pathology may also account for a substantial proportion of cognitive and motor dysfunction currently considered 'normal aging' in older persons without dementia. Thus, AD may have a much larger impact on the health and wellbeing of our aging population.
