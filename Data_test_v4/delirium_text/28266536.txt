28266536|t|A rapid and visual turn-off sensor for detecting copper (II) ion based on DNAzyme coupled with HCR-based HRP concatemers.
28266536|a|To solve the requirement of on-site, rapid, and visual detection of copper (II) (Cu2+) in aqueous solution, a turn-off sensor for detecting copper (II) ion was developed based on Cu2+-dependent DNAzyme as the recognition element and hybridization chain reaction (HCR)-based horseradish peroxidase (HRP) concatemers as the signal amplifier and the signal report element. The detection unit, which was composed of the immobilized Cu2+-dependent DNAzyme coupled with HCR-based HRP concatemers via Waston-Crick base pairing, could catalyze hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via TMB, generating obvious green color and turning yellow after sulfuric acid termination with optical absorption at 450 nm. Upon Cu2+ addition, the substrate strand of the Cu2+-dependent DNAzyme concatenated with the HCR-based HRP complex was irreversibly cleaved, efficiently causing dramatic reduction of the detection signal. Under optimal conditions, the detection signal decreased with the concentration of Cu2+ in 5 min, exhibiting a linear calibration from 0.05 to 3 muM with a detection limit of 8 nM. The sensor also displayed a high selectivity for Cu2+ given the specificity and anti-interference of the detection unit, and this system was applicable for monitoring Cu2+ in real water samples. Generally speaking, the proposed sensor exhibits good potential in environment surveys.
