32695454|t|Crystal structure of 4-methyl-N-propyl-benzene-sulfonamide.
32695454|a|The crystal structure of the title sulfonamide, C10H15NO2S, comprises two mol-ecules in the asymmetric unit. The S=O bond lengths of the sulfonamide functional group range from 1.428 (2) to 1.441 (2) A, with S-C bond lengths of 1.766 (3) A (for both mol-ecules in the asymmetric unit), and S-N bond lengths of 1.618 (2) and 1.622 (3) A, respectively. When both mol-ecules are viewed down the N-S bond, the propyl group is gauche to the toluene moiety. In the crystal structure, mol-ecules of the title compound are arranged in an intricate three-dimensional network that is formed via inter-molecular C-H O and N-H O hydrogen bonds. The crystal structure was refined from a crystal twinned by inversion.
