39180246|t|MCC950 as a promising candidate for blocking NLRP3 inflammasome activation: A review of preclinical research and future directions.
39180246|a|The NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a key component of the innate immune system that triggers inflammation and pyroptosis and contributes to the development of several diseases. Therefore, blocking the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome has therapeutic potential for the treatment of these diseases. MCC950, a selective small molecule inhibitor, has emerged as a promising candidate for blocking NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Ongoing research is focused on elucidating the specific targets of MCC950 as well as assessfing its metabolism and safety profile. This review discusses the diseases that have been studied in relation to MCC950, with a focus on stroke, Alzheimer's disease, liver injury, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and sepsis, using bibliometric analysis. It then summarizes the potential pharmacological targets of MCC950 and discusses its toxicity. Furthermore, it traces the progression from preclinical to clinical research for the treatment of these diseases. Overall, this review provides a solid foundation for the clinical therapeutic potential of MCC950 and offers insights for future research and therapeutic approaches.
