22739032|a|BACKGROUND: Vascular disease and medical factors are associated with cognitive decline and cardiovascular events. We examined the association between vascular risk factors and events in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. METHODS: The association between vascular risk factors and cardiovascular events in a cohort of 810 participants, including 400 with mild cognitive impairment, 184 with Alzheimer's, and 226 controls was investigated using a longitudinal hazard model. RESULTS: There were 31 events including 11 strokes, 7 myocardial infarctions, 5 revascularizations, and 8 deaths during an average follow-up of 31 months. Longitudinal cardiovascular event rates were low and similar between diagnostic groups. CONCLUSIONS: All baseline vascular risk factors that were expected to be associated with longitudinal cardiovascular events were, or were trending toward, associating with cardiovascular events except atrial fibrillation, depression, and apolipoprotein E genotype. Despite differences in baseline vascular risk factors, longitudinal cardiovascular event rates were similar between diagnostic groups.
