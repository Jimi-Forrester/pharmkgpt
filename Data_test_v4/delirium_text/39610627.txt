39610627|t|Role of Neurosurgical Interventions in the Treatment of Movement Disorders Like Parkinson's Disease, Dystonia, and Tourette Syndrome.
39610627|a|This article provides an overview of neurosurgical therapies for movement disorders (MDs), including Tourette syndrome, dystonia, Parkinson's disease (PD), and others. It focuses on the benefits of these treatments and suggests directions for further research. A total of 10 years' worth of English-language PubMed articles were combed through, with an emphasis on studies conducted in North America. To manage MDs like Parkinson's disease and Tourette syndrome, the results suggest that non-invasive neuromodulation techniques, closed-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS), and other advanced therapies may become the treatment of choice in the future. Research on dystonia is being focused on improving treatment methods by investigating new areas of the brain that might be stimulated through neurosurgery and looking at gene therapy. Modern technological developments, such as non-invasive neuromodulation procedures and improved imaging, provide promising substitutes for traditional surgical approaches. This study highlights the need for continuous clinical trials for better outcomes, which is why research and development in this area must continue.
