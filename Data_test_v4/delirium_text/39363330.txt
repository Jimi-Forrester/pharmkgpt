39363330|t|Hyperspectral retinal imaging in Alzheimer's disease and age-related macular degeneration: a review.
39363330|a|While Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases have traditionally been viewed as brain disorders, there is growing evidence indicating their manifestation in the eyes as well. The retina, being a developmental extension of the brain, represents the only part of the central nervous system that can be noninvasively imaged at a high spatial resolution. The discovery of the specific pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease in the retina of patients holds great promise for disease diagnosis and monitoring, particularly in the early stages where disease progression can potentially be slowed. Among various retinal imaging methods, hyperspectral imaging has garnered significant attention in this field. It offers a label-free approach to detect disease biomarkers, making it especially valuable for large-scale population screening efforts. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the field and outline the current bottlenecks and enabling technologies that could propel this field toward clinical translation.
