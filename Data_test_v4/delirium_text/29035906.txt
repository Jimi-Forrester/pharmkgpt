29035906|t|Effectiveness of a Multifaceted Delirium Screening, Prevention, and Treatment Initiative on the Rate of Delirium Falls in the Acute Care Setting.
29035906|a|Delirium is a potentially modifiable fall risk factor, but few studies address the effects of delirium programs on falls. Beginning in 2011, we implemented a nursing-driven hospitalwide delirium program targeting improvements in risk identification, prevention, detection, and treatment. Over the course of the program, delirium falls decreased from 0.91 to 0.50 per patient day (P = .0002). A decrease in overall falls was also noted (P = .0007).
