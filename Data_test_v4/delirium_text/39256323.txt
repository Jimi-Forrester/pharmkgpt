39256323|t|Comparison of Caregiver and General Population Preferences for Dependency-Related Health States.
39256323|a|OBJECTIVE: We assess whether the preferences regarding dependency-related health states as stated by informal caregivers are aligned with those expressed by the general population. METHODS: The preferences of a sample of 139 Spanish informal caregivers of dependent patients are compared with those obtained via a sample of 312 persons, also from the Spanish general population. We assess 24 dependency states extracted from the DEP-6D using the time trade-off method. Descriptive statistics and regression methods are used to explore differences between the two samples. RESULTS: Mean difference tests establish that, for all but one of the 24 states, there are no significant differences between the samples. The estimated mean values ranged from - 0.64 to 0.60 for the caregiver sample and from - 0.60 to 0.65 for the general population sample, with a correlation of 0.96. On average, the classification of states as better or worse than dead matched in both samples (except for one state). Regression models also show that sample type does not have a significant average impact. After we introduce interaction effects, only the most severe level of two dimensions, cognitive problems and housework, result in significant differences-with the caregiver sample reporting higher values for the former, and lower values for the latter. CONCLUSION: Caregivers and the general population exhibit quite similar preferences concerning dependency-related health states. This suggests that the results of cost-utility analyses, and the resource allocation decisions based on them, would likewise not be significantly affected by the preferences used to generate the weighting algorithm.
