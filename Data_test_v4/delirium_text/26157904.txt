26157904|t|Aspirin-Induced Acute Liver Injury.
26157904|a|Aspirin is thought to be a relatively safe drug in adults. The association of aspirin and Reye syndrome in children is well documented. We report a 41-year-old female with pericarditis who was treated with high-dose aspirin and developed subsequent acute liver injury. After discontinuation of aspirin, liver enzyme elevation and right upper quadrant pain both resolved. We conclude that high-dose aspirin should be considered as a potentially hepatotoxic agent.
