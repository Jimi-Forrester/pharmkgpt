15815954|t|[Neurology in the court of the Learned King].
15815954|a|During the reign of Alfonso X of Castile one of the most flourishing cultural periods of European history was reached. The so-called Learned King contributed to this development by promoting the use of Castilian as the language of scientific discovery instead of Latin, and favoring the recovery of Arabic origin manuscripts in the Toledo Translators' School. Where the wise men from the "three cultures" (Christian, Islamic and Jewish) worked together in harmony to perpetuate classical knowledge. The aim of this paper is to analyze neurological pathology in the period concerned. The Learned King suffered from several neurologic syndromes including delirium and coma. He also showed chronic maxillary sinusitis with orbital involvement, trigeminal neuralgia and visual loss. Furthermore, in the "Cantigas" he described miraculous treatments of several disorders including seizures, leprous neuropathy, dementia, rabies, and ergotism.
