34439422|a|The well-established, health-benefitting effects of grapevines and derivatives (wines and vinification byproducts) are attributed to their antioxidant phenolic content. The dearth of an efficient method for the simultaneous quantitation of antioxidant phenolics prompted us to develop a novel method utilizing triple quadrupole LC-MS/MS for the accurate, fast, simultaneous quantitation of the 32 most abundant grapevine phenolics. The fully validated, novel method is capable to simultaneously record the quantitative presence of 12 phenolic acids, 19 polyphenols and coniferyl aldehyde (a phenolic compound extracted from cork stoppers into wines) and is applicable for the determination of antioxidant phenolics content of grape berries, pomace, stems and wines. Its utility was demonstrated for three native Greek grapevine varieties, two red (Mandilaria and Aidani mavro) and one white (Monemvassia). Results herein highlighted the stems of the Monemvassia white variety as particularly rich in antioxidant phenolics such as the flavonol monomer (+)-catechin (387 mg/kg) and the dimer procyanidin B1 (400 mg/kg) along with stilbene phytoalexin trans-resveratrol (24 mg/kg). These results are in line with the TPC, TFC and TTC content of stems and the determined antioxidant capacities, highlighting the stems of this Vitis vinifera variety as potentially exploitable source of antioxidant phenolics.
