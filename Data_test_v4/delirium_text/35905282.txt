35905282|t|Serum levels of apolipoprotein A-I and E are associated with postoperative delirium: A post hoc analysis.
35905282|a|Postoperative delirium is a common complication for elderly patients. Detection of phosphorylated neurofilament heavy subunit in the serum reflects axonal damage with postoperative delirium. Although it has been implicated that serum apolipoprotein levels might be associated with senile cognitive disorder, its role in the development of delirium has not been fully investigated. This study examined the association of apolipoproteins with delirium after surgery. This was a post hoc analysis of 117 patients who participated in a prospective observational study of delirium in patients undergoing cancer surgery. Patients were clinically assessed for delirium within the first 5 days of surgery. Serum levels of apolipoprotein A-I, B, and E were measured on postoperative day 3. Forty-one patients (35%) were clinically diagnosed with postoperative delirium. Serum levels of apolipoprotein A-I and B were increased in patients with delirium whereas those of apolipoprotein E were decreased. These changes in apolipoprotein A-I and E levels were associated with the presence of phosphorylated neurofilament heavy subunit in the serum, and were significantly associated with delirium (A-I: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.238; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.766-20.68; P < .0001; E: aOR, 0.253; 95% CI, 0.066-0.810; P = .0193). A combination of apolipoprotein A-I and E offers significant discrimination between delirium and nondelirium with high accuracy (area under the curve, 0.8899). Serum apolipoprotein A-I and E levels were associated with delirium and the presence of phosphorylated neurofilament heavy subunit in serum. Therefore, apolipoproteins might be useful biomarkers of postoperative delirium.
