29213612|t|Charles Bonnet Syndrome: Case series.
29213612|a|Since its first description in 1760, Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS) has been reported in many studies. The main characteristics are visual hallucinations, preserved awareness of unreal visions, and absence of psychotic symptoms. CBS can occur with lesions located anywhere along the central visual pathway, from the eye to the calcarine fissure. OBJECTIVE: To describe patients with CBS and carry out a review of the literature. METHODS: Six patients with visual hallucinations were evaluated in an outpatient memory clinic between 2001 and 2008, and their clinical characteristics recorded. RESULTS: Four patients were female, and the mean age was 74.5+-16.9 years. Three patients had visual loss secondary to eye disease and three due to cerebral lesions. The visions consisted of animals, persons, moving objects, bizarre creatures or colored forms, and were considered disturbing by five patients. Five patients received treatment, and only three reported partial benefit from the therapy. Complete recovery was not seen in any of the subjects. CONCLUSIONS: CBS is relatively rare and its recognition is important to avoid misdiagnoses with psychiatric or dementing illnesses.
