29660941|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by accumulations of amyloid-beta (Abeta42) and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, associated with neuroinflammation, synaptic loss, and neuronal death. Several studies indicate that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is implicated in the pathological features of AD. We have investigated in 5XFAD mice, the therapeutic effects of Brimapitide, a JNK-specific inhibitory peptide previously tested with higher concentrations in another AD model (TgCRND8). Three-month-old 5XFAD and wild-type littermate mice were treated by intravenous injections of low doses (10 mg/kg) of Brimapitide every 3 weeks, for 3 or 6 months (n = 6-9 per group). Cognitive deficits and brain lesions were assessed using Y-maze, fear-conditioning test, and histological and biochemical methods. Chronic treatment of Brimapitide for 3 months resulted in a reduction of Abeta plaque burden in the cortex of 5XFAD treated mice. After 6 months of treatment, cognitive deficits were reduced but also a significant reduction of cell death markers and the pro-inflammatory IL-1beta cytokine in treated mice were detected. The Abeta plaque burden was not anymore modified by the 6 months of treatment. In addition to modulating cognition and amyloid plaque accumulation, depending on the treatment duration, Brimapitide seems experimentally to reduce neuronal stress in 5XFAD mice.
