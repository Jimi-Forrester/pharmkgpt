19912480|a|UNLABELLED: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) might alter cerebral hemodynamics. Impairment of vasomotor reactivity may constitute a biomarker of amyloid angiopathy and therefore it may be useful to distinguish disorders with CAA from other conditions. The aim of this study was to assess the vasomotor reactivity in two conditions characterized by CAA: Alzheimer's disease and amyloid hemorrhage. METHODS: We assessed the vasomotor using transcranial Doppler and the breath-holding method. RESULTS: Responses obtained in controls were higher than in patients with Alzheimer's or with antecedent of amyloid hemorrhage while there was no statistical difference in the comparison between these last two groups. CONCLUSION: The vasomotor reactivity seems to be similarly impaired in Alzheimer's disease and amyloid hemorrhage patients.
