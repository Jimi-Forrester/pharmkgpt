22607518|t|Relationship between behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia and oral health status in the elderly with vascular dementia.
22607518|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and oral status in the elderly with vascular dementia. BACKGROUND: There have been some reports of a relationship between disease symptoms and oral status in the elderly with Alzheimer's disease, but few reports have been conducted in the elderly with vascular dementia. Until now, the relationship between BPSD and oral status has been unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An investigation was conducted concerning BPSD and oral status among 57 subjects with vascular dementia (mean age, 85.7 +- 5.5 years). The wearing of dentures and oral activities of daily living (oral ADL) were examined. RESULTS: Subjects with activity disturbances and those with aggressiveness had significantly lower rates of denture wearing than those without these two symptoms (p < 0.05). Significantly lower oral ADL scores were obtained from subjects with delusional ideas, hallucinations, activity disturbances and diurnal rhythm disturbances (p < 0.05), as well as those with affective disturbances (p< 0.01). CONCLUSION: This study indicated a relationship between BPSD and the wearing of dentures in the elderly with vascular dementia. The study also demonstrated relationships between BPSD and oral ADL.
