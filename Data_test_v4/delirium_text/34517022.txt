34517022|a|miRNA-132/212 are small regulators of gene expression with a function that fulfills a vital function in diverse biological processes including neuroprotection of cells with prolonged longevity in neurons and the cardiovascular system. In neurons, miRNA-132 appears to be essential for controlling differentiation, development, and neural functioning. Indeed, it also universally promotes axon evolution, nervous migration, plasticity as well, it is suggested to be neuroprotective against neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, miRNA-132/212 disorder leads to neural developmental perturbation, and the development of degenerative disorders covering Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and epilepsy's along with psychiatric perturbations including schizophrenia. Furthermore, the cellular mechanisms of the miRNA-132/212 have additionally been explored in cardiovascular diseases models. Also, the miRNA-132/212 family modulates cardiac hypertrophy and autophagy in cardiomyocytes. The protective and effective clinical promise of miRNA-132/212 in these systems is discussed in this review. To sum up, the current progress in innovative miRNA-based therapies for human pathologies seems of extreme concern and reveals promising novel therapeutic strategies.
