39000536|t|Virus-like Particles as Vaccines for Allergen-Specific Therapy: An Overview of Current Developments.
39000536|a|Immune engineering and modulation are the basis of a novel but powerful tool to treat immune diseases using virus-like particles (VLPs). VLPs are formed by the viral capsid without genetic material making them non-infective. However, they offer a wide variety of possibilities as antigen-presenting platforms, resulting in high immunogenicity and high efficacy in immune modulation, with low allergenicity. Both animal and plant viruses are being studied for use in the treatment of food allergies. These formulations are combined with adjuvants, T-stimulatory epitopes, TLR ligands, and other immune modulators to modulate or enhance the immune response toward the presented allergen. Here, the authors present an overview of VLP production systems, their immune modulation capabilities, and the applicability of actual VLP-based formulations targeting allergic diseases.
