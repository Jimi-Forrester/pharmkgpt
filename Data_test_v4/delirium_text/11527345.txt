11527345|t|Executive deficits appearing in the initial stage of Alzheimer's disease.
11527345|a|The presence of executive deficits has been sought at a stage of Alzheimer's disease where currently used neuropsychological batteries could not yet distinguish Alzheimer's patients from normal age- and education-matched controls. This study shows that, at this early stage, those patients that 6 months later are found to show clear signs of Alzheimer's had been significantly worse than normal controls in an executive function task adapted from the Brown-Peterson procedure.
