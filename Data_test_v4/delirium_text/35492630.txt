35492630|t|Modelling of interactions between Abeta(25-35) peptide and phospholipid bilayers: effects of cholesterol and lipid saturation.
35492630|a|Aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in neuronal membranes is a known promoter of Alzheimer's disease. To gain insight into the molecular details of Abeta peptide aggregation and its effect on model neuronal membranes, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations of the Abeta(25-35) fragment of the amyloid precursor protein in phospholipid bilayers composed of either fully saturated or highly unsaturated lipids, in the presence or absence of cholesterol. It was found that the peptide does not penetrate through any of the considered membranes, but can reside in the headgroup region and upper part of the lipid tails showing a clear preference to a polyunsaturated cholesterol-free membrane. Due to the ordering and condensing effect upon addition of cholesterol, membranes become more rigid facilitating peptide aggregation on the surface. Except for the case of the cholesterol-free saturated lipid bilayer, the peptides have a small effect on the membrane structure and ordering. It was also found that the most "active" amino-acid for peptide-lipid and peptide-cholesterol interaction is methionine-35, followed by asparagine-27 and serine-26, which form hydrogen bonds between peptides and polar atoms of lipid headgroups. These amino acids are also primarily responsible for peptide aggregation. This work will be relevant for designing strategies to develop drugs to combat Alzheimer's disease.
