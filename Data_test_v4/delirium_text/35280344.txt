35280344|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia responsible for more than 121,499 deaths from AD in 2019 making AD the sixth-leading cause in the United States. AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by decline of memory, behavioral impairments that affects a person's ability to function independently ultimately leading to death. The current pressing need for a treatment for (AD) and advances in the field of cell therapy, has rendered stem cell therapeutics a promising field of research. Despite advancements in stem cell technology, confirmed by encouraging pre-clinical utilization of stem cells in AD animal models, the number of clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of stem cell therapy is limited, with the results of many ongoing clinical trials on cell therapy for AD still pending. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been the main focus in these studies, reporting encouraging results concerning safety profile, however their efficacy remains unproven. In the current article we review the latest advances regarding different sources of stem cell therapy and present a comprehensive list of every available clinical trial in national and international registries. Finally, we discuss drawbacks arising from AD pathology and technical limitations that hinder the transition of stem cell technology from bench to bedside. Our findings emphasize the need to increase clinical trials towards uncovering the mode of action and the underlying therapeutic mechanisms of transplanted cells as well as the molecular mechanisms controlling regeneration and neuronal microenvironment.
