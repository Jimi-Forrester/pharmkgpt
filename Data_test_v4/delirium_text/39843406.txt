39843406|t|Targeting signaling pathways in neurodegenerative diseases: Quercetin's cellular and molecular mechanisms for neuroprotection.
39843406|a|BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, are complex and challenging due to their intricate pathophysiology and limited treatment options. METHODS: This review systematically sourced articles related to neurodegenerative diseases, neurodegeneration, quercetin, and clinical studies from primary medical databases, including Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science. RESULTS: Recent studies have included quercetin to impact the cellular and molecular pathways involved in neurodegeneration. Quercetin, a flavonoid abundant in vegetables and fruits, is gaining attention for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties. It regulates signaling pathways such as nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), sirtuins, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt). These pathways are essential for cellular survival, inflammation regulation, and apoptosis. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that quercetin improves symptoms and pathology in neurodegenerative models, indicating promising outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The study explores the potential of incorporating laboratory research into practical medical treatment, focusing on quercetin's neuroprotective effects on NDs and its optimal dosage.
