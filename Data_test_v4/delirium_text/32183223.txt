32183223|a|Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa L. subsp. chinensis) and Nightshade (Solanum retroflexum are popular traditional leafy vegetables consumed predominantly by rural Africans. Sun drying is adopted as a traditional method of postharvest preservation to store theses leaves during off seasons. The influence of different types of postharvest processing treatments, such as conventional oven drying, solar cabinet drying, sun drying and freeze drying, on the changes on colour properties and antioxidant components were investigated. Freeze-drying retained the ascorbic acid content, antioxidant activities, total chlorophyll content, green colour by reducing the colour difference ( E). With regard to Chinese cabbage and Nightshade leaves, sun and microwave drying respectively had the most negative impact on all the identified phenolic compounds. The OPLS-DA and the UPLC-QTOF/MS and chemometric approach showed kaempferol-3-O-sophoroside, kaempferol-3-sophorotrioside-7-glucoside and hydroxyoctadecenedioic acid as the markers responsible for the separation of sun-dried samples from the other drying treatments in Chinese cabbage. Sinapoyl malate was not detected in sun-dried samples. Caffeoylmalic acid was identified as the marker compound to separate the other drying treatments from the microwave dried samples of Nightshade leaves. Trihydroxyoctadecadiene derivative and hydroxyoctadecanedioic acid were detected in microwaved samples. Due to the cost effectiveness, solar dryer cabinet treatment was recommended for drying both vegetables. The proximate analysis of solar dried functional powder of Chinese cabbage and Nightshade vegetables demonstrated higher contents of protein and dietary fibre.
