27997885|a|BACKGROUND: Streptozotocin (STZ) has served as an agent to generate an Alzheimer's disease (AD) model in rats, while edaravone (EDA), a novel free radical scavenger, has recently emerged as an effective treatment for use in vivo and vitro AD models. However, to date, these beneficial effects of EDA have only been clearly demonstrated within STZ-induced animal models of AD and in cell models of AD. A better understanding of the mechanisms of EDA may provide the opportunity for their clinical application in the treatment of AD. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanisms of STZ and EDA as assessed upon electrophysiological alterations in CA1 pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampal slices. METHODS: Through measures of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs), AMPAR-mediated eEPSCs (eEPSCsAMPA), evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs), evoked excitatory postsynaptic current paired pulse ratio (eEPSC PPR) and evoked inhibitory postsynaptic current paired pulse ratio (eIPSC PPR), it was possible to investigate mechanisms as related to the neurotoxicity of STZ and reductions in these effects by EDA. RESULTS: Our results showed that STZ (1000 microM) significantly inhibited peak amplitudes of eEPSCs, eEPSCsAMPA and eIPSCs, while EDA (1000 microM) attenuated these STZ-induced changes at holding potentials ranging from -60mV to +40 mV for EPSCs and -60mV to +20 mV for IPSCs. Our work also indicated that mean eEPSC PPR were substantially altered by STZ, effects which were partially restored by EDA. In contrast, no significant effects upon eIPSC PPR were obtained in response to STZ and EDA. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that STZ inhibits glutamatergic transmission involving pre-synaptic mechanisms and AMPAR, and that STZ inhibits GABAergic transmission by post-synaptic mechanisms within CA1 pyramidal neurons. These effects are attenuated by EDA.
