38427242|t|Understanding Actin Remodeling in Neuronal Cells Through Podosomes.
38427242|a|Cytoskeletal dysregulation forms an important aspect of many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Cytoskeletal functions require the dynamic activity of the cytoskeletal proteins-actin, tubulin, and the associated proteins. One of such important phenomena is that of actin remodeling, which helps the cell to migrate, navigate, and interact with extracellular materials. Podosomes are complex actin-rich cytoskeletal structures, abundant in proteins that interact and degrade the extracellular matrix, enabling cells to displace and migrate. The formation of podosomes requires extensive actin networks and remodeling. Here we present a novel immunofluorescence-based approach to study actin remodeling in neurons through the medium of podosomes.
