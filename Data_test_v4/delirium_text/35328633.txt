35328633|a|Sirtuins (SIRTs) are a family of class III histone deacetylases (HDACs) consisting of seven members, widely expressed in mammals. SIRTs mainly participate in metabolic homeostasis, DNA damage repair, cell survival, and differentiation, as well as other cancer-related biological processes. Growing evidence shows that SIRTs have pivotal roles in chronic degenerative diseases, including colorectal cancer (CRC), the third most frequent malignant disease worldwide. Metabolic alterations are gaining attention in the context of CRC development and progression, with mitochondrion representing a crucial point of complex and intricate molecular mechanisms. Mitochondrial SIRTs, SIRT2, SIRT3, SIRT4 and SIRT5, control mitochondrial homeostasis and dynamics. Here, we provide a comprehensive review on the latest advances on the role of mitochondrial SIRTs in the initiation, promotion and progression of CRC. A deeper understanding of the pathways by which mitochondrial SIRTs control CRC metabolism may provide new molecular targets for future innovative strategies for CRC prevention and therapy.
