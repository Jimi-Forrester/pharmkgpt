34338333|t|Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography/Positron Emission Tomography Molecular Imaging for Parkinsonism: A Fast-Developing Field.
34338333|a|The early differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease and atypical parkinsonism is a major challenge. The use of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/positron emission tomography (PET) molecular imaging to investigate parkinsonism is a fast-developing field. Imaging biomarker research may potentially lead to more accurate disease detection, enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment. This review summarizes recent SPECT/PET advances in radiopharmaceuticals and imaging technologies/analyses that improve the diagnosis of neurodegenerative parkinsonism. We are currently witnessing a turning point in the field. Integrating molecular imaging as a diagnostic technique represents an opportunity to reassess the strategies for diagnosing neurodegenerative parkinsonism. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:711-719.
