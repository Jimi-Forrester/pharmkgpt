37175729|t|The Cytokine CX3CL1 and ADAMs/MMPs in Concerted Cross-Talk Influencing Neurodegenerative Diseases.
37175729|a|Neuroinflammation plays a fundamental role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. It could therefore be said that neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative pathologies is not a consequence but a cause of them and could represent a therapeutic target of neuronal degeneration. CX3CL1 and several proteases (ADAMs/MMPs) are strongly involved in the inflammatory pathways of these neurodegenerative pathologies with multiple effects. On the one hand, ADAMs have neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic effects; on the other hand, they target cytokines and chemokines, thus causing inflammatory processes and, consequently, neurodegeneration. CX3CL1 itself is a cytokine substrate for the ADAM, ADAM17, which cleaves and releases it in a soluble isoform (sCX3CL1). CX3CL1, as an adhesion molecule, on the one hand, plays an inhibiting role in the pro-inflammatory response in the central nervous system (CNS) and shows neuroprotective effects by binding its membrane receptor (CX3CR1) present into microglia cells and maintaining them in a quiescent state; on the other hand, the sCX3CL1 isoform seems to promote neurodegeneration. In this review, the dual roles of CX3CL1 and ADAMs/MMPs in different neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (MH), and multiple sclerosis (MS), are investigated.
