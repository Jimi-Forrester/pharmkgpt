28588480|t|Reduced Gray Matter Volume in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
28588480|a|Background and Purpose: Previous studies of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) have found that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) exhibit gray matter alterations, but these findings are inconsistent and have not been quantitatively reviewed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to conduct a quantitative meta-analysis of VBM studies of patients with T2DM. Materials and Methods: The seed-based d mapping method was applied to quantitatively estimate the regional gray matter abnormalities in T2DM patients. We also used meta-regression to explore the effects of some demographics and clinical characteristics. Results: Seven studies, with 8 datasets comprising 530 participants with T2DM and 549 non-T2DM controls, were included. The pooled and subgroup meta-analyses found that T2DM patients showed robustly reduced gray matter in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, medial superior frontal gyrus, insula, median cingulate cortex, precuneus cortex and the left lentiform nucleus extending into the parahippocampus. The meta-regression also found that the percentage of female patients with T2DM was negatively associated with gray matter in the right superior temporal gyrus and illness duration was negatively associated with gray matter in the right middle temporal gyrus. Conclusion: This meta-analysis indicates that T2DM patients have significantly and robustly reduced gray matter mainly in the cortical-striatal-limbic networks, which are associated with human cognition. Thereby implicating this finding in the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in T2DM patients.
