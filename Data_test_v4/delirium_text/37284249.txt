37284249|a|Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, impacting approximately 50 million individuals globally. However, the current treatments available for AD are only symptomatic and have limited efficacy. This study aimed to investigate whether Leonurine could alleviate cognitive dysfunction in a mouse model of AD and explore its underlying molecular mechanisms. Methods: In this study, male APP/PS1 mice were orally administered Leonurine for two consecutive months. The cognitive functions of the mice were then evaluated using novel object recognition (NOR) and Morris water maze (MWM) tests. Hippocampal neuronal damage was observed through Nissl staining, Abeta levels were determined through ELISA, oxidative stress activity was detected through biochemical methods, and the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) pathway was analyzed using western blot and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Results: Our results demonstrated that Leonurine treatment markedly improved cognitive functions, as indicated by the improved performance in the model. Additionally, histopathology showed a reduction in hippocampal neuronal damage. This can be attributed to the potential of Leonurine to reduce Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 levels and alleviate oxidative stress. Its antioxidant effect is linked to the activation of the Nrf-2 signaling pathway in APP/PS1 mice, which promotes Nrf-2 nuclear translocation and expression of HO-1 and NQO-1. Conclusion: These findings suggest that Leonurine could be explored further as it could emerge as a promising drug for AD treatment.
