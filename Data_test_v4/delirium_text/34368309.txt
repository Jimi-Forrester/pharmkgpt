34368309|a|BACKGROUND: Experimental evidence has indicated the benefits of statins for the treatment of postoperative delirium. Previously, clinical trials did not reach definite conclusions on the effects of statins on delirium. Some clinical trials have indicated that statins reduce postoperative delirium and improve outcomes, while some studies have reported negative results. AIM: To evaluate whether perioperative rosuvastatin treatment reduces the incidence of delirium and improves clinical outcomes. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial was conducted in a single center in Jiangsu, China. This study enrolled patients aged greater than 60 years who received general anesthesia during elective operations and provided informed consent. A computer-generated randomization sequence (in a 1:1 ratio) was used to randomly assign patients to receive either rosuvastatin (40 mg/d) or placebo. Participants, care providers, and investigators were all masked to group assignments. The primary endpoint was the incidence of delirium, which was assessed twice daily with the Confusion Assessment Method during the first 7 postoperative days. Analyses were performed on intention-to-treat and safety populations. RESULTS: Between January 1, 2017 and January 1, 2020, 3512 patients were assessed. A total of 821 patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 411) or rosuvastatin (n = 410). The incidence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in the rosuvastatin group [23 (5.6%) of 410 patients] than in the placebo group {42 (13.5%) of 411 patients [odds ratios (OR) = 0.522, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.308-0.885; P < 0.05]}. No significant difference in 30-d all-cause mortality (6.1% vs 8.7%, OR = 0.67, 95%CI: 0.39-1.2, P = 0.147) was observed between the two groups. Rosuvastatin decreased the hospitalization time (13.8 +- 2.5 vs 14.2 +- 2.8, P = 0.03) and hospitalization expenses (9.3 +- 2.5 vs 9.8 +- 2.9, P = 0.007). No significant differences in abnormal liver enzymes (9.0% vs 7.1%, OR = 1.307, 95%CI: 0.787-2.169, P = 0.30) or rhabdomyolysis (0.73% vs 0.24%, OR = 3.020, 95%CI: 0.31-29.2, P = 0.37) were observed between the two groups. CONCLUSION: The current study suggests that perioperative rosuvastatin treatment reduces the incidence of delirium after an elective operation under general anesthesia. However, the evidence does not reveal that rosuvastatin improves clinical outcomes. The therapy is safe. Further investigation is necessary to fully understand the potential usefulness of rosuvastatin in elderly patients.
