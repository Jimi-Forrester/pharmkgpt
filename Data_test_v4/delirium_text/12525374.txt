12525374|a|The charts of 628 cancer patients, referred to the psycho-oncology service at the Hotel-Dieu de Quebec from 1994 to 1997, were reviewed in 1997 to determine the nature, the prevalence, and the characteristics of psychiatric diagnoses, particularly delirium. Results showed that among patients diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder, 54.5% had adjustment disorders, 13.1% suffered from delirium and 10.9% from major depression. Statistically significant associations were observed between delirium and the use of opioids (odds-ratio (OR): 3.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.28-6.57), corticosteroids (OR = 4.33; CI = 2.34-8.08), a history of alcoholism (OR = 2.41; CI = 1.27-4.56), being hospitalized (OR = 6.10; CI = 2.85-13.08), and being older (OR = 1.06; CI = 1.04-1.08). These results confirm the high frequency of psychiatric disorders in patients referred for a consultation in psycho-oncology and underline the importance to develop such services. Delirium is a major psychiatric complication of cancer and is associated with opioids, corticosteroids, alcoholism, being hospitalized, and being older.
