METHODS: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database was used to assign 784 non-dementia elderly into two groups: a normal sleep group (528 participants) and a CSD group (256 participants) via the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)-sleep subitem. Blood transcriptomics, blood neutrophil, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and neutrophil-related inflammatory factors were measured. We also investigated gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), Cox proportional hazards model for risk factors, and mediation and interaction effects between indicators. Cognitive progression is defined as the progression from cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/dementia or from MCI to dementia. RESULTS: CSD could significantly affect cognitive function. The activated neutrophil pathways for cognitive progression in CSD were identified by transcriptomics GSEA, which was reflected by increased blood neutrophil level and its correlation with cognitive progression in CSD. High tau burden mediated the influence of neutrophils on cognitive function and exacerbated the CSD-related risk of left hippocampal atrophy. Elevated neutrophil-related inflammatory factors were observed in the cognitive progression of CSD and were associated with brain tau burden. CONCLUSIONS: Activated neutrophil pathway triggering tau pathology may underline the mechanism of cognitive progression in CSD.
