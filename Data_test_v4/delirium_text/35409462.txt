35409462|t|The Impact of the COVID-19 Virus Pandemic on the Incidence of First Psychotic Spectrum Disorders.
35409462|a|The effects of COVID-19 on the human body are not yet understood enough. Medical history provides information on cases of psychiatric symptoms during viral infections in the 20th century, such as the influenza pandemic. Currently, it is observed that there is an increasing number of new psychiatric disorders in previously healthy individuals. In addition, because of the decreased amount of reporting to health care providers, including psychiatrists, many physicians suggest that the number of neuropsychiatric disorders may be underestimated. In this paper, we review available studies on the occurrence of first-time psychotic spectrum disorder (PSD) in individuals related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The reviewed studies suggest that first-time psychotic disorder in COVID-19 patients is statistically significantly more frequent compared to influenza, as well as to other respiratory infections. The emergence of new PSDs is explained by direct neurotropism of the virus on the one hand and by immunological mechanisms on the other. The main conclusions of this review should be treated with caution, and future research on this topic is needed. The authors recognize the particular need to develop standardized laboratory panels that include inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-alpha), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing, and SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays to entirely understand the etiology of neuropsychiatric complications of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the pandemic itself. In addition, public health efforts are required to promote mental health, especially during COVID-19.
