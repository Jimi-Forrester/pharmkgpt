21199235|t|Galantamine (Reminyl) once daily outcome and satisfaction survey (RODOS) in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease: a study in a real life population.
21199235|a|AIM: To record in real life the appreciation of elderly patients, their caregivers and physicians of a once daily formulation of prolonged release of galantamine in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, observational study was conducted in 128 elderly patients, treated for 6 months with galantamine, donepezil or rivastigmine. RESULTS: Of the patients treated with galantamine, 82 of the 97 (84.5%) were continuing their treatment after 6 months. These patients reported their condition as improved in 49%, unchanged in 47% and worsened in 4%. Caregivers rated global evaluation as 37% better, 41% unchanged and 22% worse. Physicians rated global clinical impression of change as 46% better, 34% unchanged and 20% worse. Measurements of cognition and behavior remained stable. The appreciation of physicians and caregivers corresponded well (P<0.001). The incidence of serious side-effects possibly related to galantamine was 9.3%, which was not different from that in patients treated with other cholinesterase inhibitors. CONCLUSION: In a real life setting, galantamine once daily is safe and is favorably appreciated by patients, their caregivers and physicians.
