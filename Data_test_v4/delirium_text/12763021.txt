12763021|a|A major component of the amyloid plaque core in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the 40-42-residue amyloid beta peptide (Abeta). Mutations linked to AD such as those in presenilins 1 (PS1) and 2 (PS2) invariably increase the longer Abeta42 species that forms neurotoxic oligomers. It is believed that PS1/2 constitute the catalytic subunit of the gamma-secretase responsible for the final step in Abeta biogenesis. Recent genetic studies have identified a number of additional genes encoding APH1a, APH1b, PEN2, and Nicastrin proteins, which are part of the gamma-secretase complex with PS1. Further, knockout studies using RNAi showed that these components are essential for gamma-secretase activity. However, the nature of gamma-secretase and how the aforementioned proteins regulate its activity are still incompletely understood. Here we present evidence that unlike PS1, overexpression of these proteins can increase the levels of Abeta, suggesting that these proteins are limiting for gamma-secretase activity. In addition, our studies also suggest that the presenilin partners regulate the relative levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42.
