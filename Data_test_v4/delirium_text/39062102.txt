39062102|a|To date, although several studies have investigated the circulating levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), only a few authors have addressed their evaluation in adults. Furthermore, an important limitation of these studies lies in the fact that circulating BDNF is stored in platelets and released into the circulation when needed. To the best of our knowledge, a very limited number of studies have related peripheral BDNF values to platelet counts, and yet no study has evaluated intra-platelet BDNF levels in adults with ASD. In this framework, the aim of the present work is to pave the way in this field and evaluate platelet BNDF levels in adult ASD patients, as well as their correlation with autistic symptoms and related psychopathological dimensions. We recruited 22 ASD and 22 healthy controls, evaluated with the Adult autism subthreshold spectrum (AdAS Spectrum), the Social Anxiety Spectrum-self report (SHY-SR), the Trauma and loss spectrum-self report (TALS-SR), the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), and the Mood Spectrum-self report for suicidality. Intra-platelet BDNF levels were also assessed. The results highlighted lower BDNF levels in the ASD group; moreover, AdAS Spectrum and WSAS total score as well as AdAS Spectrum Restricted interest and rumination, WSAS Private leisure activities, TALS-SR Arousal, and SHY-SR Childhood domains were significant negative predictors of platelet BDNF levels.
