36830954|t|Transcription of Autophagy Associated Gene Expression as Possible Predictors of a Colorectal Cancer Prognosis.
36830954|a|(1) Background: Autophagy plays a dual role in oncogenesis-it contributes to the growth of the tumor and can inhibit its development. The aim of this study was to assess changes in the transcriptional activity of LAMP-2, BECN1, PINK1, and FOXO1 genes involved in the autophagy process in histopathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma sections of colorectal cancer: (2) Methods: A gene expression profile analysis was performed using HG-U133A and the RT-qPCR reaction. The transcriptional activity of genes was compared in sections of colorectal cancer in the four clinical stages (CSI-CSIV) concerning the control group; (3) Results: In CSI, the transcriptional activity of the PINK1 gene is highest; in CS II, the LAMP-2 gene is highest, while FOXO1 increases gradually from CSI reaching a maximum in CSIII. There is no BECN1 gene expression in colorectal cancer cells; (4) Conclusions: The observed differences in the mRNA concentration profile of autophagy-related genes in colon cancer specimens may indicate the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of this cancer. Genes involved in autophagy may be diagnostic tools for colorectal cancer screening and personalized therapy in the future.
