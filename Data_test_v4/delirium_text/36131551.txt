36131551|t|The Antioxidative Role of Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy as a Downstream Regulator of Oxidative Stress in Human Diseases.
36131551|a|Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) plays an important role in regulating a variety of cellular functions by selectively degrading damaged or functional proteins in the cytoplasm. One of the cellular processes in which CMA participates is the oxidative stress response. Oxidative stress regulates CMA activity, while CMA protects cells from oxidative damage by degrading oxidized proteins and preventing the accumulation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS). Changes in CMA activity have been found in many human diseases, and oxidative stress is also involved. Therefore, understanding the interaction mechanism of ROS and CMA will provide new targets for disease treatment. In this review, we discuss the role of CMA in combatting oxidative stress during the development of different conditions, such as aging, neurodegeneration, liver diseases, infections, pulmonary disorders, and cancers.
