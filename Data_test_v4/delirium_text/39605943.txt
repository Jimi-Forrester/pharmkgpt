39605943|a|Ovarian aging is a major health concern for women. Ovarian aging is associated with reduced health span and longevity. Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the hallmarks of ovarian aging. In addition to providing oocytes with optimal energy, the mitochondria provide a co-substrate that drives epigenetic processes. Studies show epigenetic alterations, both nuclear and mitochondrial contribute to ovarian aging. Both, nuclear and mitochondrial genomes cross-talk with each other, resulting in two ways orchestrated anterograde and retrograde response that involves epigenetic changes in nuclear and mitochondrial compartments. Epigenetic alterations causing changes in metabolism impact ovarian function. Key mitochondrial co-substrate includes acetyl CoA, NAD+, ATP, and alpha-KG. Thus, enhancing mitochondrial function in aging ovaries may preserve ovarian function and can lead to ovarian longevity and reproductive and better health outcomes in women. This article describes the role of mitochondria-led epigenetics involved in ovarian aging and discusses strategies to restore epigenetic reprogramming in oocytes by preserving, protecting, or promoting mitochondrial function.
