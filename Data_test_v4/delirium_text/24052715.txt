24052715|t|Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, progressive early-onset spinocerebellar ataxia, and late-onset sensorineural hearing loss: case report and literature review.
24052715|a|The association of ataxia, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and hearing loss is extremely rare. Considerable heterogeneity exists in the literature of the neurological manifestations, age of onset, clinical severity and associated abnormalities. We describe a 24-year-old woman with secondary hypergonadotropic amenorrhea, early-onset progressive spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), late-onset sensorineural hearing loss and normal intelligence and compare it with reported cases.
