38613094|t|Diet and Physical Activity in Fabry Disease: A Narrative Review.
38613094|a|Fabry disease (FD) is caused by mutations in the galactosidase alpha (GLA) gene which lead to the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb-3). Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and oral chaperone therapy are the current pharmacological treatments for this condition. However, in the literature, there is a growing emphasis on exploring non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies to improve the quality of life of patients with FD. In particular, the nutritional approach to FD has been marginally addressed in the scientific literature, although specific dietary interventions may be useful for the management of nephropathy and gastrointestinal complications, which are often present in patients with FD. Especially in cases of confirmed diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a low-FODMAP diet can represent an effective approach to improving intestinal manifestations. Furthermore, it is known that some food components, such as polyphenols, may be able to modulate some pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the disease, such as inflammation and oxidative stress. Therefore, the use of healthy dietary patterns should be encouraged in this patient group. Sports practice can be useful for patients with multi-organ involvement, particularly in cardiovascular, renal, and neurological aspects. Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge on the role of nutrition and physical activity in FD patients.
