39740074|a|With the advent of treatments that specifically target Alzheimer's disease brain pathology, biomarker tests will become an increasingly important part of the routine clinical evaluation of cognitive impairment and guide clinical decision making. Clinicians must ensure they are using accurate and well-validated biomarker tests and select the most appropriate testing modality for each patient based on individual and practical considerations. The interpretation of test results may be complex and depends on the pre-test probability and test-specific factors. Biomarker results must be presented and discussed with patients in a process that is sensitive to the major implications of the results and is carefully connected to diagnosis, prognosis, and management. Advances in treatments for Alzheimer's disease will likely require non-dementia specialists to use biomarkers, necessitating major educational efforts. In the new era of Alzheimer's disease treatments, biomarkers are essential tools that will be integrated into all aspects of dementia diagnosis and care.
