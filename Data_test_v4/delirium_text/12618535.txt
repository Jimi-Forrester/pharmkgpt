12618535|t|The delirium rating scale in children and adolescents.
12618535|a|The study of delirium has been neglected in pediatric patients, and there are no diagnostic criteria or rating scales adapted for use in this age group. The Delirium Rating Scale is widely used to diagnose and rate the severity of delirium in adults. It was retrospectively administered to 84 children and adolescents diagnosed with delirium to evaluate its applicability in pediatric patients. Delirium Rating Scale scores were comparable to those reported for delirium in adults, although single cross-sectional Delirium Rating Scale scores did not predict length of hospital stay or mortality outcome. Therefore, the Delirium Rating Scale can be used to evaluate delirium in the pediatric population.
