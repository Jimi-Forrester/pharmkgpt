37960314|t|Lipids, Gut Microbiota, and the Complex Relationship with Alzheimer's Disease: A Narrative Review.
37960314|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a multifactorial, progressive, and chronic neurodegenerative disorder associated with the aging process. Memory deficits, cognitive impairment, and motor dysfunction are characteristics of AD. It is estimated that, by 2050, 131.5 million people will have AD. There is evidence that the gastrointestinal microbiome and diet may contribute to the development of AD or act preventively. Communication between the brain and the intestine occurs through immune cells in the mucosa and endocrine cells, or via the vagus nerve. Aging promotes intestinal dysbiosis, characterized by an increase in pro-inflammatory pathogenic bacteria and a reduction in anti-inflammatory response-mediating bacteria, thus contributing to neuroinflammation and neuronal damage, ultimately leading to cognitive decline. Therefore, the microbiota-gut-brain axis has a significant impact on neurodegenerative disorders. Lipids may play a preventive or contributory role in the development of AD. High consumption of saturated and trans fats can increase cortisol release and lead to other chronic diseases associated with AD. Conversely, low levels of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may be linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Unlike other studies, this review aims to describe, in an integrative way, the interaction between the gastrointestinal microbiome, lipids, and AD, providing valuable insights into how the relationship between these factors affects disease progression, contributing to prevention and treatment strategies.
