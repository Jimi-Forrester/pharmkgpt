38192208|t|Designing nanodiscs as versatile platforms for on-demand therapy.
38192208|a|Nowadays, there has been an increasing utilization of nanomedicines for disease treatment. Nanodiscs (NDs) have emerged as a novel platform technology that garners significant attention in biomedical research and drug discovery. NDs are nanoscale phospholipid bilayer discs capable of incorporating membrane proteins and lipids within a native-like environment. They are assembled using amphiphilic biomacromolecular materials, such as apolipoprotein A1 or membrane scaffold proteins (MSPs), peptides, and styrene-maleic acid polymers (SMAs). NDs possess well-defined sizes and shapes, offering a stable, homogeneous, and biologically relevant environment for studying membrane proteins and lipids. Their unique properties have made them highly desirable for diverse applications, including cancer immunotherapy, vaccine development, antibacterial and antiviral therapy, and treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diabetes-related conditions. This review discusses the classifications, advantages, and applications of NDs in disease therapy.
