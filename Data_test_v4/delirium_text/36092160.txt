36092160|t|lncRNA ZFAS1 Positively Facilitates Endothelial Ferroptosis via miR-7-5p/ACSL4 Axis in Diabetic Retinopathy.
36092160|a|Accumulating evidence has suggested the significant role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) in regulating ferroptosis, while its regulatory mechanism in diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains unelucidated. In this work, we first demonstrated that lncRNA zinc finger antisense 1 (ZFAS1) is upregulated in high glucose-cultured human retinal endothelial cells (hRECs) and ZFAS1 inhibition attenuated high glucose- (HG-) induced ferroptosis, which was evidenced by cell viability, total iron and ferrous iron levels, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4) expression detection. Mechanistically, we validated that ZFAS1 may act as a competing endogenous RNA by competitively binding with microRNA-7-5p (miR-7-5p) and modulating the expression of its downstream molecule acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), which is now identified as a classic driver gene of ferroptosis process. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that HG-induced ZFAS1 elevation activates ferroptosis in hRECs and the ZFAS1/miR-7-5p/ACSL4 axis may serve as a therapeutic target for endothelial dysfunction in DR.
