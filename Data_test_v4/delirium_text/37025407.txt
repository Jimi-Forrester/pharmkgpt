37025407|a|Introduction: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has a high incidence rate globally, increasing the burden of death, disability, and the economy worldwide. Previous studies have found that the compositions of oral and intestinal microbiota changed respectively in T2DM; whether the changes were associated or interacted between the two sites and whether there were some associations between T2DM and the ectopic colonization of oral microbiota in the gut still need to be identified. Research design and methods: We performed a cross-sectional observational study; 183 diabetes and 74 controls were enrolled. We used high-throughput sequencing technology to detect the V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA in oral and stool samples. The Source Tracker method was used to identify the proportion of the intestinal microbiota that ectopic colonized from the oral cavity. Results: The oral marker bacteria of T2DM were found, such as Actinobacteria, Streptococcus, Rothia, and the intestinal marker bacteria were Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus, and Blautia at the genus level. Among them, Actinobacteria and Blautia played a vital role in different symbiotic relationships of oral and intestinal microbiota. The commonly distributed bacteria, such as Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria, were found in both oral and intestine. Moreover, the relative abundance and composition of bacteria were different between the two sites. The glycine betaine degradation I pathway was the significantly up-regulated pathway in the oral and intestinal flora of T2DM. The main serum indexes related to oral and intestinal flora were inflammatory. The relative abundance of Proteobacteria in the intestine and the Spirochete in oral was positively correlated, and the correlation coefficient was the highest, was 0.240 (P<0.01). The proportion of ectopic colonization of oral flora in the gut of T2DM was 2.36%. Conclusion: The dysbacteriosis exited in the oral and intestine simultaneously, and there were differences and connections in the flora composition at the two sites in T2DM. Ectopic colonization of oral flora in the intestine might relate to T2DM. Further, clarifying the oral-gut-transmitting bacteria can provide an essential reference for diagnosing and treating T2DM in the future.
