25635367|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is recognition that the use of sedative drugs in critically ill patients is potentially harmful, particularly in relation to ICU delirium and clinical outcomes. In that context, there is an increasing interest in maintaining light sedation, the use of non-gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist agents and antipsychotics. RECENT FINDINGS: The sedative drugs currently available have limitations relating to duration of action, cost or variability in response. Recent reviews and meta-analyses comparing sedatives in ICU patients differ in their findings depending on whether trials in elective cardiac surgical patients are included. Dexmedetomidine does appear to reduce the number of ventilator days in the less sick critically ill patient. There is currently no evidence to support the routine use of antipsychotics in ICU patients to prevent or treat delirium, although they will reduce agitation and they appear to be well tolerated when used in the critically ill patient. Sedation protocols and early mobilization reduce the use of sedative drugs and improve some outcomes but are challenging to implement in practice. SUMMARY: The bedside clinician needs to balance the need to sedate the patient and maintain life-saving support, while keeping their patient responsive, cooperative and pain free.
