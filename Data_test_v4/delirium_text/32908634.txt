32908634|t|The Latest View on the Mechanism of Ferroptosis and Its Research Progress in Spinal Cord Injury.
32908634|a|Ferroptosis is a recently identified nonapoptotic form of cell death whose major markers are iron dependence and accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species, accompanied by morphological changes such as shrunken mitochondria and increased membrane density. It appears to contribute to the death of tumors, ischemia-reperfusion, acute renal failure, and nervous system diseases, among others. The generative mechanism of ferroptosis includes iron overloading, lipid peroxidation, and downstream execution, while the regulatory mechanism involves the glutathione/glutathione peroxidase 4 pathway, as well as the mevalonate pathway and the transsulfuration pathway. In-depth research has continuously developed and enriched knowledge on the mechanism by which ferroptosis occurs. In recent years, reports of the noninterchangeable role played by selenium in glutathione peroxidase 4 and its function in suppressing ferroptosis and the discovery of ferroptosis suppressor protein 1, identified as a ferroptosis resistance factor parallel to the glutathione peroxidase 4 pathway, have expanded and deepened our understanding of the mechanism by which ferroptosis works. Ferroptosis has been reported in spinal cord injury animal model experiments, and the inhibition of ferroptosis could promote the recovery of neurological function. Here, we review the latest studies on mechanism by which ferroptosis occurs, focusing on the ferroptosis execution and the contents related to selenium and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1. In addition, we summarize the current research status of ferroptosis in spinal cord injury. The aim of this review is to better understand the mechanisms by which ferroptosis occurs and its role in the pathophysiological process of spinal cord injury, so as to provide a new idea and frame of reference for further exploration.
