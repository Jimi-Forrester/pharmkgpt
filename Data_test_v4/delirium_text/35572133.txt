35572133|t|Characterizing Differences in Functional Connectivity Between Posterior Cortical Atrophy and Semantic Dementia by Seed-Based Approach.
35572133|a|Background: Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) and semantic dementia (SD) are focal syndromes involving different cerebral regions. This study aimed to demonstrate the existence of abnormal functional connectivity (FC) with an affected network in PCA and SD. Methods: A total of 10 patients with PCA, 12 patients with SD, and 11 controls were recruited to undergo a detailed clinical history interview and physical examination, neuropsychological assessments, and PET/MRI scan. Seed-based FC analyses were conducted to construct FC in language network, visual network, and salience network. The two-sample t-test was performed to reveal distinct FC patterns in PCA and SD, and we further related the FC difference to cognition. Meanwhile, the uptake value of fluorodeoxyglucose in regions with FC alteration was also extracted for comparison. Results: We found a global cognitive impairment in patients with PCA and SD. The results of FC analyses showed that patients with PCA present decreased FC in left precentral gyrus to left V1 and increased FC in right inferior frontal gyrus to right V1 in the visual network, right medial frontal gyrus and left fusiform to left anterior temporal lobe and post-superior temporal gyrus in the language network, and left superior temporal gyrus to left anterior insula in the salience network, which were related to cognitive function. Patients with SD had decreased FC from right superior frontal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus and right superior frontal gyrus to left anterior temporal lobe, or post-superior temporal gyrus in the language network, as well as left superior frontal gyrus to right anterior insula in the salience network, positively relating to cognitive function, but increased FC in the right superior temporal gyrus to left anterior temporal lobe in the language network, and right insula and left anterior cingulum to right anterior insula in the salience network, negatively relating to cognitive function. Most of the regions with FC change in patients with PCA and SD had abnormal metabolism simultaneously. Conclusion: Abnormal connectivity spread over the cortex involving language and salience networks was common in patients with PCA and SD, whereas FC change involving the visual network was unique to patients with PCA. The FC changes were matched for cognitive deficits.
