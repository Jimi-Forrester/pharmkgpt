33614624|t|Inflammation and Wnt Signaling: Target for Immunomodulatory Therapy?
33614624|a|Wnt proteins comprise a large family of highly conserved glycoproteins known for their role in development, cell fate specification, tissue regeneration, and tissue homeostasis. Aberrant Wnt signaling is linked to developmental defects, malignant transformation, and carcinogenesis as well as to inflammation. Mounting evidence from recent research suggests that a dysregulated activation of Wnt signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as neuroinflammation, cancer-mediated inflammation, and metabolic inflammatory diseases. Recent findings highlight the role of Wnt in the modulation of inflammatory cytokine production, such as NF-kB signaling and in innate defense mechanisms as well as in the bridging of innate and adaptive immunity. This sparked the development of novel therapeutic treatments against inflammatory diseases based on Wnt modulation. Here, we summarize the role and function of the Wnt pathway in inflammatory diseases and focus on Wnt signaling as underlying master regulator of inflammation that can be therapeutically targeted.
