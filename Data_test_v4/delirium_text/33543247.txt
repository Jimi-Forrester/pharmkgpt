33543247|t|Sequence of clinical and neurodegeneration events in Parkinson's disease progression.
33543247|a|Dementia is one of the most debilitating aspects of Parkinson's disease. There are no validated biomarkers that can track Parkinson's disease progression, nor accurately identify patients who will develop dementia and when. Understanding the sequence of observable changes in Parkinson's disease in people at elevated risk for developing dementia could provide an integrated biomarker for identifying and managing individuals who will develop Parkinson's dementia. We aimed to estimate the sequence of clinical and neurodegeneration events, and variability in this sequence, using data-driven statistical modelling in two separate Parkinson's cohorts, focusing on patients at elevated risk for dementia due to their age at symptom onset. We updated a novel version of an event-based model that has only recently been extended to cope naturally with clinical data, enabling its application in Parkinson's disease for the first time. The observational cohorts included healthy control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease, of whom those diagnosed at age 65 or older were classified as having high risk of dementia. The model estimates that Parkinson's progression in patients at elevated risk for dementia starts with classic prodromal features of Parkinson's disease (olfaction, sleep), followed by early deficits in visual cognition and increased brain iron content, followed later by a less certain ordering of neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra and cortex, neuropsychological cognitive deficits, retinal thinning in dopamine layers, and further deficits in visual cognition. Importantly, we also characterize variation in the sequence. We found consistent, cross-validated results within cohorts, and agreement between cohorts on the subset of features available in both cohorts. Our sequencing results add powerful support to the increasing body of evidence suggesting that visual processing specifically is affected early in patients with Parkinson's disease at elevated risk of dementia. This opens a route to earlier and more precise detection, as well as a more detailed understanding of the pathological mechanisms underpinning Parkinson's dementia.
