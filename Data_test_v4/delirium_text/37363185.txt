37363185|t|Arterial stiffness and its influence on cerebral morphology and cognitive function.
37363185|a|Background: Recently, arterial stiffness has been associated with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), brain atrophy and vascular dementia. Arterial stiffness is assessed via pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurement and is strongly dependent on arterial blood pressure. While circadian blood pressure fluctuations are important determinants of end-organ damage, the role of 24-h PWV variability is yet unclear. Objectives: We here investigated the association between PWV and its circadian changes on brain morphology and cognitive function in community-dwelling individuals. Design: Single-centre, prospective, community-based follow-up study. Methods: The study cohort comprised elderly community-based participants of the Austrian Stroke Prevention Family Study which was started in 2006. Patients with any history of cerebrovascular disease or dementia were excluded. The study consists of 84 participants who underwent ambulatory 24-h PWV measurement. White matter hyperintensity volume and brain volume were evaluated by 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A subgroup of patients was evaluated for cognitive function using an extensive neuropsychological test battery. Results: PWV was significantly related to reduced total brain volume (p = 0.013), which was independent of blood pressure and blood pressure variability. We found no association between PWV with markers of cerebral SVD or impaired cognitive functioning. Only night-time PWV values were associated with global brain atrophy (p = 0.005). Conclusions: This study shows a relationship of arterial stiffness and reduced total brain volume. Elevations in PWV during night-time are of greater importance than day-time measures.
