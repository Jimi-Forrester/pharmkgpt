34861083|a|BACKGROUND: The role of intraoperative magnesium for the prevention of emergence agitation or delirium is unclear as there have been conflicting results reported by several randomized controlled trials. AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of magnesium sulfate on emergence agitation or emergence delirium in pediatric patients. METHODS: Electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science, were searched to identify studies which evaluated the effects of magnesium on postoperative emergence agitation or emergence delirium. The primary outcome was the incidence of emergence agitation or emergence delirium during the post-anesthesia stay. The secondary outcome was the agitation or delirium score upon admission to the post-anesthesia care unit. We estimated the odds ratio and standardized mean difference using a random-effect model. RESULTS: A total of 712 pediatric patients from 10 randomized controlled trials were included in the final analysis. The incidence of emergence agitation or emergence delirium was 29.7% in the magnesium group and 50.5% in the control group. The pooled effect size revealed that the administration of magnesium sulfate significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative emergence agitation or emergence delirium in pediatric patients undergoing surgery with general anesthesia (Odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.15 to 0.64; p = .002). Additionally, children in the magnesium group reported significantly lower agitation or delirium scores than those in the control group (standardized mean difference, -0.70; 95% confidence interval, -1.15 to -0.24; p = .003). CONCLUSION: The administration of magnesium sulfate reduced the incidence and severity of emergence agitation or emergence delirium in pediatric patients after the use of general anesthesia during surgery.
