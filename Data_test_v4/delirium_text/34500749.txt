34500749|a|Imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine compounds are a new class of promising lead molecules to which we have incorporated polar nitro and amino moieties to increase the scope of their biological activity. Two of these substituted 3-nitro-6-amino-imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine compounds (5c and 5h) showed potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity (IC50 40-50 nM), which we have previously reported. In this study, we wanted to test the biological efficacy of these compounds. Cytotoxicity assays showed that compound 5h mediated greater cell death with over 43% of cells dead at 100 muM and activation of caspase 3-mediated apoptosis. On the other hand, compound 5c mediated a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation. Both compounds showed cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase and reduced cellular ATP levels leading to activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and enhanced mitochondrial oxidative stress. It has to be noted that all these effects were observed at doses beyond 10 muM, 200-fold above the IC50 for AChE inhibition. Both compounds also inhibited bacterial lipopolysaccharide-mediated cyclooxygenase-2 and nitric oxide release in primary rat microglial cells. These results suggested that the substituted imidazo (1,2-b) pyridazine compounds, which have potent AChE inhibitory activity, were also capable of antiproliferative, anti-migratory, and anti-inflammatory effects at higher doses.
