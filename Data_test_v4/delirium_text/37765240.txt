37765240|t|Influence of Surface Ligand Density and Particle Size on the Penetration of the Blood-Brain Barrier by Porous Silicon Nanoparticles.
37765240|a|Overcoming the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains a significant challenge with regard to drug delivery to the brain. By incorporating targeting ligands, and by carefully adjusting particle sizes, nanocarriers can be customized to improve drug delivery. Among these targeting ligands, transferrin stands out due to the high expression level of its receptor (i.e., transferrin receptor) on the BBB. Porous silicon nanoparticles (pSiNPs) are a promising drug nanocarrier to the brain due to their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and exceptional drug-loading capacity. However, an in-depth understanding of the optimal nanoparticle size and transferrin surface density, in order to maximize BBB penetration, is still lacking. To address this gap, a diverse library of pSiNPs was synthesized using bifunctional poly(ethylene glycol) linkers with methoxy or/and carboxyl terminal groups. These variations allowed us to explore different transferrin surface densities in addition to particle sizes. The effects of these parameters on the cellular association, uptake, and transcytosis in immortalized human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) were investigated using multiple in vitro systems of increasing degrees of complexity. These systems included the following: a 2D cell culture, a static Transwell model, and a dynamic BBB-on-a-chip model. Our results revealed the significant impact of both the ligand surface density and size of pSiNPs on their ability to penetrate the BBB, wherein intermediate-level transferrin densities and smaller pSiNPs exhibited the highest BBB transportation efficiency in vitro. Moreover, notable discrepancies emerged between the tested in vitro assays, further emphasizing the necessity of using more physiologically relevant assays, such as a microfluidic BBB-on-a-chip model, for nanocarrier testing and evaluation.
