33104755|t|Cholesterol oxidase from Rhodococcus erythropolis with high specificity toward beta-cholestanol and pytosterols.
33104755|a|Two genes (choRI and choRII) encoding cholesterol oxidases belonging to the vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (VAO) family were cloned on the basis of putative cholesterol oxidase gene sequences in the genome sequence data of Rhodococcus erythropolis PR4. The genes corresponding to the mature enzymes were cloned in a pET vector and expressed in Escherichia coli. The two cholesterol oxidases produced from the recombinant E. coli were purified to examine their properties. The amino acid sequence of ChoRI showed significant similarity (57%) to that of ChoRII. ChoRII was more stable than ChoRI in terms of pH and thermal stability. The substrate specificities of these enzymes differed distinctively from one another. Interestingly, the activities of ChoRII toward beta-cholestanol, beta-sitosterol, and stigmasterol were 2.4-, 2.1-, and 1.7-fold higher, respectively, than those of cholesterol. No cholesterol oxidases with high activity toward these sterols have been reported so far. The cholesterol oxidation products from these two enzymes also differed. ChoRI and ChoRII oxidized cholesterol to form cholest-4-en-3-one and 6beta-hydroperoxycholest-4-en-3-one, respectively.
