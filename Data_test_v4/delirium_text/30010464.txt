30010464|t|Period from Loss of the Ability to Access Toilets Independently to Death in End-Stage Cancer Patients.
30010464|a|Background: Toileting independence is considered to be important factors for achieving a "good death" for terminally ill patients. Aim: To clarify the period from loss of the ability to access toilets independently to death in end-stage cancer patients. Design: Observational study. Setting/Participants: The medical records of all end-stage cancer patients who had died while using home care services provided by Medical Corporation Kagayaki General Home Care Clinic between September 2011 and August 2017, were retrospectively reviewed. Results: A total of 220 patients were included. The median time from total dependence in toileting to death was 6.0 (95% confidence interval: 5.0-7.0) days. When the duration was 7 days or shorter and 21 days or shorter, the cumulative death rate was 55.9% and 86.4% respectively. Conclusion: A large percentage of terminally ill cancer patients maintained the ability to access toilets independently until very close to the end of their lives, so the duration of total assistance needed was shorter. These findings may be useful to make a care plan to support achieving "good death" for patients.
