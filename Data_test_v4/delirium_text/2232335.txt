2232335|a|A 50-year-old driver was arrested in a drunken stupor while he was driving a track. He suddenly died after five days of the arrest in a jail. As time went by, various symptoms of alcohol withdrawal appeared. He was in the state of delirium treatments for about a day before he died. Gross and microscopical examination revealed fibrosis and fatty degeneration of liver and heart lesions representing chronic and acute ischemia. We discussed the cause and the mechanism of the death in the case and reviewed those in the previous observations.
