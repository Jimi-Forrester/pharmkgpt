28727426|t|Fully Atomistic Abeta40 and Abeta42 Oligomers in Water: Observation of Porelike Conformations.
28727426|a|Oligomers formed by amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) are central to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, yet their structure remains elusive. Of the two predominant Abeta alloforms, Abeta40 and Abeta42, the latter is more strongly associated with AD. Here, we structurally characterized Abeta40 and Abeta42 monomers through pentamers which were converted from previously derived coarse-grained (DMD4B-HYDRA) simulations into all-atom conformations and subjected to explicit-solvent MD. Free energy landscapes revealed that structural differences between Abeta40 and Abeta42 conformations increase with oligomer order up to trimers. All conformations display high statistical coil and turn content (40-50%) with minor beta-strand and alpha-helical content (<10%). Abeta40 tetramers and pentamers exhibit significantly more elongated morphologies than the respective Abeta42 conformations. Unlike the initial DMD4B-HYDRA conformations, fully atomistic Abeta40 and Abeta42 trimers, tetramers, and pentamers form water-permeable pores, whereby the tendency for pore formation sharply increased with oligomer order and is the highest for Abeta42 pentamers. Previous studies reported that Abeta oligomers form ion channels when embedded into a cellular membrane, which causes an abnormal ion flux and eventually leads to cell death. Our findings reveal an extraordinary ability of Abeta oligomers to form pores in pure water prior to their insertion into a membrane and thus provide support to the ion channel hypothesis of AD.
