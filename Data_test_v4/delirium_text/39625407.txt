39625407|t|Exploring aortic stiffness in aging mice: a comprehensive methodological overview.
39625407|a|Stiffening of the vascular network is associated with the early stages of vascular aging, leading to cardiovascular disorders (hypertension), renal failures, or neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's). Unfortunately, many people remain undiagnosed because diagnostic methods are either unsuitable for a large population or unfamiliar to clinicians which favor the hypertension evaluation. In preclinical research, stiffness studies are often partially conducted. We think that the evaluation of aortic stiffness is essential as it would improve our understanding of aging diseases progression. We propose here a systematic method using decision trees in a multi-scale and multimodal approaches. Our method was evaluated by analyzing the aortic situation in old and young mice. We demonstrate that both the endothelial and smooth muscle cells exhibit pronounced functional alterations in favor of constriction. Additionally, there is significant remodeling of the extracellular matrix, leading to a drastic degradation of elastic fibers and the accumulation of collagen in the aortic wall. This series of changes contributes to the development of vascular rigidity, a preliminary stage of arterial hypertension. Our results suggest that our method should improve preclinical understanding and encourage clinicians to equip themselves with tools for assessing vascular function, as it is an essential issue for preventing numerous pathologies.
