26668576|t|Prostate Cancer: Cases of Rare Presentation and Rare Metastasis.
26668576|a|Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men. Diagnosis of early disease is based on prostate biopsy which is carried out because of symptoms of prostatism or asymptomatic rise in PSA. On the other side, advanced disease can locally invade and metastasise to lymph nodes, bones, lungs, etc. Initial presentation of prostate cancer in form of brain metastasis is extremely seldom. Similarly, prostate cancer, which metastasised to the breast, is very rare too. Here, we discuss two unique cases of prostate cancer, one of them had an initial presentation of brain metastasis from prostate adenocarcinoma and the other case had an established diagnosis of prostate cancer metastasised to the breast. In theory, cancer can cause metastatic spread to any part of the body; however diversity into such presentation or progression from prostate cancer has not been frequently noticed.
