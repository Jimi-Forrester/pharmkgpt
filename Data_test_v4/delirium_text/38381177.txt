38381177|a|We aimed to investigate the effect of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) on cholinergic system integrity in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. Nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) volume and cholinergic pathways integrity was evaluated at baseline, 1-, 2-, and 4-year follow-ups in 40 cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants, 29 MCI patients without SVD, and 23 MCI patients with SVD. We compared cholinergic markers among three groups and examined their associations with SVD burden in MCI patients. We used linear mixed models to assess longitudinal changes in cholinergic markers over time among groups. Mediation analysis was employed to investigate the mediating role of cholinergic system degeneration between SVD and cognitive impairment. Increased mean diffusivity (MD) in medial and lateral pathways was observed in MCI patients with SVD compared to those without SVD and CU participants. Both MCI groups showed decreased NBM volume compared to CU participants, while there was no significant difference between the two MCI groups. Longitudinally, compared to CU participants, MCI patients with SVD displayed a more rapid change in MD in both pathways, but not in NBM volume. Furthermore, SVD burden was associated with cholinergic pathway disruption and its faster rate of change in MCI patients. However, mediation analyses showed that cholinergic pathways did not mediate significant indirect effects of SVD burden on cognitive impairment. Our findings suggest that SVD could accelerate the degeneration of cholinergic pathways in MCI patients. However, they do not provide evidence to support that SVD could contribute to cognitive impairment through cholinergic system injury.
