39609531|a|Diet is a potentially modifiable neurodegenerative disease risk factor. We studied the effects of a typical Western diet (WD; high in refined carbohydrates, cholesterol and saturated fat), relative to a heart-healthy diet (HHD; high in unrefined carbohydrates, polyunsaturated fat and fiber, and low in cholesterol) on brain microvessel transcriptomics and brain metabolomics of the temporal region in Ossabaw minipigs. Thirty-two pigs (16 male and 16 females) were fed a WD or HHD starting at the age of 4 months for a period of 6 months. The WD and HHD were isocaloric and had a similar macronutrient content but differed in macronutrient quality. Within each dietary group, half of the pigs also received atorvastatin. Relative to HHD-fed pigs, WD-fed pigs had 175 genes differentially expressed (fold change > 1.3, FDR < 0.05) by diet, 46 upregulated and 129 downregulated. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis identified 22 gene sets enriched in WD-fed pigs, comprising pathways related to inflammation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis, and 53 gene sets enriched in the HHD-fed pigs, including cell energetics, neurotransmission, and inflammation resolution pathways. Metabolite analysis showed enrichment in arginine, tyrosine, and lysine in WD-fed pigs, and ergothioneine and S-adenosyl methionine in HHD-fed pigs. Atorvastatin treatment did not affect gene expression. These results suggest a likely contribution of diet to brain pathologies characterized by neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.
