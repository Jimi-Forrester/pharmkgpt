39760845|a|We have previously shown in small studies that full brain Transcranial Radiofrequency Wave Treatment (TRFT) to subjects with Alzheimer's Disease could stop and reverse their cognitive decline. An 8-emitter head device, the "MemorEM", was used in these studies to provide TRFT at 915 MHz frequency and power level of 1.6 W/kg Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) during daily 1-hour treatments. Although no deleterious side effects during up to 2.5 years of treatment were reported, it is important to rule out the possibility that brain heating will occur during TRFT in humans at a higher power level of 4.0 W/kg SAR, which is anticipated for future clinical testing in order to increase treatment intensity/efficacy to deep sub-cortical areas. To examine if brain heating occurs during a single 1-hour treatment at 4 W/kg SAR, a hollow human head phantom filled with brain-analogous gel and with an attached MemorEM head device was utilized. Brain temperatures were taken at 64 specific coordinates within the brain gel before and immediately following one-hour of TRFT. Results revealed none of the 64 sites having a temperature increase after TRFT of 1  C or more. Indeed, 45 of the 64 sites exhibited a temperature rise of less than 0.5  C, with just three sites exhibiting an increase between 0.75 and 0.9  C. These results demonstrate that TRFT in a human head phantom that mimics the electromagnetic properties of the human head, does not appreciably increase brain temperature (i.e., is non-thermal) at 915 MHz frequency and 4 W/kg SAR power level. Thus, TRFT would appear to be safe at 4 W/kg for long-term daily treatments.
