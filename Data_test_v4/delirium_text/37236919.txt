37236919|a|The fornix is a white matter bundle located in the center of the hippocampaldiencephalic limbic circuit that controls memory and executive functions, yet its genetic architectures and involvement in brain disorders remain largely unknown. We carried out a genome-wide association analysis of 30,832 UK Biobank individuals of the six fornix diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) traits. The post-GWAS analysis allowed us to identify causal genetic variants in phenotypes at the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), locus, and gene levels, as well as genetic overlap with brain health-related traits. We further generalized our GWAS in adolescent brain cognitive development (ABCD) cohort. The GWAS identified 63 independent significant variants within 20 genomic loci associated (P < 8.33 x 10-9) with the six fornix dMRI traits. Geminin coiled-coil domain containing (GMNC) and NUAK family SNF1-like kinase 1 (NUAK1) gene were highlighted, which were found in UKB and replicated in ABCD. The heritability of the six traits ranged from 10% to 27%. Gene mapping strategies identified 213 genes, where 11 were supported by all of four methods. Gene-based analyses revealed pathways relating to cell development and differentiation, with astrocytes found to be significantly enriched. Pleiotropy analyses with eight neurological and psychiatric disorders revealed shared variants, especially with schizophrenia under the conjFDR threshold of 0.05. These findings advance our understanding of the complex genetic architectures of fornix and their relevance in neurological and psychiatric disorders.
