37388715|t|Treatment mechanism of immune triad from the repurposing drug against COVID-19.
37388715|a|COVID-19 is an immune-mediated disease whose pathophysiology uses SAMHD1 tetramerization and cGAS-STING signaling, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) cascade, spike protein- inflammasome activation, and neuropilin 1 (NRP1) signaling. Variants of concern, such as SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Subvariants BQ.1, BQ.1.1, BA.4.6, BF.7, BA.2.75.2, and other mutants, have emerged. The longitudinal memory T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 persists for eight months after symptom onset. Therefore, we must achieve viral clearance to coordinate immune cell reactions. Aspirin, dapsone, and dexamethasone as anticatalysis medicines have been used to treat COVID-19. They are shown to work harmoniously with modulating ILCs. Therefore, it needs to prescribe this immune triad to alleviate the clinical pathologic course and block exacerbation mechanisms due to diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants.
