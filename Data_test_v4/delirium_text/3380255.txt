3380255|t|Effect of acute arecoline, tacrine and arecoline + tacrine post-training administration on retention in old mice.
3380255|a|The amnesias characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and other age-related dementias are refractory to conventional pharmacotherapy. A recent treatment strategy is to combine drugs to improve their memory enhancing effect. We previously reported that in young weakly trained mice, the combination of arecoline and tacrine was more effective on a mg/kg basis than either drug administered alone. This was true whether the route of administration was intracerebroventricular, subcutaneous or oral. We now report that 24 month old mice trained to avoid footshock in a T-maze show poor retention when tested one week later. Subcutaneous administration of arecoline, tacrine (also referred to as tetrahydroaminoacridine, THA) and arecoline plus tacrine administered immediately after T-maze footshock avoidance training enhanced retention of 24 month old mice compared to the saline-injected control. Since the combination was as effective as the single drug treatments even though 96% less arecoline and 99.7% less tacrine was administered, the combination showed marked potentiation of drug action of memory processing.
