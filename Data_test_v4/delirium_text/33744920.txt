33744920|a|BACKGROUND: oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) and hip fracture are common problems in older patients, both associated with important complications. OBJECTIVE: the aim of this study was to measure the prevalence and identify the main risk factors of dysphagia in older patients with hip fracture. DESIGN: a prospective study in an orthogeriatric unit of a university hospital over 10 months. METHODS: a total of 320 patients (mean age 86.2 years, 73.4% women) were assessed for dysphagia within 72 hours post-surgery using the Volume-Viscosity Swallow Test. Geriatric assessment, hip fracture management and complications were examined to determine their relationship with the presence of OD. RESULTS: dysphagia was present in 176 (55%) patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of delirium during hospitalization and the inability to perform instrumental activities of daily living before admission were associated with OD. CONCLUSIONS: the prevalence of OD is high in hip fracture patients. Objective dysphagia assessment should be routinely included as part of the geriatric assessment of such patients.
