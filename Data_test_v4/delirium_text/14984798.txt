14984798|a|Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. The relationship between amnesia induced by central administration of aggregated Abeta(25-35) and neurodegeneration in the hippocampus was investigated. One month after a single intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta(25-35) (15 nmol), male Wistar rats were tested in an eight-arm radial maze. A quantitative evaluation of cell number in hippocampal regions was carried out on H&E-stained brain sections of rats used in the behavioral study. Indices of free radical-mediated processes in the hippocampus were evaluated in additional groups of animals 1, 3, 5, and 30 days after surgery. Abeta(25-35) induced impairments of working and reference memory (RM) as well as neurodegeneration in the CA1 but not in the CA3 field of the hippocampus. A significant correlation between both reference and working memory (WM) impairments and the neuronal cell loss in the hippocampal CA1 region was demonstrated. A gradually developing oxidative stress was evident in the hippocampus of rats treated with Abeta(25-35) as indicated by the increase in 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBARS) reactive substances and superoxide generation. These data suggest the involvement of oxidative stress in Abeta(25-35)-induced neurodegeneration and a relation between memory impairment and neurodegeneration in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus.
