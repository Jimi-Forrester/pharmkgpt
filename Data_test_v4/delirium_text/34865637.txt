34865637|t|Nocturnal dexmedetomidine alleviates post-intensive care syndrome following cardiac surgery: a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial.
34865637|a|BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine is a sedative agent that may have the potential to reduce the risk of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). This study aimed to establish whether prophylactic nocturnal dexmedetomidine safely reduces postoperative PICS incidence and to develop an easy-to-use model for predicting the risk of PICS following cardiac surgery. METHODS: This was a single-center, double-blind, randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled trial. Patients undergoing cardiac surgery were randomly assigned (1:1) to dexmedetomidine or placebo (normal saline) groups between January 2019 and July 2020. Dexmedetomidine or a similar volume of saline was administered, with an infusion rate up to 1.2 mug/kg/h until the RASS remained between - 1 and 0. The primary study endpoint was PICS incidence at 6 months follow-up, as defined by cognitive, physical, or psychological impairments. RESULTS: We assessed 703 individuals for eligibility, of whom 508 were enrolled. Of these, there were 251 in the dexmedetomidine group and 257 in the placebo group that received the trial agent, forming a modified intention-to-treat population. PICS incidence at 6-month follow-up was significantly decreased in the dexmedetomidine group (54/251, 21.5%) relative to the placebo group (80/257, 31.1%) (odds ratio [OR] 0.793, 95% CI 0.665-0.945; p = 0.014). Psychological impairment was significantly reduced in the dexmedetomidine group relative to the placebo group (18.7% vs. 26.8%, OR 0.806, CI 0.672-0.967, p = 0.029). However, dexmedetomidine treatment was associated with a higher rate of hypotension. A nomogram revealed that age, education, a medical history of diabetes and smoking, dexmedetomidine treatment, postoperative atrial fibrillation, and sequential organ failure assessment scores at 8 h post-surgery were independent predictors of PICS. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic nocturnal dexmedetomidine administration significantly reduced PICS incidence by a marked reduction in psychological impairment within a 6-month follow-up period.
