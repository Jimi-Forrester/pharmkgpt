37833411|a|The pathological outcome of dengue disease results from complex interactions between dengue virus (DENV) and host genetics and immune response. Complement receptor types 1 and 2 (CR1 and CR2) mediate complement activation through the alternative pathway. This study investigated the possible association of genetic polymorphisms and plasma levels of CR1 and CR2 with dengue disease. A total of 267 dengue patients and 133 healthy controls were recruited for this study. CR1 and CR2 gene polymorphisms were analyzed by Sanger sequencing, while plasma CR1 and CR2 levels were measured by ELISA. The frequency of the CR1 minor allele rs6691117G was lower in dengue patients and those with severe dengue compared to healthy controls. Plasma CR1 and CR2 levels were decreased in dengue patients compared to healthy controls (P < 0.0001) and were associated with platelet counts. CR1 levels were lower in dengue patients with warning signs (DWS) compared to those without DWS, while CR2 levels were decreased according to the severity of the disease and after 5 days (T1) and 8 days (T2) of follow-up. CR2 levels were decreased in dengue patients positive for anti-DENV IgG and IgM and patients with bleeding and could discriminate DWS and SD from dengue fever patients (AUC = 0.66). In conclusion, this study revealed a reduction in CR2 levels in dengue patients and that the CR1 SNP rs6691117A/G is associated with the dengue severity. The correlation of CR2 levels with platelet counts suggests that CR2 could be an additional biomarker for the prognosis of severe dengue disease.
