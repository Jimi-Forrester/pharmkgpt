36182540|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is an acute change in behaviour, characterised by a fluctuating course, inattention, and disorganised thinking. For critically ill adults in the intensive care, the incidence of delirium has been reported to be at least 30% and is associated with both short-term and long-term complications, longer hospital stay, increased risk of mortality, and long-term cognitive problems. AIM: The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a nurse-led delirium-prevention protocol in reducing the incidence and duration of delirium among adults admitted to intensive care. METHODS: A hybrid stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the implementation and dissemination of the nurse-led intervention to reduce the incidence and duration of delirium among adults admitted to the four adults intensive care units in the southwest of Sydney, Australia. RESULTS: Between May 2019 and February 2020, over a 10-month period, 2618 admissions, among 2566 patients, were included in the study. After an initial 3-month baseline period, each month there was a random crossover to the nurse-led intervention in one of the four intensive care units, and by the 7th month of the trial, all units were exposed to the intervention for at least 3 months. The incidence of acute delirium was observed to be 10.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 9.1-12.4%), compared to 14.1% (95% CI = 12.2-16.2%) during the preintervention (baseline) period (adjusted rate ratio [adjRR] = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.57-1.08, p = 0.134). The average delirium-free-days for these preintervention and postintervention periods were 4.1 days (95% CI = 3.9-4.3) and 4.4 days (95% CI = 4.2-4.5), respectively (adjusted difference = 0.24 days [95% CI = -0.12 to 0.60], p = 0.199). CONCLUSION: Following the introduction of a nurse-led, nonpharmacological intervention to reduce the burden of delirium, among adults admitted to intensive care, we observed no statistically significant decrease in the incidence of delirium or the duration of delirium.
