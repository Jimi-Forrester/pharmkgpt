21330304|t|Sink hypothesis and therapeutic strategies for attenuating Abeta levels.
21330304|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) plaque, comprised mainly by Abeta peptides, is an important pathology of Alzheimer's brains. Major efforts have been devoted to targeting this neurotoxic Abeta peptide for discovering disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Inasmuch as Abeta is found in both the brain and the periphery, it is hypothesized that there is some form of equilibrium for the Abeta in the brain and the periphery such that Abeta can be transported across the blood-brain barrier. By modulating the periphery Abeta levels, it is predicted that the brain Abeta levels will undergo concomitant changes, forming the basis of the "sink hypothesis" for Abeta lowering strategies. In this review, the significance and implication of this sink hypothesis as well as how the sink hypothesis may contribute to the recent Abeta-based drug discovery in AD are discussed. Ultimately, the validity of the sink hypothesis will be resolved when the appropriate Abeta agents are being tested in the clinic.
