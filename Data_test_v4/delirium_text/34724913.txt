34724913|a|BACKGROUND: The prevalence of delirium, its associated factors, and its impact on long-term mortality among survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is unclear. METHODS: Since this was a population-based study, data were extracted from the National Health Insurance database in South Korea. All adults who were admitted to intensive care units with a diagnosis of ARDS between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2019, and who survived for >= 60 days were included. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, tenth revision code of delirium (F05) was used to extract delirium cases during hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 6809 ARDS survivors were included in the analysis, and 319 patients (4.7%) were diagnosed with delirium during hospitalization. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis after covariate adjustment, male sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23, 2.08; P < 0.001), longer duration of hospitalization (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01, 1.03; P < 0.001), neuromuscular blockade use (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.12, 2.01; P = 0.006), benzodiazepine (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.13, 2.13; P = 0.007) and propofol (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.01, 2.17; P = 0.046) continuous infusion, and concurrent depression (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.01, 1.71; P = 0.044) were associated with a higher prevalence of delirium among ARDS survivors. In the multivariable Cox regression analysis after adjustment for covariates, the occurrence of delirium was not significantly associated with 1-year all-cause mortality, when compared to the other survivors who did not develop delirium (hazard ratio: 0.85, 95% CI 1.01, 1.71; P = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: In South Korea, 4.7% of ARDS survivors were diagnosed with delirium during hospitalization in South Korea. Some factors were potential risk factors for the development of delirium, but the occurrence of delirium might not affect 1-year all-cause mortality among ARDS survivors.
