39060980|a|OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in individuals undergoing various medical procedures. We systematically searched electronic databases and manually identified relevant articles to assess the impact of dexmedetomidine on BDNF levels in surgical patients. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science databases with no language restrictions. Studies that examined the effects of dexmedetomidine administration on BDNF levels in surgical patients were included. RESULTS: The overall analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in BDNF levels in individuals receiving dexmedetomidine compared to controls (Standardized Mean Difference SMD = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.28; I2: 89%). Subgroup analyses based on the anesthesia method (p < 0.01), and the type of surgery (p < 0.01) showed significant between-group differences (Fig. 3). The results of the sensitivity analyses indicated that individual studies did not significantly affect the overall results. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis indicates that dexmedetomidine administration is associated with a significant increase in BDNF levels in individuals undergoing surgical procedures. These findings highlight the potential role of dexmedetomidine in modulating BDNF levels, which may have implications for optimizing perioperative neuroprotective strategies and improving patient outcomes.
