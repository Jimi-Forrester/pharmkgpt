39465944|t|Split-Luciferase Reassembly Assay to Measure Endoplasmic Reticulum-Mitochondria Contacts in Live Cells.
39465944|a|Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria contact sites play a critical role in cell health and homeostasis, such as the regulation of Ca2+ and lipid homeostasis, mitochondrial dynamics, autophagosome and mitophagosome biogenesis, and apoptosis. Failure to maintain normal ER-mitochondrial coupling is implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and hereditary spastic paraplegia. It is of considerable significance to explore how the dysregulation of ER-mitochondrial contacts could lead to cell death and whether repairing these contacts to the normal level could ameliorate neurodegenerative conditions. Thus, improved assays that measure the level of these contacts could help to illuminate the pathogenic mechanisms of these diseases. Ultimately, establishing simple and reliable assays will facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies. Here we describe a split-luciferase assay to quantitatively measure the level of ER-mitochondria contacts in live cells. This assay can be used to study the pathophysiological role of these contacts as well as to identify their modulators in high-throughput screening.
