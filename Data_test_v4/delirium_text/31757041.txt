31757041|t|Optimizing the Synthetic Route of Chromone-2-carboxylic Acids: A Step forward to Speed-Up the Discovery of Chromone-Based Multitarget-Directed Ligands.
31757041|a|6-Bromochromone-2-carboxylic acid (3) was synthesized by a microwave-assisted process. The optimization of the reaction was performed varying parameters, such as type of base/number of reagent equivalents, solvent, temperature and reaction time. The yield of the reaction was improved to 87%. The new synthetic route is versatile as several chromone-2-carboxylic acids (compounds 4B-10B) were obtained with good yields (54-93%). Only in the case of the nitro substituent (compound 11B), an ester was obtained instead of the desired carboxylic acid. Following this synthetic route chromone carboxylic acids can be attained with a high degree of purity, without the need of the tedious and expensive purification processes through column chromatography. The reaction is safe, cost-effective, fast and robust, and can be used in the development of concise and diversity-oriented libraries based on chromone scaffold. The overall study can be looked as a step forward to speed-up the discovery of chromone-based multitarget-directed ligands.
