39485609|a|This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which chronic alcohol consumption impacts female infertility, highlighting significant societal implications. By conducting a comprehensive literature review, we examined existing evidence on the association between long-term alcohol use and female reproductive health. Relevant studies were identified through systematic searches of electronic databases and key journals. We synthesized information on the molecular pathways affected by alcohol consumption, with particular emphasis on oxidative stress, inflammation, and hormonal disruptions. Additionally, we reviewed efforts to address alcohol-related health issues, including public health interventions, regulatory measures, and educational initiatives. Our study found strong evidence linking chronic alcohol consumption to increased mortality rates and a range of preventable diseases globally. Alcohol's effects extend beyond physiological consequences to psychological, social, and economic burdens. Chronic alcohol consumption disrupts hormonal balance and reproductive function, contributing to female infertility. Future research should focus on quantifying mortality risks associated with alcohol consumption, understanding gender-specific patterns in alcohol-related health outcomes, and elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying female infertility. Addressing these gaps will inform strategies to mitigate the burden of alcohol-induced health issues and promote overall well-being. Collaborative efforts among diverse stakeholders are essential for advancing research agendas and translating findings into effective interventions.
