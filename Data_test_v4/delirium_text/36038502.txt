36038502|a|Solid-state nanopores are an emerging technology used as a high-throughput, label-free analytical method for the characterization of protein aggregation in an aqueous solution. In this work, we used Levodopamine to coat a silicon nitride nanopore surface that was fabricated through a dielectric breakdown in order to reduce the unspecific adsorption. The coating of inner nanopore wall by investigation of the translocation of heparin. The functionalized nanopore was used to investigate the aggregation of amyloid-beta and alpha-synuclein, two biomarkers of degenerative diseases. In the first application, we demonstrate that the alpha-synuclein WT is more prone to form dimers than the variant A53T. In the second one, we show for the Abeta(42)-E22Delta (Osaka mutant) that the addition of Abeta(42)-WT monomers increases the polymorphism of oligomers, while the incubation with Abeta(42)-WT fibrils generates larger aggregates.
