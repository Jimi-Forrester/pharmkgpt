33538844|t|Delirium in trauma patients: a 1-year prospective cohort study of 2026 patients.
33538844|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium in trauma surgery is common, especially post-operatively, but medical characteristics, risk factors and residence post-discharge have not comprehensively been investigated in all trauma patients. METHODS: Over 1 year, 2026 trauma patients were prospectively screened for delirium with the following tools: Delirium Observation screening scale (DOS), Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) and a DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual)-5, nursing tool (ePA-AC) construct. Risk factors-predisposing und precipitating-for delirium were assessed via multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 2026 trauma patients, 440 (21.7%) developed delirium, which was associated with an increased risk of assisted living (OR 6.42, CI 3.92-10.49), transfer to nursing home (OR 4.66, CI 3.29-6.6), rehabilitation (OR 3.96, CI 3.1-5.1), or death (OR 70.72, CI 22-227.64). Intensive care management (OR 18.62, CI 14.04-24.68), requirement of ventilation (OR 32.21, CI 21.27-48.78), or its duration (OR 67.22, CI 33.8-133.71) all increased the risk for developing delirium. Relevant predisposing risk factors were dementia (OR 50.92, CI 15.12-171.45), cardiac insufficiency (OR 11.76, CI 3.6-38.36), and polypharmacy (OR 5.9, CI 4.01-8.68).Relevant precipitating risk factors were brain edema (OR 40.53, CI 4.81-341.31), pneumonia (OR 39.66, CI 8.89-176.93) and cerebral inflammation (OR 21.74, CI 2.34-202.07). CONCLUSION: Delirium in trauma patients is associated with poor outcome as well as with intensive care management and various predisposing and/or precipitating factors. Three quarters of patients who had undergone delirium were not able to live independently at home any more.
