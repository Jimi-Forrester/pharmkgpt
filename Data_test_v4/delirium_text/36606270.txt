36606270|t|A pilot randomized controlled trial of WeiNaoKang (SaiLuoTong) in treating vascular dementia.
36606270|a|Objective: WeiNaoKang (or SaiLuoTong) is an herbal formula consisting of ginkgo, ginseng, and saffron. Our objective was to investigate if WeiNaoKang could improve cognitive function and cerebral perfusion in patients suffering from vascular dementia. Methods: A 16-week randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was carried out in the setting of a memory disorder clinic at a single center. Patients with vascular dementia diagnosed clinically but supported by imaging and other investigations were invited to participate. The diagnoses were based on the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) criteria. An independent blinded assessor evaluated the effects of the formula. Intervention group was compared to the control group. A subgroup of participants was randomly chosen for further evaluation of cerebral perfusion by single photon emission computed tomography scans post-treatment. Results: Both groups were comparable in age (mean = 74 +- 7.2 years in the placebo group and 75 +- 7.4 in the intervention group) and in other demographics. Sixty-two participants were included in final analysis. Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Portion (ADAS-cog) was the primary outcome. By week 16, the mean ADAS-cog reduced from 24.48 to 20.30 (mean reduction = 4.18) for those in the treatment group, and from 18.98 to 17.81 (mean reduction = 1.18) for those in the placebo group. The difference in mean reduction of ADAS-cog was -3.00 (95% confidence interval [CI] = -4.910 to -1.100) in favor of the treatment group. Secondary outcomes of activities of daily living and quality of life measures also showed significant difference. In the perfusion scan analysis, the difference in the change in cerebral blood flow (t-scores) pre- and post-treatment between the intervention group (n = 7) and the placebo group (n = 11) was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Conclusion: In this randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, we demonstrated significant differences in improvement in cognitive function and activities of daily living. The clinical improvement is corroborated with improvement in cerebral perfusion in a subset of participants.
