38542875|t|Biphasic Fermentation of Trapa bispinosa Shells by Ganoderma sinense and Characterization of Its Polysaccharides and Alcoholic Extract and Analysis of Their Bioactivity.
38542875|a|BACKGROUND: Trapa bispinosa shells (TBs) and its flesh (TBf) have been recognized for their medicinal properties, including antioxidant, antitumor, and immunomodulatory effects. Despite these benefits, TBs are often discarded as waste material, and their applications remain to be further explored. METHODS: In this study, we optimized the solid-state fermentation process of Ganoderma sinense (GS) with TBs using a response surface experiment methodology to obtain the fermented production with the highest water extract rate and DPPH free radical scavenging activity. We prepared and characterized pre-fermentation purified polysaccharides (P1) and post-fermentation purified polysaccharides (P2). Alcoholic extracts before (AE1) and after (AE2) fermentation were analyzed for active components such as polyphenols and flavonoids using UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS (ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry). Mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7) were employed to compare the immune-stimulating ability of polysaccharides and the antioxidant activity of AE1 and AE2. RESULTS: Optimal fermentation conditions comprised a duration of 2 days, a temperature of 14  C, and a humidity of 77%. The peak water extract yield and DPPH free radical scavenging rate of the water extract from TBs fermented by GS were observed under these conditions. The enhanced activity may be attributed to changes in the polysaccharide structure and the components of the alcoholic extract. The P2 treatment group indicated more secretion of RAW 264.7 cells of NO, iNOS, IL-2, IL-10, and TNF-alpha than P1, which shows that the polysaccharides demonstrated increased immune-stimulating ability, with their effect linked to the NF-kB pathway. Moreover, the results of the AE2 treatment group indicated that secretion of RAW 264.7 cells of T-AOC and T-SOD increased and MDA decreased, which shows that the alcoholic extract demonstrated enhanced antioxidant activity, with its effect linked to the Nrf2/Keap1-ARE pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Biphasic fermentation of Trapa bispinosa shells by Ganoderma sinense could change the composition and structure of the polysaccharides and the composition of the alcoholic extract, which could increase the products' immunomodulatory and antioxidant activity.
