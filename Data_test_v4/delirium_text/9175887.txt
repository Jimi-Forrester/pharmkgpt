9175887|a|To better understand the characteristics of amyloid deposition in the choroid plexus, we examined autopsied brain by routine histology, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy in three group of patients: primary systemic amyloidosis (n = 7), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA, n = 6), and controls (n = 3). Three of the CAA patients had Alzheimer's disease. Congophilic, birefringent amyloid deposits of the choroid plexus were seen in six of the seven cases of systemic light chain amyloidosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the deposited amyloids had reactivity for immunoglobulin light chain and amyloid P component. Accumulation of macrophages labeled with monoclonal antibodies against CD 68 and major histocompatibility complex class II antigens were observed around the massive amyloid deposits. The presence of approximately 10 nm amyloid fibrils along the epithelial basement membrane as well as in the vascular walls was ascertained by electron microscopy. In CAA, Congo red-positive amyloid deposits were consistently present in meningeal blood vessels and were often found in senile plaques of the cerebral parenchyma; congophilic amyloid deposits were absent in the choroid plexus. Choroid plexus epithelial cells exhibited immunostaining for beta amyloid precursor protein (APP) with N-terminal- and C-terminal-specific antibodies; in particular, consistent staining was obtained for the latter antibody. Immunoreactivity for amyloid beta protein (A beta) with monoclonal antibodies (6E10, 4G8) was often found in choroid plexus epithelial cells. These findings suggest that amyloid deposition of the choroid plexus depends on the major component protein in amyloidosis, and that the choroid plexus may produce APP and A beta protein although A beta amyloidosis is not evident in the choroid plexus.
