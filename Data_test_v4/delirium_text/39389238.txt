39389238|t|Serotonin in Depression and Alzheimer's Disease: Focus on SSRI's Beneficial Effects.
39389238|a|Depression is a complex and pervasive mental health disorder affecting millions globally. Serotonin, a critical neurotransmitter, plays a central role in the pathophysiology of depression. This review explores serotonin's multifaceted role in depression, focusing on its synthesis, bioavailability, receptor interactions, and the impact of various factors, including diet, stress, and gender differences. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of serotonin's role in depression by examining its synthesis and structure, its bioavailability and dietary influences, and its interactions with stress and immune responses. Additionally, it investigates the influence of age, socioeconomic status, and gender on depression, and integrates findings from animal research to elucidate serotonin's impact on mood disorders and cognitive decline. A literature review was conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase databases. Key focus areas included serotonin synthesis and receptor interactions, dietary effects on serotonin bioavailability, and the relationship between serotonin, immune responses, and stress. Gender differences, age-related factors, and socioeconomic influences on depression were also examined. Studies were thematically categorized and analyzed to provide a cohesive overview. Our review highlights that serotonin synthesis involves a complex enzymatic process, with recent structural studies revealing intricate receptor interactions. Dietary factors significantly impact serotonin levels, with interventions potentially modulating mood disorders. Stress and immune responses are linked to serotonin dynamics, with chronic stress exacerbating mood disorders and influencing cognitive decline. Animal studies underscore serotonin's role in mood regulation and cognitive function, while human research reveals how age, gender, and socioeconomic factors affect depression. The findings emphasize the need for a multidimensional approach to understanding and treating depression. Various factors, including diet, stress, and immune responses, influence serotonin's role in mood disorders. The review suggests potential therapeutic pathways involving dietary interventions and stress management. Furthermore, gender-specific considerations and the impact of age and socioeconomic status on depression outcomes highlight the need for tailored treatment strategies.
