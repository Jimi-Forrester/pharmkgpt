38928298|t|Signaling Role of Pericytes in Vascular Health and Tissue Homeostasis.
38928298|a|Pericytes are multipotent cells embedded within the vascular system, primarily surrounding capillaries and microvessels where they closely interact with endothelial cells. These cells are known for their intriguing properties due to their heterogeneity in tissue distribution, origin, and multifunctional capabilities. Specifically, pericytes are essential in regulating blood flow, promoting angiogenesis, and supporting tissue homeostasis and regeneration. These multifaceted roles draw on pericytes' remarkable ability to respond to biochemical cues, interact with neighboring cells, and adapt to changing environmental conditions. This review aims to summarize existing knowledge on pericytes, emphasizing their versatility and involvement in vascular integrity and tissue health. In particular, a comprehensive view of the major signaling pathways, such as PDGFbeta/ PDGFRbeta, TGF-beta, FOXO and VEGF, along with their downstream targets, which coordinate the behavior of pericytes in preserving vascular integrity and promoting tissue regeneration, will be discussed. In this light, a deeper understanding of the complex signaling networks defining the phenotype of pericytes in healthy tissues is crucial for the development of targeted therapies in vascular and degenerative diseases.
