15706224|t|Inactivation of GSK-3beta in okadaic acid-induced neurodegeneration: relevance to Alzheimer's disease.
15706224|a|Hyperphosphorylation of tau is a characteristic feature of the neurodegenerative pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Okadaic acid is used as a research model of AD to increase the tau phosphorylation and neuronal death. Using Western blotting, we found that the amounts of activated PKB[pS-473] and inactivated GSK-3beta[pS-9] were increased in proportion to the progress of okadaic acid induced tau phosphorylation. Immunocytochemistry showed that PKB[pS-473] and GSK-3beta[pS-9] immunoreactivity increased in dystrophic neurites and cell bodies in degenerating neurons after okadaic acid treatment. Double staining with phosphospecific tau antibodies showed that PKB[pS-473] and GSK-3beta[pS-9] were colocalized with phosphospecific tau in response to okadaic acid. Taken together, our data suggest that inhibition of protein phosphatase results in the hyperphosphorylation of tau without GSK-3beta overactivation.
