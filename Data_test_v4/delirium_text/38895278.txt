38895278|a|Gene-editing technologies promise to create a new class of therapeutics that can achieve permanent correction with a single intervention. Besides eliminating mutant alleles in familial disease, gene-editing can also be used to favorably manipulate upstream pathophysiologic events and alter disease-course in wider patient populations, but few such feasible therapeutic avenues have been reported. Here we use CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the last exon of amyloid precursor protein (App), relevant for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our strategy effectively eliminates an endocytic (YENPTY) motif at APP C-terminus, while preserving the N-terminus and compensatory APP-homologues. This manipulation favorably alters events along the amyloid-pathway - inhibiting toxic APP-beta-cleavage fragments (including Abeta) and upregulating neuroprotective APP-alpha-cleavage products. AAV-driven editing ameliorates neuropathologic, electrophysiologic, and behavioral deficits in an AD knockin mouse model. Effects persist for many months, and no abnormalities are seen in WT mice even after germline App-editing; underlining overall efficacy and safety. Pathologic alterations in the glial-transcriptome of App-KI mice, as seen by single nuclei RNA-sequencing (sNuc-Seq), are also normalized by App C-terminus editing. Our strategy takes advantage of innate transcriptional rules that render terminal exons insensitive to nonsense-decay, and the upstream manipulation is expected to be effective for all forms of AD. These studies offer a path for a one-time disease-modifying treatment for AD.
