32490247|a|BACKGROUND: Human clinical studies reported that several electroencephalographical (EEG) parameters can be used as biomarkers of psychiatric disorders. EEGs recorded from non-human primates (monkeys) is useful for understanding of human pathologies of psychiatric disorders and development of new therapeutic agents. NEW METHODS: In this study, we expand a previous non-invasive head holding system with face masks for awake monkeys to be applied to scalp EEG recording. The new design of a head holding system allows to attach scalp EEG electrodes on the positions comparable to human electrode placement and to present auditory stimuli. RESULTS: With this system, we could record auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) in auditory sensory gating and oddball paradigms, which are often used as biomarkers of psychiatric disorders in animal models and human patients. The recorded AEPs were comparable to previous human clinical data. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Compared with previous non-invasive head holding systems, top, side (cheek and ears), and rear of the head can be open for attachment of EEG electrodes and auditory stimulation in the present system. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the present system is useful in EEG recording from awake monkeys. Furthermore, this system can be applied to eye-tracking and chronic intra-cerebral recording experiments.
