32789064|t|Pulmonary Embolism Presenting as Abdominal Pain and Asystole.
32789064|a|Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening condition that mandates prompt identification and management. The protean and atypical symptomatology of PE can mislead the physician and pose a diagnostic dilemma. Abdominal pain is one such rare symptom that is not commonly encountered in the clinical setting. With the limited availability of literature describing abdominal pain as a symptom of this acute disease, it is pivotal that healthcare workers are aware of this presentation. Herewith, we report a 36-year-old man with no co-morbidities who presented with abdominal pain and subsequent cardiac arrest. He was diagnosed and managed in the emergency department and made a complete recovery.
