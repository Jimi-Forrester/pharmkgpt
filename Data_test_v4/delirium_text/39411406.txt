39411406|t|Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder and its comparison with high-frequency stimulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
39411406|a|Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) showed potentially beneficial effects for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Low-frequency (LF) rTMS decreases neuronal excitability and may have better safety compared to high-frequency (HF) rTMS. However, there lacks meta-analysis specifically focusing on LF rTMS. Objectives: To specifically explore the efficacy and safety of LF rTMS for treating PTSD. Methods: Databases including PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Web of Science were systematically searched from inception to October 17, 2023. Both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and open trials of LF rTMS on PTSD were included, and we additionally included RCTs comparing HF rTMS and sham treatment on PTSD. First, we qualitatively summarized parameters of LF rTMS treatment; then, we extracted data from the LF rTMS treatment subgroups of these studies to examine its effect size and potential influencing factors; third, we compared the effect sizes among LF rTMS, HF rTMS and sham treatment through network meta-analysis of RCTs. Results: In all, 15 studies with a sample size of 542 participants were included. The overall effect size for LF rTMS as a treatment for PTSD was found as Hedges' g = 1.02 (95% CI (0.56, 1.47)). Meta-regression analysis did not reveal any influencing factors. Network meta-analysis showed that compared to sham treatment, only HF rTMS on the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) demonstrated a significant advantage in ameliorating PTSD symptoms, while LF rTMS on the right DLPFC showed a trend toward advantage, but the difference was not significant. Conclusion: The current literature shows LF rTMS has effect in treating PTSD caused by various traumatic events. However, present limited number of RCT studies only showed LF rTMS to have a trend of advantage compared to sham treatment in treating PTSD caused by external traumatic events. In the future, more RCTs are needed to be made to confirm the efficacy of LF rTMS. Additionally, studies are required to elucidate the underlying mechanism in order to further improve its efficacy in different traumatic populations. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42023470169.
