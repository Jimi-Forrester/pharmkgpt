38306585|t|Mixed-Methods Study of End-of-Life Experiences of Patients With Hematologic Malignancies in Social Hospice Residential Home Care Settings.
38306585|a|PURPOSE: Hospice is underutilized by patients with hematologic malignancies (HM), and when patients are referred, they are typically more ill, hospitalized, and with shorter length of stay (LOS) than patients with solid tumors (ST), limiting research about home hospice care experiences of patients with HM. In this mixed-methods study, we examined the hospice experiences of patients with HM who died at residential care homes (RCHs), home-based settings in which volunteer caregivers and hospice staff provide end-of-life (EOL) care under the social hospice model. METHODS: We queried a registry of 535 hospice patients who died at RCHs between 2005 and 2020 that included quantitative medication administration data as well as qualitative data from hospice intake forms and written volunteer caregiver narratives. Qualitative data were analyzed by collective case study methodology. Quantitative comparisons of LOS and liquid morphine use were performed with matched patients with ST. RESULTS: The registry yielded 29 patients with HM, of whom qualitative data were available for 18 patients. Patients with HM exhibited common EOL symptoms (pain, dyspnea, and agitation). Instances of bleeding were low (22%), and notable HM-specific care concerns were described regarding bone fractures, skin integrity, and delirium. Most (78%) experienced good symptom management and peaceful or comfortable deaths. In only one case were symptoms described as severe and poorly managed. Patients with HM had comparable LOS on hospice and at the RCHs to patients with ST, with no group differences in liquid morphine use. CONCLUSION: In this registry cohort, most patients with HM achieved good symptom management in home care settings with volunteer caregivers and hospice support. Caregivers may require additional counseling and palliative medications for HM-specific EOL symptoms.
