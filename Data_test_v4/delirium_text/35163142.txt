35163142|t|Adenosine Receptors in Neuropsychiatric Disorders: Fine Regulators of Neurotransmission and Potential Therapeutic Targets.
35163142|a|Adenosine exerts an important role in the modulation of central nervous system (CNS) activity. Through the interaction with four G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) subtypes, adenosine subtly regulates neurotransmission, interfering with the dopaminergic, glutamatergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic, and endocannabinoid systems. The inhibitory and facilitating actions of adenosine on neurotransmission are mainly mediated by A1 and A2A adenosine receptors (ARs), respectively. Given their role in the CNS, ARs are promising therapeutic targets for neuropsychiatric disorders where altered neurotransmission represents the most likely etiological hypothesis. Activating or blocking ARs with specific pharmacological agents could therefore restore the balance of altered neurotransmitter systems, providing the rationale for the potential treatment of these highly debilitating conditions. In this review, we summarize and discuss the most relevant studies concerning AR modulation in psychotic and mood disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, depression, and anxiety, as well as neurodevelopment disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), fragile X syndrome (FXS), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and neuropsychiatric aspects of neurodegenerative disorders.
