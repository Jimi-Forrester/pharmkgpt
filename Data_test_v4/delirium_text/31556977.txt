31556977|t|A Multidisciplinary Approach for Addressing Challenges in Alzheimer's Disease.
31556977|a|In this webcast, experts from the Banner health care system discuss the evaluation of cognitive concerns and cognitive impairment, and the diagnosis and management of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Topics of the brief video clips include methods for developing therapeutic rapport with patients and their families, identifying and assessing the patient's and/or the care partner's concern, detecting cognitive impairment, characterizing the patient's cognitive-behavioral syndrome, and investigating and determining the etiology of the cognitive impairment or dementia syndrome. The experts also address strategies for delivering a diagnosis to patients and their care partners, planning treatment regimens, and offering education and support. Task-sharing and collaboration must occur between specialists and primary care clinicians to address the growing number of individuals with AD and related dementias.
