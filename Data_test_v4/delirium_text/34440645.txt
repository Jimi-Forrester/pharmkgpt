34440645|t|Mitophagy Regulates Neurodegenerative Diseases.
34440645|a|Mitochondria play an essential role in supplying energy for the health and survival of neurons. Mitophagy is a metabolic process that removes dysfunctional or redundant mitochondria. This process preserves mitochondrial health. However, defective mitophagy triggers the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, causing major neurodegenerative disorders. This review introduces molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways behind mitophagy regulation. Furthermore, we focus on the recent advances in understanding the potential role of mitophagy in the pathogenesis of major neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, etc.) and aging. The findings will help identify the potential interventions of mitophagy regulation and treatment strategies of neurodegenerative diseases.
