38290815|a|Background Delirium is a debilitating disorder with high prevalence near the end of life, impacting quality of life of patients and their relatives. Timely recognition of delirium can lead to prevention and/or better treatment of delirium. According to current hypotheses delirium is thought to result from aberrant inflammation and neurotransmission, with a possible role for neuronal damage. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a protein biomarker in body fluids that is unique to neurons, with elevated levels when neurons are damaged, making NfL a viable biomarker for early detection of delirium. This narrative review summarises current research regarding the pathophysiology of delirium and the potential of NfL as a susceptibility biomarker for delirium and places this in the context of care for patients with advanced cancer.Results Six studies were conducted exclusively on NfL in patients with delirium. Three of these studies demonstrated that high plasma NfL levels preoperatively predict delirium in older adult patients postoperatively. Two studies demonstrated that high levels of NfL in intensive care unit (ICU) patients are correlated with delirium duration and severity. One study found that incident delirium in older adult patients was associated with increased median NfL levels during hospitalisation.Conclusions Targeted studies are required to understand if NfL is a susceptibility biomarker for delirium in patients with advanced cancer. In this palliative care context, better accessible matrices, such as saliva or urine, would be helpful for repetitive testing. Improvement of biological measures for delirium can lead to improved early recognition and lay the groundwork for novel therapeutic strategies.
