37699318|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological condition that progresses with age. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation has been suggested to be a key pathogenic process in Alzheimer's disease. Ginseng polysaccharides (GP), the main biologically active components isolated from Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer (ginseng), may act as neuroprotective agents with potential benefits for AD patients. However, GP effects on Abeta pathology and AD symptoms are still unclear. Here, a 4.7-kDa GP termed GP4 was purified and subjected to basic physicochemical characterization. The biological effects of GP4 to prevent Abeta aggregation were then assessed with cross-species AD models, including Aftin-5-treated SH-SY5Y cells and cerebral organoids, and transgenic C. elegans overexpressing the full-length human Abeta42 peptide. These analyses ultimately demonstrated that GP4 was capable of inhibiting Abeta accumulation both in vivo and vitro, and with early intervention of GP4 being sufficient to alleviate Abeta42-associated aging phenotypes and memory loss in C. elegans model of AD. Furthermore, neuroinflammation was significantly down-regulated in human cells and cerebral organoids. From a mechanistic perspective, the ability of GP4 to inhibit Abeta aggregation was found to be related to its ability to promote neuronal mitophagic activity. This finding offers a robust theoretical foundation for the further development of GP4 as a candidate drugs with the potential to treat AD.
