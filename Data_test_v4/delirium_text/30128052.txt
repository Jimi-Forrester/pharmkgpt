30128052|a|Rationale: It has been reported that peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) level decreases significantly in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and mice models, while the mechanism is unclear. This study aims to unravel the mechanism that amyloid beta (Abeta) decreases PPARgamma and attempted to discover lead compound that preserves PPARgamma. Methods: In APP/PS1 transgenic mice and Abeta treated microglia, the interaction between HSP90 and PPARgamma were analyzed by western blot. Using a PPRE (PPARgamma responsive element) containing reporter cell line, compounds that activate PPARgamma activity were identified. After genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of potential target pathways, the target of jujuboside A (JuA) was discovered through Axl/HSP90beta. After oral administration or intrathecal injection, the anti-AD activity of JuA was evaluated by Morris water maze (MWM) test and object recognition test. Soluble Abeta42 levels and plaque numbers after JuA treatment were detected by thioflavin S staining, and the activation of microglia was assayed by immunofluorescence staining against Iba-1. Results: We found that Abeta stress decreased heat shock protein 90 beta (HSP90beta), subsequently reduced the abundance of PPARgamma, and down-regulated Abeta clearance-related genes in BV2 cells and primary microglia. We identified that JuA stimulated the expression of HSP90beta, strengthened the interaction between HSP90beta and PPARgamma, preserved PPARgamma levels, and thus effectively promoted the clearance of Abeta42. We demonstrated that JuA increased HSP90beta expression through Axl/ERK pathway. JuA significantly ameliorated cognitive deficiency in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, meanwhile, JuA significantly reduced the soluble Abeta42 levels and plaque numbers in the brain. Notably, the therapeutic effects of JuA were dampened by R428, an Axl inhibitor. Conclusions: This study suggests that the up-regulation of HSP90beta by JuA through Axl is a potential therapeutic strategy to facilitate Abeta42 clearance and ameliorate cognitive deficiency in AD.
