36979009|t|Antioxidant Characterization of Six Tomato Cultivars and Derived Products Destined for Human Consumption.
36979009|a|The consumption of fresh tomatoes and processed tomato products is widespread in the Mediterranean diet. This fruit is a valuable source of antioxidants and plays an important role in preventing oxidative stress. This study aimed to investigate the content of antioxidants and measure the total antioxidant capacity (ABTS and DPPH assays) in the peel, pulp, and seed fractions of six tomato cultivars. Finally, some bioactive compounds and total antioxidant activity were also determined in homemade tomato purees, since such homemade production is commonplace in Southern Italy. The level of antioxidants and total antioxidant capacity in each fraction were also calculated based on their actual fresh weight in the whole tomato. The overall results indicated that the peel and seeds of all analysed tomato cultivars contribute significantly to the antioxidant charge of the fruits. Consequently, consuming tomatoes without peel and seeds results in a substantial loss of compounds beneficial for human health. Our results also showed that phenolic and lycopene content, as well as antioxidant activities in all purees are higher than in fresh tomatoes. Based on this evidence, producing homemade tomato puree is a good practice, and its consumption helps prevent oxidative stress damage.
