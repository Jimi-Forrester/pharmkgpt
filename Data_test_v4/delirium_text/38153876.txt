38153876|t|Perioperative Patients With Hemodynamic Instability: Consensus Recommendations of the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation.
38153876|a|In November of 2022, the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation held a Consensus Conference on Hemodynamic Instability with invited experts. The objective was to review the science and use expert consensus to produce best practice recommendations to address the issue of perioperative hemodynamic instability. After expert presentations, a modified Delphi process using discussions, voting, and feedback resulted in 17 recommendations regarding advancing the perioperative care of the patient at risk of, or with, hemodynamic instability. There were 17 high-level recommendations. These recommendations related to the following 7 domains: Current Knowledge (5 statements); Preventing Hemodynamic Instability-Related Harm During All Phases of Care (4 statements); Data-Driven Quality Improvement (3 statements); Informing Patients (2 statements); The Importance of Technology (1 statement); Launch a National Campaign (1 statement); and Advancing the Science (1 statement). A summary of the recommendations is presented in Table 1 .
