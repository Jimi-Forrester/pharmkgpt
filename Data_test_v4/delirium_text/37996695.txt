37996695|t|Podcast: Influenza-Associated Complications and the Impact of Vaccination on Public Health.
37996695|a|Influenza is primarily considered an acute respiratory infection but can lead to a myriad of medium and long-term sequelae across every major organ system in the body. Increasing awareness, gaining broader understanding of its mechanistic pathways, identifying at-risk individuals, and determining how to better protect them could help minimize its impact. The aim of this podcast, featuring Dr Stefania Maggi, Dr Annemarijn de Boer, and Dr Melissa K. Andrew, is to outline the main influenza complications and their impact beyond acute respiratory disease, as well as highlighting vaccination as a tool at our disposal. Both physical and cognitive function can be affected as a result of influenza infection, notably in frailer individuals, which in turn may lead to a loss of independence. Observational studies have identified beneficial effects of vaccination for cardioprotection as well as preventing dementia, but more evidence is required. In conclusion, influenza can cause a wide array of complications, which vaccination may help prevent.Podcast available for this article.
