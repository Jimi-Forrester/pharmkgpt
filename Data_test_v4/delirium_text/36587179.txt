36587179|t|Dose-dependent biological toxicity of green synthesized silver nanoparticles in rat's brain.
36587179|a|Metal nanoparticles, in general, and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), in particular, have been the focus of numerous studies over the last two decades. Recently, the green synthesis of metal nanoparticles has been favored over chemical synthesis due to its low toxicity and easy preparation. The present study aims to investigate the dose-dependent toxicity of green synthesized AgNPs on rats' brains. Thirty-four Wistar male rats were divided into four groups. The first, second, and third groups were administered for 14 days with three different doses (0.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) of AgNPs, respectively. The fourth group, which served as a control group, was given normal saline for the same period. The toxicity of the green synthesized AgNPs on the cortical and hippocampal levels of the oxidative stress markers (MDA, NO, and GSH) as well as the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and the monoamine neurotransmitters (DA, NE, and 5H-T) were investigated. AgNPs showed minimal oxidative stress in the cortex and hippocampus for the administered doses. However, AgNPs showed an inhibitory effect on AchE activity in a dose-dependent manner and a decrease in the 5H-T and NE levels. The green synthesized AgNPs showed an ultrastructural change in the cellular membranes of the neurons. The green synthesis of AgNPs has reduced their cytotoxic oxidative effects due to their capping with biologically compatible and boosting molecules such as flavonoids. However, another neurotoxicity was observed in a dose-dependent manner.
