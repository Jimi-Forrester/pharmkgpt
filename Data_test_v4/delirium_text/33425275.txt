33425275|t|Neurologic manifestations in patients with COVID-19: A case report.
33425275|a|BACKGROUND: There are very few reports about the neurological complications of COVID-19. We describe two COVID-19 patients with neurologic presentations. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein we present neurological manifestations in 2 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The patients showed most common symptoms of COVID-19 along with common conflicts in CT scans of lung such as ground-glass opacities (GGOs). First case revealed two episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures; brain CT scan in second patients revealed an extensive hypodense lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere. All cases received supportive care, antibiotics, and antiviral medications. All cases were discharged with a good general condition. CONCLUSION: The current case series report the association between neurological involvements and COVID-19. Clinicians should be aware of neurologic symptoms in the setting of COVID-19, which might even be the first presentations of this infection.
