31398826|t|Modeling Neurological Disorders with Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Astrocytes.
31398826|a|Astrocytes play vital roles in neurological disorders. The use of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes provides a chance to explore the contributions of astrocytes in human diseases. Here we review human iPSC-based models for neurological disorders associated with human astrocytes and discuss the points of each model.
