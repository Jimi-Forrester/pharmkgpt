26817272|a|Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a well-known natural polyphenol compound. It is reported that resveratrol possesses strong anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, cardiovascular protective and cancer chemo-preventive effects. Therefore, there has been a considerable interest in its biological activity, pharmacological activity and also synthetic resveratrol analogues in recent years. Up to now, many new resveratrol derivatives have been synthesized and some new biological activities of these compounds have been found, so in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and the inhibition of influenza H1N1 neuraminidase. Structure-activity studies revealed that crucial elements of parental components are required for specific effects. This review summarizes the available literatures on the structure-activity relationships and pharmacological properties of resveratrol analogues.
