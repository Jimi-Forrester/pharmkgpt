32850001|a|This study assessed the molecular mechanism of selenium (Se) protecting against kidney injury induced by zearalenone (ZEA) in mice. The experimental mice were divided into 4 groups including the control group, the Se group, the ZEA group, and the Se+ZEA group; ZEA and Se were administered orally for 28 days. The changes in renal biochemical index (BUN, UA, and CRE), biochemical change of kidney damage such as BUN, UA, and CRE, and oxidative damage such as MDA, T-SOD, and GSH-Px were investigated. Pathological sections and TUNEL staining were used to analyze renal pathological changes and cell apoptosis. qRT-PCR and Western blot were employed to detect the expression of genes and proteins which were related with endoplasmic reticulum stress. The results showed that ZEA increased the concentration of BUN, UA, and CRE and the content of MDA and decreased the activities of T-SOD and GSH-Px in the mouse kidneys. However, Se reversed above changes of the biochemical and antioxidant indexes of renal injury. Moreover, the results also showed that ZEA can increase the expression of Bax, caspase-12, caspase-3, Bip, CHOP, JNK protein, and mRNA and decrease the expression of Bcl-2 protein and mRNA. But Se reversed these proteins and genes related to endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis. It can be concluded that Se protected against the kidney damage induced by ZEA. Se may protect the kidney from ZEA-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress by inhibiting ERS.
