38321930|a|Recent genomics and epigenetic advances have empowered the exploration of DNA/RNA methylation and histone modifications crucial for gene expression in response to stress, aging and disease. Interest in understanding neuronal plasticity's epigenetic mechanisms, influencing brain rewiring amid development, aging and neurodegenerative disorders, continues to grow. Histone acetylation dysregulation, a commonality in diverse brain disorders, has become a therapeutic focus. Histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases have emerged as promising targets for neurodegenerative disorder treatment. This review delves into histone acetylation regulation, potential therapies and future perspectives for disorders like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's. Exploring genetic-environmental interplay through models and studies reveals molecular changes, behavioral insights and early intervention possibilities targeting the epigenome in at-risk individuals.
