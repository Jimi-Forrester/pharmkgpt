2872846|t|Blood-brain barrier: interface between internal medicine and the brain.
2872846|a|The blood-brain barrier separates brain interstitial space from blood and is formed by brain capillary endothelial cells that are fused together by epithelial-like tight junctions. Study of the blood-brain barrier traditionally has been a relatively arcane field, even for neurobiologists. However, advances over the last 10 years in understanding the transport physiology and cell biology of the brain capillary endothelial cell now provide insights into the pathogenesis of such problems as brain glucopenia, hepatic encephalopathy, therapeutic efficacy of alpha-methyldopa, brain edema in diabetic ketoacidosis, Alzheimer's disease, brain tumors, and lupus cerebritis.
