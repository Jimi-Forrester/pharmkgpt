28470044|t|Chemical Synthesis of (+)-Ryanodine and (+)-20-Deoxyspiganthine.
28470044|a|(+)-Ryanodine is a natural product modulator of ryanodine receptors, important intracellular calcium ion channels that play a critical role in signal transduction leading to muscle movement and synaptic transmission. Chemical derivatization of (+)-ryanodine has demonstrated that certain peripheral structural modifications can alter its pharmacology, and that the pyrrole-2-carboxylate ester is critical for high affinity binding to ryanodine receptors. However, the structural variation of available ryanodine analogues has been limited by the challenge of site-specific functionalization of semisynthetic intermediates, such as (+)-ryanodol. Here we report a synthetic strategy that provides access to (+)-ryanodine and the related natural product (+)-20-deoxyspiganthine in 18 and 19 steps, respectively. A key feature of this strategy is the reductive cyclization of an epoxide intermediate that possesses the critical pyrrole-2-carboxylate ester. This approach allows for the direct introduction of this ester in the final stage of the synthesis and provides a framework for the synthesis of previously inaccessible synthetic ryanoids.
