33815881|t|Iron Accumulation and Lipid Peroxidation in the Aging Retina: Implication of Ferroptosis in Age-Related Macular Degeneration.
33815881|a|Iron is an essential component in many biological processes in the human body. It is critical for the visual phototransduction cascade in the retina. However, excess iron can be toxic. Iron accumulation and reduced efficiency of intracellular antioxidative defense systems predispose the aging retina to oxidative stress-induced cell death. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is characterized by retinal iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation. The mechanisms underlying AMD include oxidative stress-mediated death of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and subsequent death of retinal photoreceptors. Understanding the mechanism of the disruption of iron and redox homeostasis in the aging retina and AMD is crucial to decipher these mechanisms of cell death and AMD pathogenesis. The mechanisms of retinal cell death in AMD are an area of active investigation; previous studies have proposed several types of cell death as major mechanisms. Ferroptosis, a newly discovered programmed cell death pathway, has been associated with the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. Ferroptosis is initiated by lipid peroxidation and is characterized by iron-dependent accumulation. In this review, we provide an overview of the mechanisms of iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation in the aging retina and AMD, with an emphasis on ferroptosis.
