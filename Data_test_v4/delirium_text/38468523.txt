38468523|a|Resveratrol is a biologically active natural phenolic plant product. It has several properties which make them useful to treat the disease. In this review, we have highlighted the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol. Several available animal models have been proven to help understand the disease pathway and mechanism of action by resveratrol. In this review, we have highlighted the neuroprotective activity of resveratrol in AD, which effectively counter the neurodegenerative disease by decreasing the formation of plaques. Resveratrol is a natural plant product that is easily available, cost-effective, and possesses neuroprotective activity, which is useful for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Resveratrol presents a promising avenue for AD treatment due to its diverse neuroprotective mechanisms. Given the ongoing global challenge in treating AD, researchers have increasingly focused on exploring the therapeutic potential of resveratrol.
