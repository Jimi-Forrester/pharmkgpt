30740895|t|Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of ASP3662, a Novel 11beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 Inhibitor, in Healthy Young and Elderly Subjects.
30740895|a|Inhibition of the enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) represents a potential mechanism for improving pain conditions. ASP3662 is a potent and selective inhibitor of 11beta-HSD1. Two phase I clinical studies were conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PKs), and pharmacodynamics (PDs) of single and multiple ascending doses of ASP3662 in healthy young and elderly non-Japanese and young Japanese subjects. Nonlinear, more than dose-proportional PKs were observed for ASP3662 after single-dose administration, particularly at lower doses (<= 6 mg); the PKs at steady state were dose proportional, although the time to ASP3662 steady state was dose dependent at lower doses (<= 2 mg). Similar PKs were observed among young Japanese, young non-Japanese, and elderly non-Japanese subjects. Specific inhibition of 11beta-HSD1 occurred after both single and multiple doses of ASP3662. A marked dissociation between PKs and PDs was observed after single but not multiple doses of ASP3662. ASP3662 was generally safe and well tolerated.
