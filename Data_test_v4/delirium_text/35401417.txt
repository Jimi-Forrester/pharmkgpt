35401417|t|Lobar Cerebral Microbleeds Are Associated With Cognitive Decline in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
35401417|a|Purpose: Combined the number, volume, and location of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), this study aimed to explore the different features of CMBs and their correlation with cognitive ability in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: This study recruited 95 patients with T2DM and 80 healthy control (HC) individuals. AccuBrain , an automated tool, was used to obtain the number and volume of CMBs. The scores on global cognition and five cognitive domains were derived from a battery of cognitive tests. The logistic regression and multivariate linear regression were conducted to determine the relationship between the CMBs (number, volume, and location) and cognitive ability in patients with T2DM. Results: After adjusting for several variables, the total volume of CMBs (OR = 0.332, 95%CI: 0.133-0.825, and p = 0.018) was independent risk factor for cognitive impairment, whereas the total number of CMBs was not (OR = 0933, 95%CI: 0.794-1.097, and p = 0.400). Furthermore, the volume of CMBs in lobar regions was independently associated with working memory (beta = -0.239, 95%CI: -0.565 to -0.035, and p = 0.027). However, no significant correlation between the number of CMBs (both lobar and deep/infratentorium) and any cognitive domains was observed. Conclusions: Lobar CMBs was related with cognitive impairment in patients with T2DM and might be a potential early warning signal. Compared with the counting analysis, the quantitative method offered a more sensitive and objective measurement for studying imaging features of CMBs.
