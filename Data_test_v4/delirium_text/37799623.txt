37799623|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-associated neurodegenerative disease, and the currently available diagnostic modalities and therapeutic agents are unsatisfactory due to its high clinical heterogeneity. Necroptosis is a common type of programmed cell death that has been shown to be activated in AD. Methods: In this study, we first investigated the expression profiles of necroptosis-related genes (NRGs) and the immune landscape of AD based on GSE33000 dataset. Next, the AD samples in the GSE33000 dataset were extracted and subjected to consensus clustering based upon the differentially expressed NRGs. Key genes associated with necroptosis clusters were identified using Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) algorithm, and then intersected with the key gene related to AD. Finally, we developed a diagnostic model for AD by comparing four different machine learning approaches. The discrimination performance and clinical relevance of the diagnostic model were assessed using various evaluation metrics, including the nomogram, calibration plot, decision curve analysis (DCA), and independent validation datasets. Results: Aberrant expression patterns of NRGs and specific immune landscape were identified in the AD samples. Consensus clustering revealed that patients in the GSE33000 dataset could be classified into two necroptosis clusters, each with distinct immune landscapes and enriched pathways. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) was found to be the most optimal diagnostic model for the AD based on the predictive ability and reliability of the models constructed by four machine learning approaches. The five most important variables, including ACAA2, BHLHB4, CACNA2D3, NRN1, and TAC1, were used to construct a five-gene diagnostic model. The constructed nomogram, calibration plot, DCA, and external independent validation datasets exhibited outstanding diagnostic performance for AD and were closely related with the pathologic hallmarks of AD. Conclusion: This work presents a novel diagnostic model that may serve as a framework to study disease heterogeneity and provide a plausible mechanism underlying neuronal loss in AD.
