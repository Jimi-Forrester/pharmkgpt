24130779|t|Amyloid beta(1-40)-induced astrogliosis and the effect of genistein treatment in rat: a three-dimensional confocal morphometric and proteomic study.
24130779|a|Astrocytes are highly involved in regulation and homeostasis of the extracellular environment in the healthy brain. In pathological conditions, these cells play a major role in the inflammatory response seen in CNS tissues, which is called reactive astrogliosis and includes hypertrophy and proliferation of astrocytes. Here, we performed 3D confocal microscopy to evaluate the morphological response of reactive astrocytes positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in rats, to the presence of Abeta(1-40) in the rat brain before and after treatment with genistein. In 50 astrocytes per animal, we measured the volume and surface area for the nucleus, cell body, the entire cell, the tissue covered by single astrocytes and quantified the number and length of branches, the density of the astrocytes and the intensity of GFAP immunoreactivity. Injecting Abeta(1-40) into the brain of rats caused astrogliosis indicated by increased values for all measured parameters. Mass spectrometric analysis of hippocampal tissue in Abeta(1-40)-injected brain showed decreased amounts of tubulins, enolases and myelin basic protein, and increased amounts of dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2. In Abeta(1-40)-injected rats pretreated with genistein, GFAP intensity was decreased to the sham-operated group level, and Abeta(1-40)-induced astrogliosis was significantly ameliorated.
