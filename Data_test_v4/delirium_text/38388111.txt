38388111|a|BACKGROUND: People with dementia have poorer outcomes after hip fracture and this may be due in part to variation in care. We aimed to compare care and outcomes for people with and without cognitive impairment after hip fracture. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using Australian and New Zealand Hip Fracture Registry data for people >=50 years of age who underwent hip fracture surgery (n = 49,063). Cognitive impairment or known dementia and cognitively healthy groups were defined using preadmission cognitive status. Descriptive statistics and multivariable mixed effects models were used to compare groups. RESULTS: In general, cognitively impaired people had worse care and outcomes compared to cognitively healthy older people. A lower proportion of the cognitively impaired group had timely pain assessment (<=30 min of presentation: 61% vs 68%; p < 0.0001), were given the opportunity to mobilise (89% vs 93%; p < 0.0001) and achieved day-1 mobility (34% vs 58%; p < 0.0001) than the cognitively healthy group. A higher proportion of the cognitively impaired group had delayed pain management (>30 mins of presentation: 26% vs 20%; p < 0.0001), were malnourished (27% vs 15%; p < 0.0001), had delirium (44% vs 13%; p < 0.0001) and developed a new pressure injury (4% vs 3%; p < 0.0001) than the cognitively healthy group. Fewer of the cognitively impaired group received rehabilitation (35% vs 64%; p < 0.0001), particularly patients from RACFs (16% vs 39%; p < 0.0001) and were prescribed bone protection medication on discharge (24% vs 27%; p < 0.0001). Significantly more of the cognitively impaired group had a new transfer to residential care (46% vs 11% from private residence; p < 0.0001) and died at 30-days (7% vs 3% from private residence; 15% vs 10% from RACF; both p < 0.0001). In multivariable models adjusting for covariates with facility as the random effect, the cognitively impaired group had a greater odds of being malnourished, not achieving day-1 walking, having delirium in the week after surgery, dying within 30 days, and in those from private residences, having a new transfer to a residential care facility than the cognitively healthy group. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified several aspects of care that could be improved for patients with cognitive impairment - management of pain, mobility, nutrition and bone health, as well as delirium assessment, prevention and management strategies and access to rehabilitation. Further research is needed to determine whether improvements in care will reduce hospital complications and improve outcomes for people with dementia after hip fracture.
