35854207|t|The predictive value of modified risk scores in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD: a retrospective cohort study.
35854207|a|This study aims to evaluate the performance of CREWS (Chronic Respiratory Early Warning Score), S-NEWS (Salford-National Early Warning Score), qNEWS (Quick National Early Warning Score), NEWS (National Early Warning Score), and qSOFA (Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) scores in predicting mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and the need for mechanical ventilation (MV) of patients presented with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). This retrospective cohort study was conducted in the emergency department of a tertiary hospital between January 1 and December 31, 2019. The patients with AECOPD and aged >= 18 were included. Patients who were transferred from another center and whose data could not be reached were excluded. Demographic information, comorbid diseases, variables of the scores, laboratory results, and outcomes were recorded. A total of 575 consecutive patients were included. The 30-day mortality, ICU admission, and MV need rate were 5.7% (n = 33), 9.6% (n = 55), and 13.7% (n = 79), respectively. Each score had moderate-to-excellent performance in predicting MV need and ICU admission, while their performance in predicting mortality was poor. CREWS is the most successful score in predicting 30-day mortality (AUC 0.695), ICU admission (AUC 0.841), and MV need (AUC 0.924). ICU admission, age, and creatinine levels were associated with mortality (p < 0.05). All scores have better performance in predicting ICU admission and MV need than mortality. ICU admission, age, and creatinine levels may be the predictors of mortality among AECOPD patients.
