35409998|a|Clinical internships that effectively incorporate the care of older adults with mental health disorders are sparse in many countries, including Taiwan. This study investigated the effectiveness of a problem-based geropsychiatric clinical internship program for nursing students in Taiwan. We conducted a quasi-experimental study among 126 nursing students. Experimental and control groups received problem-based geropsychiatric and general psychiatric practice sessions, respectively. Knowledge, attitude, skills, and self-reflection were evaluated before (T1) and after (T2) measurements. There were no significant differences between the groups in knowledge, attitude, skills, and self-reflection at T1. At T2, knowledge was significantly higher in the experimental group (t = 2.39, p = 0.02). Attitude, skills, and self-reflection ability did not differ between the groups at T2. Our results showed that clinical problem-based approaches can be applied in geropsychiatric mental health nursing internship programs. The problem-based approach was helpful in improving nursing students' knowledge about psychiatric symptoms and the health problems of older adults with mental illness. However, it did not significantly enhance or change the attitudes, skills, or the ability to self-reflect among students.
