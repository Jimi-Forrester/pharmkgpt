35535905|a|Administration of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) is believed to be an effective method for treating neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study, we investigated the possibility of hUC-MSCs treatment of neonatal hypoxic/ischemic brain injury associated with maternal immune activation and the underlying mechanism. We established neonatal rat models of hypoxic/ischemic brain injury by exposing pregnant rats to lipopolysaccharide on day 16 or 17 of pregnancy. Rat offspring were intranasally administered hUC-MSCs on postnatal day 14. We found that polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-1 (PTBP-1) participated in the regulation of lipopolysaccharide-induced maternal immune activation, which led to neonatal hypoxic/ischemic brain injury. Intranasal delivery of hUC-MSCs inhibited PTBP-1 expression, alleviated neonatal brain injury-related inflammation, and regulated the number and function of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes, thereby promoting plastic regeneration of neurons and improving brain function. These findings suggest that hUC-MSCs can effectively promote the repair of neonatal hypoxic/ischemic brain injury related to maternal immune activation through inhibition of PTBP-1 expression and astrocyte activation.
