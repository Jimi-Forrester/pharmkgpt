23691594|a|This paper describes a model of cell death, called autophagy, one among other typical and atypical processes of cell death. This phenomenon is present in the organism, from conception until death, and is conditioned by many genes of ATG family, or mTOR kinase and specific proteins, like BNIP3. This process plays a very important role not only in physiological functions of the organism but also in pathological, such as Alzheimer or Huntington disease, as well as diseases caused by viruses.
