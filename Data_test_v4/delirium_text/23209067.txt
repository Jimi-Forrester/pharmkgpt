23209067|a|Compared to young people, elderly people are more likely to develop cognitive impairments associated with medications. Dementia and delirium (acute confusional state) are known to be associated with drug toxicity. Anticholinergic medications are important causes of acute and chronic cognitive impairment. Psychoactive drugs, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants can cause delirium and dementia. In addition, non-psychoactive drugs such as histamine H2 receptor antagonists, cardiac medications, and antibiotics may cause acute and chronic cognitive impairments. Early diagnosis and withdrawal of the offending agent is essential for treating drug-induced dementia and delirium.
