37163992|t|Cytokines as emerging regulators of central nervous system synapses.
37163992|a|Cytokines are key messengers by which immune cells communicate, and they drive many physiological processes, including immune and inflammatory responses. Early discoveries demonstrated that cytokines, such as the interleukin family members and TNF-alpha, regulate synaptic scaling and plasticity. Still, we continue to learn more about how these traditional immune system cytokines affect neuronal structure and function. Different cytokines shape synaptic function on multiple levels ranging from fine-tuning neurotransmission, to regulating synapse number, to impacting global neuronal networks and complex behavior. These recent findings have cultivated an exciting and growing field centered on the importance of immune system cytokines for regulating synapse and neural network structure and function. Here, we highlight the latest findings related to cytokines in the central nervous system and their regulation of synapse structure and function. Moreover, we explore how these mechanisms are becoming increasingly important to consider in diseases-especially those with a large neuroinflammatory component.
