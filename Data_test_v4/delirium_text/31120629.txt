31120629|a|Cerebral cortical laminar necrosis (CLN) is a consequence of severe hypoxic, ischemic, or hypoglycemic events. In humans, these cortical lesions show characteristic linear T1-weighted (T1W) hyperintensity in the late subacute stage. Limited information reporting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in dogs affected by CLN is available. A 3-year-old Belgian Shepherd dog was referred 8 days after sudden onset of blindness after general anesthesia. Neurological examination showed central blindness and mild ataxia. Three-Tesla MRI examination of the brain revealed bilateral asymmetrical areas of T2-weighted hyperintensity within the occipital, parietal, temporal, and frontal cortex, involving gray and white matter. Furthermore, linear T1W-hyperintense lesions were found in the cerebral cortex of the same areas and showed heterogeneous contrast enhancement. Perfusion-weighted images revealed hyperperfusion in the affected regions. Lesions were compatible with subacute CLN with corresponding edema suspected to be secondary to anesthesia-related brain hypoxia. Three-Tesla MRI enabled identification of the laminar pattern of the cortical lesions.
