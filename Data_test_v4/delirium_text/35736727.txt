35736727|t|Genomic Survey of PEBP Gene Family in Rice: Identification, Phylogenetic Analysis, and Expression Profiles in Organs and under Abiotic Stresses.
35736727|a|Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding-protein (PEBP) domain-containing proteins play important roles in multiple developmental processes of plants; however, functions of few members in the PEBP gene family have been elucidated in rice and other crops. In this study, we found that twenty OsPEBPs genes identified in rice are not evenly distributed on the chromosomes. Four colinear pairs are identified, suggesting the duplication of OsPEBPs during evolution. The OsPEBPs are classified into six subgroups by phylogenetic analysis. The structure of all the OsPEBP genes and encoded proteins are similar. The 262 PEBP domain-containing proteins from crops are divided into six groups. The number of colinear pairs varies between rice and other crops. More than thirty cis-acting elements in the promoter region of OsPEBPs are discovered. Expression profiles of OsPEBP genes are differential. Most of the OsPEBPs expression can be regulated by NaCl, ABA, JA, and light, indicating that OsPEBPs may be involved in the control of the response to the environmental signals. These results lay sound foundation to further explore their functions in development of rice and crops.
