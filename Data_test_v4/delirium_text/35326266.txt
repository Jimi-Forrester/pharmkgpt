35326266|a|Therapeutic interventions are greatly needed for age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Astrocytes regulate many aspects of neuronal function including bioenergetics and synaptic transmission. Reactive astrocytes are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases due to their pro-inflammatory phenotype close association with damaged neurons. Thus, strategies to reduce astrocyte reactivity may support brain health. Caloric restriction and a ketogenic diet limit energy production via glycolysis and promote oxidative phosphorylation, which has gained traction as a strategy to improve brain health. However, it is unknown how caloric restriction affects astrocyte reactivity in the context of neuroinflammation. We investigated how a caloric restriction mimetic and glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), affects interleukin 1beta-induced inflammatory gene expression in human astrocytes. Human astrocyte cultures were exposed to 2-DG or vehicle for 24 h and then to recombinant IL-1beta for 6 or 24 h to analyze mRNA and protein expression, respectively. Gene expression levels of proinflammatory genes (complement component 3, IL-1beta, IL6, and TNFalpha) were analyzed by real-time PCR, immunoblot, and immunohistochemistry. As expected, IL-1beta induced elevated levels of proinflammatory genes. 2-DG reversed this effect at the mRNA and protein levels without inducing cytotoxicity. Collectively, these data suggest that inhibiting glycolysis in human astrocytes reduces IL-1beta-induced reactivity. This finding may lead to novel therapeutic strategies to limit inflammation and enhance bioenergetics toward the goal of preventing and treating neurodegenerative diseases.
