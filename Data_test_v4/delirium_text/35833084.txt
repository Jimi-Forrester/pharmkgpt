35833084|a|In epidemiological studies, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been associated with cognitive impairment and dementia, but studies about functional network connectivity in T2DM without cognitive impairment are limited. This study aimed to explore network connectivity alterations that may help enhance our understanding of damage-associated processes in T2DM. MRI data were analyzed from 82 patients with T2DM and 66 normal controls. Clinical, biochemical, and neuropsychological assessments were conducted in parallel with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and the cognitive status of the patients was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment-B (MoCA-B) score. Independent component analysis revealed a positive correlation between the salience network and the visual network and a negative connection between the left executive control network and the default mode network in patients with T2DM. The differences in dynamic brain network connectivity were observed in the precuneus, visual, and executive control networks. Internal network connectivity was primarily affected in the thalamus, inferior parietal lobe, and left precuneus. Hemoglobin A1c level, body mass index, MoCA-B score, and grooved pegboard (R) assessments indicated significant differences between the two groups (p < 0.05). Our findings show that key changes in functional connectivity in diabetes occur in the precuneus and executive control networks that evolve before patients develop cognitive deficits. In addition, the current study provides useful information about the role of the thalamus, inferior parietal lobe, and precuneus, which might be potential biomarkers for predicting the clinical progression, assessing the cognitive function, and further understanding the neuropathology of T2DM.
