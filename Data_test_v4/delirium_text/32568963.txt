32568963|t|Reducing Delirium in Hospitalized Adults Through a Structured Sleep Promotion Program.
32568963|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium affects approximately 1 in 4 patients during their hospitalization and is associated with numerous complications. Sleep deprivation is a significant risk factor for developing delirium and is a patient dissatisfier. PROBLEM: An internal assessment revealed that up to 25% of all patients on medical-surgical units had a diagnosis of delirium while in the hospital. APPROACH: An evidence-based practice project was implemented to reduce the development of delirium through sleep promotion on 2 inpatient units. A dedicated time was selected, and key strategies were identified to promote sleep with minimal interruptions. OUTCOMES: Delirium decreased by 33% and 45% on the 2 units over 1 year. Overall, patient satisfaction for quietness at night survey responses also increased (P = .0005; CI, 0.05 to 0.67) with ongoing sustainment. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a dedicated period to sleep was associated with a reduction in delirium and increased patient satisfaction for quietness at night.
