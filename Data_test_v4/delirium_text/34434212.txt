34434212|t|Emerging Trends and Research Foci in Cataract Genes: A Bibliometric and Visualized Study.
34434212|a|Background: Approximately 50% of cataracts are associated with genetic factors. Genetic etiology and molecular mechanisms based on gene research increase the understanding of cataracts and provide direction for diagnosis and intervention. In the present study, SCIE papers related to the modeling of cataract gene research from 2010-2019 were evaluated and qualitative and quantitative analyses with modeling performed. Methods: The SCIE database was searched on July 6, 2021 for cataract gene publications and relevant papers published since 2010 were considered for review. Subsequently, 1,904 SCIE papers associated with cataract genes from 2010-2019 were analyzed using a bibliometric method. The publication, country, institution, journal, references, knowledgebase, keywords, and research hotspots of the papers were analyzed using an online analysis platform of literature metrology, bibliographic item co-occurrence matrix builder (BICOMB), CiteSpace V, and VOS viewer analysis tool. Results: 78 countries published the related articles, and the United States ranks of America had the most publications. Two thousand seven hundred and eighty three institutions contributed to the related publications. Fudan University had the most publications. The reference clusters of SCI papers were clustered into six categories, namely, causing congenital cataract-microcornea syndrome, functional snp, cataractous lenses, a1 mutation, foxe3 mutation, cell adhesion gene pvrl3, nid1 gene. The key words representing the research frontiers were cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (2017-2019), oxidative stress (2017-2019). Conclusion: This study provided a systematic, objective and comprehensive analysis of the literature related to gene research of cataract. Moreover, this study demonstrated the current hotspots and the future trends in the field of gene research of cataract. This review will help ophthalmologist to discern the dynamic evolution of cataract gene research, as well as highlight areas for future research.
