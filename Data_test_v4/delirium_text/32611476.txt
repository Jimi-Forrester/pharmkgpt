32611476|t|Montessori intervention for individuals with dementia: feasibility study of a culturally adapted psychosocial intervention in Pakistan (MIRACLE).
32611476|a|BACKGROUND: Globally, nearly two-thirds of people with dementia reside in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), yet research on how to support people with dementia in LMIC settings is sparse, particularly regarding the management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. Understanding how best to manage these symptoms of dementia with non-specialist approaches in LMICs is critical. One such approach is a non-pharmacological intervention based on the Montessori method. AIMS: To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally adapted, group-based Montessori intervention for care home residents with dementia and their study partners, who were paid care workers in Pakistan. METHOD: This was a two-stage study: a cultural adaptation of the Montessori intervention and a single-arm, open-label, feasibility and acceptability study of 12 participant dyads. Feasibility and tolerability of the intervention and study procedures were determined through the recruitment rate, adherence to the protocol and acceptance of the intervention. Qualitative interviews were undertaken with the study partners. A pre-post exploratory analysis of ratings of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, functional ability and quality of life were also conducted. RESULTS: The recruitment and retention rates of people with dementia were acceptable, and the intervention was well tolerated by participant dyads. Findings show a reduction in agitation levels and improvement in mood and interest for the activities. CONCLUSIONS: Feasibility studies of low-cost, easy-to-deliver and culturally adapted interventions are essential in laying the groundwork for subsequent definitive effectiveness and/or implementation trials for dementia in LMICs, where awareness and resources for dementia are limited.
