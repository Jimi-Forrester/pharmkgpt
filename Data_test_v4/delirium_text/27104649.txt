27104649|t|L17A/F19A Substitutions Augment the alpha-Helicity of beta-Amyloid Peptide Discordant Segment.
27104649|a|beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) aggregation has been thought to be associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Recently, we showed that L17A/F19A substitutions may increase the structural stability of wild-type and Arctic-type Abeta40 and decrease the rates of structural conversion and fibril formation. However, the underlying mechanism for the increase of structural stability as a result of the alanine substitutions remained elusive. In this study, we apply nuclear magnetic resonance and circular dichroism spectroscopies to characterize the Abeta40 structure, demonstrating that L17A/F19A substitutions can augment the alpha-helicity of the residues located in the alpha/beta-discordant segment (resides 15 to 23) of both wild-type and Arctic-type Abeta40. These results provide a structural basis to link the alpha-helicity of the alpha/beta-discordant segment with the conformational conversion propensity of Abeta.
