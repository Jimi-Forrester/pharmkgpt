11832235|t|Hip1 and Hippi participate in a novel cell death-signaling pathway.
11832235|a|Neuronal apoptosis is a cardinal feature of late-onset neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease. Biochemical and cell biological studies point to a role for Hip1 and Hippi in caspase-8 activation and the initiation of apoptosis during the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease.
