33291308|t|Diabetic Corneal Neuropathy.
33291308|a|Diabetic keratopathy (DK) is a common, but underdiagnosed, ocular complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) that has a significant economic burden. It is characterised by progressive damage of corneal nerves, due to DM-induced chronic hyperglycaemia and its associated metabolic changes. With advances in corneal nerve imaging and quantitative analytic tools, studies have shown that the severity of diabetic corneal neuropathy correlates with the status of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The corneal nerve plexus is, therefore, considered as an important surrogate marker of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and helps in the evaluation of interventional efficacy in the management of DM. The clinical manifestations of DK depend on the disease severity and vary from decreased corneal sensitivity to sight-threatening corneal infections and neurotrophic ulcers. The severity of diabetic corneal neuropathy and resultant DK determines its management plan, and a step-wise approach is generally suggested. Future work would focus on the exploration of biomarkers for diabetic corneal neuropathy, the development of new treatment for corneal nerve protection, and the improvement in the clinical assessment, as well as current imaging technique and analysis, to help clinicians detect diabetic corneal neuropathy earlier and monitor the sub-clinical progression more reliably.
