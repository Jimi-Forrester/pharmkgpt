37245495|t|Post-stroke delirium and challenges for the rehabilitation setting: A narrative review.
37245495|a|INTRODUCTION: Post-stroke delirium (PSD) is a common yet underrecognized complication following stroke, with its effect on stroke rehabilitation being the subject of limited attention. The objective of this narrative review is to provide an overview of core issues in PSD including epidemiology, diagnostic challenges, and management considerations, with an emphasis on the rehabilitation phase. METHODS: Ovid Medline and Google Scholar were searched through February 2023 using keywords related to delirium, rehabilitation, and the post-stroke period. Only studies conducted on adults (>=18 years) and written in the English language were included. RESULTS: PSD affects approximately 25% of stroke patients, and often persists well into the post-acute phase, with a negative impact on rehabilitation outcomes including lengths of stay, function, and cognition. Certain stroke and patient characteristics can help predict risk for PSD. The diagnosis of delirium becomes more challenging when superimposed on stroke deficits (such as attentional impairment or other cognitive, psychiatric, or behavioural disorders), leading to underdiagnosis, overdiagnosis, or misdiagnosis. Particularly in patients with post-stroke language or cognitive disorders, common screening tools are less accurate. The multidisciplinary rehabilitation team should be involved in management of PSD as rehabilitative activities can be beneficial for patients who can participate safely. Addressing barriers to effective delirium care at various levels of the health care system can improve rehabilitation trajectories for these patients. CONCLUSIONS: PSD is a disease entity commonly encountered in the rehabilitation setting, but it is challenging to diagnose and manage. New delirium screening tools and management approaches specific for the post-stroke and rehabilitation settings are needed.
