38720971|a|The aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides is associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there has been a growing belief that the oligomerization of Abeta species in different environments has a neurotoxic effect on the patient's brain, causing damage. It is necessary to comprehend the compositions of Abeta oligomers in order to develop medications that may effectively inhibit these neurotoxic forms that affect the nervous system of AD patients. Thus, dissociation or inhibition of Abeta aggregation may be able to prevent AD. To date, the search for traditional agents and biomolecules has largely been unsuccessful. In this context, nanoparticles have emerged as potential candidates to directly inhibit the formation of Abeta oligomers. The oligomerization of the dimeric Abeta peptides with or without the influence of a silver nanoparticle was thus investigated using temperature replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations. The physical insights into the dimeric Abeta oligomerization were clarified by analyzing intermolecular contact maps, the free energy landscape of the dimeric oligomer, secondary structure terms, etc. The difference in obtained metrics between Abeta with or without a silver nanoparticle provides a picture of the influence of silver nanoparticles on the oligomerization process. The underlying mechanisms that are involved in altering Abeta oligomerization will be discussed. The obtained results may play an important role in searching for Abeta inhibitor pathways.
