33544389|t|What prompts patients to present with delirium?
33544389|a|PURPOSE: To explore the recognition, response and understanding of delirium in families and carers of hospitalised patients. METHODS: All adults with delirium admitted to an acute medical unit were included. Delirium was diagnosed by a specialist geriatrician. The responder who sought medical advice for each patient was interviewed using a delirium recognition questionnaire. Vital status was ascertained at four months. RESULTS: Sixty patients were included (mean age 85, SD 6.8 years). Reported symptoms included drowsiness and lack of responsiveness, though these were less commonly recognised as being due to delirium. 76% received medical advice within 24 h, although two responders took > 1 week. One-third of responders had never heard of delirium. Delirium knowledge among responders was variable. CONCLUSION: Overall awareness and knowledge of delirium was poor. Community delirium education and public health initiatives may improve rapidity of recognition, delirium assessment, and potentially health outcomes.
