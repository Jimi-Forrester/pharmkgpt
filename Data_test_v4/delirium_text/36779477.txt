36779477|t|Longitudinal characterization of circulating extracellular vesicles and small RNA during simian immunodeficiency virus infection and antiretroviral therapy.
36779477|a|OBJECTIVES: Latent infection by HIV hinders viral eradication despite effective antiretroviral treatment (ART). Among proposed contributors to viral latency are cellular small RNAs that have also been proposed to shuttle between cells in extracellular vesicles. Thus, we profiled extracellular vesicle small RNAs during different infection phases to understand the potential relationship between these extracellular vesicle associated small RNAs and viral infection. DESIGN: A well characterized simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/macaque model of HIV was used to profile extracellular vesicle enriched blood plasma fractions harvested during preinfection, acute infection, latent infection/ART treatment, and rebound after ART interruption. METHODS: Measurement of extracellular vesicle concentration, size distribution, and morphology was complemented with qPCR array for small RNA expression, followed by individual qPCR validations. Iodixanol density gradients were used to separate extracellular vesicle subtypes and virions. RESULTS: Plasma extracellular vesicle particle counts correlated with viral load and peaked during acute infection. However, SIV gag RNA detection showed that virions did not fully explain this peak. Extracellular vesicle microRNAs miR-181a, miR-342-3p, and miR-29a decreased with SIV infection and remained downregulated in latency. Interestingly, small nuclear RNA U6 had a tight association with viral load peak. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to monitor how extracellular vesicle concentration and extracellular vesicle small RNA expression change dynamically in acute viral infection, latency, and rebound in a carefully controlled animal model. These changes may also reveal regulatory roles in retroviral infection and latency.
