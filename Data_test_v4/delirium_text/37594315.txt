37594315|t|Ambient Air Pollutants and Olfaction among Women 50-79 Years of Age from the Sister Study.
37594315|a|BACKGROUND: Poor olfaction is common in older adults and may have profound adverse implications on their health. However, little is known about the potential environmental contributors to poor olfaction. OBJECTIVE: We investigated ambient fine particulate matter [PM <=2.5mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5)] and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in relation to poor olfaction in middle-aged to older women. METHODS: The Sister Study is a nationwide cohort of 50,884 women in the United States with annual average air pollutant exposures estimated based on participants' residences from enrollment (2003-2009) through 2017. This analysis was limited to 3,345 women, 50-79 years of age as of January 2018, who completed the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) in 2018-2019. Poor olfaction was defined as a B-SIT score of <=9 in the primary analysis. We conducted multivariable logistic regressions, accounting for covariates and study sampling design. RESULTS: Overall, we found little evidence for associations of air pollutants with poor olfaction. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of poor olfaction for each interquartile range (IQR) increment of air pollutants in 2006 were 1.03 (95% CI: 0.91, 1.17) for PM2.5 (per 3.3 mug/m3) and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.22) for NO2 (per 5.7 ppb). Results were similar in the analyses using the most recent (2017) or the cumulative average (2006-2017) air pollutant exposure data. Secondary analyses suggested potential association in certain subgroups. The OR per IQR was 1.35 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.65) for PM2.5 among younger participants (<54.2 years of age) and 1.87 (95% CI: 1.29, 2.71) for NO2 among current smokers. DISCUSSION: This study did not find convincing evidence that air pollutants have lasting detrimental effects on the sense of smell of women 50-79 years of age. The subgroup analyses are exploratory, and the findings need independent confirmation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12066.
