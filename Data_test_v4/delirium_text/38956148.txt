38956148|a|This study aimed to develop and internally validate a nomogram model for assessing the risk of intraoperative hypothermia in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) lobectomy. This study is a retrospective study. A total of 530 patients who undergoing VATS lobectomy from January 2022 to December 2023 in a tertiary hospital in Wuhan were selected. Patients were divided into hypothermia group (n = 346) and non-hypothermia group (n = 184) according to whether hypothermia occurred during the operation. Lasso regression was used to screen the independent variables. Logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors of hypothermia during operation, and a nomogram model was established. Bootstrap method was used to internally verify the nomogram model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the discrimination of the model. Calibration curve and Hosmer Lemeshow test were used to evaluate the accuracy of the model. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the clinical utility of the model. Intraoperative hypothermia occurred in 346 of 530 patients undergoing VATS lobectomy (65.28%). Logistic regression analysis showed that age, serum total bilirubin, inhaled desflurane, anesthesia duration, intraoperative infusion volume, intraoperative blood loss and body mass index were risk factors for intraoperative hypothermia in patients undergoing VATS lobectomy (P < 0.05). The area under ROC curve was 0.757, 95% CI (0.714-0.799). The optimal cutoff value was 0.635, the sensitivity was 0.717, and the specificity was 0.658. These results suggested that the model was well discriminated. Calibration curve has shown that the actual values are generally in agreement with the predicted values. Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed that chi2 = 5.588, P = 0.693, indicating that the model has a good accuracy. The DCA results confirmed that the model had high clinical utility. The nomogram model constructed in this study showed good discrimination, accuracy and clinical utility in predicting patients with intraoperative hypothermia, which can provide reference for medical staff to screen high-risk of intraoperative hypothermia in patients undergoing VATS lobectomy.
