38161283|a|This study was undertaken to identify and characterize the first ligands capable of selectively identifying nicotinic acetylcholine receptors containing alpha7 and beta2 subunits (alpha7beta2-nAChR subtype). Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons express alpha7beta2-nAChR. Here, they appear to mediate neuronal dysfunction induced by the elevated levels of oligomeric amyloid-beta associated with early Alzheimer's disease. Additional work indicates that alpha7beta2-nAChR are expressed across several further critically important cholinergic and GABAergic neuronal circuits within the central nervous system. Further studies, however, are significantly hindered by the inability of currently available ligands to distinguish heteromeric alpha7beta2-nAChR from the closely related and more widespread homomeric alpha7-only-nAChR subtype. Functional screening using two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology identified a family of alpha7beta2-nAChR-selective analogs of alpha-conotoxin PnIC (alpha-CtxPnIC). A combined electrophysiology, functional kinetics, site-directed mutagenesis, and molecular dynamics approach was used to further characterize the alpha7beta2-nAChR selectivity and site of action of these alpha-CtxPnIC analogs. We determined that alpha7beta2-nAChR selectivity of alpha-CtxPnIC analogs arises from interactions at a site distinct from the orthosteric agonist-binding site shared between alpha7beta2- and alpha7-only-nAChR. As numerous previously identified alpha-Ctx ligands are competitive antagonists of orthosteric agonist-binding sites, this study profoundly expands the scope of use of alpha-Ctx ligands (which have already provided important nAChR research and translational breakthroughs). More immediately, analogs of alpha-CtxPnIC promise to enable, for the first time, both comprehensive mapping of the distribution of alpha7beta2-nAChR and detailed investigations of their physiological roles.
