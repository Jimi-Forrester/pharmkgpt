33437155|t|The antioxidant activities of Korean Red Ginseng (Panax ginseng) and ginsenosides: A systemic review through in vivo and clinical trials.
33437155|a|A wide range of studies have steadily pointed out the relation of oxidative stress to the primary and secondary causes of human disease and aging. As such, there have been multiple misconceptions about oxidative stress. Most of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from chronic diseases cause oxidative damage to cell membrane lipids and proteins. ROS production is increased by abnormal stimulation inside and outside in the body, and even though ROS are generated in cells in response to abnormal metabolic processes such as disease, it does not mean that they directly contribute to the pathogenesis of a disease. Therefore, the focus of treatment should not be on ROS production itself but on the prevention and treatment of diseases linked to ROS production, including types 1 and 2 diabetes, cancer, heart disease, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. In this regard, Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) has been traditionally utilized to help prevent and treat diseases such as diabetes, cancer, inflammation, nervous system diseases, cardiovascular disease, and hyperlipidemia. Therefore, this review was intended to summarize in vivo animal and human clinical studies on the antioxidant activities of KRG and its components, ginsenosides.
