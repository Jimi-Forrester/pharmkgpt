30906380|t|Changes in Regional Cerebral Perfusion after Nicergoline Treatment in Early Alzheimer's Disease: A Pilot Study.
30906380|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Nicergoline is an ergoline derivative that is used to treat cognitive deficits in cerebrovascular disease and various forms of dementia. Although therapeutic effects of nicergoline have been established, little is known about its effects on cerebral perfusion in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to examine the role of nicergoline in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of AD patients using technetium-99m hexa-methyl-propylene-amine-oxime single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). METHODS: Sixteen patients with early AD underwent a comprehensive clinical assessment including cognitive testing and SPECT scans before and after nicergoline treatment. Nicergoline (30 mg twice daily) was administered for an average duration of 1.5 years. Clinical and cognitive functioning was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), CDR-Sum of Boxes, Global Deterioration Scale, Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, and Geriatric Depression Scale. RESULTS: Nicergoline treatment induced changes in the severity of dementia, cognitive function, activities of daily living, and depressive symptoms, which were not statistically significant. During the follow-up, the patients showed significant increases in their relative rCBF in the superior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, and postcentral gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: Nicergoline treatment improves perfusion of the frontal and parietal regions in early AD patients. It is possible that the increased perfusion in the superior frontal gyrus may be related to the mechanisms that delay or prevent progressive deterioration of cognitive functions in AD.
