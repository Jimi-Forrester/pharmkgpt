39732508|t|The role of neuropsychological assessment in the evaluation of patients with cognitive-behavioral change due to suspected Alzheimer's disease and other causes of cognitive impairment and dementia.
39732508|a|The Alzheimer's Association convened a Diagnostic Evaluation, Testing, Counseling and Disclosure Clinical Practice Guideline workgroup to help combat the major global health challenges surrounding the timely detection, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate disclosure of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other diseases that cause these types of cognitive-behavioral disorders. The newly published clinical practice guidelines are proposed as a structured approach to evaluation. The purpose of the present article is to provide a clinical perspective on the use of neuropsychology within the new framework and practice guidelines outlined under the Diagnostic Evaluation, Testing, Counseling and Disclosure of Suspected Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (DETeCD-ADRD) recommendations for primary care and specialty care. Neuropsychological evaluation is a critical component in supporting early and accurate diagnosis and staging, characterizing the clinical profile, assessing trajectory over time, and providing recommendations specifically tailored to the individual and their care team. HIGHLIGHTS: Reviews the neuropsychological evaluation component of the new framework and clinical practice guidelines outlined under the Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guidelines for the Diagnostic Evaluation, Testing, Counseling and Disclosure of Suspected Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (DETeCD-ADRD). Examines the utility of neuropsychological evaluation in the assessment of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD). Supports a basis for neuropsychology in early and accurate diagnosis and staging, characterizing the clinical profile, assessing trajectory over time, and providing recommendations specifically tailored to the individual and their care team.
