38892725|t|Effect of Xanthohumol, a Bioactive Natural Compound from Hops, on Adenosine Pathway in Rat C6 Glioma and Human SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma Cell Lines.
38892725|a|Xanthohumol (Xn) is an antioxidant flavonoid mainly extracted from hops (Humulus lupulus), one of the main ingredients of beer. As with other bioactive compounds, their therapeutic potential against different diseases has been tested, one of which is Alzheimer's disease (AD). Adenosine is a neuromodulatory nucleoside that acts through four different G protein-coupled receptors: A1 and A3, which inhibit the adenylyl cyclases (AC) pathway, and A2A and A2B, which stimulate this activity, causing either a decrease or an increase, respectively, in the release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate. This adenosinergic pathway, which is altered in AD, could be involved in the excitotoxicity process. Therefore, the aim of this work is to describe the effect of Xn on the adenosinergic pathway using cell lines. For this purpose, two different cellular models, rat glioma C6 and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y, were exposed to a non-cytotoxic 10 microM Xn concentration. Adenosine A1 and A2A, receptor levels, and activities related to the adenosine pathway, such as adenylate cyclase, protein kinase A, and 5'-nucleotidase, were analyzed. The adenosine A1 receptor was significantly increased after Xn exposure, while no changes in A2A receptor membrane levels or AC activity were reported. Regarding 5'-nucleotidases, modulation of their activity by Xn was noted since CD73, the extracellular membrane attached to 5'-nucleotidase, was significantly decreased in the C6 cell line. In conclusion, here we describe a novel pathway in which the bioactive flavonoid Xn could have potentially beneficial effects on AD as it increases membrane A1 receptors while modulating enzymes related to the adenosine pathway in cell cultures.
