29598932|a|Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a 30 amino acid long peptide hormone derived from the proglucagon gene and secreted in the distal small intestine when food enters the duodenum. GLP-1 is also produced in the central nervous system (CNS), predominantly in the brainstem, and subsequently transported to a large number of regions in the CNS. Neuronal cells in nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) can synthesize GLP-1 and extends to hypothalamus, some thalamic and cortical areas. A G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) provides the majority of GLP-1 actions. GLP-1 receptor activation triggers some in vivo signaling pathways. GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are used in the treatment diabetes and obesity. GLP-1 stimulates insulin secretion, inhibits glucagon secretion, decreases food intake, reduces appetite, delays gastric emptying, provides weight reduction, and protects beta cells from apoptosis. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia. It is characterized by cognitive insufficiencies and behavioral changes that impact memory and learning abilities, daily functioning and quality of life. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, which are known as pathophysiological features of the T2DM, have also been demonstrated to have significant impact on cognitive impairment. It is thought that GLP-1 affects neurological and cognitive functions, as well as its regulatory effect on glucose metabolism. The pathophysiological relationship between GLP-1 and AD is discussed in this review.
