22017497|t|Novel reversible monoamine oxidase A inhibitors: highly potent and selective 3-(1H-pyrrol-3-yl)-2-oxazolidinones.
22017497|a|Monoamine oxidases (MAOs) are involved in various psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders; hence, MAO inhibitors are useful agents in the therapy of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's dementia, and depression syndrome. Herein we report a novel series of 3-(1H-pyrrol-3-yl)-2-oxazolidinones 3-7 as reversible, highly potent and selective anti-MAO-A agents. In particular, 4b, 5b, and 4c showed a K(i-MAO-A) of 0.6, 0.8, and 1 nM, respectively, 4c being 200000-fold selective for MAO-A with respect to MAO-B.
