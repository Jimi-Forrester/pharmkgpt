23015319|a|Amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is responsible for the deficits of learning and memory in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The high affinity between Abeta and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) suggests that the impairment of cognitive function in AD might be involved in the Abeta-induced damage of nAChRs. This study investigated the effects of Abeta fragments on nAChR-mediated membrane currents in acutely isolated rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons by using whole-cell patch clamp technique. The results showed that: (1) nonspecific nAChR agonist nicotine, selective alpha7 nAChR agonist choline, and alpha4beta2 nAChR agonist epibatidine all effectively evoked inward currents in CA1 neurons at normal resting membrane potential, with different desensitization characteristics; (2) acute application of different concentrations (pM-muM) of Abeta25-35, Abeta31-35, or Abeta35-31 alone did not trigger any membrane current, but pretreatment with 1 muM Abeta25-35 and Abeta31-35 similarly and reversibly suppressed the nicotine-induced currents; (3) further, choline- and epibatidine-induced currents were also reversibly suppressed by the Abeta pretreatment, but more prominent for the choline-induced response. These results demonstrate that the functional activity of both alpha7 and alpha4beta2 nAChRs in the membrane of acutely isolated hippocampal neurons was significantly downregulated by Abeta treatment, suggesting that nAChRs, especially alpha7 nAChRs, in the brain may be the important biological targets of neurotoxic Abeta in AD. In addition, the similar suppression of nAChR currents by Abeta25-35 and Abeta31-35 suggests that the sequence 31-35 in Abeta molecule may be a shorter active center responsible for the neurotoxicity of Abeta in AD.
