36238415|a|The objective assessment of atrophy and the measurement of brain volume is important in the early diagnosis of dementia and neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, several MR-based volumetry software have been developed. For their clinical application, several issues arise, including the standardization of image acquisition and their validation of software. Additionally, it is important to highlight the diagnostic performance of the volumetry software based on expert opinions. We instituted a task force within the Korean Society of Neuroradiology to develop guidelines for the clinical use of MR-based brain volumetry software. In this review, we introduce the commercially available software and compare their diagnostic performances. We suggest the need for a standard protocol for image acquisition, the validation of the software, and evaluations of the limitations of the software related to clinical practice. We present recommendations for the clinical applications of commercially available software for volumetry based on the expert opinions of the Korean Society of Neuroradiology.
