32686699|a|Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy has emerged as a model to assess cognitive domains. The DMD gene variant location and its association with variable degrees of cognitive impairment necessitate identification of a common denominator. Computer architectures provide a framework to delineate the mechanisms involved in the cognitive functioning of the human brain. Copy number variations in the 79 exons of DMD gene were screened in 84 DMD subjects by Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA). DMD subjects were categorized based on the presence or absence of DP140 isoform. The cognitive and neuropsychological assessments were carried out as per inclusion criteria using standard scales. Instance-based learning theory (IBLT) based on the partial matching process was developed to mimic Stroop Color and Word Task (SCWT) performance on Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) cognitive architecture based on IBLT. Genotype-phenotype correlation was conducted based on the mutation location in DMD gene. Assessment of specific cognitive domains in DP140 - ve group corresponded to the involvement of multiple brain lobes including temporal (verbal and visual learning and memory), parietal (visuo-conceptual and visuo-constructive abilities) and frontal (sustained and focused attention, verbal fluency, cognitive control). Working memory axis was found to be the central domain through tasks including RAVLT trial 1, recency effect, digit span backward, working memory index, arithmetic subtests in the Dp140 - ve group. IBLT validated the non-reliance of DMD subjects on recency indicating affected working memory domain. Modeling strategy revealed altered working memory processes in DMD cases with affected Dp140 isoform. DMD brain was observed to rely on primacy than the recency suggesting alterations in working memory capacity. Modeling revealed lowered activation of DMD brain with Dp140 - ve in order to retrieve the instances.
