35202997|t|T1/T2-weighted ratio in multiple sclerosis: A longitudinal study with clinical associations.
35202997|a|BACKGROUND: T1w/T2-w ratio has been proposed as a clinically feasible MRI biomarker to assess tissue integrity in multiple sclerosis. However, no data is available in the earliest stages of the disease and longitudinal studies analysing clinical associations are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To describe longitudinal changes in T1-w/T2-w in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and multiple sclerosis, and to investigate their clinical associations. METHODS: T1-w/T2-w images were generated and the mean value obtained in the corresponding lesion, normal-appearing grey (NAGM) and white matter (NAWM) masks. By co-registering baseline to follow-up MRI, evolved lesions were assessed; and by placing the mask of new lesions to the baseline study, the pre-lesional tissue integrity was measured. RESULTS: We included 171 CIS patients and 22 established multiple sclerosis patients. In CIS, evolved lesions showed significant T1-w/T2-w increases compared to baseline (+7.6%, P < 0.001). T1-w/T2-w values in new lesions were lower than in pre-lesional tissue (-28.2%, P < 0.001), and pre-lesional tissue was already lower than baseline NAWM (-7.8%, P < 0.001). In CIS at baseline, higher NAGM T1-w/T2-w was associated with multiple sclerosis diagnosis, and longitudinal decreases in NAGM and NAWM T1-w/T2-w were associated with disease activity. In established multiple sclerosis, T1-w/T2-w was inversely correlated with clinical disability and disease duration. CONCLUSION: A decrease in T1-w/T2-w ratio precedes lesion formation. In CIS, higher T1-w/T2-w was associated with multiple sclerosis diagnosis. In established multiple sclerosis, lower T1-w/T2-w values were associated with clinical disability. The possible differential impact of chronic inflammation, iron deposition and demyelination should be considered to interpret these findings.
