The imbalance of whole genome including genes and microRNAs contributes to the various phenotypes of T21. However, the integrative association between genes and microRNAs in the T21 placenta has yet to be determined. METHODS: We analyzed the expressions of genes and microRNAs in the whole genomes of chorionic villi cells from normal and T21 human fetal placentas based on our prior studies. The functional significances and interactions of the genes and microRNAs were predicted using bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: Among 110 genes and 34 microRNAs showing significantly differential expression between the T21 and normal placentas, the expression levels of 17 genes were negatively correlated with those of eight microRNAs in the T21 group. Of these 17 genes, 10 with decreased expression were targeted by five up-regulated microRNAs, whereas seven genes with increased expression were targeted by three down-regulated microRNAs. These genes were significantly associated with hydrogen peroxide-mediated programmed cell death, cell chemotaxis, and protein self-association. They were also associated with T21 and its accompanying abnormalities. The constructed interactive signaling network showed that seven genes (three increased and four decreased expressions) were essential components of a dynamic signaling complex (P = 7.77e-16). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we have described the interplay of genes and microRNAs in the T21 placentas and their modulation in biological pathways related to T21 pathogenesis. These results may therefore contribute to further research about the interaction of genes and microRNAs in disease pathogenesis.
