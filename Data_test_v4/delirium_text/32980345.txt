32980345|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and high levels of viral RNA in the stool suggest active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication within enterocytes. METHODS: Here, in multiple, large cohorts of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we have studied the intersections between Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), intestinal inflammation, and IBD treatment. RESULTS: A striking expression of ACE2 on the small bowel enterocyte brush border supports intestinal infectivity by SARS-CoV-2. Commonly used IBD medications, both biologic and nonbiologic, do not significantly impact ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptor expression in the uninflamed intestines. In addition, we have defined molecular responses to COVID-19 infection that are also enriched in IBD, pointing to shared molecular networks between COVID-19 and IBD. CONCLUSIONS: These data generate a novel appreciation of the confluence of COVID-19- and IBD-associated inflammation and provide mechanistic insights supporting further investigation of specific IBD drugs in the treatment of COVID-19.
