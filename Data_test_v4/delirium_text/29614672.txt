29614672|a|The microtubule associated protein tau in a hyperphosphorylated form was identified as the building block of the filamentous aggregates found in the neurons of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. In the abnormal state, hyperphosphorylated tau from AD brains (AD P-tau) was unable to promote microtubule assembly and more importantly, it could inhibit the normal activity of tau and other MAPs. AD P-tau was able to disrupt preformed microtubules and, by binding to normal tau, turn the latter into an AD P-tau like molecule. AD P-tau toxic behavior was prevalent in the soluble form and it was lost upon dephosphorylation. Mutations on tau associated with disease, e.g., R406W in frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17, altered its conformation to make it a better substrate for kinases. Using phospho-mimetics, it was found that the minimum phospho-sites necessary to acquire such a toxic behavior of tau were at 199, 212, 231 and 262, and tau pseudophosphorylated at those sites in combination with R406W was named Pathological Human Tau (PH-Tau). PH-Tau expressed in cells had similar behavior to AD P-tau: disruption of the microtubule system, change in the normal subcellular localization, and gain of toxic function for cells. In animal models expressing PH-Tau, it was found that two putative mechanisms of neurodegeneration exist depending on the concentration of the toxic protein, both involving cognitive decline, due to synaptic dysfunction at lower concentration and neuronal death at higher. Studies investigating the mechanism of tau pathology and its transmission from neuron to neuron are currently ongoing.
