39191665|t|The impact of metabolic syndrome on the cerebral cortex: a Mendelian randomization study.
39191665|a|Metabolic syndrome exhibits associations with diverse neurological disorders, and its potential influence on the cerebral cortex may be one of the many potential factors contributing to these adverse outcomes. In this study, we aimed to investigate the causal relationship between metabolic syndrome and changes in cerebral cortex structure using Mendelian randomization analysis. Genome-wide association study data for the 5 components of metabolic syndrome were obtained from individuals of European descent in the UK Biobank. Genome-wide association study data for 34 known cortical functional regions were sourced from the ENIGMA Consortium. Data on Alzheimer's disease, major depression, and anxiety disorder were obtained from the IEU Open genome-wide association study database. The causal links between metabolic syndrome elements and cerebral cortex architecture were evaluated using inverse variance weighting, Mendelian randomization-Egger, and weighted median techniques, with inverse variance weighting as the primary method. Inverse variance weighting, Mendelian randomization Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode methods were employed to assess the relationships between metabolic syndrome and neurological diseases (Alzheimer's disease, major depression, and anxiety disorder). Outliers, heterogeneity, and pleiotropy were assessed using Cochran's Q test, MR-PRESSO, leave-one-out analysis, and funnel plots. Globally, no causal link was found between metabolic syndrome and overall cortical thickness or surface area. However, regionally, metabolic syndrome may influence the surface area of specific regions, including the caudal anterior cingulate, postcentral, posterior cingulate, rostral anterior cingulate, isthmus cingulate, superior parietal, rostral middle frontal, middle temporal, insula, pars opercularis, cuneus, and inferior temporal. It may also affect the thickness of the medial orbitofrontal, caudal middle frontal, paracentral, superior frontal, superior parietal, and supramarginal regions. These findings were nominally significant and withstood sensitivity analyses, showing no substantial heterogeneity or pleiotropy. Furthermore, we found an association between metabolic syndrome and the risk of Alzheimer's disease, major depression, and anxiety disorder. This study suggests a potential association between metabolic syndrome and changes in cerebral cortex structure, which may underlie certain neurological disorders. Furthermore, we found an association between metabolic syndrome and the risk of Alzheimer's disease, major depression, and anxiety disorder. Early diagnosis of metabolic syndrome holds significance in preventing these neurological disorders.
