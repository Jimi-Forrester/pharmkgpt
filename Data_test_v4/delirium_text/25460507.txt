25460507|a|In transmission studies with Alzheimer's disease (AD) animal models, the formation of Abeta plaques is proposed to be initiated by seeding the inoculated amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain. Like the misfolded scrapie prion protein (PrPSc) in prion diseases, Abeta in AD shows a certain degree of resistance to protease digestion while the biochemical basis for protease resistance of Abeta remains poorly understood. Using in vitro assays, histoblotting, and electron microscopy, we characterize the biochemical and morphological features of synthetic Abeta peptides and Abeta isolated from AD brain tissues. Consistent with previous observations, monomeric and oligomeric Abeta species extracted from AD brains are insoluble in detergent buffers and resistant to digestions with proteinase K (PK). Histoblotting of AD brain tissue sections exhibits an increased Abeta immunoreactivity after digestion with PK. In contrast, synthetic Abeta40 and Abeta42 are soluble in detergent buffers and fully digested by PK. Electron microscopy of Abeta40 and Abeta42 synthetic peptides shows that both species of Abeta form mature fibrils. Those generated from Abeta40 are longer but less numerous than those made of Abeta42. When spiked into human brain homogenates, both Abeta40 and Abeta42 acquire insolubility in detergent and resistance to PK. Our study favors the hypothesis that the human brain may contain cofactor(s) that confers the synthetic Abeta peptides PrPSc-like physicochemical properties.
