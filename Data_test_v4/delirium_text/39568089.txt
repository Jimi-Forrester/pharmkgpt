39568089|a|BACKGROUND: To establish simple screening tests to suspect Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, the clinical sign "head-turning sign" (HTS), which is a patient's behavior of turning their head towards their partner to seek assistance with questions posed by the examiner during the interview, and the simple screening questionnaire for dementia named "Neucop-Q" were validated in participants diagnosed with amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET). METHODS: We enrolled 155 patients: 47 cognitive normal, 36 with mild cognitive impairment, 64 with dementia, and 8 with psychiatric disorders. All participants underwent Neucop-Q [three questions: Consciousness/self-awareness of cognitive disabilities (C) normal/impaired (nor/imp), Pleasure/pastime (P) nor/imp, and News/knowledge on current topics (N) nor/imp] and amyloid/tau PET. Additionally, we measured plasma amyloid beta (Abeta) 42/40 ratio, phosphorylated tau 181 (pTau181), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light (NFL) levels and compared with HTS and Neucop-Q results. RESULTS: The specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of HTS positivity (HTSpos) were the highest (amyloid PET: 0.930 and 0.870, tau PET: 0.944 and 0.957, respectively), while Cimp and Nimp had a high negative predictive value (NPV) for amyloid PET (negativity) (0.750 and 0.725). Pimp showed high specificity for predicting non-AD tau positivity among non-AD participants without amyloid PET positivity (0.854). To validate these findings with PET results, we examined the correlation between well-established AD blood biomarkers and results obtained from these screening tests. HTSpos, Cimp, and Nimp were strongly associated with Abeta42/40 ratio (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0022, and P = 0.001), pTau181 (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0095, and P = 0.001), GFAP (P = 0.0372, P = 0.0088, and P = 0.0002), and amyloid PET Centiloid (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0210, and P = 0.0006), whereas Pimp increased neuroinflammation (GFAP; P = 0.0061) and was associated with non-AD tauopathy. The combination of Neucop-Q questions showed that Cimp/Pnor/Nimp subjects have the highest specificity and PPV (0.972 and 0.833) and were strongly associated with Abeta42/40 ratio (P = 0.0006), pTau181 (P = 0.0006), and amyloid PET Centiloid (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: HTSpos, Cimp, and Nimp have diagnostic utility in suspecting MCI due to AD and AD, and Pimp has diagnostic value in non-AD tauopathy. HTSpos, Cimp, and Nimp were associated with biomarkers of Abeta pathology. HTS and Neucop-Q may serve as powerful first-line screening in memory clinics.
