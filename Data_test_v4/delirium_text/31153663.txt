31153663|t|A novel mutation in PSEN1 (p.T119I) in an Argentine family with early- and late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
31153663|a|Mutations in PSEN1 are the most common cause of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this article, we present an Argentine family with autosomal dominant early- and late-onset AD. The proband and 6 family members were available for genetic testing and clinical and neuropsychological assessments. Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers were analyzed in the proband and a cousin (mutation carrier), who also underwent positron emission tomography using F-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and Pittsburgh compound B. Exon sequencing of PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP revealed a novel heterozygous variant in PSEN1 (c.356C>T; p.T119I). Median age of onset in the family was 56 years. However, the proband's uncle showed initial symptoms at age 71. Although no DNA was available, he was an obligate carrier because his daughter (proband's cousin) carried the mutation. Both the proband and his cousin exhibited biomarker evidence (cerebrospinal fluid or imaging) of underlying Alzheimer's pathology. Overall, our results support that the PSEN1 p.T119I variant is likely pathogenic.
