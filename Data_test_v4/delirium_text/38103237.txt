38103237|a|Alzheimer's disease, among the most common neurodegenerative disorders, is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment. At present, the Alzheimer's disease main risk remains genetic risks, but major environmental factors are increasingly shown to impact Alzheimer's disease development and progression. Microglia, the most important brain immune cells, play a central role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and are considered environmental and lifestyle "sensors." Factors like environmental pollution and modern lifestyles (e.g., chronic stress, poor dietary habits, sleep, and circadian rhythm disorders) can cause neuroinflammatory responses that lead to cognitive impairment via microglial functioning and phenotypic regulation. However, the specific mechanisms underlying interactions among these factors and microglia in Alzheimer's disease are unclear. Herein, we: discuss the biological effects of air pollution, chronic stress, gut microbiota, sleep patterns, physical exercise, cigarette smoking, and caffeine consumption on microglia; consider how unhealthy lifestyle factors influence individual susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease; and present the neuroprotective effects of a healthy lifestyle. Toward intervening and controlling these environmental risk factors at an early Alzheimer's disease stage, understanding the role of microglia in Alzheimer's disease development, and targeting strategies to target microglia, could be essential to future Alzheimer's disease treatments.
