27929541|a|The amyloid beta (Abeta) pathway is strongly implicated in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and more recently, glaucoma. Here, we identify the alpha2 adrenergic receptor agonists (alpha2ARA) used to lower intraocular pressure can prevent retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death via the non-amyloidogenic Abeta-pathway. Neuroprotective effects were confirmed in vivo and in vitro in different glaucoma-related models using alpha2ARAs brimonidine (BMD), clonidine (Clo) and dexmedetomidine. alpha2ARA treatment significantly reduced RGC apoptosis in experimental-glaucoma models by 97.7% and 92.8% (BMD, P<0.01) and 98% and 92.3% (Clo, P<0.01)) at 3 and 8 weeks, respectively. A reduction was seen in an experimental Abeta-induced neurotoxicity model (67% BMD and 88.6% Clo, both P<0.01, respectively), and in vitro, where alpha2ARAs significantly (P<0.05) prevented cell death, under both hypoxic (CoCl2) and stress (UV) conditions. In experimental-glaucoma, BMD induced ninefold and 25-fold and 36-fold and fourfold reductions in Abeta and amyloid precursor protein (APP) levels at 3 and 8 weeks, respectively, in the RGC layer, with similar results with Clo, and in vitro with all three alpha2ARAs. BMD significantly increased soluble APPalpha (sAPPalpha) levels at 3 and 8 weeks (2.1 and 1.6-fold) in vivo and in vitro with the CoCl2 and UV-light insults. Furthermore, treatment of UV-insulted cells with an sAPPalpha antibody significantly reduced cell viability compared with BMD-treated control (52%), co-treatment (33%) and untreated control (27%). Finally, we show that alpha2ARAs modulate levels of laminin and MMP-9 in RGCs, potentially linked to changes in Abeta through APP processing. Together, these results provide new evidence that alpha2ARAs are neuroprotective through their effects on the Abeta pathway and sAPPalpha, which to our knowledge, is the first description. Studies have identified the need for alpha-secretase activators and sAPPalpha-mimetics in neurodegeneration; alpha2ARAs, already clinically available, present a promising therapy, with applications not only to reducing RGC death in glaucoma but also other neurodegenerative processes involving Abeta.
