29158487|a|Unraveling the complexity of aging is crucial for understanding its mechanisms and its role as a risk factor for most chronic conditions. Advancements marked by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have sparked interest in gene cataloguing in the context of aging and age-related conditions. Here, we used GWAS to explore whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with functional and anthropometric parameters in a cohort of old community-dwellers enrolled in the ilSIRENTE study. Analyses were carried out in men and women aged 80+ years enrolled in the ilSIRENTE study (n = 286) and replicated in the inCHIANTI study (n = 1055). Genotyping was accomplished on Infinium Human610-QUAD version 1. In the ilSIRENTE population, genetic variants in ZNF295 and C2CD2 (rs928874 and rs1788355) on chromosome 21q22.3, were significantly associated with the 4-meter gait speed (rs928874, p = 5.61 x 10-8; rs1788355, p = 5.73 x 10-8). This association was not replicated in the inCHIANTI population. Our findings suggest that specific SNPs may be associated with a key measure of physical performance in older adults. GWASs using larger samples are needed to confirm these preliminary results to enhance our comprehension of complex age-associated phenomena.
