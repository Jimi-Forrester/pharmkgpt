8225377|t|A psychiatric evaluation of referred cancer and medical patients: a comparative study.
8225377|a|We evaluated the psychiatric status of referred cancer patients (N = 39) and referred medical patients at two other institutions (N = 64, N = 62). Depression, anxiety, psychosis, delirium occurred with comparable frequency in both groups. Cancer patients presented with somatic complaints more frequently. However the average number of referrals of cancer patients to the psychiatric service was very low (3/months) compared to referral of medically ill patients (32/month, 10/month). The data suggests that a comparable level of psychological distress exists in cancer patients, and psychiatric referral may help in its early recognition and alleviation.
