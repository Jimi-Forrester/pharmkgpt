37248904|t|The Multifactorial Etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease: Neuroinflammation as the Major Contributor.
37248904|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. AD is a multifactorial disease, affected by several factors including amyloid-beta42 oligomers, self-assembled tau, microbiota molecules, etc. However, inflammatory components are critical to trigger AD. Neuroinflammatory pathology links glial activation by "damage signals" with tau hyperphosphorylation, as explained by the Neuroimmunomodulation Theory, discovered by the ICC laboratory. This theory elucidates the onset and progression of several degenerative diseases and concept of "multitarget" therapy. These studies led to the rationale to identify inflammatory targets for the action of bioactive molecules or drugs against AD.
