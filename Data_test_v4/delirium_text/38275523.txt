38275523|t|Rethinking Clozapine: Lights and Shadows of a Revolutionary Drug.
38275523|a|The current literature globally highlights the efficacy of Clozapine in several psychiatric disorders all over the world, with an FDA indication for reducing the risk of repeated suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. A growing field of research is also stressing a possible broader beneficial effect of Clozapine in promoting neuroprotection and neurotrophism. However, this drug is linked to several life-threatening side effects, such as agranulocytosis, myocarditis and seizures, that limit its use in daily clinical practice. For this work, a search was performed on PubMed using the terms "Clozapine indications", "Clozapine adverse effects", "Clozapine regenerative effects", and "Clozapine neuroplasticity" with the aim of reviewing the scientific literature on Clozapine's treatment indications, adverse effects and potential regenerative role. The results confirmed the efficacy of clozapine in clinical practice, although limited by its adverse effects. It appears crucial to raise awareness among clinicians about the potential benefits of using Clozapine, as well educating medical personnel about its risks and the early identification of possible adverse effects and their management.
