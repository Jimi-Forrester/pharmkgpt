36702318|a|Mutations or triplication of the alpha synuclein (ASYN) gene contribute to synucleinopathies including Parkinson's disease (PD), Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Recent evidence suggests that ASYN also plays an important role in amyloid-induced neurotoxicity, although the mechanism(s) remains unknown. One hypothesis is that accumulation of ASYN alters endolysosomal pathways to impact axonal trafficking and processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). To define an axonal function for ASYN, we used a transgenic mouse model of synucleinopathy that expresses a GFP-human ASYN (GFP-hASYN) transgene and an ASYN knockout (ASYN-/-) mouse model. Our results demonstrate that expression of GFP-hASYN in primary neurons derived from a transgenic mouse impaired axonal trafficking and processing of APP. In addition, axonal transport of BACE1, Rab5, Rab7, lysosomes and mitochondria were also reduced in these neurons. Interestingly, axonal transport of these organelles was also affected in ASYN-/- neurons, suggesting that ASYN plays an important role in maintaining normal axonal transport function. Therefore, selective impairment of trafficking and processing of APP by ASYN may act as a potential mechanism to induce pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in PD patients.
