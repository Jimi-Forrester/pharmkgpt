32022298|a|Diabetes disrupts organs throughout the body including the brain. Evidence suggests diabetes is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neurodegeneration. In this review, we focus on understanding how diabetes contributes to the progression of neurodegeneration by influencing several aspects of the disease process. We emphasize the potential roles of brain insulin resistance, as well as cholesterol and lipid disruption, as factors which worsen AD.
