34517845|a|BACKGROUND: Many patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) suffer from cognitive impairment after hospital discharge. Different mechanisms have been implicated as potential causes for this impairment, inter alia cerebral inflammation. A class of drugs with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties are beta-HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors ("statins"). We hypothesized that treatment with rosuvastatin attenuates cerebral cytokine mRNA expression and nitro-oxidative stress in an animal model of acute lung injury. METHODS: After approval of the institutional and state animal care committee, we performed this prospective randomized controlled animal study in accordance with the international guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Thirty-two healthy male pigs were randomized to one of four groups: lung injury by central venous injection of oleic acid (n = 8), statin treatment before and directly after lung injury (n = 8), statin treatment after lung injury (n = 8), or ventilation-only controls (n = 8). About 18 h after lung injury and standardized treatment, the animals were euthanised, and the brains and lungs were collected for further examinations. We determined histologic lung injury and cerebral and pulmonal cytokine and 3-nitrotyrosine production. RESULTS: We found a significant increase in hippocampal IL-6 mRNA after lung injury (p < 0.05). Treatment with rosuvastatin before and after induction of lung injury led to a significant reduction of hippocampal IL-6 mRNA (p < 0.05). Cerebral 3-nitrotyrosine was significantly higher in lung-injured animals compared with all other groups (p < 0.05 vs. animals treated with rosuvastatin after lung injury induction; p < 0.001 vs. all other groups). 3-Nitrotyrosine was also increased in the lungs of the lung-injured pigs compared to all other groups (p < 0.05 each). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight cerebral cytokine production and nitro-oxidative stress within the first day after induction of lung injury. The treatment with rosuvastatin reduced IL-6 mRNA and 3-nitrotyrosine concentration in the brains of the animals. In earlier trials, statin treatment did not reduce mortality in ARDS patients but seemed to improve quality of life in ARDS survivors. Whether this is attributable to better cognitive function because of reduced nitro-oxidative stress and inflammation remains to be elucidated.
