28032911|a|The amyloid beta (Abeta) protein is a major component of senile plaques, one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases leads to production of Abeta. APP contains tandem triple repeats of the GXXXG motif in its extracellular juxtamembrane and transmembrane regions. It is reported that the GXXXG motif is related to protein-protein interactions, but it remains controversial whether the GXXXG motif in APP is involved in substrate dimerization and whether dimerization affects gamma-secretase-dependent cleavage. Therefore, the relationship between the GXXXG motifs, substrate dimerization, and gamma-secretase-dependent cleavage sites remains unclear. Here, we applied blue native poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis to examine the effect of alanine substitutions within the GXXXG motifs of APP carboxyl terminal fragment (C99) on its dimerization and Abeta production. Surprisingly, alanine substitutions in the motif failed to alter C99 dimerization in detergent soluble state. Cell-based and solubilized gamma-secretase assays demonstrated that increasing alanine substitutions in the motif tended to decrease long Abeta species such as Abeta42 and Abeta43 and to increase in short Abeta species concomitantly. Our data suggest that the GXXXG motif is crucial for Abeta production, but not for C99 dimerization.
