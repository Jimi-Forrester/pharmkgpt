36362017|t|Molecular Mechanisms Linking Inflammation to Autoimmunity in Sjogren's Syndrome: Identification of New Targets.
36362017|a|Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune rheumatic disorder characterized by the lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands and the production of autoantibodies to self-antigens. The involvement of the exocrine glands drives the pathognomonic manifestations of dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) and dry mouth (xerostomia) that define sicca syndrome. To date, the molecular mechanisms mediating pathological salivary gland dysfunction in SS remain to be elucidated, despite extensive studies investigating the underlying cause of this disease, hampering the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Many researchers have identified a multifactorial pathogenesis of SS, including environmental, genetic, neuroendocrine, and immune factors. In this review, we explore the latest developments in understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of SS, which have attracted increasing interest in recent years.
