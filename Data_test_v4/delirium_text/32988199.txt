32988199|a|Relatively short amino acid sequences often play a pivotal role in triggering protein aggregation leading to the formation of amyloid fibrils. In the case of insulin, various regions of A- and B-chains have been implicated as the most relevant to the protein's amyloidogenicity. Here, we focus on the highly amyloidogenic H-fragment of insulin comprising the disulfide-bonded N-terminal parts of both chains. Analysis of the aggregation behavior of single-chain peptide derivatives of the H-fragment suggests that the A-chain's part initiates the aggregation process while the disulfide-tethered B-chain reluctantly adapts to amyloid structure. Merging of both A- and B-parts into single-chain continuous peptides (A-B and B-A) results in extreme amyloidogenicity exceeding that of the double-chain H-fragment as reflected by almost instantaneous de novo fibrillization. Amyloid fibrils of A-B and B-A present distinct morphological and infrared traits and do not cross-seed insulin. Our study suggests that the N-terminal part of insulin's A-chain containing the intact Cys6-Cys11 intrachain disulfide bond may constitute insulin's major amyloid stretch which, through its bent conformation, enforces a parallel in-register alignment of beta-strands. Comparison of the self-association behavior of H, A-B, and B-A peptides suggests that A-chain's N-terminal amyloid stretch is very versatile and adaptive to various structural contexts.
