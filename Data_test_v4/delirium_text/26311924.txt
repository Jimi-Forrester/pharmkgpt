26311924|a|[Purpose] We performed early physiotherapy for elderly patients with pneumonia admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and examined the effects of this early physiotherapy on the severity of pneumonia. [Subjects and Methods] Patients for whom physiotherapy was started the day after admission to the ICU (acute phase) were assigned to the early intervention group and compared with patients in the standard intervention group. All patients were divided into three groups (Groups I, II, and III) based on the severity of pneumonia. We evaluated the ICU admission period, hospitalization period, and activities of daily living (ADL) before and after admission. [Results] With respect to the severity of pneumonia, Group II showed significant differences in the ICU admission period and rates of change in the operating range, cognitive domain, and Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Group III showed significant differences in the ICU admission period and rate of change in the cognitive domain (FIM item). The results were more favorable in the early intervention group than in the standard intervention group. [Conclusion] The ICU admission period was shorter and a reduction in the ADL level was prevented in Groups II, and III compared to Group I. This may have occurred because of the early rehabilitation.
