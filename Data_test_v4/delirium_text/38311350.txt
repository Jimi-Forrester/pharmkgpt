38311350|t|Considerations regarding anesthesia for renal transplantation.
38311350|a|Renal transplantation is a complex surgical procedure requiring meticulous anesthetic planning to ensure patient safety and optimal graft function. In this comprehensive review, we examined various aspects of anesthesia management during renal transplantation, including preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care. Preoperative optimization involves the identification and management of risks to mitigate perioperative complications. Treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents is recommended to correct anemia in transplant recipients with hemoglobin levels below 9-10 g/dl. Intraoperative management focuses on hemodynamic monitoring, maintenance of intravascular volume, and careful selection of anesthetic techniques. Neuromuscular monitoring and the appropriate use of neuromuscular blocking and reversal agents are considered essential. Further, hemodynamic goals include maintaining the mean arterial pressure within the range of 80-110 mmHg. In addition, attention should be paid to perioperative glycemic control, temperature management, and diuretic use. In postoperative management, multimodal analgesia and the prevention of postoperative delirium contribute to optimal recovery. The implementation of enhanced recovery after surgery principles can further improve outcomes. Collaborative efforts among surgical teams, anesthesiologists, and healthcare professionals are crucial for achieving successful renal transplantation outcomes.
