28798396|t|Flavonoid glycosides isolated from Epimedium brevicornum and their estrogen biosynthesis-promoting effects.
28798396|a|Epimedium brevicornum Maxim has a long history of use in the treatment of estrogen deficiency-related diseases. However, the chemical constituents and mechanism of action of this medicinal plant are not fully understood. In the present study, we isolated four new isoprenylated flavonoid glycosides, as well as 16 known flavonoids (13 isoprenylated flavonoids), from this plant. The chemical structures of the new flavonoid glycosides were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis. The new compounds 1-4 were potent promoters of estrogen biosynthesis in human ovarian granulosa-like KGN cells. ZW1, an isoprenylated flavonoid analogue and a specific inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), was synthesized and used to explore the mechanism of the isoprenylated analogues on estrogen biosynthesis. ZW1 treatment increased estrogen production by upregulation of aromatase mRNA and protein expression. ZW1 increased the phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Further study showed that the inhibition of PDE5 by ZW1 increased estrogen biosynthesis partly through suppression of phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3). Our results suggested that the isoprenylated flavonoids from E. brevicornum may produce beneficial health effects through the promotion of estrogen biosynthesis. PDE5 warrants further investigation as a new therapeutic target for estrogen biosynthesis in the prevention and treatment of estrogen-deficiency related diseases.
