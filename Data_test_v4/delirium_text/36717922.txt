Patchouli alcohol (PA), isolated from Pogostemonis Herba, exhibits multiple pharmacological properties, including neuroprotective effects. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of PA against AD using the TgCRND8 transgenic AD mouse model, and to explore the underlying mechanisms targeting CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta/asparagine endopeptidase (C/EBPbeta/AEP) signaling pathway. METHODS: After genotyping to confirm the transgenicity, drug treatments were administered intragastrically once daily to 3-month-old TgCRND8 mice for 4 consecutive months. Several behavioral tests were applied to assess different aspects of neurological functions. Then the brain and colon tissues were harvested for in-depth mechanistic studies. To further verify whether PA exerts anti-AD effects via modulating C/EBPbeta/AEP signaling pathway in TgCRND8 mice, adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors encoding CEBP/beta were bilaterally injected into the hippocampal CA1 region in TgCRND8 mice to overexpress C/EBPbeta. Additionally, the fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiment was performed to verify the potential role of gut microbiota on the anti-AD effects of PA. RESULTS: Our results showed that PA treatment significantly improved activities of daily living (ADL), ameliorated the anxiety-related behavioral deficits and cognitive impairments in TgCRND8 mice. PA modulated the amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. PA also markedly reduced the levels of beta-amyloid (Abeta) 40 and Abeta42, suppressed Abeta plaque burdens, inhibited tau protein hyperphosphorylation at several sites and relieved neuroinflammation in the brains of TgCRND8 mice. Moreover, PA restored gut dysbiosis and inhibited the activation of the C/EBPbeta/AEP signaling pathway in the brain and colon tissues of TgCRND8 mice. Interestingly, PA strikingly alleviated the AD-like pathologies induced by the overexpression of C/EBPbeta in TgCRND8 mice. Additionally, the FMT of fecal microbiota from the PA-treated TgCRND8 mice significantly alleviated the cognitive impairments and AD-like pathologies in the germ-free TgCRND8 mice. CONCLUSION: All these findings amply demonstrated that PA could ameliorate the cognitive deficits in TgCRND8 mice via suppressing Abeta plaques deposition, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, neuroinflammation and gut dysbiosis through inhibiting the activation of C/EBPbeta/AEP pathway, suggesting that PA is a promising naturally occurring chemical worthy of further development into the pharmaceutical treatment of AD.
