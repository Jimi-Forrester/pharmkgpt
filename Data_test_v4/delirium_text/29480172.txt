29480172|t|GDF11 Rejuvenates Cerebrovascular Structure and Function in an Animal Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
29480172|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is present in up to 90% of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and may interact with classical neuropathology to exacerbate cognitive decline. Since growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) can activate vascular remodeling, we tested its effects on cognitive function and neuroinflammatory changes of AD model mice. We intravenously administered GDF11 or vehicle daily to 12-month-old transgenic mice overexpressing the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP)/PS1). Cognitive function was monitored using the Morris water maze, and after conclusion of the treatment, we assessed the morphology and presence of inflammatory markers in the cerebral vasculature. Subchronic treatment of adult AbetaPP/PS1 mice with GDF11 rescued cognitive function and ameliorated cerebrovascular function. In particular, the de novo genesis of small blood vessels and the expression of vascular-related proteins were significantly higher than in the vehicle-treated AbetaPP/PS1 mice, whereas the expressions of the inflammatory markers Iba-1 and GFAP significantly decreased in proportion to the lower ratio of two forms of amyloid-beta (Abeta40/42). Daily intravenous treatment with GDF11-injection can rejuvenate respects of cognition and cerebrovascular changes in AD mice.
