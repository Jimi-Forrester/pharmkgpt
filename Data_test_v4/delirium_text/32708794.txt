32708794|t|The Role of MicroRNAs in Repair Processes in Multiple Sclerosis.
32708794|a|Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder characterised by demyelination of central nervous system neurons with subsequent damage, cell death and disability. While mechanisms exist in the CNS to repair this damage, they are disrupted in MS and currently there are no treatments to address this deficit. In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the influence of the small, non-coding RNA molecules, microRNAs (miRNAs), in autoimmune disorders, including MS. In this review, we examine the role of miRNAs in remyelination in the different cell types that contribute to MS. We focus on key miRNAs that have a central role in mediating the repair process, along with several more that play either secondary or inhibitory roles in one or more aspects. Finally, we consider the current state of miRNAs as therapeutic targets in MS, acknowledging current challenges and potential strategies to overcome them in developing effective novel therapeutics to enhance repair mechanisms in MS.
