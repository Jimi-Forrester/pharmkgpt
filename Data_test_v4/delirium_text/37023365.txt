37023365|t|The Experiences of Post-ICU COVID-19 Survivors: An Existential Perspective using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.
37023365|a|COVID-19 has highlighted the vulnerability of intensive care unit (ICU) patients and the negative sequelae associated with ICU treatment. While the potentially traumatic impact of ICU is well documented, less is known about the ICU survivor's subjective experience and how it influences life post-discharge. Existential psychology addresses the universal concerns of existence, including death, isolation, and meaninglessness, and offers a holistic view of human experience beyond diagnostic categories. An existential psychological understanding of ICU COVID-19 survivorship may therefore provide a rich account of what it means to be among the worst affected by a global existential crisis. This study employed interpretive phenomenological analysis of qualitative interviews with 10 post-ICU COVID-19 survivors (aged 18-78). Interviews were structured on existential psychology's 'Four Worlds' model that explores the physical, social, personal, and spiritual dimensions of human experience. The essential meaning of ICU COVID-19 survival was conceptualised as 'Trying to Reconnect with a Changed Reality' and consisted of four themes. The first, Between Shifting Realities in ICU, described the liminal nature of ICU and the need to ground oneself. The second, What it Means to Care and Be Cared For, captured the emotive nature of personal interdependence and reciprocity. The third, The Self is Different, described survivors' struggle to reconcile old and new selves. The fourth, A New Relationship with Life, outlined how survivors' experiences shaped their new worldviews. Findings evidence the value of holistic, existentially informed psychological support for ICU survivors.
