35619840|a|INTRODUCTION: Dementia is a major cause of morbidity and dependence. The number of elderly individuals living with dementia worldwide is expected to rise up to 131 million by 2050. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is estimated to be one of the highest prevalence regions. However, there are limited numbers of studies in the region, especially on the primary care level. This study aims to determine the prevalence of dementia and identify the most important modifiable risk factors in our sample.  Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used utilizing the non-probability convenience sampling technique. A questionnaire including demographic data, the Arabic version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) to screen for depression, and the Arabic version of the eight-item Alzheimer's Dementia (AD8) to screen for dementia, were administered to participants recruited from six primary healthcare centers in Riyadh city, Saudi Arabia.  Results: This study found the prevalence of dementia to be 16% and 11% assuming cutoff points of 3 and 4, respectively, using the Arabic version of AD8, with depression and dyslipidemia as important modifiable risk factors for dementia in our sample.  Conclusion: Primary healthcare professionals should be aware of the important modifiable risk factors such as dyslipidemia and depression in the population to be able to develop strategies for early detection and slowing down the progression of dementia. Further research to identify other modifiable risk factors in the population is recommended.
