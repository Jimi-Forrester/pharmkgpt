29165763|a|OBJECTIVE: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is an early dementia or discrete memory loss. The cognitive deficit in MCI impedes people's daily activities, which influences multiple aspects of thinking and acting including attention, reading, writing, reasoning, language, and judgment. This review aims to assess the outcome of various neuropsychological interventions in treating MCI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MCI causes memory problems and is characterized by the cognitive damage that is disproportionate about individual education background and age. RESULTS: Post-mortem biopsies performed on 134 patients diagnosed with MCI showed the presence of Alzheimer's disease AD in 54.4% of all the patients, mixed pathologies in 19.4% and gross microscopic infarcts in 39.1% patients. This review was done to assess the outcome of MCI and the various neuropsychological interventions, which are being used in the treatment of MCI. These techniques were studies individually followed by their roles in treating specific cognitive deficits. CONCLUSIONS: The study focused on reviewing the literature for mainly three cognitive rehabilitation strategies: (1) rehearsal-based approaches (2) compensatory techniques (3) mnemonic strategies. In the present review, rehabilitation of language deficits in MCI is also included.
