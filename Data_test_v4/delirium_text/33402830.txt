33402830|a|The gut microbiota is now recognized as a major contributor to the host's nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and neurological functions. Imbalanced microbiota (ie, dysbiosis) is linked to undernutrition-induced stunting, inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and cancers. Skeletal muscle also takes part in the interorgan crosstalk regulating substrate metabolism, immunity, and health. Here, we review the reciprocal influence of gut microbiota and skeletal muscle in relation to juvenile growth, performance, aging, and chronic diseases. Several routes involving the vascular system and organs such as the liver and adipose tissue connect the gut microbiota and skeletal muscle, with effects on fitness and health. Therapeutic perspectives arise from the health benefits observed with changes in gut microbiota and muscle activity, further encouraging multimodal therapeutic strategies.
