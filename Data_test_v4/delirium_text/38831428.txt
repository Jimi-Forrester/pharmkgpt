38831428|a|BACKGROUND: It is necessary to develop advanced therapies utilizing natural ingredients with anti-inflammatory qualities in order to lessen the negative effects of chemotherapeutics. RESULTS: The bioactive N1-(5-methyl-5H-indolo[2,3-b]quinolin-11-yl)benzene-1,4-diamine hydrochloride (NIQBD) was synthesized. After that, soluble starch nanoparticles (StNPs) was used as a carrier for the synthesized NIQBD with different concentrations (50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg). The obtained StNPs loaded with different concentrations of NIQBD were coded as StNPs-1, StNPs-2, and StNPs-3. It was observed that, StNPs-1, StNPs-2, and StNPs-3 exhibited an average size of 246, 300, and 328 nm, respectively. Additionally, they also formed with homogeneity particles as depicted from polydispersity index values (PDI). The PDI values of StNPs-1, StNPs-2, and StNPs-3 are 0.298, 0.177, and 0.262, respectively. In vivo investigation of the potential properties of the different concentrations of StNPs loaded with NIQBD against MTX-induced inflammation in the lung and liver showed a statistically substantial increase in levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) accompanied by a significant decrease in levels of oxidants such as malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP), matrix metalloproteinase 9/Gelatinase B (MMP-9), and levels of inflammatory mediators including interleukin 1-beta (IL-1beta), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) in both lung and liver tissues, and a significant decrease in levels of plasma homocysteine (Hcy) compared to the MTX-induced inflammation group. The highly significant results were obtained by treatment with a concentration of 200 mg/mL. Histopathological examination supported these results, where treatment showed minimal inflammatory infiltration and congestion in lung tissue, a mildly congested central vein, and mild activation of Kupffer cells in liver tissues. CONCLUSION: Combining the treatment of MTX with natural antioxidant supplements may help reducing the associated oxidation and inflammation.
