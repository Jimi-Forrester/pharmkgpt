39474844|t|Oxytocin in old age psychiatry: A systematic review of the safety of using intranasal oxytocin in older adults.
39474844|a|OBJECTIVES: To examine the literature for evidence of adverse events associated with the use of intranasal oxytocin in older adults (60+). METHODS: A systematic review was undertaken according to PRISMA guidelines. Peer-reviewed literature was searched for studies involving intranasal oxytocin use in older populations. The Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI) critical appraisal tool was used to assess the quality of included studies. RESULTS: The search identified nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effects of intranasal oxytocin on a total sample size of 331 older participants. Adverse effects associated with oxytocin administration were predominantly mild and varied inconsistently between studies. Compared to placebo intranasal oxytocin was not significantly associated with severe adverse outcomes in doses ranging from 24 to 72 IU after single dose and or repeated doses in the short-term. CONCLUSION: In a population of older adults, intranasal oxytocin is devoid of serious adverse events. Although this review offers valuable insights, it may not fully reflect the potential adverse events associated with the long-term administration of intranasal oxytocin such as would be expected in its clinical application if approved for the treatment of dementia.
