35239561|t|Sleep Spindles and K-Complexes Are Favorable Prognostic Biomarkers in Critically Ill Patients.
35239561|a|SUMMARY: In this narrative review, we summarize recent research on the prognostic significance of biomarkers of sleep in continuous EEG and polysomnographic recordings in intensive care unit patients. Recent studies show the EEG biosignatures of non-rapid eye movement 2 sleep (sleep spindles and K-complexes) on continuous EEG in critically ill patients better predict functional outcomes and mortality than the ictal-interictal continuum patterns. Emergence of more complex and better organized sleep architecture has been shown to parallel neurocognitive recovery and correlate with functional outcomes in traumatic brain injury and strokes. Particularly interesting are studies which suggest intravenous dexmedetomidine may induce a more biomimetic non-rapid eye movement sleep state than intravenous propofol, potentially providing more restorative sleep and lessening delirium. Protocols to improve intensive care unit sleep and neurophysiological studies evaluating the effect of these on sleep and sleep architecture are here reviewed.
