37065921|t|DTI-ALPS: An MR biomarker for motor dysfunction in patients with subacute ischemic stroke.
37065921|a|Purpose: Brain glymphatic dysfunction is involved in the pathologic process of acute ischemic stroke (IS). The relationship between brain glymphatic activity and dysfunction in subacute IS has not been fully elucidated. Diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) index was used in this study to explore whether glymphatic activity was related to motor dysfunction in subacute IS patients. Methods: Twenty-six subacute IS patients with a single lesion in the left subcortical region and 32 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited in this study. The DTI-ALPS index and DTI metrics (fractional anisotropy, FA, and mean diffusivity, MD) were compared within and between groups. Spearman's and Pearson's partial correlation analyses were performed to analyze the relationships of the DTI-ALPS index with Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) scores and with corticospinal tract (CST) integrity in the IS group, respectively. Results: Six IS patients and two HCs were excluded. The left DTI-ALPS index of the IS group was significantly lower than that of the HC group (t = -3.02, p = 0.004). In the IS group, a positive correlation between the left DTI-ALPS index and the simple Fugl-Meyer motor function score (rho = 0.52, p = 0.019) and a significant negative correlation between the left DTI-ALPS index and the FA (R = -0.55, p = 0.023) and MD (R = -0.48, p = 0.032) values of the right CST were found. Conclusions: Glymphatic dysfunction is involved in subacute IS. DTI-ALPS could be a potential magnetic resonance (MR) biomarker of motor dysfunction in subacute IS patients. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of IS and provide a new target for alternative treatments for IS.
