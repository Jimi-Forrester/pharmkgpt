32916195|a|The effects of systemic inflammation on the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not clarified, both beneficial and deleterious effects being reported. Allergy is accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response and some epidemiological studies have reported a positive association between a history of allergy/asthma and dementia. To investigate whether chronic airway allergy influences the inflammatory status in the brain, AD-like pathology, and behaviour in relation to AD, we induced chronic airway allergy in triple transgenic AD (3xTgAD) and wildtype (WT) mice by repeated exposure to ovalbumin (OVA) as allergen. Behavioural tests relevant for hippocampus-dependent behaviour were performed. We found that allergy significantly increased the brain levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgE. In 3xTgAD mice, allergy increased the levels of decay accelerating factor and decreased the phosphorylation of p38. In contrast, allergy increased the levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta and complement component 1q (C1q) in WT mice. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis confirmed eosinophilia in both genotypes, but the basal levels of eosinophils were lower in 3xTgAD mice. In summary, allergy induced predominantly anti-inflammatory effects in 3xTgAD mice, and pro-inflammatory effects in WT mice, thus being another potential factor to be considered when studying AD pathogenesis.
