27153489|a|Homeostatic control of brain metabolism is essential for neuronal activity. Jais et al., (2016) report that reduced brain glucose uptake elicited by a high-fat diet self-corrects by the recruitment of peripheral, VEGF-producing macrophages to the blood-brain barrier. Their findings further suggest that restoring brain glucose availability might help protect from cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease.
