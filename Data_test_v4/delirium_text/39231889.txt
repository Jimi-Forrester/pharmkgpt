39231889|a|INTRODUCTION: Literature shows differences in pain experiences between sexes. The exact influence of thermal liver ablation on experienced pain is still not well-known. This study aims to investigate the maximum pain intensity at the recovery between men and women after percutaneous thermal liver ablation. METHODS: Patients treated with percutaneous thermal liver ablation (radiofrequency or microwave ablation) in Maastricht University Medical Center + between 2018 and 2022 for primary or secondary liver tumors were included retrospectively. Outcomes included maximum numerical rating scale (NRS, scale:0-10) score at the recovery room, prevalence of post-procedural pain (defined as NRS score >= 4), duration of anesthesia, length of stay at recovery, and complications. Regression analyses were adjusted for age, ASA-score, BMI, tumor type, maximum diameter of lesion, chronic pain in patients' history, and history of psychological disorder. RESULTS: 183 patients were included of which 123 men (67%). Results showed higher average maximum NRS scores in women patients compared to men (mean:3.88 versus 2.73), but not after adjustments (ass:0.75, 95%CI:-0.13-1.64). Women suffered more from acute post-procedural pain (59% versus 35%; aOR:2.50, 95%CI:1.16-5.39), and needed analgesics more often at the recovery room (aOR:2.43, 95%CI:1.07-5.48) compared to men. NRS score at recovery arrival did not significantly differ (ass:0.37, 95%CI:-0.48-1.22). No differences were seen in the length of stay at the recovery, duration of anesthesia, procedure time, and complication rate. Location of the tumor (subcapsular or deep), total tumors per patient, and distinction between primary and secondary tumors had no influence on the NRS. CONCLUSION: This retrospective single-center study shows higher post-procedural pain rates after thermal liver ablation in women, resulting in higher analgesics use at the recovery room. The results suggest considering higher dosage of analgesics during thermal liver ablation in women to reduce post-procedural pain. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 3: Non-controlled retrospective cohort study.
