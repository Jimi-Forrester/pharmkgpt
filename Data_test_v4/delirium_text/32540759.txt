32540759|t|Piezoelectric materials for ultrasound-driven dissociation of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid aggregate structure.
32540759|a|Piezoelectric materials can evoke electrochemical reactions by transferring charge carriers to reactants upon receiving mechanical stimuli. We report a newly discovered function of piezoelectric bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) nanosheets for dissociating Alzheimer's beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregates through ultrasound-induced redox reactions. The accumulation of Abeta aggregates (e.g., Abeta fibrils, plaques) in the central nervous system is a major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, clearing Abeta aggregates is considered a key for treating AD, but the dissociation of Abeta aggregates is challenging due to their extremely robust structure consisting of beta-sheets. BiOCl nanosheets are a biocompatible piezoelectric material with piezocatalytic activity in response to ultrasound. Our analyses using multiple spectroscopic and microscopic tools have revealed that BiOCl nanosheets effectively disassemble Abeta fibrils under ultrasound stimulation. Sono-activated BiOCl nanosheets produce piezo-induced oxidative stress, which effectively destabilizes the beta-sheets in Abeta fibrils. In vitro evolution has also shown that sono-activated BiOCl nanosheets can effectively alleviate the neuro-toxicity of Abeta fibrils. Furthermore, ex vivo evolution demonstrated that amount of Abeta plaques in AD mouse's brain slices was drastically reduced by treatment with sono-activated BiOCl nanosheets.
