38167971|a|Metabolic diseases derived from an unhealthy lifestyle have been linked with an increased risk for developing cognitive impairment and even Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although high consumption of saturated fatty acids such as palmitic acid (PA) has been associated with the development of obesity and type II diabetes, the mechanisms connecting elevated neuronal PA levels and increased AD marker expression remain unclear. Among other effects, PA induces insulin resistance, increases intracellular calcium and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and reduces the NAD+/NADH ratio, resulting in decreased activity of the deacetylase Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) in neurons. These mechanisms may affect signaling pathways that impact the posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of the tau protein. To analyze the role played by PA in inducing the phosphorylation and acetylation of tau, we examined PTM changes in human tau in differentiated neurons from human neuroblastoma cells. We found changes in the phosphorylation state of several AD-related sites, namely, S199/202 and S214, that were mediated by a mechanism associated with the dysregulated activity of the kinases GSK3beta and mTOR. PA also increased the acetylation of residue K280 and elevated total tau level after long exposure time. These findings provide information about the mechanisms by which saturated fatty acids cause tau PTMs that are similar to those observed in association with AD biochemical changes.
