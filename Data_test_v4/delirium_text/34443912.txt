34443912|a|As a novel nanomaterial for cancer therapy and antibacterial agent, Cu-doped-ZnO nanocrystals (CZON) has aroused concern recently, but the toxicity of CZON has received little attention. Results of hematology analysis and blood biochemical assay showed that a 50 mg/kg dosage induced the increase in white blood cells count and that the concentration of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and Malonaldehyde (MDA) in the serum, liver, and lungs of the CZON group varied significantly from the control mice. Histopathological examinations results showed inflammation and congestion in the liver and lung after a single injection of CZON at 50 mg/kg. A transmission electron microscope (TEM) result manifested the autolysosome of hepatocyte of mice which received CZON at 50 mg/kg. The significant increase in LC3-II and decrease in p62 of hepatocyte in vivo could be seen in Western blot. These results indicated that CZON had the ability to induce autophagy of hepatocyte. The further researches of mechanism of autophagy revealed that CZON could produce hydroxyl radicals measured by erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The result of bio-distribution of CZON in vivo, investigated by ICP-OES, indicated that CZON mainly accumulated in the liver and two spleen organs. These results suggested that CZON can induce dose-dependent toxicity and autophagy by inducing oxidative stress in major organs. In summary, we investigated the acute toxicity and biological distribution after the intravenous administration of CZON. The results of body weight, histomorphology, hematology, and blood biochemical tests showed that CZON had a dose-dependent effect on the health of mice after a single injection. These results indicated that CZON could induce oxidative damage of the liver and lung by producing hydroxyl radicals at the higher dose.
