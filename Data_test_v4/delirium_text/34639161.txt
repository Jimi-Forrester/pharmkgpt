34639161|a|(1) Background: Calcium-binding protein S100B is involved in neuroregeneration but has also been associated with neurodegeneration. These contrasting effects may result from concentration or duration of exposure. We investigated the effect of long-term increased S100B levels on amyloid-beta processing in one-year-old transgenic (tg) mice with 12 copies of the murine S100B gene with specific consideration of sex and specific brain regions. (2) Methods: S100B and amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta42) were quantified in serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), adipose tissue, and different brain regions by ELISA in wild-type (wt) and S100Btg mice (each n = 7 per group). Thioflavin T (ThT) and Abeta immunostaining were performed for visualization of Abeta deposition. (3) Results: S100B in serum, CSF, and brain was significantly increased in S100Btg mice of both sexes. Abeta42 was significantly increased in the hippocampus of male S100Btg mice (p = 0.0075), and the frontal cortex of female S100Btg mice (p = 0.0262). ThT and Abeta immunostaining demonstrated Abeta deposition in different brain regions in S100Btg mice of both sexes and female wt. (4) Conclusion: Our data validate this experimental model for studying the role of S100B in neurodegeneration and indicate that Abeta processing is sex-dependent and brain region-specific, which deserves further investigation of signaling pathways and behavioral responses.
