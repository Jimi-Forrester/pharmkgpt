35305662|t|PINK1/TAX1BP1-directed mitophagy attenuates vascular endothelial injury induced by copper oxide nanoparticles.
35305662|a|Copper oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs) are widely used metal oxide NPs owing to their excellent physical-chemical properties. Circulation translocation of CuONPs after inhalation leads to vascular endothelial injury. Mitochondria, an important regulatory hub for maintaining cell functions, are signaling organelles in responses to NPs-induced injury. However, how mitochondrial dynamics (fission and fusion) and mitophagy (an autophagy process to degrade damaged mitochondria) are elaborately orchestrated to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis in CuONPs-induced vascular endothelial injury is still unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that CuONPs exposure disturbed mitochondrial dynamics through oxidative stress-dependent manner in vascular endothelial cells, as evidenced by the increase of mitochondrial fission and the accumulation of fragmented mitochondria. Inhibition of mitochondrial fission with Mdivi-1 aggravated CuONPs-induced mtROS production and cell death. Furthermore, we found that mitochondrial fission led to the activation of PINK1-mediated mitophagy, and pharmacological inhibition with wortmannin, chloroquine or genetical inhibition with siRNA-mediated knockdown of PINK1 profoundly repressed mitophagy, suggesting that the protective role of mitochondrial fission and PINK1-mediated mitophagy in CuONPs-induced toxicity. Intriguingly, we identified that TAX1BP1 was the primary receptor to link the ubiquitinated mitochondria with autophagosomes, since TAX1BP1 knockdown elevated mtROS production, decreased mitochondrial clearance and aggravated CuONPs-induced cells death. More importantly, we verified that urolithin A, a mitophagy activator, promoted mtROS clearance and the removal of damaged mitochondria induced by CuONPs exposure both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our findings indicated that modulating mitophagy may be a therapeutic strategy for pathological vascular endothelial injury caused by NPs exposure.
