35298717|a|Aberrant insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling has been proposed as a contributing factor to the development of neurodegenerative disorders including diabetic neuropathy, and delivery of exogenous IGF-1 has been explored as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the role of autocrine/paracrine IGF-1 in neuroprotection has not been well established. We therefore used in vitro cell culture systems and animal models of diabetic neuropathy to characterize endogenous IGF-1 in sensory neurons and determine the factors regulating IGF-1 expression and/or affecting neuronal health. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and in situ hybridization analyses revealed high expression of endogenous IGF-1 in non-peptidergic neurons and satellite glial cells (SGCs) of dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Brain cortex and DRG had higher IGF-1 gene expression than sciatic nerve. Bidirectional transport of IGF-1 along sensory nerves was observed. Despite no difference in IGF-1 receptor levels, IGF-1 gene expression was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in liver and DRG from streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic rats, Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, mice on a high-fat/ high-sugar diet and db/db type 2 diabetic mice. Hyperglycemia suppressed IGF-1 gene expression in cultured DRG neurons and this was reversed by exogenous IGF-1 or the aldose reductase inhibitor sorbinil. Transcription factors, such as NFAT1 and CEBPbeta, were also less enriched at the IGF-1 promoter in DRG from diabetic rats vs control rats. CEBPbeta overexpression promoted neurite outgrowth and mitochondrial respiration, both of which were blunted by knocking down or blocking IGF-1. Suppression of endogenous IGF-1 in diabetes may contribute to neuropathy and its upregulation at the transcriptional level by CEBPbeta can be a promising therapeutic approach.
