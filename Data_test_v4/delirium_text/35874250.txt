35874250|t|Amine-Modified Chitosan Flocculant Synthesized via Single-Mode Microwave Method for Laundry Wastewater Treatment.
35874250|a|In this study, an effective and environmentally friendly polyaminated cross-linked chitosan (M-PACTS) flocculant was successfully synthesized via circular focus single-mode microwave synthesizer irradiation. Epichlorohydrin and tetraethylenepentamine were used as the cross-linking agent and active cationic reagent, respectively. The same formation was used to prepare cationic lightly cross-linked chitosan (C-PACTS) via the conventional heating method. The flocculant was characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. The flocculation capability of C-PACTS and M-PACTS was compared using laundry wastewater as a model pollutant. The pH, PACTS dosage, temperature, stirring rate, stirring time, and setting time were systematically investigated. The experimental results showed that circular focus single-mode microwave synthesizer irradiation was a more efficient method to modify chitosan. M-PACTS exhibited a higher capacity for turbidity and chemical oxygen demand (CODCr) removal. Under optimal conditions, the removal rate values of M-PACTS were up to 96% (turbidity) and 78% (CODCr). The proposed PACTS is suitable for treatment of polluted wastewater in an eco-friendly manner without causing secondary pollution.
