The association between cognitive tests and molecular biomarkers, such as platelet ADAM10, may contribute to an accurate AD diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research was to investigate whether cognitive deficits in AD, assessed by Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), correlate with ADAM10 platelet levels and if that contributes to a more effective AD diagnosis. METHODS: Elderly patients with probable AD (n = 30) and a non-AD control group (n = 25), matched by age, gender, and education level were evaluated. Platelet proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE (10%) and ADAM10 expression was identified by western blotting. beta-actin was used as the endogenous control. The Spearman correlation coefficient between ADAM10 and MMSE ratio was obtained for each group. RESULTS: The MMSE ratio of AD subjects (0.45 +- 0.32) was significantly different (p < 0.001) compared to the non-AD group (1.14 +- 0.07). The relationship between MMSE ratio and ADAM10 expression was significant (r = 0.62, p = 0.0003) for the AD group. The combination of ADAM10 and MMSE at a cutoff <= 0.87 presented a sensitivity of 85%, and a specificity of 97% (AUC 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 -1.00), which was significantly better for AD diagnosis than the AUCs of MMSE (p = 0.05) and ADAM10 expression (p = 0.18) separately. CONCLUSIONS: The association of MMSE and ADAM10 expression was significantly better compared with MMSE and ADAM10 expression separately, thus providing and additional diagnostic tool for AD.
