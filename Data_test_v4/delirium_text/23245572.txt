23245572|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and currently there is no clinical treatment to cure it or to halt its progression. Aggregation and fibril formation of beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) are central events in the pathogenesis of AD. Many efforts have been spent on the development of effective inhibitors to prevent Abeta fibrillogenesis and cause disaggregation of preformed Abeta fibrils. In this study, the conjugates of ferrocene and Gly-Pro-Arg (GPR) tripeptide, Boc-Gly-Pro-Arg(NO(2))-Fca-OMe (4, GPR-Fca) and Fc-Gly-Pro-Arg-OMe (7, Fc-GPR) (Fc: ferrocene; Fca: ferrocene amino acid) were synthesized by HOBT/HBTU protocol in solution. These ferrocene GPR conjugates were employed to inhibit Abeta(1-42) fibrillogenesis and to disaggregate preformed Abeta fibrils. The inhibitory properties of ferrocene GPR conjugates on Abeta(1-42) fibrillogenesis were evaluated by thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assay, and confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis. The interaction between the ferrocene GPR conjugates and Abeta(1-42) was monitored by electrochemical means. Our results showed that both GPR and GPR-Fca can significantly inhibit the fibril formation of Abeta(1-42), and cause disaggregation of the preformed fibrils. As expected, GPR-Fca shows stronger inhibitory effect on Abeta(1-42) fibrillogenesis than that of its parent peptide GPR. In contrast, Fc-GPR shows no inhibitory effect on fibrillogenesis of Abeta(1-42). Furthermore, GPR-Fca demonstrates significantly protection against Abeta-induced cytotoxicity and exhibits high resistance to proteolysis and good lipophilicity.
