38217059|a|BACKGROUND: Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) is the long-lasting impairment of physical functions, cognitive functions, and mental health after intensive care. Although a long-term follow-up is essential for the successful management of PICS, few reviews have summarized evidence for the efficacy and management of the PICS follow-up system. MAIN TEXT: The PICS follow-up system includes a PICS follow-up clinic, home visitations, telephone or mail follow-ups, and telemedicine. The first PICS follow-up clinic was established in the U.K. in 1993 and its use spread thereafter. There are currently no consistent findings on the efficacy of PICS follow-up clinics. Under recent evidence and recommendations, attendance at a PICS follow-up clinic needs to start within three months after hospital discharge. A multidisciplinary team approach is important for the treatment of PICS from various aspects of impairments, including the nutritional status. We classified face-to-face and telephone-based assessments for a PICS follow-up from recent recommendations. Recent findings on medications, rehabilitation, and nutrition for the treatment of PICS were summarized. CONCLUSIONS: This narrative review aimed to summarize the PICS follow-up system after hospital discharge and provide a comprehensive approach for the prevention and treatment of PICS.
