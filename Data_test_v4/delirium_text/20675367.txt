20675367|t|Dual role of alpha-secretase cleavage in the regulation of gamma-secretase activity for amyloid production.
20675367|a|Processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases generates pathogenic beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides associated with Alzheimer disease (AD), whereas cleavage of APP by alpha-secretases precludes Abeta formation. Little is known about the role of alpha-secretase cleavage in gamma-secretase regulation. Here, we show that alpha-secretase-cleaved APP C-terminal product (alphaCTF) functions as an inhibitor of gamma-secretase. We demonstrate that the substrate inhibitory domain (ASID) within alphaCTF, which is bisected by the alpha-secretase cleavage site, contributes to this negative regulation because deleting or masking this domain turns alphaCTF into a better substrate for gamma-secretase. Moreover, alpha-secretase cleavage can potentiate the inhibitory effect of ASID. Inhibition of gamma-secretase activity by alphaCTF is observed in both in vitro and cellular systems. This work reveals an unforeseen role for alpha-secretase in generating an endogenous gamma-secretase inhibitor that down-regulates the production of Abeta. Deregulation of this feedback mechanism may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD.
