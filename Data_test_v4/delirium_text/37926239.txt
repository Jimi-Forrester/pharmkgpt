37926239|a|Non-Alzheimer's dementia (NAD) accounts for 30% of all neurodegenerative conditions and is characterized by cognitive decline beyond mere memory dysfunction. Diagnosing NAD remains challenging due to the lack of established biomarkers. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive neurophysiological tool that enables the investigation of cortical excitability in the human brain. Paired-pulse TMS paradigms include short- and long-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI/LICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), and short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), which can assess neurophysiological functions of GABAergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic neural circuits, respectively. We conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis to compare these TMS indices among patients with NAD and healthy controls. Our meta-analyses indicated that TMS neurophysiological examinations revealed decreased glutamatergic function in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and decreased GABAergic function in patients with FTD, progressive supranuclear palsy, Huntington's disease, cortico-basal syndrome, and multiple system atrophy-parkinsonian type. In addition, decreased cholinergic function was found in dementia with Lewy body and vascular dementia. These results suggest the potential of TMS as an additional diagnostic tool to differentiate NAD.
