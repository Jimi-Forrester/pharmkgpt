36839291|a|Currently, there is an increasing number of people with mild cognitive (MCI) impairment and dementia (D). In the present work we studied the role of tau protein, beta-amyloid, LPS (lipopolysaccharide), and curli protein of elderly adults with MCI or D and the contribution of gut microbiota. Four groups were studied: young subjects, healthy adults older than 60 years (A), elderly adults with MCI (MCI), and elderly adults with dementia (D). A preclinical study was conducted in old male Wistar rats to evaluate the impact of gut microbiota on curli protein abundance in feces and brain. The results showed that with increasing age, tau protein, beta-amyloid, and LPS significantly increased in serum during MCI and D, and this was associated with an increase in the abundance of E. coli that synthesize the amyloid protein curli, that may promote the aggregation of amyloid proteins. Rats showed a clear increase in the abundance of curli protein in the brain during aging. Thus, cognitive impairment and dementia are in part due to an alteration in the gut microbiota-brain axis via increase in curli protein and LPS leading to an increase in tau and beta-amyloid protein.
