27437942|t|Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Vascular Contributions to Cognitive Impairment and Dementia.
27437942|a|Cerebral ischaemic and haemorrhagic lesions are commonly visualised on MRI studies in older patients. Although there is evidence for their association with cognitive outcome in large series, the utility of their detection for individual prognostication is limited at this stage. Studies which evaluate these findings as a comprehensive suite, with due attention to alternative pathological conditions, especially Alzheimer disease, may improve the understanding of the precise contribution of cerebrovascular disease towards cognitive impairment and dementia, and the potential interdependence of this contribution on the presence and severity of alternative brain pathology.
