33182676|t|Electrophile Modulation of Inflammation: A Two-Hit Approach.
33182676|a|Electrophilic small molecules have gained significant attention over the last decade in the field of covalent drug discovery. Long recognized as mediators of the inflammatory process, recent evidence suggests that electrophiles may modulate the immune response through the regulation of metabolic networks. These molecules function as pleiotropic signaling mediators capable of reversibly reacting with nucleophilic biomolecules, most notably at reactive cysteines. More specifically, electrophiles target critical cysteines in redox regulatory proteins to activate protective pathways such as the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2-Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Nrf2-Keap1) antioxidant signaling pathway while also inhibiting Nuclear Factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). During inflammatory states, reactive species broadly alter cell signaling through the oxidation of lipids, amino acids, and nucleic acids, effectively propagating the inflammatory sequence. Subsequent changes in metabolic signaling inform immune cell maturation and effector function. Therapeutic strategies targeting inflammatory pathologies leverage electrophilic drug compounds, in part, because of their documented effect on the redox balance of the cell. With mounting evidence demonstrating the link between redox signaling and metabolism, electrophiles represent ideal therapeutic candidates for the treatment of inflammatory conditions. Through their pleiotropic signaling activity, electrophiles may be used strategically to both directly and indirectly target immune cell metabolism.
