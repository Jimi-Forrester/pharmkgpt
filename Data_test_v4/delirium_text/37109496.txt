37109496|t|Results of Nailfold Videocapillaroscopy in Patients with Pseudoexfoliative Glaucoma.
37109496|a|The aim of this study was to evaluate the nailfold videocapillaroscopic examination results from patients with pseudoexfoliative glaucoma (XFG) and to assess the relationship between the results of this examination and the patient's clinical status in the XFG group. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The studied group consisted of 39 Caucasian patients with XFG and 32 patients in a control group. The patients were classified into two subgroups: the hypertensive pseudoexfoliative glaucoma (hXFG) subgroup and the normotensive pseudoexfoliative glaucoma (nXFG) subgroup. The nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) was performed on all participants. The results of each NVC were classified as having a normal or abnormal pattern. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference between the results of an abnormal NVC pattern in the study group vs. the control group (p = 0.8773). Microhemorrhages were shown in 30.0% of patients with nXFG vs. the control group (6.25%) (p = 0.0520). Microhemorrhages tended to be more frequent in the XFG group (p = 0.1221). A prevalent number of tortuous capillaries was observed in hXFG patients with advanced glaucomatous neuropathy. Dilatation in the capillaries and microbleedings were observed in the group of patients with lower IOP values. Tortuosity in the capillaries was significantly more frequent in PEXG patients (XFG vs. control: p = 0.0386). No relationships between the results of NVC and age, c/d, BCVA, time of treatment, and visual field defect were found. CONCLUSIONS: Specific features of NVC examination differentiate nXFG from hXFG patients. Some capillaroscopic features may correlate with the patient's clinical status of XFG.
