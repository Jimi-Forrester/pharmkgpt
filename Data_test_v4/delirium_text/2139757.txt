2139757|a|The activities of red blood cell enzymes that scavenge the superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide were measured in severely to profoundly retarded adult Down syndrome (DS) patients with and without manifestations of Alzheimer disease (AD), and control individuals matched for sex, age, and time of blood sampling. Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD-1) and glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) activities were significantly elevated (1.39-fold and 1.24-fold, respectively) in DS individuals without AD. When an adjustment was made for the SOD gene dosage effect, DS patients with AD manifestations had significantly lower SOD levels than the matched control individuals. In contrast, DS patients with and without AD had a similar elevation in GSHPx (an adaptive phenomenon). The mean catalase (CAT) activity was no different in DS and control individuals; however, in a paired regression analysis, DS patients without AD had marginally lower CAT activity than control individuals, whereas DS patients with AD had slightly but not significantly higher CAT activity. Thus, AD manifestations in this DS population are associated with changes in the red cell oxygen scavenging processes.
