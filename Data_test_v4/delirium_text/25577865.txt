25577865|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a kind of neurodegenerative diseases, the most common cause of dementia. Although AD has been studied more than, 100 years and the Abeta and tau theory are most widely accepted among the theories achieved, yet it is not really clear what the mechanism related to AD works up to now. However, it is certain that AD is a kind of diseases resulting from multi-causes. Except for causes correlated with heredity, aging and life habits, environmental role is worth taking into consideration as well. Some metals, such as copper, aluminum, zinc and iron et al, can also have close relationship with AD. Now, we make an overview on the correlative researches in the field.
