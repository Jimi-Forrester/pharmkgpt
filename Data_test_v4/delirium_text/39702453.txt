39702453|a|OBJECTIVE: This study examines the impact of preoperative stress on postoperative neuroinflammation and associated cognitive dysfunction, with a focus on aged individuals. The goal is to determine whether managing preoperative stress can enhance postoperative outcomes and lower the risk of cognitive impairment. RESULTS: In aged rats, preoperative restraint stress significantly worsened neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits following abdominal surgery. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were observed in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex two days post-surgery, and these effects persisted for twenty-eight days. In contrast, adult rats did not show significant changes in neuroinflammation or cognitive function due to preoperative restraint stress. An ex vivo analysis indicated that hippocampal microglia from aged rats exhibited an intensified proinflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation, further heightened by preoperative restraint stress. These findings suggest that managing preoperative stress could mitigate these adverse effects, leading to better postoperative recovery and cognitive health in elderly patients.
