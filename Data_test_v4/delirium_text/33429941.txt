33429941|a|The last decade has been very important for the quantity of preclinical information obtained regarding chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and the following will be dedicated to the translational implications of the new biological acquisitions. The overcoming of the mechanistic model of clonal evolution and the entry of chronic inflammation and dysimmunity into the new model are the elements on which to base a part of future therapeutic strategies. The innate immune system plays a major role in this context. Protagonists of the initiation and regulation of many pathological aspects, from cytokine storms to fibrosis, the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes guide and condition the natural history of the disease. For this reason, MPNs share many biological and clinical aspects with non-neoplastic diseases, such as autoimmune disorders. Finally, cardiovascular risk and disturbances in iron metabolism and myelopoiesis are also closely linked to the role of inflammasomes. Although targeted therapies are already being tested, an increase in knowledge on the subject is desirable and potentially translates into better care for patients with MPNs.
