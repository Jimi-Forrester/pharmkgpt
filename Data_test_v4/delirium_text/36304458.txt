36304458|a|We recently identified a high-affinity C1q-ApoE complex in human artery atherosclerotic intima lesions and in human amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's Disease brains defining a common pathogenetic pathway of two diverse diseases, i.e. atherosclerosis and dementia. C1q is the initiating and controlling protein of the classical complement cascade (CCC), which occupies a key role in multiple acute and chronic inflammatory tissue responses. C1q is largely produced by myeloid cells including Kupffer cells (KCs) and subsequently secreted into the circulation as an inactive preprotein. Its binding partner, Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), is produced by KCs and hepatocytes and it is also secreted into the circulation, where it regulates essential steps of lipid transport. In addition to its major source, ApoE can be produced by non-liver cells including immune cells and multiple other cells depending on local tissue contexts. To initiate the CCC cascade, C1q must be activated by molecules as varied as oxidized lipids, amyloid fibrils, and immune complexes. However, ApoE is mute towards inactive C1q but binds at high-affinity to its activated form. Specifically, our studies revealed that ApoE is a CCC-specific checkpoint inhibitor via the formation of the C1q-ApoE complex. We proposed that it may arise in multiple if not all CCC-associated diseases and that its presence indicates ongoing CCC activity. Here, we turned to the liver to examine C1q-ApoE complexes in human B- and C-viral hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In addition, we used multidrug-resistance-2 gene-knockout (Mdr2-KO) mice as a model for inflammatory liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathogenesis. In normal murine and human livers, KCs were the major C1q-producing cell type while hepatocytes were the primary ApoE-forming cell type though the C1q-ApoE complex was rare or nonexistent. However, significant numbers of C1q-ApoE complexes formed in both Mdr2-KO, human viral hepatitis, and NAFLD around portal triads where immune cells had infiltrated the liver. Additionally, high numbers of C1q-ApoE complexes emerged in human livers in areas of extracellular lipid droplets across the entire liver parenchyma in NAFLD-affected patients. Thus, the C1q-ApoE complex is a new pathological hallmark of viral hepatitis B and C and NAFLD.
