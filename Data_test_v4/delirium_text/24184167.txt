24184167|a|Regarding immediate post-anaesthesia problems, one must distinguish slow awakening and the apparition of neurologic or behavioural problems. Post-anaesthesia delirium, an usual cause of transient agitation in the recovery room following halogenated-based anaesthetic, is not included in this discussion. There are two false causes of slow awakening: residual curarization and a total spinal. Slow awakening is usually caused by overdose, either absolute or relative. Regarding the occurrence of neurologic or behavioural problems, one must consider situations at risk, patients at risk, the consequences of iatrogenicity but also the unknown cerebral tumour or metabolic disorder.
