36503642|t|Targeting neuroinflammation as a preventive and therapeutic approach for perioperative neurocognitive disorders.
36503642|a|Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) is a common postoperative complication associated with regional or general anesthesia and surgery. Growing evidence in both patient and animal models of PND suggested that neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the development and progression of this problem, therefore, mounting efforts have been made to develop novel therapeutic approaches for PND by targeting specific factors or steps alongside the neuroinflammation. Multiple studies have shown that perioperative anti-neuroinflammatory strategies via administering pharmacologic agents or performing nonpharmacologic approaches exert benefits in the prevention and management of PND, although more clinical evidence is urgently needed to testify or confirm these results. Furthermore, long-term effects and outcomes with respect to cognitive functions and side effects are needed to be observed. In this review, we discuss recent preclinical and clinical studies published within a decade as potential preventive and therapeutic approaches targeting neuroinflammation for PND.
