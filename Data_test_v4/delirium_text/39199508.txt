39199508|t|The Association between Long Non-Coding RNAs and Alzheimer's Disease.
39199508|a|Neurodegeneration occurs naturally as humans age, but the presence of additional pathogenic mechanisms yields harmful and consequential effects on the brain. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a composite of such factors. Despite extensive research to identify the exact causes of AD, therapeutic approaches for treating the disease continue to be ineffective, indicating important gaps in our understanding of disease mechanisms. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an endogenous class of regulatory RNA transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides, involved in various regulatory networks, whose dysregulation is evident in several neural and extraneural diseases. LncRNAs are ubiquitously expressed across all tissues with a wide range of functions, including controlling cell differentiation and development, responding to environmental stimuli, and other physiological processes. Several lncRNAs have been identified as potential contributors in worsening neurodegeneration due to altered regulation during abnormal pathological conditions. Within neurological disease, lncRNAs are prime candidates for use as biomarkers and pharmacological targets. Gender-associated lncRNA expression is altered in a gender-dependent manner for AD, suggesting more research needs to be focused on this relationship. Overall, research on lncRNAs and their connection to neurodegenerative disease is growing exponentially, as commercial enterprises are already designing and employing RNA therapeutics. In this review we offer a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on the role of lncRNAs in AD and discuss the potential implications of lncRNA as potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
