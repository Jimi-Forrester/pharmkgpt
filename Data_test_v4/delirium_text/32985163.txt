32985163|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an aging-related neurodegenerative disease and is associated with the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in patient brains. AD can be classified into the familial type and sporadic type. Presenilin-1 (PS1) is the major risk gene for familial AD (fAD) because its mutations comprised over 80%of the total mutations causing fAD. PS1 is the catalytic subunit of the enzyme gamma-secretase, which is responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to produce Abeta. Although novel fAD-causing mutations in PS1 are being reported increasingly, the molecular mechanisms underlying how these mutations induce fAD remain elusive. Since over 90%of the fAD-causing mutations in PS1 leads to a reduction of gamma-secretase activity, the PS1 loss-of-function mutation hypothesis has been emerged, which suggests that the loss of PS1 functions may be the root cause of AD. Recently, increasing number of evidence supports this hypothesis. First, PS1 loss-of-function mutations increase the production of long-length Abeta by disturbing the cleavage sites of gamma-secretase APP, thereby increasing the ratio of Abeta42/Abeta40; Second, PS1 loss-of-function mutations dysregulate endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis in neurons; Third, PS1 loss-of-function mutations inhibit the autophagy activity of neurons, resulting in the abnormal accumulation of cleaved products from APP; Fourth, PS1 loss-of-function mutations alter the endocytosis and transcytosis processes in neurons, leading to neuratrophy; Fifth, PS1 loss-of-function mutations activate brain immune cells (astrocytes and microglia), which mount a strong neuroinflammation response; Last, PS1 loss-of-function mutations reduce the rates of glycolysis and the production of lactic acid, disrupting the balance of neuronal energy supply. In this article we summary the research progress on the PS1 loss-of-function hypothesis and pose several topics which would guide studies of this field in future.
