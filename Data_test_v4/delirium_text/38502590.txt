38502590|t|The identification of a Distinct Astrocyte Subtype that Diminishes in Alzheimer's Disease.
38502590|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of two hallmark pathologies: the accumulation of Amyloid beta (Abeta) and tau proteins in the brain. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that astrocytes, a type of glial cell in the brain, play crucial roles in clearing Abeta and binding to tau proteins. However, due to the heterogeneity of astrocytes, the specific roles of different astrocyte subpopulations in response to Abeta and tau remain unclear. To enhance the understanding of astrocyte subpopulations in AD, we investigated astrocyte lineage cells based on single-nuclei transcriptomic data obtained from both human and mouse samples. We characterized the diversity of astrocytes and identified global and subpopulation-specific transcriptomic changes between control and AD samples. Our findings revealed the existence of a specific astrocyte subpopulation marked by low levels of GFAP and the presence of AQP4 and CD63 expression, which showed functional enrichment in Abeta clearance and tau protein binding, and diminished in AD. We verified this type of astrocytes in mouse models and in AD patient brain samples. Furthermore, our research also unveiled significant alterations of the ligand-receptor interactions between astrocytes and other cell types. These changes underscore the complex interplay between astrocytes and neighboring cells in the context of AD. Overall, our work gives insights into astrocyte heterogeneity in the context of AD and reveals a distinct astrocyte subpopulation that holds potential for therapeutic interventions in AD. Targeting specific astrocyte subpopulations may offer new avenues for the development of novel treatments for AD.
