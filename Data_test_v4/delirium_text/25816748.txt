25816748|t|Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 is involved in prion-induced microglial activation but does not contribute to prion pathogenesis in mouse brains.
25816748|a|Dysfunctional variants of the innate immune cell surface receptor TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2) were identified as major genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions. Here we assessed a possible involvement of TREM2 in prion disease. We report that TREM2 expression by microglia is significantly up-regulated upon prion infection. However, depletion of TREM2 did not affect disease incubation time and survival after intracerebral prion infection. Interestingly, markers of microglial activation were attenuated in prion-infected TREM2(-/-) mice, suggesting an involvement of TREM2 in prion-induced microglial activation. Further phenotype profiling of microglia revealed that TREM2 deficiency did not change microglial phenotypes. We conclude that TREM2 is involved in prion-induced microglial activation but does not noticeably modulate the pathogenesis of experimental prion infections.
