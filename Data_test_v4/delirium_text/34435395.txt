34435395|t|Bergamot rehabilitation AgaINst agitation in dementia (BRAINAID): Study protocol for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of furocoumarin-free bergamot loaded in a nanotechnology-based delivery system of the essential oil in the treatment of agitation in elderly affected by severe dementia.
34435395|a|Pain is underdiagnosed and often not adequately treated, contributing to behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). BPSD are treated with atypical antipsychotics that are associated with severe cerebrocardiovascular effects. Interestingly, treatment of pain may reduce agitation. Research is focusing on nonpharmacological treatment, such as aromatherapy, for pain and BPSD in dementia. This clinical study will assess the effect on agitation in severely demented elderly of BEO loaded in a nanotechnological odorless cream indistinguishable from placebo. This is a protocol for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NCT04321889). A total of 134 patients aged >=65 years with severe dementia (mini-mental state examination <12) will be recruited and randomly allocated 1:1 to either BEO or placebo group. After baseline screening, BEO (80 mg) cream or placebo cream will be trans-dermally applied on both arms twice a day for 4 weeks with a 4-week follow-up period. The effect on agitation will be the primary endpoint. Any adverse events will be reported. A double-blind, clinical trial evaluating efficacy and safety of an essential oil endowed with strong analgesic properties has never been carried out before. This study could form the basis for a safer and more effective treatment of BPSD in severe dementia.
