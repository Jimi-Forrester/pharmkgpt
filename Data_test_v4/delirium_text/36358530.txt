36358530|t|Flow Synthesis of Nature-Inspired Mitochondria-Targeted Phenolic Derivatives as Potential Neuroprotective Agents.
36358530|a|A series of phenolic derivatives designed to selectively target mitochondria were synthesized under flow conditions starting from natural phenolic acids. The two-step continuous flow protocol, performed in Cyrene, a bioavailable dipolar aprotic solvent, allowed the isolation of the MITO compounds in moderate to good yields. The MITO compounds obtained, as a first step, were tested for their safety by cell viability analysis. The cytocompatible dose, in human neuronal cell line SH-SH5Y, depends on the type of compound and the non-toxic dose is between 3.5 and 125 microM. Among the seven MITO compounds synthesized, two of them have shown interesting performances, being able to protect mitochondria from oxidative insult.
