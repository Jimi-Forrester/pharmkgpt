35955694|t|Reduced VDAC1, Maintained Mitochondrial Dynamics and Enhanced Mitochondrial Biogenesis in a Transgenic Tau Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
35955694|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of neurodegeneration, defined by reduced cognitive function, which is caused by the gradual death of neurons in the brain. Recent studies have shown an age-dependent rise in the levels of voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) in AD. In addition, we discovered an aberrant interaction between VDAC1 and P-TAU in the brains of AD patients, which led to abnormalities in the structural and functional integrity of the mitochondria. The purpose of our study is to understand the protective effects of reduced VDAC1 against impaired mitochondrial dynamics and defective mitochondrial biogenesis in transgenic TAU mice. Recently, we crossed heterozygote VDAC1 knockout (VDAC1+/-) mice with transgenic TAU mice to obtain double-mutant VDAC1+/-/TAU mice. Our goal was to evaluate whether a partial decrease in VDAC1 lessens the amount of mitochondrial toxicity in transgenic Tau (P301L) mice. We found that mitochondrial fission proteins were significantly reduced, and mitochondrial fusion and biogenesis proteins were increased in double-mutant mice compared to TAU mice. On the basis of these discoveries, the current work may have significance for the development of reduced-VDAC1-based treatments for individuals suffering from AD as well as other tauopathies.
