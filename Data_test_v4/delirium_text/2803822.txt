2803822|a|The histochemical demonstration of iron and the iron content was examined in the brain of a case of the special type of hepatocerebral encephalopathy (HCE). The patient had suffered from a liver disease since 36 years old. At 44 years old, she experienced the first attack of twilight state with flapping tremor. She had predilection for eating beans. Her personality gradually became euphoric with the recurrent episodes of unconsciousness. At 54 years old, she died of the complication of melena, renal insufficiency and pneumonia. The liver showed cirrhotic changes and iron content of liver was 0 or 1 after MacDonald's criterion scale. The histopathological findings of the brain showed the characteristic changes of HCE, which were incomplete softening and spongy state pseudolaminarilly extending in the deep layer of the cerebral cortex, the proliferation of the severely changed Alzheimer 2 type glia with or without intranuclear carmine positive substance. The deparaffinized sections, 20 mu in thickness, which were not fastened on slides were used for the histochemical study of iron, because iron deposits displaced inside of the brain tissues when the paraffin sections were fastened on slide glasses in the constant-temperature bath. The iron deposition was found in the central gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, medial and lateral occipito-temporal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus of occipital lobe. The iron accumulated in the ground substance, glia cell bodies, glia nuclei and unknown bodies in the 3-6 layers of cerebral cortex of these gyri. The iron accumulation demonstrated histochemically in other parts of the brain were group 1, 2 by Spatz, mammillary body, glia cell bodies in cerebellar white matter and pons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
