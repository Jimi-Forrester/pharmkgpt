35104816|t|Remote Ischemic Conditioning: A Potential Treatment for Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion.
35104816|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is a clinical syndrome, which is characterized by significantly decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF). CCH is a common consequence of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases and the elderly. CCH results in a series of pathological damages, increasing cell death, autophagy dysfunction, amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide accumulation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and endothelial damage, which are found in CCH models. In addition, CCH is a prominent risk factor of cognitive impairment, such as vascular dementia, and CCH contributes to the occurrence and development of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the treatment of patients with CCH is of great value. It has been confirmed that remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is a safe, promising treatment for acute and chronic cerebrovascular diseases. RIC significantly increases CBF in both CCH models and patients, inhibits neuronal apoptosis, reduces Abeta deposition, protects BBB integrity and endothelial function, alleviates neuroinflammation, improves cognitive impairment, and exerts neuroprotection. SUMMARY: With the development of animal models, the pathophysiological mechanisms of CCH and RIC are increasingly revealed. KEY MESSAGES: We discuss the mechanisms related to hypoperfusion in the brain and explore the potential treatment of RIC for CCH to promote its transformation and application in humans.
