We aimed to investigate the clinical effects and complications of mirtazapine overdose. METHODS: This was an observational case series of mirtazapine overdoses (> 120 mg) identified from admissions to a toxicology unit between January 1987 and August 2013. Demographic information, details of ingestion, clinical effects, ECG parameters (HR, QT and QRS), and length of stay were extracted from a clinical database. RESULTS: From 267 mirtazapine overdoses, there were 89 single-agent mirtazapine ingestions and 178 cases where mirtazapine was taken with at least one other drug. The median age of the 89 single-agent mirtazapine ingestions was 36 years [interquartile range (IQR): 26-49 years; Range: 15-81 years]; 45 were female (51%). The median ingested dose was 420 mg (IQR: 270-750 mg; Range: 150-1350 mg) and 41 patients (46%) had a Glasgow coma score (GCS) < 15, but the minimum GCS was 10. There were no seizures, serotonin toxicity or delirium. Tachycardia occurred in 29 patients (33%) and hypertension in 32 patients (36%). The median QRS was 80 ms (Range: 80-120 ms) and there were no cases with QT prolongation. There were no arrhythmias and no deaths. The median length of stay was 14 h (IQR: 8.8-18.2 h; Range:2.2-75 h). No single-agent mirtazapine patient was admitted to intensive care. The 178 patients taking co-ingestants had more severe toxicity depending on the co-ingested drug. CONCLUSION: Mirtazapine appears to be relatively benign in overdose, associated with tachycardia, mild hypertension and mild CNS depression not requiring intervention.
