35637319|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes transmissible viral illness of the respiratory tract prompted by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. COVID-19 is one of the worst global pandemics affecting a large population worldwide and causing catastrophic loss of life. Patients having pre-existing chronic disorders are more susceptible to contracting this viral infection. This pandemic virus is known to cause notable respiratory pathology. Besides, it can also cause extra-pulmonary manifestations. Multiple extra-pulmonary tissues express the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, hence causing direct viral tissue damage. This insightful review gives a brief description of the impact of coronavirus on the pulmonary system, extra-pulmonary systems, histopathology, multiorgan consequences, the possible mechanisms associated with the disease, and various potential therapeutic approaches to tackle the manifestations.
