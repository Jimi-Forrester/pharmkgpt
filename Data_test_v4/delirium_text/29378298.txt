29378298|t|miR-34a deficiency in APP/PS1 mice promotes cognitive function by increasing synaptic plasticity via AMPA and NMDA receptors.
29378298|a|MicroRNA (miR)-34a was recently determined to contribute to the pathological development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). miR-34a deficiency significantly attenuates cognitive deficits in amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) mice; however, its role in early AD pathology and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we confirmed that the increase of miR-34a expression in APP/PS1 mice was earlier than the relevant AD pathological characteristics, such as amyloid-beta production, amyloid plaque deposition, and cognitive deficits. Furthermore, because predicted miR-34a target genes were broadly linked to alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, we evaluated synaptic plasticity by investigating high-frequency conditioning tetanus-induced excitatory postsynaptic potential, which revealed that synaptic plasticity was promoted in miR-34a knockout/APP/PS1 mice. Therefore, we assessed the expression of the presynaptic components synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and found that synaptophysin and PSD95 were not altered by miR-34a deficiency. Additionally, the synaptic strength (vesicular fusion, vesicular docking, and transporting) was either not significantly changed. We also evaluated the levels of AMPA and NMDA receptors, which showed that the expression of AMPA and NMDA receptors was markedly upregulated in APP/PS1 mice with miR-34a deficiency. We conclude that miR-34a is involved in synaptic deficits in AD pathological development, which was, at least in part, due to the inhibition of NMDA (by miR-34a-5p) and AMPA (by miR-34a-3p) receptor expression.
