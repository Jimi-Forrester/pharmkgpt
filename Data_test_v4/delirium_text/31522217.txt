31522217|a|OBJECTIVES:   To evaluate whether pre-emptive analgesia is an effective technique to reduce postoperative delirium (PD) in geriatric patients with hip fracture. METHODS: This is a double-blind randomized clinical trial. Ninety elderly patients scheduled for hipfracture surgery at HongHui Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China  between March 2018 and January 2019 were divided into 2 groups. On arrival at the emergency department, the experimental group (n=44) received ultrasound-guided continuous fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) for preoperative analgesia, while the control group (n=46) received fake (or generic) continuous FICB. All patients received spinal anaesthesia and postoperative patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). We compared the change in preoperative and postoperative pain scores, the incidence of PD, and the consumption of opioids between the 2 groups. Results: Five patients did not meet the participation requirements; therefore, 85 patients were included in the study. Patients in the experimental group experienced less preoperative pain (p less than 0.05). Between the 2 groups, no significant differences were found for postoperative pain scores. The incidence of PD was lower in the experimental group (13.9% versus 35.7%, p=0.018). In addition, before the surgery, a drop in consumption of fentanyl was noted in the experimental group (0.08+-0.21 versus 0.28+-0.13, p=0.037).Conlusion: Pre-emptive analgesia with continuous FICB is an effective technique to reduce PD in geriatric patients with hip fracture.
