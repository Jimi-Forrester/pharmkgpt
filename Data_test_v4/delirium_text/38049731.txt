38049731|t|Proteome-wide analysis reveals potential therapeutic targets for Colorectal cancer: a two-sample mendelian randomization study.
38049731|a|BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, highlighting an unmet clinical need for more effective therapies. This study aims to evaluate the causal relationship between 4,489 plasma proteins and CRC to identify potential therapeutic targets for CRC. METHODS: We conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to examine the causal effects of plasma proteins on CRC. Mediation analysis was performed to assess the indirect effects of plasma proteins on CRC through associated risk factors. In addition, we conducted a phenome-wide association study using the UK Biobank dataset to examine associations between these plasma proteins and other phenotypes. RESULTS: Out of 4,489 plasma proteins, MR analysis revealed causal associations with CRC for 23 proteins, including VIMP, MICB, TNFRSF11B, C5orf38 and SLC5A8. Our findings also confirm the associations between reported risk factors and CRC. Mediation analysis identified mediating effects of proteins on CRC outcomes through risk factors. Furthermore, MR analysis identified 154 plasma proteins are causally linked to at least one CRC risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: Our study evaluated the causal relationships between plasma proteins and CRC, providing a more complete understanding of potential therapeutic targets for CRC.
