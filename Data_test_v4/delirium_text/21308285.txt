MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty complete denture wearers (14 men and 26 women) with a mean age of 62.3 +- 9.0 years were randomly assigned to two groups and were instructed to clean their dentures according to two methods: brushing (control) - 3 times a day with denture brush and tap water following meals; brushing and immersion (Experimental) - brushing the denture 3 times a day with denture brush and tap water following meals and immersion of the denture in NitrAdine  -based denture tablets (Medical Interporous  ). Each method was used for 21 days. Denture biofilm was disclosed by a 1% neutral red solution and quantified by means of digital photos taken from the internal surface before and after the use of the product. Microbiological assessment was conducted to quantify Candida sp. RESULTS: An independent t-test revealed a significant lower biofilm percentage for the experimental group (4.7, 95% CI 2.4 to 7.9) in comparison with the control group (mean 37.5, 95% CI 28.2 to 48.1) (t38=7.996, p<0.001). A significant reduction of yeast colony forming units could be found after treatment with Medical Interporous   denture tablets as compared to the control group (Mann-Whitney test, Z=1.90; p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that NitrAdine  -based disinfecting cleaning tablets are efficient in removal of denture biofilm. In addition, a clear antimicrobial action was demonstrated. Therefore, they should be recommended as a routine denture maintenance method for the prevention of the development of microbial biofilm induced denture stomatitis.
