36447510|t|Effectiveness of Morphine in Managing Refractory Dyspnoea in Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
36447510|a|Opiates are generally used to relieve dyspnoea in advanced diseases such as cancer and lung diseases. However, little is known regarding the safety and efficacy of morphine for refractory dyspnoea in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We retrospectively reviewed records of 18 COVID-19-positive patients who were administered morphine for refractory dyspnoea during hospitalisation between May 2021 and June 2021. Details of morphine usage, vital signs, an 11-point dyspnoea numeric rating scale (DNRS) and adverse events at baseline, 24 h and 72 h after the start of treatment were abstracted from records. The final clinical outcome in terms of death or discharge was noted. All patients had severe refractory dyspnoea (DNRS score >=7) at the time of administration of morphine and had not been relieved from standard care for the past 3 days. In the results, the mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 47.1 (12) years, male was 13 (72.20%) patients and modified Medical Research Council Grade 4 was present in all 18 patients. The mean (SD) 1st day dose of morphine was 7.03 (1.53) mg and the mean (SD) duration of morphine use was 5.22 (3.00) days. Significant decreases in DNRS, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were observed 24 h and 72 h after the start of morphine administration. Meanwhile, blood pressure and heart rate were not significantly altered after treatment. The finding of this single-centre retrospective study indicates that morphine may be considered for use in the management of refractory dyspnoea among COVID-19 patients.
