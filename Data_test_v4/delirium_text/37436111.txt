37436111|t|Fluorescent Turn-On Anthracene-Based Aluminum(III) Sensor for a Therapeutic Study in Alzheimer's Disease Model of Drosophila.
37436111|a|A new anthracene-based probe (E)-N'-(1-(anthracen-9-yl)ethylidene)-2-hydroxybenzohydrazide (AHB) has been efficiently synthesized and characterized by various spectroscopic methods. It exhibits extremely selective and sensitive fluorometric sensing of Al3+ ions with a large enhancement in the fluorescent intensity due to the restricted photoinduced electron transfer (PET) mechanism with a chelation-enhanced fluorescence (CHEF) effect. The AHB-Al3+ complex shows a remarkably low limit of detection at 0.498 nM. The binding mechanism has been proposed based on Job's plot, 1H NMR titration, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), and density functional theory (DFT) studies. The chemosensor is reusable and reversible in the presence of ctDNA. The practical usability of the fluorosensor has been established by a test strip kit. Further, the therapeutic potential of AHB against Al3+ ion-induced tau protein toxicity has been tested in the eye of Alzheimer's disease (AD) model of Drosophila via metal chelation therapy. AHB shows great therapeutic potential with 53.3% rescue in the eye phenotype. The in vivo interaction study of AHB with Al3+ in the gut tissue of Drosophila confirms its sensing efficiency in the biological environment. A detailed comparison table included evaluates the effectiveness of AHB.
