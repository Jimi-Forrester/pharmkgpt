32775345|t|Perioperative Management of Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome.
32775345|a|BACKGROUND: In the perioperative course, alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) can occur in any setting, especially in aero-digestive and acute trauma surgery. Challenging issues are the overlap of other forms of delirium in perioperative and intensive care settings as well as general anesthesia masking the onset of withdrawal symptoms. In contrast to other etiologies of delirium, the pathophysiology and thus treatment strategy of AWS is different: the key point is the tolerance to GABAergic molecules of alcohol-dependent subjects resulting in central nervous hyperactivity once the effect of alcohol or other GABA-stimulating agents is decreased. SUMMARY: Despite limitations due to insufficient accuracy of self-reporting questionnaires and limited feasibility in emergency settings, the AUDIT and the shortened AUDIT-C are the standard tools for detection of alcohol use disorders (AUD), as well as predicting AWS risk and severity in approximately half of these AUD patients. The most important risk factors for AWS are a high blood alcohol concentration at hospital admission, AWS episodes in medical history, and lack of control of alcohol use. Patients considered at risk for severe AWS must be treated with prophylactic medication before the onset of symptoms. Thiamine supplementation is required for all malnourished alcohol-dependent patients. Writing down alcohol-related diagnoses in the medical records requires the patient's presumed consent after shared decision-making. These reports should remain strictly confidential if the patient desires. Psychological support for the perioperative period as well as the following course should be offered to all AUD patients including support in short- and long-term detoxification. Alternative diagnoses must be ruled out with no timely delay, especially if fever and coma are the leading symptoms. The backbone of AWS therapy is the symptom-triggered administration of intravenous benzodiazepines (BZO) in escalating doses until the aimed revised Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale (CIWA-Ar) or Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score is achieved. Clonidine, dexmedetomidine, baclofen, ketamine, and neuroleptics may be used as symptom-orientated adjuncts. The therapeutic administration of ethanol or clomethiazole is considered to be harmful in critically ill patients after the onset of AWS. General supportive and intensive care including high-dose thiamine supplementation are mandatory in severe AWS cases. The timely differential diagnosis of delirium is important - and AWS is a diagnosis of exclusion - because BZO are strongly recommended for AWS patients but may not be the treatment of choice in other etiologies of delirium. KEY MESSAGES: Screening for AWS risk factors should be integrated in the preoperative and emergency assessment. Other severe diagnoses must be ruled out before the diagnosis of AWS can be established. Preventive treatment should be given to high-risk patients scoring positive for AUD and for patients with a lack of alcohol use control. The principles of AWS therapy are symptom-orientated doses of BZO and as adjuncts alpha2-agonists, neuroleptics, and others guided by repeated reassessment with validated tools and thiamine administration. Length of stay and morbidity are reduced if AWS therapy is symptom-orientated and protocol-based.
