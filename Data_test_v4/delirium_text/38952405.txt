38952405|t|Predictiveness of preoperative laboratory values for postoperative delirium.
38952405|a|Background: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common postoperative complication, especially in patients over 60 years, with an incidence ranging from 15% to 50%. In most cases, POD manifests in the first 5 days after surgery. Multiple contributing risk factors for POD have been detected. Besides the predisposing factors such as higher age, cognitive impairment, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and past stroke, pathophysiological mechanisms like neuroinflammation are also considered as contributing factors. Methods: In a subanalysis of the "PRe- Operative  Prediction of postoperative  DElirium by appropriate  SCreening" (PROPDESC) study, the preoperative laboratory values of sodium, potassium, total protein, hemoglobin concentration (Hgb), and white blood cells as well as the biomarkers creatinine, HbA1c, NT-pro-BNP, high sensitive Troponin T (hsTnT), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed to investigate a possible relationship to the occurrence of POD. Results: After correction for age, physical status classification, surgery risk after Johns Hopkins, and operative discipline (cardiac surgery vs. noncardiac surgery), male patients with a Hgb <13 g/dL had significantly higher odds for POD (p = 0.025). Furthermore, patients with CRP >= 10 mg/L, HbA1c value >= 8.5% as well as patients with hypernatraemia (>145 mmol/L) presented significantly higher odds to develop POD (p = 0.011, p < 0.001, and p = 0.021, respectively). A raised (>14-52 ng/L) or high (>52 ng/L) hsTnT value was also associated with a significantly higher chance for POD compared to the patient group with hsTnT <14 ng/L (p < 0.001 and p = 0.016, respectively). Conclusions: Preoperative Hgb, CRP, HbA1c, sodium, and hsTnT could be used to complement and refine the preoperative screening for patients at risk for POD. Further studies should track these correlations to investigate the potential of targeted POD protection and enabling hospital staff to initiate POD-preventing measures in time.
