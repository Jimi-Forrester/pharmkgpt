36923213|a|Introduction: In recent years, the biological functions and important roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been widely reported in many diseases. Although glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness worldwide, the specific mechanisms of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis and progression of glaucoma remain unclear. Our research aims to elucidate the differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in glaucoma and to provide a basis for further exploration of the specific mechanism of action of lncRNAs in the progression of glaucoma. Methods: We performed RNA sequencing on samples from a pressurized model of R28 cells and performed bioinformatics analyses on the sequencing results. The expression consistency of lncRNAs in clinical samples from patients with glaucoma or cataracts was detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Results: RNA sequencing results showed that lncRNAs in cluster 5 were upregulated with increasing stress after typing all significantly altered lncRNAs using k-means in a cellular stress model. KEGG analysis indicated that they were associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Differentially expressed lncRNAs were verified by RT-qPCR, and the lncRNA expression levels of AC120246.2 and XLOC_006247 were significantly higher in the aqueous humor (AH) of patients with glaucoma than in those with cataracts. For LOC102551819, there was almost no expression in the AH and trabecular meshwork in patients with glaucoma but high expression was observed in the iris. Conclusion: Our research proposes potential diagnostic or intervention targets for clinical applications as well as a theoretical basis for more in-depth research on the function of lncRNAs in glaucoma.
