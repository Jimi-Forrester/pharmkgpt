38111666|t|Diagnostic value of albumin/fibrinogen ratio and C-reactive protein/albumin/globulin ratio for periprosthetic joint infection: a retrospective study.
38111666|a|Background: The study aims to explore diagnostic value of albumin/fibrinogen ratio (AFR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)/albumin (ALB)/globulin (GLO) ratio (CAGR) for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical data collected from 190 patients who had joint replacement surgery in Qilu Hospital of Shandong University (Qingdao), from January 2017 to December 2022. Based on the occurrence of PJI after surgery, patients were divided as an infection group (10 cases) and non-infection group (180 cases). Diagnostic indicators were analyzed, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were further performed to identify factors related to PJI. Sensitivity and specificity of AFR and CAGR, both individually and in combination, were calculated using ROC curves, and their diagnostic performance was compared based on the area under the curve (AUC). Results: Levels of CRP, ESR, FIB, GLO, and CAGR were significantly higher in the infection group than in non-infection group (P < 0.05). Levels of ALB and AFR were significantly lower in infection group (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis reviewed that CRP (OR = 3.324), ESR (OR = 2.118), FIB (OR = 3.142), ALB (OR = 0.449), GLO (OR = 1.985), AFR (OR = 0.587), and CAGR (OR = 2.469) were factors influencing PJI (P < 0.05). The AUC for AFR and CAGR in diagnosing PJI were 0.739 and 0.780, while AUC for their combined detection was 0.858. Conclusion: Abnormal levels of AFR and CAGR are associated with PJI, and their combined use has certain diagnostic value for PJI.
