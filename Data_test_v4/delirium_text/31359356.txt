31359356|a|BACKGROUND: The influences of genetic variants on functional clinical outcomes following stroke are unclear. In order to reliably quantify these influences, we undertook a comprehensive meta-analysis of outcomes after acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) or ischaemic stroke (AIS) in relation to different genetic variants. METHODS: PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase and Medline electronic databases were searched up to January 2019. Outcomes, defined as favourable or poor, were assessed by validated scales (Barthel index, modified Rankin scale, Glasgow outcome scale and National Institutes of Health stroke scale). RESULTS: Ninety-two publications comprising 31,895 cases met our inclusion criteria. Poor outcome was observed in patients with ICH who possessed the APOE4 allele: OR =2.60 (95% CI = 1.25-5.41, p = 0.01) and in AIS patients with the GA or AA variant at the BDNF-196 locus: OR = 2.60 (95% CI = 1.25-5.41, p = 0.01) or a loss of function allele of CYP2C19: OR = 2.36 (95% CI = 1.56-3.55, p < 0.0001). Poor outcome was not associated with APOE4: OR = 1.02 (95% CI = 0.81-1.27, p = 0.90) or IL6-174 G/C: OR = 2.21 (95% CI = 0.55-8.86, p = 0.26) in patients with AIS. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that recovery of AIS was unfavourably associated with variants of BDNF and CYP2C19 genes whilst recovery of ICH was unfavourably associated with APOE4 gene.
