36767647|t|Understanding for Prevention: Qualitative and Quantitative Analyses of Suicide Notes and Forensic Reports.
36767647|a|Suicide risk is associated with vulnerabilities and specific life events. The study's objective was to explore the relevance of data from forensic documentation on suicide deaths to the design of person-centered preventive strategies. Descriptive and thematic analyses were conducted of forensic observations of 286 deaths by suicide, including some with suicide notes. Key findings included the influence of health-and family-related adverse events, emotional states of loss and sadness, and failures of the health system to detect and act on signs of vulnerability, as confirmed by the suicide notes. Forensic documentation provides useful information to improve the targeting of preventive campaigns.
