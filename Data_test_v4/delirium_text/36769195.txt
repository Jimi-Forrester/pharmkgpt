36769195|t|Cellular Senescence as a Brake or Accelerator for Oncogenic Transformation and Role in Lymphatic Metastasis.
36769195|a|Cellular senescence-the irreversible cell cycle arrest driven by a variety of mechanisms and, more specifically, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)-is an important area of research in the context of different age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. SASP factors play both beneficial and detrimental roles in age-related disease progression depending on the source of the SASPs, the target cells, and the microenvironment. The impact of senescence and the SASP on different cell types, the immune system, and the vascular system has been widely discussed. However, the impact of replicative or stress-induced senescence on lymphatic biology and pathological lymphangiogenesis remains underexplored. The lymphatic system plays a crucial role in the maintenance of body fluid homeostasis and immune surveillance. The perturbation of lymphatic function can hamper normal physiological function. Natural aging or stress-induced premature aging influences the lymphatic vessel structure and function, which significantly affect the role of lymphatics in tumor dissemination and metastasis. In this review, we focus on the role of senescence on lymphatic pathobiology, its impact on cancer, and potential therapeutic interventions to manipulate the aged or senescent lymphatic system for disease management.
