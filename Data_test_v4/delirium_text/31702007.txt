31702007|a|OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed at investigating the therapeutic effect of Salidroside on skeletal muscle atrophy in a rat model of cigarette smoking-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and its potential mechanisms. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomized, and treated intraperitoneally (IP) with vehicle (injectable water) or a low, medium or high dose of Salidroside, followed by exposure to cigarette smoking daily for 16 weeks. A healthy control received vehicle injection and air exposure. Their lung function, body weights and gastrocnemius (GN) weights, grip strength and cross-section area (CSA) of individual muscular fibers in the GN were measured. The levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) in serum and GN tissues as well as myostatin and myogenin expression in GN tissues were measured. RESULTS: In comparison with that in the healthy control, long-term cigarette smoking induced emphysema, significantly impaired lung function, reduced body and GN weights and CSA values in rats, accompanied by significantly increased levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and MDA, but decreased levels of SOD and GSH in serum and GN tissues. Furthermore, cigarette smoking significantly up-regulated myostatin expression, but down-regulated myogenin expression in GN tissues. Salidroside treatment decreased emphysema, significantly ameliorated lung function, increased antioxidant, but reduced MDA, IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels in serum and GN tissues of rats, accompanied by decreased myostain, but increased myogenin expression in GN tissues. CONCLUSION: Salidroside mitigates the long-term cigarette smoking-induced emphysema and skeletal muscle atrophy in rats by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammatory responses and regulating muscle-specific transcription factor expression.
