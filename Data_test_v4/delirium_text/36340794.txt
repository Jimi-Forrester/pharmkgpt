36340794|a|Introduction: Premature ejaculation (PE) is classified as primary and acquired and may be facilitated by different pathophysiology. Brain plays an important role in PE, however, differences in the central neuropathological mechanisms among subtypes of PE are unknown. Materials and methods: We acquired diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data from 44 healthy controls (HC) and 47 PE patients (24 primary PE and 23 acquired PE). Then, the whole-brain white matter (WM) structural networks were constructed and between-group differences of nodal segregative parameters were identified by the method of graph theoretical analysis. Moreover, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to determine the suitability of the altered parameters as potential neuroimaging biomarkers for distinguishing primary PE from acquired PE. Results: PE patients showed significantly increased clustering coefficient C(i) in the left inferior frontal gyrus (triangular part) (IFGtriang.L) and increased local efficiency E loc (i) in the left precental gyrus (PreCG.L) and IFGtriang.L when compared with HC. Compared to HC, primary PE patients had increased C(i) and E loc (i) in IFGtriang.L and the left amygdala (AMYG.L) while acquired PE patients had increased C(i) and E loc (i) in IFGtriang.L, and decreased C(i) and E loc (i) in AMYG.L. Compared to acquired PE, primary PE patients had increased C(i) and E loc (i) in AMYG.L. Moreover, ROC analysis revealed that PreCG.L, IFGtriang.L and AMYG.L might be helpful for distinguishing different subtypes of PE from HC (PE from HC: sensitivity, 61.70-78.72%; specificity, 56.82-77.27%; primary PE from HC: sensitivity, 66.67-87.50%; specificity, 52.27-77.27%; acquired PE from HC: sensitivity, 34.78-86.96%; specificity, 54.55-100%) while AMYG.L might be helpful for distinguishing primary PE from acquired PE (sensitivity, 83.33-91.70%; specificity, 69.57-73.90%). Conclusion: These findings improved our understanding of the pathophysiological processes that occurred in patients with ejaculatory dysfunction and suggested that the abnormal segregation of left amygdala might serve as a useful marker to help clinicians distinguish patients with primary PE from those with acquired PE.
