37179603|t|Colorimetric Aptasensor for the Visual and Microplate Determination of Clusterin in Human Urine Based on Aggregation Characteristics of Gold Nanoparticles.
37179603|a|Clusterin has the potential to become the biomarker of multiple diseases, but its clinical quantitative detection methods are limited, which restricts its research progress as a biomarker. A rapid and visible colorimetric sensor for clusterin detection based on sodium chloride-induced aggregation characteristic of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was successfully constructed. Unlike the existing methods based on antigen-antibody recognition reactions, the aptamer of clusterin was used as the sensing recognition element. The aptamer could protect AuNPs from aggregation caused by sodium chloride, but clusterin bound with aptamer detached it from AuNPs, thereby inducing aggregation again. Simultaneously, the color change from red in the dispersed state to purple gray in the aggregated state made it possible to preliminarily judge the concentration of clusterin by observation. This biosensor showed a linear range of 0.02-2 ng/mL and good sensitivity with a detection limit of 5.37 pg/mL. The test results of clusterin in spiked human urine confirmed that the recovery rate was satisfactory. The proposed strategy is helpful for the development of label-free point-of-care testing equipment for clinical testing of clusterin, which is cost-effective and feasible.
