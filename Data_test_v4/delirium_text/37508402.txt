37508402|a|Currently, numerous research endeavors are dedicated to unraveling the intricate nature of neurodegenerative diseases. These conditions are characterized by the gradual and progressive impairment of specific neuronal systems that exhibit anatomical or physiological connections. In particular, in the last twenty years, remarkable efforts have been made to elucidate neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, despite extensive research endeavors, no cure or effective treatment has been discovered thus far. With the emergence of studies shedding light on the contribution of mitochondria to the onset and advancement of mitochondrial neurodegenerative disorders, researchers are now directing their investigations toward the development of therapies. These therapies include molecules designed to protect mitochondria and neurons from the detrimental effects of aging, as well as mutant proteins. Our objective is to discuss and evaluate the recent discovery of three mitochondrial ribosomal proteins linked to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. These proteins represent an intermediate stage in the pathway connecting damaged genes to the two mitochondrial neurological pathologies. This discovery potentially could open new avenues for the production of medicinal substances with curative potential for the treatment of these diseases.
