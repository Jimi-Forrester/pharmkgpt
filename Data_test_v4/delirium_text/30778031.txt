30778031|t|[Cerebral metabolism in patients with cognitive disorders: a combined MRS and PET study].
30778031|a|AIM: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) allows studying the content of many metabolites in neural tissue in vivo. There are numerous studies devoted to the MRS data analysis in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their results are contradictory. Thus, it is rational to compare the data obtained with MRS and positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), which allows evaluating the brain functional state. In this paper, the authors compared MRS data in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with the cerebral glucose metabolism changes according to FDG PET. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Multivoxel proton MRS of the supraventricular area was performed in patients with AD (n=16) and MCI (n=14). The following metabolites ratios were evaluated: NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, NAA/Cho (NAA - N-acetylaspartate, Cr - creatine, Cho - choline). All patients underwent neurological examination, assessment of cognitive status and PET with FDG. RESULTS: A decrease in NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratios in the supraventricular white matter and medial cortex in both hemispheres was observed in AD patients. In the MCI group, NAA/Cr ratio were decreased only in left white matter adjusting to the parietal cortex. Positive correlations of NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratios with cognitive status, as well as the cerebral glucose metabolism rate according to the PET data in frontal, parietal, temporal and cingulate cortex were revealed. CONCLUSION: The decrease in the NAA/Cr ratio in the supraventricular white matter and the medial cortex in AD and the correlation of this index with the results of cognitive tests and cerebral glucose metabolism suggest that it can be of diagnostic significance, reflecting the severity of cognitive impairment. In this case, the NAA/Cr ratio should be evaluated taking into account the changes in concentrations of both metabolites (NAA and Cr) in dementia.
