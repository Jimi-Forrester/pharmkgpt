37138379|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium, which is frequently encountered in intensive care patients, can be prevented with multicomponent nursing interventions, and thus the negative consequences can be reduced. AIM: To examine the effect of using eye masks and earplugs in preventing delirium in intensive care units (ICUs). STUDY DESIGN: A randomized, controlled, single-blind intervention study. METHODS: This study was conducted in the medical and surgical ICUs of a tertiary hospital, and nurses were given pre-study training on delirium risks, diagnosis, prevention, and management. Data were collected using the patient information form, the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale, the Richard-Campbell Sleep Scale, and the daily follow-up form. Various environmental modifications were made in the ICUs for all patients, and evidence-based nonpharmacological nursing interventions were applied to the patients in both groups during the day and night shifts for 3 days. In addition, the patients in the intervention group were provided with eye masks and earplugs for three nights. RESULTS: The study included a total of 60 patients (30 in the intervention group and 30 in the control group). There was a statistically significant difference in the development of delirium between the intervention and control groups (night of the 2nd day, p = .019; day of the 3rd day p < .001; night of the 3rd day p <= .001). The average total sleep quality score of the intervention group was found to be significantly higher than the control group (p <= .001 for three nights). Staying in the internal medicine ICU affected (odds ratio [OR], 11.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.00-46.66; p = .017) more on the development of delirium than in coronary ICU, being in the age group of 65 and over, having a hearing impairment, coming to ICU from the operating room, and education level had an effect. CONCLUSIONS: The earplugs and eye masks used by the intensive care patients overnight were found to be effective in increasing sleep quality and preventing delirium. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The use of eye masks and earplugs is recommended for ICUs in preventing delirium.
