38840452|t|A Multi-Dimensional Approach to Map Disease Relationships Challenges Classical Disease Views.
38840452|a|The categorization of human diseases is mainly based on the affected organ system and phenotypic characteristics. This is limiting the view to the pathological manifestations, while it neglects mechanistic relationships that are crucial to develop therapeutic strategies. This work aims to advance the understanding of diseases and their relatedness beyond traditional phenotypic views. Hence, the similarity among 502 diseases is mapped using six different data dimensions encompassing molecular, clinical, and pharmacological information retrieved from public sources. Multiple distance measures and multi-view clustering are used to assess the patterns of disease relatedness. The integration of all six dimensions into a consensus map of disease relationships reveals a divergent disease view from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), emphasizing novel insights offered by a multi-view disease map. Disease features such as genes, pathways, and chemicals that are enriched in distinct disease groups are identified. Finally, an evaluation of the top similar diseases of three candidate diseases common in the Western population shows concordance with known epidemiological associations and reveals rare features shared between Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer's disease. A revision of disease relationships holds promise for facilitating the reconstruction of comorbidity patterns, repurposing drugs, and advancing drug discovery in the future.
