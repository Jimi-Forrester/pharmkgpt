36499077|a|Assess the level of mitochondrial DNA depending on the presence of multiple organ failure in patients after heart surgery. The study included 60 patients who underwent surgical treatment of valvular heart disease using cardiopulmonary bypass. Uncomplicated patients were included in the 1st group (n = 30), patients with complications and multiple organ failure (MOF) were included in the 2nd group (n = 30). Serum mtDNA levels were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction with fluorescent dyes. Mitochondrial DNA gene expression did not differ between group before surgery. Immediately after the intervention, cytochrome B gene expression was higher in the group with MOF, and it remained high during entire follow-up period. A similar trend was observed in cytochrome oxidase gene expression. Increased NADH levels of gene expressions during the first postoperative day were noted in both groups, the expression showed tendency to increase on the third postoperative day. mtDNA gene expression in the "MOF present" group remained at a higher level compared with the group without complications. A positive correlation was reveled between the severity of MOF according to SOFA score and the level of mtDNA (r = 0.45; p = 0.028) for the end-point "First day". The ROC analysis showed that mtDNA circulating in plasma (AUC = 0.605) can be a predictor of MOF development. The level of mtDNA significantly increases in case of MOF, irrespective of its cause. (2) The expression of mtDNA genes correlates with the level of MOF severity on the SOFA score.
