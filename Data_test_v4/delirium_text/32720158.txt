32720158|t|Barriers to help-seeking for memory problems in older adults.
32720158|a|PURPOSE: Early detection of age- and disease-related cognitive problems affords patients the opportunities to receive medical treatment, engage in research, and plan for the future. Understanding help-seeking behavior has potential to aid both patients and clinicians. This study was designed to identify predictors of endorsed barriers to memory-related help-seeking as well as medical help-seeking endorsement. METHODS: This cross-sectional correlational study used a convenience sample of 97 older adults. The participants answered anonymous questionnaires about subjective memory, mood, and health and several items designed to investigate help-seeking for memory issues. RESULTS: Persons who endorsed multiple barriers to help-seeking were more likely to also endorse having hearing problems. In addition, participants who reported that they would not talk to a doctor or physician about memory concerns also had significantly worse subjective hearing. CONCLUSION: Hearing loss may be a particular risk for not seeking help for memory problems. Physicians and healthcare agencies can work to design outreach for persons who experience barriers, such as hearing loss and the concomitant outcomes.
