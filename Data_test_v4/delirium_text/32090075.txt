32090075|t|Demographic Factors and Cognitive Function Assessments Associated with Mild Cognitive Impairment Progression for the Elderly.
32090075|a|OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to conduct a 6-year follow-up and acquire a large sample dataset to analyze the most important demographic factors and cognitive function scale variables associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) progression for an elderly cohort (age >= 60 years old). Patients and Methods. We analyzed the subjects who had participated in a survey in 2011 and were successfully contacted in the later survey in 2017. For each subject, the basic demographic information was recorded, including sex, age, education level, marital status, working status, income level, and physical mental illness history. Cognitive assessments were performed using the following scales if possible: (1) the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scale, (2) Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), (3) the clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale, and (4) Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17). RESULTS: The progression outcomes were different between sexes, among age brackets, education degrees, occupations types, and income levels; different progression groups had distinct children numbers (p < 0.001), heights (p < 0.001), heights (p < 0.001), heights (p < 0.001), heights (. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the MCI progression outcomes were associated with sex, age, education degrees, occupations types, income level, children number, height, and weight. MoCA and MMSE scales are supporting tools to predict the progression outcomes, especially combined with the demographic data.
