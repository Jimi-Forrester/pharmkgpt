39071122|t|An investigation of the pigments, antioxidants and free radical scavenging potential of twenty medicinal weeds found in the southern part of Bangladesh.
39071122|a|Despite their overlooked status, weeds are increasingly recognized for their therapeutic value, aligning with historical reliance on plants for medicine and nutrition. This study investigates the medicinal potential of native weed species in Bangladesh, specifically pigments, antioxidants, and free radical scavenging abilities. Twenty different medicinal weed species were collected from the vicinity of Khulna Agricultural University and processed in the Crop Botany Department Laboratory. Pigment levels were determined using spectrophotometer analysis, and phenolics, flavonoids, and DPPH were quantified accordingly. Chlorophyll levels in leaves ranged from 216.70 +- 9.41 to 371.14 +- 28.67 microg g-1 FW, and in stems from 51.98 +- 3.21 to 315.89 +- 17.19 microg g-1 FW. Flavonoid content also varied widely, from 1,624.62 +- 102.03 to 410.00 +- 115.58 mg CE 100 g-1 FW in leaves, and from 653.08 +- 32.42 to 80.00 +- 18.86 mg CE 100 g-1 FW in stems. In case of phenolics content Euphorbia hirta L. displaying the highest total phenolic content in leaves (1,722.33 +- 417.89 mg GAE 100 g-1 FW) and Ruellia tuberosa L. in stems (977.70 +- 145.58 mg GAE 100 g-1 FW). The lowest DPPH 2.505 +- 1.028 mg mL-1was found in Heliotropium indicum L. leaves. Hierarchical clustering links species with pigment, phenolic/flavonoid content, and antioxidant activity. PCA, involving 20 species and seven traits, explained 70.07% variability, with significant PC1 (14.82%) and PC2 (55.25%). Leaves were shown to be superior, and high-performing plants such as E. hirta and H. indicum stood out for their chemical composition and antioxidant activity. Thus, this research emphasizes the value of efficient selection while concentrating on the therapeutic potential of native weed species.
