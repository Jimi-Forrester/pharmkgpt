37072569|t|Risk of esketamine anesthesia on the emergence delirium in preschool children after minor surgery: a prospective observational clinical study.
37072569|a|Emergence delirium (ED) is a common mental complication during recovery from anesthesia. However, studies on the effects of esketamine, an intravenous anesthetic for pediatrics, on ED are still lacking. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a single-dose of esketamine during anesthesia induction on ED after minor surgery in preschool children. A total of 230 children (aged 2-7 years) completed the study. The exposed group (0.46 mg kg-1: average dose of esketamine) was associated with an increased incidence of ED and a higher maximum Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium score than the non-exposed group. The length of post-anesthesia care unit stay was longer in the exposed group than the non-exposed group. In contrast, extubation time, face, legs, activity, cry, and consolability (FLACC) scores, and the proportions of rescue analgesics were comparable between the two groups. Furthermore, five factors, including preoperative anxiety scores, sevoflurane and propofol compared with sevoflurane alone for anesthesia maintenance, dezocine for postoperative analgesia, FLACC scores, and esketamine exposure, were associated with ED. In conclusion, a near-anesthetic single-dose of esketamine for anesthesia induction may increase the incidence of ED in preschool children after minor surgery. The use of esketamine in preschool children for minor surgery should be noticed during clinical practice.
