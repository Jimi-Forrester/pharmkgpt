36859316|t|The efficacy of nalmefene on anesthetic recovery of patients: a study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial.
36859316|a|INTRODUCTION: So far, the recovery quality after general anesthesia is still unsatisfied. Nalmefene is a drug to treat opioid overdose and reverse opioid actions. We aim to investigate the efficacy of nalmefene on optimizing the recovery quality of patients after general anesthesia. METHODS: It is a prospective, placebo-controlled, two-arm parallel groups, multicentre, double-blind, randomized (PPPMDR) clinical trial. The participants (n = 520) will be randomly assigned into two groups. Each patient will receive either: a single dose of nalmefene 0.25 microg/kg in the intervention group, or the same volume of 0.9% NaCl solution in the control group at the end of the surgery. The primary outcome will be the time interval between the end of anaesthesia and recovery endpoints achieved (Aldrete recovery score >= 9) in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). The other variables are the time interval from the end of operation to extubation; Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) score at extubation; the time at Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA) orientation score >= 5; visual analog scale (VAS) score and adverse effects including postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and pruritus in PACU and 24 h postoperatively. ANALYSIS: This trial aims to study whether small dose of nalmefene can shorten the time from the end of surgery to Aldrete score >= 9 and improve opioid-induced side effects.This trial focuses on providing the reliable clinical evidence for satisfactory quality of recovery. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This clinical trial has been approved and supported by the ethics committee of the Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University, School of Medicine (KY2020-150); Shanghai Tongren Hospital (2021-030-01);The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University (2021-032); and The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University(2021-KY-0495-003). Analysis of the study results will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04713358, Registered on September 23, 2021.
