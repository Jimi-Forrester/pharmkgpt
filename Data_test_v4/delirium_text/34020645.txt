34020645|a|BACKGROUND: A few reports have shown that unilateral transverse process-pedicle percutaneous kyphoplasty is a good choice for patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF). However, this issue remains controversial and the related comprehensive research was lacked. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on patients receiving PKP surgery for OVCF. Patients were divided into three groups according to surgical approach. Symptom and radiographical evaluation were performed preoperatively, 1-month postoperatively, 1-year postoperatively and follow-ups. And follow-ups were repeated every year. Visual Analogue Scale Score (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, anterior vertebral height, coronal Cobb angle and sagittal Cobb angle was determined and compared among three groups. RESULTS: Totally 447 patients were included with an average age of 76.6 +- 7.2 years old. UTP showed significantly shorter surgical duration (p < 0.001), lower cement volume (p < 0.001) but higher cement leakage proportion (p = 0.044). No significant statistical difference was found in terms of improvement rates among three groups. Besides, it was notable that the a significantly higher coronal Cobb angle was observed in UTP group, and a about 4 coronal correction was found after UTP PKP. CONCLUSION: UTTP PKP could achieve similar symptoms relief and kyphosis correction as UTP and BTP PKP. However, it had shorter surgical time and less radio exposure than BTP PKP, lower risk of cement leakage and higher proportion of bilaterally cement distribution than UTP PKP. It seemed to be a better choice for patients with OVCF. In addition, we found that UTP PKP was especially fit for OVCF patients with asymmetrical vertebral compression.
