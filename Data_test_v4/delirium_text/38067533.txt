38067533|a|The flower of Syringa pubescens Turcz. is used in Chinese folk medicine and also as a flower tea for healthcare. The effects of five drying methods on the active compound contents, the antioxidant abilities, anti-inflammatory properties and enzyme inhibitory activities were evaluated. The plant materials were treated using shade-drying, microwave-drying, sun-drying, infrared-drying and oven-drying. The seven active compounds were simultaneously determined using an HPLC method. Furthermore, the chemical profile was assessed using scanning electron microscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy. The antioxidant capacities and protective effects on L02 cells induced with hydrogen peroxide were measured. The anti-inflammatory effects on lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW264.7 cells were investigated. The enzyme inhibitory activities were determined against alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase cholinesterases and tyrosinase. The results indicated that drying methods had significant influences on the active compound contents and biological properties. Compared with other samples, the OD samples possessed low IC50 values with 0.118 +- 0.004 mg/mL for DPPH radical, 1.538 +- 0.0972 for hydroxyl radical and 0.886 +- 0.199 mg/mL for superoxide radical, while the SHD samples had stronger reducing power compared with other samples. The SHD samples could be effective against H2O2-induced injury on L02 cells by the promoting of T-AOC, GSH-PX, SOD and CAT activities and the reducing of MDA content compared with other samples. Furthermore, SPF samples, especially the SHD sample, could evidently ameliorate inflammation through the inhibition of IL-6, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha expression. All the studied SPF samples exhibited evidently inhibitory effects on the four enzymes. The IC50 values of inhibitory activity on alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase from SHD sample were 2.516 +- 0.024 and 0.734 +- 0.034 mg/mL, respectively. SD samples had potential inhibitory effects on cholinesterases and tyrosinase with IC50 values of 3.443 +- 0.060 and 1.732 +- 0.058 mg/mL. In consideration of active compound contents and biological activities, it was recommended that SHD and SD be applied for drying SPF at an industrial scale.
