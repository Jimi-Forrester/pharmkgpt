36286106|t|Fluorescent Quinoline-Based Supramolecular Gel for Selective and Ratiometric Sensing Zinc Ion with Multi-Modes.
36286106|a|A gelator 1 containing functional quinoline and Schiff base groups that could form organogels in DMF, DMSO, acetone, ethanol and 1,4-dioxane was designed and synthesized. The self-assembly process of geator 1 was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence emission spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FTIR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and water contact angle. Under non-covalent interactions, gelator 1 self-assembled into microbelts and nanofiber structures with different surface wettability. Weak fluorescence was emitted from the solution and gel state of 1. Interestingly, gelator 1 exhibited good selectivity and sensitivity towards Zn2+ in solution and gel states along with its emission enhancement and change. The emission intensity at 423 nm of solution 1 in 1,4-dioxane was slightly enhanced, and a new emission peak appeared at 545 nm along with its intensity sequentially strengthened in the titration process. The obvious ratiometric detection process was presented with a limit of detection (LOD) of 5.51 muM. The detection mechanism was revealed by a theoretical calculation and NMR titration experiment, which was that Zn2+ induced the transition from trans- to cis- of molecule 1 and further coordinated with 1. This study will introduce a new method for the construction of functional self-assembly gel sensors for the detection of Zn2+.
