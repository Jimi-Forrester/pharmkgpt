35008933|t|A Growing Link between Circadian Rhythms, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Alzheimer's Disease.
35008933|a|Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mounting evidence suggests the emerging important role of circadian rhythms in many diseases. Circadian rhythm disruption is considered to contribute to both T2DM and AD. Here, we review the relationship among circadian rhythm disruption, T2DM and AD, and suggest that the occurrence and progression of T2DM and AD may in part be associated with circadian disruption. Then, we summarize the promising therapeutic strategies targeting circadian dysfunction for T2DM and AD, including pharmacological treatment such as melatonin, orexin, and circadian molecules, as well as non-pharmacological treatments like light therapy, feeding behavior, and exercise.
