34408820|a|BACKGROUND: Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorder (ATPD) (ICD-10) is characterized by the sudden onset of psychotic symptoms and can be triggered by psychological stress. In the ICD-10 definition of ATPD, episodes are short-term, lasting from days to three months, followed by complete remission. OBJECTIVE: This paper reports the case of a 37-year-old woman with stress-induced new-onset psychosis instigated by fear of coronavirus infection. METHOD: Physical examinations, paraclinical testing, and neuroimaging excluded an organic cause of symptoms. A thorough anamnestic investigation excluded the presence of other concomitant stress factors as the trigger of the patient's psychotic symptoms. RESULTS: In response to the COVID-19 lockdown, the patient developed excessive concern about coronavirus infection and, consequently, sleeping difficulties. Symptoms intensified, and she was admitted to the psychiatric ward, presenting with hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, and disorientation. The clinical picture fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of an Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorder. After one week of antipsychotic treatment, her symptoms had remitted, and the patient was discharged. Albeit, four months after treatment discontinuation, her psychotic symptoms re-emerged, and she was readmitted. The patient recovered from symptoms within 48 hours of treatment initiation with antipsychotics. She later reported to have been stressed and anxious while awaiting her coronavirus test result and, following, had doubted the negative result. CONCLUSION: The present case supports previous reports describing the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on population mental health; the psychological stress caused by the fear of infection can lead to the debut of psychotic manifestations and ATPD.
