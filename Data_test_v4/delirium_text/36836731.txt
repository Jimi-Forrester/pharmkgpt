36836731|t|Alzheimer's Disease and Impaired Bone Microarchitecture, Regeneration and Potential Genetic Links.
36836731|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and osteoporosis are both age-related degenerative diseases. Many studies indicate that these two diseases share common pathogenesis mechanisms. In this review, the osteoporotic phenotype of AD mouse models was discussed, and shared mechanisms such as hormonal imbalance, genetic factors, similar signaling pathways and impaired neurotransmitters were identified. Moreover, the review provides recent data associated with these two diseases. Furthermore, potential therapeutic approaches targeting both diseases were discussed. Thus, we proposed that preventing bone loss should be one of the most important treatment goals in patients with AD; treatment targeting brain disorders is also beneficial for osteoporosis.
