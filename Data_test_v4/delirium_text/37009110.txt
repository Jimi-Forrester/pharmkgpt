37009110|a|Background: Evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of schizophrenia suggests that interindividual variation in the stationary striatal functional circuit may be correlated with antipsychotic treatment response. However, little is known about the role of the dynamic striatum-related network in predicting patients' clinical improvement. The spontaneous coactivation pattern (CAP) technique has recently been found to be important for elucidating the non-stationary nature of functional brain networks. Methods: Forty-two drug-naive first-episode schizophrenia patients underwent fMRI and T1W imaging before and after 8 weeks of risperidone monotherapy. The striatum was divided into 3 subregions, including the putamen, pallidum, and caudate. Spontaneous CAPs and CAP states were utilized to measure the dynamic characteristics of brain networks. We used DPARSF and Dynamic Brain Connectome software to analyze each subregion-related CAP and CAP state for each group and then compared the between-group differences in the neural network biomarkers. We used Pearson's correlation analysis to determine the associations between the neuroimaging measurements with between-group differences and the improvement in patients' psychopathological symptoms. Results: In the putamen-related CAPs, patients showed significantly increased intensity in the bilateral thalamus, bilateral supplementary motor areas, bilateral medial, and paracingulate gyrus, left paracentral lobule, left medial superior frontal gyrus, and left anterior cingulate gyrus compared with healthy controls. After treatment, thalamic signals in the putamen-related CAP 1 showed a significant increase, while the signals of the medial and paracingulate gyrus in the putamen-related CAP 3 revealed a significant decrease. The increase in thalamic signal intensity in the putamen-related CAP 1 was significantly and positively correlated with the percentage reduction in PANSS_P. Conclusion: This study is the first to combine striatal CAPs and fMRI to explore treatment response-related biomarkers in the early phase of schizophrenia. Our findings suggest that dynamic changes in CAP states in the putamen-thalamus circuit may be potential biomarkers for predicting patients' variation in the short-term treatment response of positive symptoms.
