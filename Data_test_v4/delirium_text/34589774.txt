34589774|a|Gut-Brain Axis provides a bidirectional communicational route, an imbalance of which can have pathophysiological consequences. Differential gut microbiome studies have become a frontier in autism research, affecting 85% of autistic children. The present study aims to understand how gut microbiota of autism subjects differ from their neurotypical counterparts. This study would help to identify the abundance of bacterial signature species in autism and their associated metabolites. 16S rRNA metagenomic sequence datasets of 30 out of 206 autism subjects were selected from the American Gut Project Archive. First, the taxonomic assignment was inferred by similarity-based methods using the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) toolkit. Next, species abundance was characterized, and a co-occurrence network was built to infer species interaction using measures of diversity. Thirdly, statistical parameters were incorporated to validate the findings. Finally, the identification of metabolites associated with these bacterial signature species connects with biological processes in the host through pathway analysis. Gut microbiome data revealed Akkermansia sp. and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii to be statistically lower in abundance in autistic children than their neurotypical peers with a five and two-fold decrease, respectively. While Prevotella sp. and Sutterella sp. showed a five and a two-fold increase in cases, respectively. The constructed pathway revealed succinate and butyrate as the significant metabolites for the bacterial signature species identified. The present study throws light on the role of mucosa-associated bacterial species: Veillonella sp., Prevotella sp., Akkermansia sp., Sutterella sp., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Lactobacillus sp., which can act as diagnostic criteria for detection of gut dysbiosis in autism.
