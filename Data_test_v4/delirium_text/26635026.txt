26635026|t|NPAS4 Facilitates the Autophagic Clearance of Endogenous Tau in Rat Cortical Neurons.
26635026|a|Tau, a microtubule-binding phosphoprotein, plays a critical role in the stabilisation of microtubules and neuronal function. However, hyperphosphorylated tau is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. The facilitation of tau clearance is now regarded as a valid therapeutic strategy for these neurodegenerative tauopathies. Here, we provide the first demonstration that the over-expression of neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (NPAS4)-induced autophagy and effectively facilitated the clearance of endogenous total and phosphorylated tau in rat primary cortical neurons. Moreover, the activation of autophagy by serum depletion significantly decreased endogenous total and phosphorylated tau levels. Autophagy inhibitors, such as 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and chloroquine (CQ), induced tau aggregation. However, NPAS4 over-expression reversed the aggregation of tau that was induced by the inhibition of autophagy. Interestingly, proteasome inhibition by MG132, had no effect on autophagy, but did reduce tau levels, indicating that NPAS4 may also degrade tau proteins through an unknown proteasome-mediated mechanism. Furthermore, NPAS4 did not alter the activity of two major tau kinases, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5). Taken together, the results indicate that targeting NPAS4 could provide a therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD and other tauopathies.
