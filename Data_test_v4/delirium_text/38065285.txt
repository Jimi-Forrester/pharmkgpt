38065285|t|LRP4-related signalling pathways and their regulatory role in neurological diseases.
38065285|a|The mechanism of action of low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 4 (LRP4) is mediated largely via the Agrin-LRP4-MuSK signalling pathway in the nervous system. LRP4 contributes to the development of synapses in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). It interacts with signalling molecules such as the amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP) and the wingless type protein (Wnt). Its mechanisms of action are complex and mediated via interaction between the pre-synaptic motor neuron and post-synaptic muscle cell in the PNS, which enhances the development of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). LRP4 may function differently in the central nervous system (CNS) than in the PNS, where it regulates ATP and glutamate release via astrocytes. It mayaffect the growth and development of the CNS by controlling the energy metabolism. LRP4 interacts with Agrin to maintain dendrite growth and density in the CNS. The goal of this article is to review the current studies involving relevant LRP4 signaling pathways in the nervous system. The review also discusses the clinical and etiological roles of LRP4 in neurological illnesses, such as myasthenia gravis, Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. In this review, we provide a theoretical foundation for the pathogenesis and therapeutic application of LRP4 in neurologic diseases.
