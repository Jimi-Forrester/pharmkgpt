38379937|a|Background: Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a common neurological disorder contributing to stroke, dementia, and disability. No treatment options exist although clinical trials are ongoing. We aimed to understand what matters to people and families affected by SVD to inform future research. Methods: We thematically analysed unsolicited correspondences from members of the public addressed to members of the Edinburgh SVD Research Group on a variety of subjects related to SVD. We used inductive thematic codes, categorised under concerns, requests, emotions, and contributions, to form a grounded theory that categorised and ranked concerns raised. Results: 101 correspondents expressed 346 concerns between August 2015 and February 2021, mostly via email. 60 correspondents (59.4 %) disclosed a SVD diagnosis, 39 (38.6 %) disclosed a previous stroke or TIA, and 40 (39.6 %) were family of people living with SVD. Primary concerns related to cognitive problems (number of correspondents (n)=43 (42.6 %)), lack of support or information from healthcare services (n = 41 (40.6 %)), prognosis (n = 37 (36.6 %)), sensory disturbances (n = 27 (26.7 %)), functional problems (n = 24, (23.8 %)), impact on daily life (n = 24 (23.8 %)), and causes of SVD (n = 19 (18.8 %)). 57 correspondents (56.4 %) expressed support for research, 43 (42.6 %) expressed an eagerness to understand SVD, 35 (34.7 %) expressed helplessness, and 19 (18.8 %) expressed frustration. Conclusions: Cognitive decline was the main concern for people and families living with SVD who corresponded with the Edinburgh SVD research group. These findings also indicate a need for more accessible services and better information about SVD for patients and families.
