37113370|t|Association of Hip Fracture With the Use of Walking Assistance Devices Post-surgery: A Retrospective Study Comparing Intertrochanteric and Subtrochanteric Hip Fractures.
37113370|a|Background Hip fractures, including intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures, are among the most common types of fractures. The dynamic hip screw (DHS) and the cephalomedullary hip nail (CHN) are the two main techniques used for the fixation of these types of fractures. This study aims to explore the association of the fracture type with the use of walking assistance devices post-surgery, regardless of the fixation technique. Methodology This study is a retrospective study based on the review of de-identified patient data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Patients aged 65 years old or above who underwent fixation procedures for intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric fractures using CHN or DHS techniques were included in this study. Results A total of 8,881 patients were included and divided into the following two groups: 876 (9.9%) patients treated for subtrochanteric fracture, and 8,005 (90.1%) patients treated for intertrochanteric fracture. No statistical significance was detected in the use of mobility aid postoperatively between the two groups. When compared to CHN, DHS was noted to be the most employed fixation technique among patients with intertrochanteric fractures. One main finding was that patients who underwent surgery using DHS for intertrochanteric fractures were more likely to use walking assistance devices postoperatively compared to those with subtrochanteric fractures treated with the same fixation technique. Conclusions Findings suggest that the use of walking assistance devices post-surgery is independent of the type of fracture and potentially dependent on the fixation technique employed. Future studies focused on the difference in the use of walking assistance devices based on fixation techniques for patients with distinctive sub-types of trochanteric fractures are highly encouraged.
