38261107|t|Heterologous expression and fibrillary characterization of the microtubule-binding domain of tau associated with tauopathies.
38261107|a|BACKGROUND: Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are one of the most common pathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease. The NFTs are mainly composed of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated tau. Thus, recombinant tau is urgently required for the study of its fibrillogenesis and its associated cytotoxicity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Heterologous expression, purification, and fibrillation of the microtubule-binding domain (MBD) of tau (tauMBD) were performed. The tauMBD was heterologously expressed in E. coli. Ni-chelating affinity chromatography was then performed to purify the target protein. Thereafter, tauMBD was systematically identified using the SDS-PAGE, western blot and MALDI-TOF MS methods. The aggregation propensity of the tauMBD was explored by both the thioflavin T fluorescence and atomic force microscopy experiments. CONCLUSIONS: The final yield of the recombinant tauMBD was ~ 20 mg L-1. It is shown that TauMBD, in the absence of an inducer, self-assembled into the typical fibrils at a faster rate than wild-type tau. Finally, the in vitro cytotoxicity of tauMBD aggregates was validated using PC12 cells. The heterologously expressed tau in this study can be further used in the investigation of the biophysical and cellular cytotoxic properties of tau.
