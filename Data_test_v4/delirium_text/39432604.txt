39432604|a|BACKGROUND: Perioperative neurocognitive disorder and postoperative depressive symptoms are significant complications after surgery. Studies have indicated that esketamine possesses neuroprotective and antidepressant qualities. METHODS: This trial included 209 patients aged 60 to 86 years undergoing tumor resection who received esketamine (Group E) or not (Group C) during and after surgery. In group E, patients were given an intravenous dose of 0.5 mg/kg of esketamine 10 minutes after induction of general anaesthesia. In addition, esketamine (2 mg/kg) in combination with sufentanil was used for PCIA during 48 hours postoperatively. On the other hand, saline was used as a substitute for esketamine in group C. Cognitive function was evaluated using neuropsychological tests and telephone interview for cognitive status-modified, and symptoms of depression were assessed using Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17. RESULTS: Compared to Group C, patients in Group E exhibited lower rates of depressive symptoms at 3, 7, and 90 days post-surgery (53.9% vs 67.7%, 26.3% vs 47.9%, and 13.3% vs 28.4%). Group E also showed decreased time for Trail Making Test on days 7 and 90. However, there were no significant differences in the incidence of delirium 1 to 5 days post-surgery or cognitive impairment 90 days post-surgery between the 2 groups (12.1% vs 10.9% and 8.4% vs 9.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative low-dose esketamine and postoperative low-dose esketamine combined with sufentanil for patient-controlled intravenous analgesia has been shown to improve postoperative analgesia, alleviate postoperative depressive symptoms, and aid in the recovery of social executive ability. However, this approach did not reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium or postoperative cognitive dysfunction.
