36958211|a|AIM: We analyzed the role and mechanism of dihydromyricetin (DHM) in suppressing inflammatory injury in microglial cells via targeting MD2. METHODS: In vitro, BV2 cells were used as the objects of study to induce inflammatory injury with LPS + ATP, then the cell apoptosis level was identified, inflammatory factor levels were measured by ELISA, TLR4 and MD2 were stained with fluorescence staining, and protein expression was determined using Western-blot (WB) assay. Afterwards, MD2 expression was knocked down n BV2 cells to construct the BV2-MD2-/- cell line, so as to detect the role of DHM on BV2-MD2-/-. Moreover, the binding of DHM to MD2 was analyzed via mall molecule-protein docking and pull-down assays. In-vivo, wild-type (WT) C67BL/6 mice and APP/PS1 (AD) mice were used as the objects of study, which were intervened with DHM to detect the changes in mouse cognition. In addition, the pathological changes of brain tissues were analyzed with H&E staining. In addition, the inflammatory factor and protein levels in brain tissues were also detected. RESULTS: DHM suppressed inflammatory injury in BV2 cells, reduced the cell apoptosis rate and inflammatory factor levels, and suppressed the level of TLR4 and MD2. After MD2 knockdown, DHM was unable to further suppress BV2 cell injury. Results of small molecule-protein docking and pull-down assays suggested that DHM bound to MD2 to suppress the formation of TLR4 complex. In AD mice, DHM improved the cognitive disorder in mice, suppressed inflammatory injury in brain tissues and lowered the expression of TLR4 protein. CONCLUSION: DHM targeted MD2 to suppress the formation of TLR4 protein complex, thereby suppressing inflammatory injury in microglial cells and improving the cognition in AD mice.
