37045611|t|Identification of risk factors for postoperative delirium in patients following intraoral reconstruction with microvascular free flaps: a matched-pair analysis.
37045611|a|Postoperative delirium (POD) following microvascular head and neck reconstruction negatively impacts patient outcomes, and only a few risk factors have been identified. The aim of this study was to identify additional risk factors for POD after intraoral reconstruction with microvascular free flaps. Data from 377 patients who underwent intraoral microvascular free flap reconstruction between 2011 and 2019 were analysed retrospectively. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were compared between 40 patients with POD and 40 patients without POD who were matched for previously identified risk factors (i.e., sex, age, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, preoperative arterial hypertension, tracheotomy, operation time, and blood transfusion). A multivariable regression analysis was then performed to identify risk factors associated with POD. POD occurred in 50 (13.3%) of the 377 cases studied; the median time of onset was postoperative day 2. Excessive preoperative alcohol consumption (odds ratio 9.22, 95% confidence interval 1.09-77.97; P = 0.041) and postoperative transplant revision (odds ratio 25.72, 95% confidence interval 1.26-525.43; P = 0.035) were identified as risk factors for POD. The identification of patients at high risk of POD based on these two risk factors may allow early adjustment of diagnostic and therapeutic modalities to improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.
