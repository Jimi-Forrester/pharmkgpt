34727939|a|BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis is a destructive central nervous system (CNS) infection with acute and long-term neurological disorders. Previous studies suggest that p75NTR signaling influences cell survival, apoptosis, and proliferation in brain-injured conditions. However, the role of p75NTR signaling in regulating pneumococcal meningitis (PM)-induced neuroinflammation and altered neurogenesis remains largely to be elucidated. METHODS: p75NTR signaling activation in the pathological process of PM was assessed. During acute PM, a small-molecule p75NTR modulator LM11A-31 or vehicle was intranasally administered for 3 days prior to S. pneumoniae exposure. At 24 h post-infection, clinical severity, histopathology, astrocytes/microglia activation, neuronal apoptosis and necrosis, inflammation-related transcription factors and proinflammatory cytokines/mediators were evaluated. Additionally, p75NTR was knocked down by the adenovirus-mediated short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) to ascertain the role of p75NTR in PM. During long-term PM, the intranasal administration of LM11A-31 or vehicle was continued for 7 days after successfully establishing the PM model. Dynamic changes in inflammation and hippocampal neurogenesis were assessed. RESULTS: Our results revealed that both 24 h (acute) and 7, 14, 28 day (long-term) groups of infected rats showed increased p75NTR expression in the brain. During acute PM, modulation of p75NTR through pretreatment of PM model with LM11A-31 significantly alleviated S. pneumoniae-induced clinical severity, histopathological injury and the activation of astrocytes and microglia. LM11A-31 pretreatment also significantly ameliorated neuronal apoptosis and necrosis. Moreover, we found that blocking p75NTR with LM11A-31 decreased the expression of inflammation-related transcription factors (NF-kappaBp65, C/EBPbeta) and proinflammatory cytokines/mediators (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and iNOS). Furthermore, p75NTR knockdown induced significant changes in histopathology and inflammation-related transcription factors expression. Importantly, long-term LM11A-31 treatment accelerated the resolution of PM-induced inflammation and significantly improved hippocampal neurogenesis. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the p75NTR signaling plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of PM. Targeting p75NTR has beneficial effects on PM rats by alleviating neuroinflammation and promoting hippocampal neurogenesis. Thus, the p75NTR signaling may be a potential therapeutic target to improve the outcome of PM.
