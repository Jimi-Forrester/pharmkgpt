15755621|a|The pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) shows a significant correlation between beta-amyloid peptide (betaAP) deposition and the clinical severity of dementia. The ability of site-directed antibodies towards the N-terminal region of beta-amyloid peptide to suppress in vitro formation of toxic beta-amyloid serves as a factual basis for in vivo investigations. We localized the epitope of these anti-aggregating antibodies, and injection of phage displaying this epitope induced antibodies against the whole anti-beta-amyloid peptide. In Alzheimer's diseased transgenic mice, these antibodies are delivered from the periphery to the CNS preventing beta-amyloid formation and/or dissolving such aggregates. Performance of such antigens opens up possibilities for development of an efficient, long-lasting immunization procedure for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
