33562660|t|The Role of HSPB8, a Component of the Chaperone-Assisted Selective Autophagy Machinery, in Cancer.
33562660|a|The cellular response to cancer-induced stress is one of the major aspects regulating cancer development and progression. The Heat Shock Protein B8 (HSPB8) is a small chaperone involved in chaperone-assisted selective autophagy (CASA). CASA promotes the selective degradation of proteins to counteract cell stress such as tumor-induced stress. HSPB8 is also involved in (i) the cell division machinery regulating chromosome segregation and cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase and (ii) inflammation regulating dendritic cell maturation and cytokine production. HSPB8 expression and role are tumor-specific, showing a dual and opposite role. Interestingly, HSPB8 may be involved in the acquisition of chemoresistance to drugs. Despite the fact the mechanisms of HSPB8-mediated CASA activation in tumors need further studies, HSPB8 could represent an important factor in cancer induction and progression and it may be a potential target for anticancer treatment in specific types of cancer. In this review, we will discuss the molecular mechanism underlying HSPB8 roles in normal and cancer conditions. The basic mechanisms involved in anti- and pro-tumoral activities of HSPB8 are deeply discussed together with the pathways that modulate HSPB8 expression, in order to outline molecules with a beneficial effect for cancer cell growth, migration, and death.
