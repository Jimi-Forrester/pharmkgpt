35377826|t|Burden of rotavirus gastroenteritis on caregivers: Findings from a systematic literature review.
35377826|a|Rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) poses a substantial clinical, economic, and humanistic burden globally. While predominantly affecting children, the burden of RVGE extends to caregivers and families but is often overlooked. In this systematic literature review, we aim to identify and summarize methods and estimates of RVGE associated caregiver burden. Of the 190 publications identified, 10 were included. Four studies used the EuroQoL-5 Dimension instrument and its associated Visual Analog Scale and reported a decrease in caregiver health related quality of life when a child contracted RVGE, with the greatest reduction observed in caregivers of hospitalized children. Other studies utilized surveys to assess impacts on caregivers' quality of life. Caregivers of RVGE patients experienced multiple impacts beyond financial costs related to productivity and absenteeism, with disruptions to daily routines and anxiety/stress frequently reported. This review highlights the importance of including RVGE caregiver burden when evaluating interventions, such as vaccination, to decrease RVGE burden.
