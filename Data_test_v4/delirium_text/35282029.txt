35282029|a|Background: During treatment of acute respiratory failure (ARF) in children, sedation can reduce pain, improve tolerance, and reduce the incidence of adverse events, so selecting an appropriate sedation strategy is very important for improving prognosis and quality of life. Both dexmedetomidine and propofol have good sedative effects, so we investigated the application of these drugs in critically ill children with ARF by literature search and meta-analysis. Methods: We searched Embase, The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Ovid, Clinicaltrials.org, and Google Scholar for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) preferentially but not exclusively, and used RevMan 5.4 to analyze the screened literature. Results: Seven studies were included in the quantitative meta-analysis, with a total of 1,188 patients. There was no significant difference in the effect of dexmedetomidine and propofol on the duration of tracheal intubation in children with ARF [mean difference (MD) =-0.05; 95% confidence interval (CI): (-0.42, 0.32); Z=0.26; P=0.79], but dexmedetomidine sedation could reduce the intensive care unit (ICU) stay in children with ARF [MD =-0.62; 95% CI: (-1.08, -0.16); Z=2.65; P=0.008], and shorten the total hospital stay [MD =-1.94; 95% CI: (-2.63, -1.25); Z=5.48; P<0.00001]. There was no significant effect on mortality between the two groups [odds ratio (OR) =0.48; 95% CI: (0.19, 1.25); Z=1.50; P=0.13]. The incidence rate of bradycardia with dexmedetomidine sedation was higher than with propofol [OR =12.30; 95% CI: (2.28, 66.47); Z=2.92; P=0.004], and the incidence of hypotension was also higher [OR =6.99, 95% CI: (1.22, 39.86); Z=2.19; P=0.03]. Discussion: Compared with propofol, dexmedetomidine can significantly reduce the ICU stay and hospital stay. However, bradycardia and hypotension may occur during the use of dexmedetomidine, which requires close attention and timely intervention.
