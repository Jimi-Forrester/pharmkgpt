34024109|t|Discovery of Novel Tacrine-Pyrimidone Hybrids as Potent Dual AChE/GSK-3 Inhibitors for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
34024109|a|Based on a multitarget strategy, a series of novel tacrine-pyrimidone hybrids were identified for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Biological evaluation results demonstrated that these hybrids exhibited significant inhibitory activities toward acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). The optimal compound 27g possessed excellent dual AChE/GSK-3 inhibition both in terms of potency and equilibrium (AChE: IC50 = 51.1 nM; GSK-3beta: IC50 = 89.3 nM) and displayed significant amelioration on cognitive deficits in scopolamine-induced amnesia mice and efficient reduction against phosphorylation of tau protein on Ser-199 and Ser-396 sites in glyceraldehyde (GA)-stimulated differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, compound 27g exhibited eligible pharmacokinetic properties, good kinase selectivity, and moderate neuroprotection against GA-induced reduction in cell viability and neurite damage in SH-SY5Y-derived neurons. The multifunctional profiles of compound 27g suggest that it deserves further investigation as a promising lead for the prospective treatment of AD.
