36706615|t|Clonal hematopoiesis due to mosaic chromosomal alterations: Impact on disease risk and mortality.
36706615|a|Mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) are the clonal expansion of large somatically acquired structural chromosomal changes present on the autosomes and sex chromosomes. Most studies of mCAs use existing genotype array intensity data from large populations to investigate potential risk factors and disease outcomes associated with mCAs. In this review, we perform a comprehensive examination of existing evidence for mCA disease and mortality associations and provide a framework for interpreting these associations in the context of important biases specific to mCA studies. Our goal is to motivate well-designed mCA studies to assist in unlocking the potential of mCAs to improve understanding of the effects of ageing and accelerate translational applications for improving public health.
