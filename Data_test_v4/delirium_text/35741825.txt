35741825|t|Genetic and Epigenetic Association of Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor-1alpha with Glycosylation in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
35741825|a|Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex trauma-related disorder, the etiology and underlying molecular mechanisms of which are still unclear and probably involve different (epi)genetic and environmental factors. Protein N-glycosylation is a common post-translational modification that has been associated with several pathophysiological states, including inflammation and PTSD. Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF1A) is a transcriptional regulator of many genes involved in the inflammatory processes, and it has been identified as master regulator of plasma protein glycosylation. The aim of this study was to determine the association between N-glycan levels in plasma and immunoglobulin G, methylation at four CpG positions in the HNF1A gene, HNF1A antisense RNA 1 (HNF1A-AS1), rs7953249 and HNF1A rs735396 polymorphisms in a total of 555 PTSD and control subjects. We found significant association of rs7953249 and rs735396 polymorphisms, as well as HNF1A gene methylation at the CpG3 site, with highly branched, galactosylated and sialyated plasma N-glycans, mostly in patients with PTSD. HNF1A-AS1 rs7953249 polymorphism was also associated with PTSD; however, none of the polymorphisms were associated with HNF1A gene methylation. These results indicate a possible regulatory role of the investigated HNF1A polymorphisms with respect to the abundance of complex plasma N-glycans previously associated with proinflammatory response, which could contribute to the clinical manifestation of PTSD and its comorbidities.
