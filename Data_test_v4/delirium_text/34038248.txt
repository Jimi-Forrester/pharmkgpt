34038248|t|A Survey of Nurses' Perspectives on Delirium Screening in Older Adult Medical Inpatients With Limited English Proficiency.
34038248|a|The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is commonly used to detect delirium but its utility in patients with limited English proficiency (LEP) is not well-established. In the current study, internal medicine nurses at an acute care hospital in Canada were surveyed on the use of the CAM in older adults with LEP. Nurses' perspectives were explored with a focus on barriers to administration. Fifty participants were enrolled (response rate = 47.6%). Twenty-eight (56%) participants stated they could not confidently and accurately assess delirium in patients with LEP. Twenty-nine (58%) participants believed the CAM is not an effective delirium screening tool in the LEP population. Barriers to screening included: challenges with interpretation services, dependence on family members, and fear that the assessment itself may worsen confusion. Our study is the first to describe specific barriers to administering the CAM in patients with LEP. Strategies are required to address these barriers and optimize delirium screening for patients with LEP. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 47(4), 29-34.].
