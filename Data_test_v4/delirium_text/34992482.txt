34992482|t|A Novel Application of Ketamine for Improving Perioperative Sleep Disturbances.
34992482|a|Perioperative sleep disturbances are commonly observed before, during, and after surgery and can be caused by several factors, such as preoperative negative moods, general anesthetics, surgery trauma, and pain. Over the past decade, the fast-acting antidepressant effects of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine represent one of the most attractive discoveries in the field of psychiatry, such as antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. It is also widely used as a short-acting anesthetic and analgesic. Recent research has revealed new possible applications for ketamine, such as for perioperative sleep disorders and circadian rhythm disorders. Here, we summarize the risk factors for perioperative sleep disturbances, outcomes of perioperative sleep disturbances, and mechanism of action of ketamine in improving perioperative sleep quality.
