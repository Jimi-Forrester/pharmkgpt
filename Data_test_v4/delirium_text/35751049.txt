35751049|a|BACKGROUND: Structural ophthalmologic findings have been reported in patients with beta-thalassemia due to chronic anemia, iron overload, and iron chelation therapy toxicity in few previous studies. We aimed to investigate structural ocular findings and their relationship with hematological parameters in patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, from January 2018 to January 2019, 39 patients with TDT over the age of 18 participated. Multicolor fundus imaging, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and blue light fundus autofluorescence imaging were performed for all patients and 27 age- and sex-matched controls. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 28.6 +- 6.2 years. The central macular thickness and macular thicknesses in all quadrants were significantly thinner in patients than controls (P<0.05). None of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) measurements were significantly different between TDT patients and controls. There was a significantly negative correlation between hemoglobin with central macula thickness (r=-0.439, P=0.005). All measurements of macular subfield thickness were insignificantly thinner in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) compared to the non-DM subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Macular thickness was significantly thinner in central macula and entire quadrants in TDT patients compared to healthy individuals; however, all RNFL measurement thicknesses were comparable between the two groups. Close monitoring of TDT patients by periodic ophthalmologic examinations with more focus on diabetic patients, patients with severe anemia and iron overload should be warranted.
