27642574|t|Comparison of the Effects of Dexmedetomidine and Remifentanil on Cognition State After Cataract Surgery.
27642574|a|BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine is a potent and highly specific alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist that induces sedative and analgesic effects over a short-term period. As a result of these benefits, dexmedetomidine may be a better alternative than other available drugs for keeping the patient's cognition state in an acceptable condition after outpatient ophthalmic surgeries. OBJECTIVES: This randomized study was conducted to compare the sedative effects of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil on the cognitive state of patients who have undergone cataract surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 100 patients who were candidates for cataract surgery under local anesthesia received either dexmedetomidine (50 patients; D group) or remifentanil (50 patients; R group) in a double-blind, randomized study. The baseline cardiovascular status and mini mental state examination (MMSE) score for each patient were recorded. As a loading dose, dexmedetomidine (0.5 microg/kg) and remifentanil (0.1 microg/kg) were infused at 10 minutes and 5 minutes before topical anesthesia, respectively. Subsequently, the maintenance dose was administered at 0.2 microg/kg/hour and 0.05 microg/kg/minutes in the D and R groups, respectively. The surgical procedure was begun when the bispectral index (BIS) reached 70 - 80. MMSE test was done at a postanesthetic care unit (PACU) 120 minutes after the discontinuation of the drug. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the MMSE scores of the two groups before surgery (P = 0.6), but the MMSE test conducted at the PACU revealed significantly better cognitive outcomes in the D group than in the R group in patients younger and older than 65 years (P = 0.03 and P = 0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that dexmedetomidine may be a suitable agent for sedation in cataract surgery because it results in a more favorable postoperative cognitive status than remifentanil. Likewise, dexmedetomidine had no significant adverse effects on cardiovascular or respiratory systems.
