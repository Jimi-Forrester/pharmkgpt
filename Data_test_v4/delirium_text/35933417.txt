35933417|t|Rationale and study protocol for We-PAP: a randomized pilot/feasibility trial of a couples-based intervention to promote PAP adherence and sleep health compared to an educational control.
35933417|a|BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a serious health condition that affects approximately 30-50% of older adults and contributes to risk for cardiometabolic disorders and dementia. Despite the well-documented role of partners in treatment seeking and adherence to positive airway pressure (PAP), treatments for OSA have nearly exclusively focused on the patient and current treatments for OSA do not address co-existing sleep problems such as insomnia that are prevalent in both patients with OSA and their partners. Therefore, the goal of this study is to develop and test a novel couples-based sleep health intervention to promote adherence to PAP and improve sleep health of the couple. METHODS: We are conducting a two-arm, parallel group, single blind, randomized controlled pilot/feasibility trial to compare our novel couples-based sleep health intervention (We-PAP) to an information control group (IC). We-PAP is based on a transdiagnostic model and uses a dyadic approach including increasing effective partner support, communication skills, and couple-level goal-setting. We-PAP involves 3 sessions and delivered via telehealth in weekly sessions. The IC includes standardized patient educational materials. Both groups receive the usual follow-up with their medical team. The study involves assessments at pre-treatment, post-intervention (approximately 1 month after starting PAP and completing We-PAP sessions or IC) and 3 months after starting PAP. Our main outcomes are feasibility and acceptability ratings. Secondary outcomes include comparing We-PAP to IC for PAP adherence, sleep quality (self-report and objective) and cognitive measures. DISCUSSION: We-PAP is the first couples-based transdiagnostic sleep health intervention for patients with OSA and their partners. Results of this study will be used to inform the design of a subsequent fully powered clinical trial. If successful, this intervention could significantly advance current clinical practice in the treatment of OSA and sleep health more comprehensively in older adults. Moreover, this intervention may be useful for improving sleep in other aging populations with multiple sleep and other health problems, including patients with chronic illnesses or those at risk for Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.
