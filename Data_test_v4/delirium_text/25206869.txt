25206869|t|APOE and APOC1 gene polymorphisms are associated with cognitive impairment progression in Chinese patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
25206869|a|Current evidence shows that apolipoprotein E (APOE), apolipoprotein CI (APOC1) and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) variations are related to late-onset Alzheimer's disease. However, it remains unclear if genetic polymorphisms in these genes are associated with cognitive decline in late-onset Alzheimer's disease patients. We performed a 30-month longitudinal cohort study to investigate the relationship between Alzheimer's disease and APOE, APOC1, and LRP. In this study, 78 Chinese Han patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease were recruited form Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in China. APOE, APOC1, and LRP genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms. The Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale were used to assess patients' cognitive function. After a 30-month follow-up period, we found a significant reduction in Mini-Mental State Examination total score, a higher proportion of patients fulfilling cognitive impairment progression criteria, and a higher proportion of APOC1 H2 carriers in APOE epsilon4 carriers compared with non-carriers. In addition, the APOE epsilon4 allele frequency was significantly higher in the cognitive impairment progression group compared with the non-cognitive impairment progression group. In conclusion, APOE epsilon4 plays an important role in augmenting cognitive decline, and APOC1 H2 may act synergistically with APOE epsilon4 in increasing the risk of cognitive decline in Chinese patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
