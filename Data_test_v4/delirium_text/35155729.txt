35155729|a|INTRODUCTION: We sought to examine a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based marker of neurodegeneration from the AT(N) (amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration) framework among a multi-ethnic, community-dwelling cohort. METHODS: Community-dwelling Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic White adults and elders were recruited. All participants underwent comprehensive assessments including an interview, functional exam, clinical labs, informant interview, neuropsychological testing and 3T MRI of the brain. A neurodegeneration MRI meta-region of interest (ROI) biomarker for the AT(N) framework was calculated. RESULTS: Data were examined from n = 1305 participants. Mexican Americans experienced N at significantly younger ages. The N biomarker was significantly associated with cognitive outcomes. N was significantly impacted by cardiovascular factors (e.g., total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein) among non-Hispanic Whites whereas diabetes (glucose, HbA1c, duration of diabetes) and sociocultural (household income, acculturation) factors were strongly associated with N among Mexican Americans. DISCUSSION: The prevalence, progression, timing, and sequence of the AT(N) biomarkers must be examined across diverse populations.
