37767150|a|Key Clinical Message: Remimazolam is a new benzodiazepine sedative and has the characteristic of causing minimal effects on circulation. This case indicates that it can be considered as an option for anesthesia management of patients with decreased cardiac function. Abstract: Some patients who undergo cardiac surgery have reduced cardiac function, which can often make anesthesia management difficult owing to severe hypotension at the time of anesthesia induction. Therefore, it is important to select drugs that cause minimal circulatory depression. On the other hand, in 2020, the use of remimazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine sedative, was approved in Japan, and reports of its use in various patients have been increasing. This drug has the characteristic of causing minimal effects on circulation. We here report the safe use of remimazolam in the anesthesia management of a patient with decreased cardiac function who was diagnosed as having angina pectoris. The patient was a 73-year-old man scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Remimazolam was used for sedation purposes during anesthesia induction. During surgery, there were no significant hemodynamic changes and the patient remained in stable cardiovascular condition. Our present case indicates that remimazolam can be considered as an option for anesthesia management in CABG for patients with decreased cardiac function.
