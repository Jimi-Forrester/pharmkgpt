36877358|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is closely related to type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study investigated the impact of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on diabetes-induced disturbances in AD-related factors (including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta), and tau protein) in the hippocampus, with the main focus on adiponectin signaling.In total, 28 male Wistar rats at the age of 8 weeks were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 7 in each group): control (Con), type 2 diabetes (T2D), HIIT (Ex), and type 2 diabetes + HIIT (T2D + Ex). T2D was induced by a high-fat diet plus a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ). Rats in Ex and T2D + Ex groups performed 8 weeks of HIIT (running at 8-95% of Vmax, 4-10 intervals). Insulin and adiponectin levels in serum and hippocampus were measured along with hippocampal expression of insulin and adiponectin receptors, phosphorylated AMPK, dephosphorylated GSK3beta, and phosphorylated tau. Homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance beta (HOMA-beta), and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were calculated to assess insulin resistance and sensitivity. T2D decreased insulin and adiponectin levels in serum and hippocampus, as well as the hippocampal levels of insulin and adiponectin receptors and AMPK, but increased GSK3beta and tau in the hippocampus. HIIT reversed diabetes-induced impairments and consequently decreased tau accumulation in the hippocampus of diabetic rats. HOMA-IR, HOMA-beta, and QUICKI were improved in Ex and T2D + Ex groups. Overall, our results confirmed that T2D has undesirable effects on the levels of some Alzheimer's-related factors in the hippocampus, and HIIT could ameliorate these impairments in the hippocampus.
