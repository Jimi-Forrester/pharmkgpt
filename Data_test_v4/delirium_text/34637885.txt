34637885|a|In our efforts to find potential agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in naturally occurring compounds, a systematic investigation for the active constituents of Flemingia philippinensis was carried out. Four new prenylated isoflavones, philippinone A-D (1-4), together with six known analogues (5-10), were obtained from the roots of Flemingia philippinensis. Their structures were established through extensive physical and spectroscopic data analysis. All the isolates were evaluated for their inhibitory effect of self-induced Abeta aggregation among which compound 5 showed significant Abeta aggregation inhibitory ability with the inhibitory rate of 70.56%. The results of molecular docking experiment for compounds 1 and 6 corresponded to that of the thioflavin-T assay. Moreover, the results further clarified the effects of different substituent group of tested compounds on the Abeta aggregation inhibition. A preliminary structure-activity relationship is further discussed. Our results suggested that the isoflavonoids may mitigate the progression of AD and compounds 2 and 5 may be a candidate in the treatment of AD.
