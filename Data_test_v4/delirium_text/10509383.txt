10509383|a|1. Full-length form of human presenilin 1 (PS1) is processed and an N-terminal fragment (28 KD) and C-terminal fragment (19 KD) are generated. To elucidate the possible role of presenilin mutations in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the authors analyze the effects of AD-linked mutations on PS1 processing in cultured cells. 2. Complementary DNAs encoding genes for human PS1 harboring twenty-nine missense mutations linked with familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) were introduced into PC12 cells. Human PS1 exogenously expressed in the cells was detected by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody that recognized the N-terminal region of human PS1. The amounts of full-length form (48 KD) and N-terminal fragment (28 KD) of PS1 was quantified by densitometrical analysis. 3. The ratio of the N-terminal fragment to total PS1 was reduced by twenty-nine mutations. The specific effects on PS1 processing varied according to mutation. 4. These results suggest that AD-linked missense mutations of PS1 are involved in neurodegeneration via inhibition of PS1 processing.
