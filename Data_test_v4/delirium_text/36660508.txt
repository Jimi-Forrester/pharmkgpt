36660508|t|When Influenza, Bacterial Pneumonia, and COVID-19 Co-exist.
36660508|a|In the United States, influenza virus and bacterial pneumonia are known to be the leading causes of hospitalization in the winter season. Although healthcare workers are knowledgeable about the management of these co-infections, with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic that occurred in 2019, a significant change has occurred. The symptoms and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are similar to that of influenza virus and bacterial pneumonia which can present a unique challenge for healthcare workers. Many reports are available for influenza virus and bacterial pneumonia but none about influenza, bacterial pneumonia, and COVID-19 co-infection. Here, we present the case of a patient who was admitted with COVID-19, influenza, and bacterial pneumonia co-infection, along with his clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment plan, and outcomes.
