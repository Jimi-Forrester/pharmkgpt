32403417|a|Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) therapy offers great promise in hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury. However, the poor survival of implanted NPCs in the HI host environment limits their therapeutic effects. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a pleiotropic cytokine that is induced in response to a variety of pathological processes including inflammation and immunity. On the other hand, TNF-alpha has protective effects on cell apoptosis and death and affects the differentiation, proliferation, and survival of neural stem/progenitor cells in the brain. The present study investigated whether TNF-alpha pretreatment on human NPCs (hNPCs) enhances the effectiveness of cell transplantation therapy under ischemic brain. Fetal brain tissue-derived hNPCs were pretreated with TNF-alpha before being used in vitro experiments or transplantation. TNF-alpha significantly increased expression of cIAP2, and the use of short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of cIAP2 demonstrated that cIAP2 protected hNPCs against HI-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, pretreatment of hNPCs with TNF-alpha mediated neuroprotection by altering microglia polarization via increased expression of CX3CL1 and by enhancing expression of neurotrophic factors. Furthermore, transplantation of TNF-alpha-treated hNPCs reduced infarct volume and improved neurological functions in comparison with non-pretreated hNPCs or vehicle. These findings show that TNF-alpha pretreatment, which protects hNPCs from HI-injured brain-induced apoptosis and increases neuroprotection, is a simple and safe approach to improve the survival of transplanted hNPCs and the therapeutic efficacy of hNPCs in HI brain injury.
