39041685|t|Managing Postoperative Delirium in Patients Receiving Head and Neck Surgery: An Educational Overview.
39041685|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium in patients receiving head and neck surgery is a pressing concern, affecting morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. With an aging population and about 65,000 new head and neck cancer diagnoses per year in the United States, surgery remains a primary treatment modality, regardless of age. OBJECTIVES: This article offers an educational overview of postoperative delirium management in patients receiving head and neck surgery, summarizing incidence, etiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic tests, treatment, complications, and risk factors. METHODS: A narrative literature review of articles published in the past 10 years was conducted to consolidate information on postoperative delirium in patients receiving head and neck surgery. FINDINGS: Postoperative delirium is characterized by acute, fluctuating cognitive dysfunction within 30 days after surgery, with incidence ranging from 11% to 26%. Pathophysiology is multifactorial, and pharmacologic options are limited because of side effects and varying effectiveness. Nonpharmacologic management focuses on addressing underlying causes and early mobilization. Reducing postoperative delirium risk necessitates interprofessional, systemwide collaboration.
