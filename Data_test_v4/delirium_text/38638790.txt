38638790|t|The Incidence of Residual Neuromuscular Block in Pediatrics: A Prospective, Pragmatic, Multi-institutional Cohort Study.
38638790|a|Introduction Residual neuromuscular block, defined as a quantitatively measured train-of-four ratio (TOFr) <0.9, is common postoperatively. Using a pragmatic trial design, we hypothesized that qualitative and/or clinical assessment of neuromuscular block would inadequately detect residual block following antagonism with neostigmine or sugammadex. Method After IRB approval and written informed consent, 74 children (aged 2-17 years), undergoing elective surgery and receiving rocuronium, were prospectively enrolled in the study at Children's Hospital Colorado and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. Routine clinical practice at both institutions consisted of clinical signs and/or qualitative assessment with peripheral nerve stimulators. Children at the Colorado hospital routinely received sugammadex antagonism; whereas children at the Atlanta hospital received neostigmine. Residual neuromuscular block was assessed postoperatively using quantitative electromyography. If TOFr was <0.9, patients received sugammadex until TOFr >=0.9. Result Qualitative and clinical assessment failed to detect residual block in 29.7% of patients in the neostigmine reversal cohort (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 29.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.7 to 5,559.5, p-value = 0.002). No residual block was detected in the sugammadex reversal cohort. A correlation between increasing patient weight and incidence of postoperative residual block was observed in the neostigmine cohort (aOR 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.10, p-value = 0.002). Conclusion Qualitative and/or clinical assessment of neuromuscular block inadequately detects residual block following neostigmine antagonism.
