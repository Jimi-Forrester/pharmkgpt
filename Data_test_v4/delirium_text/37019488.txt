37019488|t|Usability of exergames as a home-based balance training tool for older adults: protocol for a systematic review.
37019488|a|INTRODUCTION: Exergames are used in the clinical practice of geriatric rehabilitation to increase physical activity levels and motivate players/patients. Their use in the home environment makes it possible to perform fun, engaging and interactive training with a large number of repetitions, thereby reducing the negative repercussions of postural imbalance in older adults. The aim of this systematic review is to collate and analyse evidence on the usability of exergames as a tool for home-based balance training for older adults. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will include randomised controlled trials involving healthy older adults (aged 60 years or older) who are described as having impaired static or dynamic balance using any subjective or objective assessment criteria. We will search Web of Science, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, ScienceDirect and the Cochrane Library from database inception to December 2022. CLINICALTRIALS: gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ReBEC will be searched for ongoing or unpublished trials. Two independent reviewers will screen the studies and extract the data. The findings will be presented in the text and tables, and if possible, relevant meta-analyses will be performed. The risk of bias and the quality of evidence will be assessed based on the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation, respectively. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was not required because of the nature of this study. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and through clinical rehabilitation networks. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42022343290.
