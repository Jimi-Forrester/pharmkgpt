36514377|t|Metabolomics of Extracellular Vesicles: A Future Promise of Multiple Clinical Applications.
36514377|a|Extracellular vesicles (EVs) can contain DNA, RNA, proteins and metabolic molecules from primary origins; they are coated with a phospholipid bilayer membrane and released by cells into the extracellular matrix. EVs can be obtained from various body liquids, including the blood, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine. As has been proved, EVs-mediated transfer of biologically active molecules is crucial for various physiological and pathological processes. Extensive investigations have already begun to explore the diagnosis and prognosis potentials for EVs. Furthermore, research has continued to recognize the critical role of nucleic acids and proteins in EVs. However, our understanding of the comprehensive effects of metabolites in these nanoparticles is currently limited and in its infancy. Therefore, we have attempted to summarize the recent research into the metabolomics of EVs in relation to potential clinical applications and discuss the problems and challenges that have occurred, to provide more guidance for the future development in this field.
