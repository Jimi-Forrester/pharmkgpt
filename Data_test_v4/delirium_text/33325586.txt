33325586|t|Recognition and Removal of Amyloid-beta by a Heteromultivalent Macrocyclic Coassembly: A Potential Strategy for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
33325586|a|The imbalance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) production and clearance causes aggregation of Abeta1-42 monomers to form fibrils and amyloid plaques, which is an indispensable process in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and eventually leads to pathological changes and cognitive impairment. Consequently, Abeta1-42 is the most important target for the treatment of AD. However, developing a single treatment method that can recognize Abeta1-42 , inhibit Abeta1-42 fibrillation, eliminate amyloid plaques, improve cognitive impairments, and alleviate AD-like pathology is challenging. Here, a coassembly composed of cyclodextrin (CD) and calixarene (CA) is designed, and it is used as an anti-Abeta therapy agent. The CD-CA coassembly is based on the previously reported heteromultivalent recognition strategy and is able to successfully eliminate amyloid plaques and degrade Abeta1-42 monomers in 5xFAD mice. More importantly, the coassembly improves recognition and spatial cognition deficits, and synaptic plasticity impairment in the 5xFAD mice. In addition, the coassembly ameliorates AD-like pathology including prevention of neuronal apoptosis and oxidant stress, and alteration of M1/M2 microglial polarization states. This supramolecular approach makes full use of both molecular recognition and self-assembly of macrocyclic amphiphiles, and is a promising novel strategy for AD treatment.
