37337792|t|Art2 mediates selective endocytosis of methionine transporters during adaptation to sphingolipid depletion.
37337792|a|Accumulating evidence in several model organisms indicates that reduced sphingolipid biosynthesis promotes longevity, although underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In yeast, sphingolipid depletion induces a state resembling amino acid restriction, which we hypothesized may be due to altered stability of amino acid transporters at the plasma membrane. To test this, we measured surface abundance for a diverse panel of membrane proteins in the presence of myriocin, a sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibitor. Unexpectedly, we found that surface levels of most proteins examined were either unaffected or increased during myriocin treatment, consistent with an observed decrease in bulk endocytosis. In contrast, sphingolipid depletion triggered selective endocytosis of the methionine transporter Mup1. Unlike methionine-induced Mup1 endocytosis, myriocin triggers Mup1 endocytosis that requires the Rsp5 adaptor Art2, C-terminal lysine residues, and the formation of K63-linked ubiquitin polymers. These findings reveal cellular adaptation to sphingolipid depletion by ubiquitin-mediated remodeling of nutrient transporter composition at the cell surface.
