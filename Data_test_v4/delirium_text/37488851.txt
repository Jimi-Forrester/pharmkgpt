37488851|a|The current therapeutic drugs for Alzheimer's disease only improve symptoms, they do not delay disease progression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new effective drugs. The underlying pathogenic factors of Alzheimer's disease are not clear, but neuroinflammation can link various hypotheses of Alzheimer's disease; hence, targeting neuroinflammation may be a new hope for Alzheimer's disease treatment. Inhibiting inflammation can restore neuronal function, promote neuroregeneration, reduce the pathological burden of Alzheimer's disease, and improve or even reverse symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. This review focuses on the relationship between inflammation and various pathological hypotheses of Alzheimer's disease; reports the mechanisms and characteristics of small-molecule drugs (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, neurosteroids, and plant extracts); macromolecule drugs (e.g., peptides, proteins, and gene therapeutics); and nanocarriers (e.g., lipid-based nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, and inorganic nanoparticles) in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The review also makes recommendations for the prospective development of anti-inflammatory strategies based on nanocarriers for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
