METHODS: In a cohort of 244 older adults at risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) owing to a family history of AD dementia, we measured single molecule array (Simoa)-based plasma tau biomarkers (p-tau231 and p-tau181), Abeta40 and Abeta42 with immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry, and Simoa neurofilament light (NfL). A subset of 129 participants underwent amyloid-beta (18 F-NAV4694) and tau (18 F-flortaucipir) PET assessments. We investigated plasma biomarker associations with Abeta and tau PET at the global and voxel level and tested plasma biomarker combinations for improved detection of Abeta-PET positivity. We also investigated associations with 8-year cognitive change. RESULTS: Plasma p-tau biomarkers correlated with flortaucipir binding in medial temporal, parietal, and inferior temporal regions. P-tau231 showed further associations in lateral parietal and occipital cortices. Plasma Abeta42/40 explained more variance in global Abeta-PET binding than Abeta42 alone. P-tau231 also showed strong and widespread associations with cortical Abeta-PET binding. Combining Abeta42/40 with p-tau231 or p-tau181 allowed for good distinction between Abeta-negative and -positive participants (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] range = 0.81-0.86). Individuals with low plasma Abeta42/40 and high p-tau experienced faster cognitive decline. INTERPRETATION: Plasma p-tau231 showed more robust associations with PET biomarkers than p-tau181 in presymptomatic individuals. The combination of p-tau and Abeta42/40 biomarkers detected early AD pathology and cognitive decline. Such markers could be used as prescreening tools to reduce the cost of prevention trials.
