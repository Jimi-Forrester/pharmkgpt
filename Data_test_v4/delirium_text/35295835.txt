35295835|t|Altered Microstructural Changes Detected by Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging in Patients With Cognitive Impairment After Acute Cerebral Infarction.
35295835|a|Objective: To detect the microstructural changes in patients with cognitive impairment after acute cerebral infarction using diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI). Materials and Methods: A total of 70 patients with acute cerebral infarction were divided into two groups: 35 patients with cognitive impairment (VCI group), and 35 patients without cognitive impairment (N-VCI group), according to mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score. Healthy individuals (n = 36) were selected as the normal control (NORM) group. DKI parameters from 28 different brain regions of interest (ROIs) were selected, measured, and compared. Results: VCI group patients had significantly higher mean diffusion (MD) and significantly lower mean kurtosis (MK) values in most ROIs than those in the N-VCI and NORM groups. DKI parameters in some ROIs correlated significantly with MMSE score. The splenium of corpus callosum MD was most correlated with MMSE score, the correlation coefficient was -0.652, and this parameter had good ability to distinguish patients with VCI from healthy controls; at the optimal cut-off MD value (0.9915), sensitivity was 91.4%, specificity 100%, and the area under the curve value 0.964. Conclusions: Pathological changes in some brain regions may underlie cognitive impairment after acute cerebral infarction, especially the splenium of corpus callosum. These preliminary results suggest that, in patients with VCI, DKI may be useful for assessing microstructural tissue damage.
