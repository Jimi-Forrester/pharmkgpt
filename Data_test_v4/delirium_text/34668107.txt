34668107|t|Thirst in patients admitted to intensive care units: an observational study.
34668107|a|BACKGROUND: Despite various studies reporting a high prevalence, reaching 71%, the sensation of thirst in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, its prevention, detection, and management, is not well known nor considered. Limited research has examined the causes of thirst in ICU patients, while it has been examined in other patient populations. AIM: To determine the incidence and intensity of thirst in patients admitted to ICU and its association with airway devices (endotracheal tube, tracheostomy, oxygen mask), airway humidification, patients' characteristics, and therapy (serum sodium concentration, hematocrit, fluid balance, possibility of oral hydration, and dosage of diuretics). METHODS: Patients were interviewed daily to report the presence of thirst and rate its intensity on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) from 0 (no thirst) -10 (intolerable thirst). Other data were obtained through direct evaluation or by consulting medical records. Patients admitted to three ICUs from May to August 2014 in a university hospital in Italy were included. RESULTS: A total of 220 Patients were enrolled. Thirst was found in 76.1% of patients' observations, with a mean thirst score of 5.37. Thirst intensity was predicted by high doses of diuretics (> 100 mg/die), increasing serum sodium concentration, absence of oral hydration and the presence of xerostomia. Thirst was associated with the use of humidified Venturi mask. CONCLUSIONS: Thirst is highly prevalent among patients in this population of intensive care patients. It would be desirable to evaluate this stressor at least daily, to eliminate or relieve this sensation.
