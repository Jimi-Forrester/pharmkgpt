22554400|a|The mediatory role of kinins in both acute and chronic inflammation within nervous tissues has been widely described. Bradykinin, the major representative of these bioactive peptides, is one of a few mediators of inflammation that directly stimulates afferent nerves due to the broad expression of specific kinin receptors in cell types in these tissues. Moreover, kinins may be delivered to a site of injury not only after their production at the endothelium surface but also following their local production through the enzymatic degradation of kininogens at the surface of nerve cells. A strong correlation between inflammatory processes and neurodegeneration has been established. The activation of nerve cells, particularly microglia, in response to injury, trauma or infection initiates a number of reactions in the neuronal neighborhood that can lead to cell death after the prolonged action of inflammatory substances. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the effects of kinins on neuronal destruction. In these studies, the overexpression of proteins involved in kinin generation or of kinin receptors has been observed in several neurologic disorders including neurodegenerative diseases such Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis as well as disorders associated with a deficiency in cell communication such as epilepsy. This review is focused on recent findings that provide reliable evidence of the mediatory role of kinins in the inflammatory responses associated with different neurological disorders. A deeper understanding of the role of kinins in neurodegenerative diseases is likely to promote the future development of new therapeutic strategies for the control of these disorders. An example of this could be the prospective use of kinin receptor antagonists.
