12365769|a|This study examined the influence of animal-assisted therapy, specifically fish aquariums, on nutritional intake in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sixty-two individuals with AD who lived in specialized units were studied. Baseline nutritional data were obtained followed by a 2-week treatment period when the aquariums were introduced. The treatment data were collected daily for 2 weeks then weekly for 6 weeks. Nutritional intake increased significantly (21.1%; p <.001) when the aquariums were introduced and continued to increase during the 6-week weekly follow-up. Weight increased significantly (1.65 lbs; p < .001) over the 16-week period In addition, participants required less nutritional supplementation, resulting in health care cost savings.
