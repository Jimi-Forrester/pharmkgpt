34271396|a|This study was aimed at optimizing the astaxanthin extraction efficiency from shrimp shell (green tiger, Penaeus semisulcatus). Astaxanthin was extracted using selected nonpolar/polar solvents (petroleum ether, n-hexane, ethanol, acetone) individually and in ternary mixtures of petroleum ether, acetone, and water in ratios of 15:50:35, 50:45:5, and 15:75:10 for different times (2,4 and 6 h). The results showed that solvents with higher polarity were more suitable for the extraction of astaxanthin, and increasing the extraction time from 2 to 6 h improved the extraction yield. The conditions of extraction of astaxanthin with the desirable solvent were then optimized with the ultrasonic method using the Box-Behnken design [variables included: extraction temperature (25 to 45  C), extraction time (5 to 15 min), and ultrasound amplitude (20 to 100%)]. Optimal extraction conditions were determined as the ultrasonic amplitude of 23.6%, extraction time of 13.9 min, and extraction temperature of 26.3  C. Under this optimum condition, the amount of astaxanthin, ferric reducing antioxidant power, and free radical scavenging capacity of the extract were obtained as 51.5%, 1705 mumol of Fe2+/g, and 73.9%, respectively. Extraction and analysis of the extract at the optimum point were used to validate the results.
