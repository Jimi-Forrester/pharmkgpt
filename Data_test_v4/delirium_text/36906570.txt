36906570|a|INTRODUCTION: It remains unclear whether COVID-19 which is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is associated with the deterioration of cognitive function among patients with schizophrenia. This study aimed to evaluate changes in cognitive function before and after COVID-19 and associated factors among patients with schizophrenia at the Psychiatric Hospital of the Cross (HPC). METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted among 95 patients with schizophrenia followed from mid-2019 until June 2021 at the Psychiatric Hospital of the Cross (HPC). This cohort was divided into a group diagnosed with COVID-19 (n = 71) and another not diagnosed with COVID-19 (n = 24). The questionnaire included the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS), and Activities of Daily Living (ADL). RESULTS: The repeated-measures ANOVA showed no significant effect of time and the interaction between time and being diagnosed or not with COVID-19 on cognition. However, being diagnosed or not with COVID-19 had a significant effect on global cognitive function (p = 0.046), verbal memory (p = 0.046), and working memory (p = 0.047). The interaction between being diagnosed with COVID-19 and cognitive impairment at baseline was significantly associated with a higher cognitive deficit (Beta = 0.81; p = 0.005). Clinical symptoms, autonomy, and depression were not associated with the cognition (p > 0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 disease affected global cognition and memory: patients diagnosed with COVID-19 had more deficits in these domains than those without COVID-19. Further studies are necessary to clarify the variation of cognitive function among schizophrenic patients with COVID-19.
