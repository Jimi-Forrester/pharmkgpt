33975566|t|Incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of delirium in patients with noninvasive ventilation: a prospective observational study.
33975566|a|BACKGROUND: Factors that may increase the risk for delirium and the firm knowledge around mechanism for delirium in noninvasive ventilation (NIV) patients is lacking. We investigated the incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of delirium in NIV patients. METHODS: A prospective observational study was performed in an intensive care unit (ICU) of a teaching hospital. Patients in whom NIV was used as a first-line intervention were enrolled. During NIV intervention, delirium was screened using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU each day. The association between delirium and poor outcomes (e.g., NIV failure, ICU and hospital mortality) was investigated using forward stepwise multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: We enrolled 1083 patients. Of these, 196 patients (18.1%) experienced delirium during NIV intervention. Patients with delirium had higher NIV failure rates (37.8% vs. 21.0%, p < 0.01), higher ICU mortality (33.2% vs. 14.3%, p < 0.01), and higher hospital mortality (37.2% vs. 17.0%, p < 0.01) than subjects without delirium. They also had a longer duration of NIV (median 6.3 vs. 3.7 days, p < 0.01), and stayed longer in the ICU (median 9.0 vs. 6.0 days, p < 0.01) and the hospital (median 14.5 vs. 11.0 days, p < 0.01). These results were confirmed in COPD and non-COPD cohorts. According to subtype, compared to hyperactive delirium patients, hypoactive and mixed delirium patients spent more days and many more days on NIV (median 3.4 vs. 6.5 vs. 10.1 days, p < 0.01). Similar outcomes were found for length of stay in the ICU and hospital. However, NIV failure, ICU mortality, and hospital mortality did not differ among the three subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is associated with increases in poor outcomes (NIV failure, ICU mortality, and hospital mortality) and the use of medical resources (duration of NIV, and lengths of stay in the ICU and hospital). Regarding subtype, hypoactive and mixed delirium are associated with higher, and much higher, consumption of medical resources, respectively, compared to hyperactive delirium.
