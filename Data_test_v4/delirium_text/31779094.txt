31779094|a|In multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with a progressive form of the disease, spinal cord (SC) functions slowly deteriorate beyond age 40. We previously showed that in the SC of these patients, large areas of incomplete demyelination extend distance away from plaque borders and are characterized by a unique progliotic TGFB1 (Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1) genomic signature. Here, we attempted to determine whether region- and age-specific physiological parameters could promote the progression of SC periplaques in MS patients beyond age 40. An analysis of transcriptomics databases showed that, under physiological conditions, a set of 10 homeobox (HOX) genes are highly significantly overexpressed in the human SC as compared to distinct brain regions. Among these HOX genes, a survey of the human proteome showed that only HOXA5 encodes a protein which interacts with a member of the TGF-beta signaling pathway, namely SMAD1 (SMAD family member 1). Moreover, HOXA5 was previously found to promote the TGF-beta pathway. Interestingly, SMAD1 is also a protein partner of the androgen receptor (AR) and an unsupervised analysis of gene ontology terms indicates that the AR pathway antagonizes the TGF-beta/SMAD pathway. Retrieval of promoter analysis data further confirmed that AR negatively regulates the transcription of several members of the TGF-beta/SMAD pathway. On this basis, we propose that in progressive MS patients, the physiological SC overexpression of HOXA5 combined with the age-dependent decline in AR ligands may favor the slow progression of TGFB1-mediated gliosis. Potential therapeutic implications are discussed.
