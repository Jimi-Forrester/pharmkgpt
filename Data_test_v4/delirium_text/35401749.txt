35401749|a|Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecological malignancy. Despite the initial resection and chemotherapeutic treatment, relapse is common, which leads to poor survival rates in patients. A primary cause of recurrence is the persistence of ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSCs) with high tumorigenicity and chemoresistance. To achieve a better therapeutic response in EOC relapse, the mechanisms underlying acquired chemoresistance associated with relapse-initiating OCSCs need to be studied. Transcriptomes of both chemosensitive primary and chemoresistant relapse EOC samples were obtained from ICGC OV-AU dataset for differential expression analysis. The upregulated genes were further studied using KEGG and GO analysis. Significantly increased expression of eighteen CSC-related genes was found in chemoresistant relapse EOC groups. Upregulation of the expression in four hub genes including WNT3A, SMAD3, KLF4, and PAX6 was verified in chemoresistant relapse samples via immunohistochemistry staining, which confirmed the existence and enrichment of OCSCs in chemoresistant relapse EOC. KEGG and GO enrichment analysis in microarray expression datasets of isolated OCSCs indicated that quiescent state, increased ability of drug efflux, and enhanced response to DNA damage may have caused the chemoresistance in relapse EOC patients. These findings demonstrated a correlation between OCSCs and acquired chemoresistance and illustrated potential underlying mechanisms of OCSC-initiated relapse in EOC patients. Meanwhile, the differentially expressed genes in OCSCs may serve as novel preventive or therapeutic targets against EOC recurrence in the future.
