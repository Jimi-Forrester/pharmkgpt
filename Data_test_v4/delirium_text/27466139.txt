27466139|a|The amyloidogenic peptide, Abeta, provokes a series of events affecting distinct cellular pathways regulated by protein phosphorylation. Abeta inhibits protein phosphatases in a dose-dependent manner, thus it is expected that the phosphorylation state of specific proteins would be altered in response to Abeta. In fact several Alzheimer's disease related proteins, such as APP and TAU, exhibit pathology associated hyperphosphorylated states. A systems biology approach was adopted and the phosphoproteome, of primary cortical neuronal cells exposed to Abeta, was evaluated. Phosphorylated proteins were recovered and those whose recovery increased or decreased, upon Abeta exposure across experimental sets, were identified. Significant differences were evident for 141 proteins and investigation of their interactors revealed key protein clusters responsive to Abeta treatment. Of these, 73 phosphorylated proteins increased and 68 decreased upon Abeta addition. These phosphorylated proteins represent an important resource of potential AD phospho biomarkers that should be further pursued.
