34732255|a|OBJECTIVES: To compare differential expression protein in hippocampal tissues from mice of perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) and normal control mice and to explore the possible mechanism of PND. METHODS: Mice were randomly divided into a PND group (n = 9) and a control group (n = 9).The mice in the PND group were treated with open tibial fracture with intramedullary fixation under isoflurane anesthesia, while the mice in the control group received pure oxygen without surgery. The cognitive functions of the two groups were examined using Morris water maze experiment, Open field test and Fear conditioning test. The protein expression of the hippocampus of mice was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed to explore the principal functions of dysregulated proteins. RESULTS: A total of 21 proteins were differentially expressed between PND and control mice on days 1, 3, and 7 after the operation. These proteins were involved in many pathological processes, such as neuroinflammatory responses, mitochondrial oxidative stress, impaired synaptic plasticity, and neuronal cell apoptosis. Also, the dysregulated proteins were involved in MAPK, AMPK, and ErbB signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of PND could be attributed to multiple mechanisms.
