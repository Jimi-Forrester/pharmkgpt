23627271|t|An expedient synthesis and screening for antiacetylcholinesterase activity of piperidine embedded novel pentacyclic cage compounds.
23627271|a|The aim of this study was to synthesize and evaluate diazapentacyclic analogs for their acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity. The pentacyclic analogs were synthesized by one-pot three-component domino reactions in a microwave synthesizer. Most of the compounds exhibited moderate to good AChE inhibitory activity, compound 5i showed potent inhibitory activity with IC50 1.12 +- 0.01 microM and this may provide a new lead for developing potential inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease.
