35370647|t|Hotspots and Frontiers in Inflammatory Tumor Microenvironment Research: A Scientometric and Visualization Analysis.
35370647|a|Methods: Articles on inflammatory tumor microenvironment were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection, and the characteristics of the articles were analyzed by CiteSpace software. Background: The inflammatory tumor microenvironment is an essential feature of the tumor microenvironment. The way in which it promotes or inhibits tumor progression plays an important role in the outcome of a tumor treatment. This research aims to explore a scientific collaboration network, describe evolution of hotspots, and predict future trends through bibliometric analysis. Results: A total of 3,534 papers published by 390 institutions in 81 countries/regions were screened, and the annual quantity has been increasing rapidly in the past decades. United States was the leading country and has the most productive institutions in this field. The research topics were mainly focused on inflammation and immunity mediated by crucial factors as well as the mechanisms of angiogenesis. Additionally, the development and application of nanoparticles is currently a novel research frontier with bright prospect. Conclusion: The present scientometric study provides an overview of inflammatory tumor microenvironment research over the previous decades using quantitative and qualitative methods, and the findings of this study can provide references for researchers focusing on tumor treatment.
