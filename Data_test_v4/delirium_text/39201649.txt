39201649|t|Genetic Polymorphisms in the HMGCR Gene and Associations with Cognitive Decline in Parkinson's Disease Patients.
39201649|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms including cognitive impairment and dementia. The etiopathogenesis of PD, as well as its protective and susceptibility factors, are still elusive. 3-Hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) is an enzyme regulating cholesterol synthesis. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene coding HMGCR have recently been correlated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Alternative splicing of exon 13 of the HMGCR transcript and its strongly associated HMGCR haplotype 7 (H7: rs17244841, rs3846662, rs17238540) may downregulate protein activity and cholesterol synthesis, with lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels associated with PD that may affect cognitive abilities. We genotyped three SNPs in the H7 HMGCR gene in 306 PD patients divided into three groups-without cognitive decline, with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and with PD dementia-and in 242 healthy participants. A correlation between the rs17238540 genotype and PD susceptibility as well as a minor association between rs3846662 and cognitive status in PD patients was observed; however, the two-sided analysis of these groups did not reveal any significance. We observed a statistically significant elevated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) plasma level in the minor allele carriers of rs17238540 and rs17244841 among PD patients. This study should be replicated in a larger population.
