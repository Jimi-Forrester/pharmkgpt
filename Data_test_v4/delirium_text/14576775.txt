14576775|t|Substrate cleavage by caspases generates protein fragments with Smac/Diablo-like activities.
14576775|a|Smac/Diablo and HtrA2/Omi promote apoptosis by binding to and antagonizing IAP proteins, including the 'X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis' (XIAP). Here we show that caspase-mediated proteolysis of a limited subset of cell death substrates exposes functional Smac/Diablo-like N-termini after cleavage, which are able to bind to and antagonize XIAP. We propose that this mechanism may establish a feedforward sensitization of the apoptotic pathway and contribute to the functional redundancy of IAP antagonism. In addition, this may be particularly relevant in Alzheimer's disease since the caspase-generated C31 peptide, an established cytotoxin, acquires Smac/Diablo-like properties after apoptotic processing.
