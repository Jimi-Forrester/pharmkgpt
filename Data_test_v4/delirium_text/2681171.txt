2681171|t|Anxiety and alcoholism.
2681171|a|Patients with alcohol dependence commonly experience symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. It is essential that clinicians recognize and treat anxiety disorders in alcoholic patients. Panic attacks with and without agoraphobia are especially prevalent among alcoholics and their families. Treatments of choice for panic disorder are the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, as well as tricyclic antidepressants and the benzodiazepine alprazolam. Benzodiazepines seem to be effective in controlling two pathophysiologic characteristics of alcohol withdrawal--noradrenergic and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical overactivity. They also can be used to prevent and treat withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens. They are not indicated for the treatment of alcohol dependence per se.
