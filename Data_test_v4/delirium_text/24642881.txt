24642881|t|8-Alkylcoumarins from the fruits of Cnidium monnieri protect against hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative stress damage.
24642881|a|Three new 8-alkylcoumarins, 7-O-methylphellodenol-B (1), 7-methoxy-8-(3-methyl- 2,3-epoxy-1-oxobutyl)chromen-2-one (2), and 3'-O-methylvaginol (3), together with seven known compounds (4-10) were isolated from the fruits of Cnidium monnieri. Their structures were determined by detailed analysis of spectroscopic data and comparison with the data of known analogues. All the isolates were evaluated the cytoprotective activity by MTS cell proliferation assay and the results showed that all the three new 8-alkylcoumarins exhibited cytoprotective effect on Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells injured by hydrogen peroxide.
