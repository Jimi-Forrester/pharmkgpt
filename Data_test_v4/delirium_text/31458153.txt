31458153|t|1,3-Dibromo-1,1-difluoro-2-propanone as a Useful Synthon for a Chemoselective Preparation of 4-Bromodifluoromethyl Thiazoles.
31458153|a|We report herein a synthetic protocol for the preparation of 1,3-dibromo-1,1-difluoro-2-propanone, a new synthon used for the first time in a reaction with aromatic amines and sodium thiocyanate, leading to thiazoles which are useful candidates in drug discovery programs. The new synthon allows to introduce a bromodifluoromethyl group at the C4 of the thiazole, and it is amenable of further transformation such as the Br/F exchange useful in radiopharmaceutics. Application of the strategy to the preparation of a precursor of the biologically relevant DF2755Y is also reported.
