38288960|t|Girdlestone resection arthroplasty for femoral neck fractures has poorer outcomes than hemiarthroplasty in frail patients with increased risk for arthroplasty-related complications: a retrospective case study of 21 patients.
38288960|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hemiarthroplasty (HA) is the usual treatment for displaced femoral neck fractures (FNF) in elderly patients. Patients may be unsuitable for HA due to secondary conditions such as systemic infections or severe neurological conditions, which is why Girdlestone resection arthroplasty (GRA) may be an option. We aimed to determine (1) patient survival in matched patient groups treated with either GRA or HA and (2) functional outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 21 patients treated with GRA for FNF in a German university hospital were retrospectively reviewed (2015-2019). After matching for age and comorbidities, a control group of 42 HA patients was established. Patient survival was determined by a Kaplan-Meier analysis. The mean follow-up (FU) was 1.5 (0-4.4) years. Function at FU was documented using the modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS) and the National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD) mobility score. RESULTS: The 1-month-mortality was 19% in the GRA group and 12% in the HA group; the 1-year mortality was 71% and 49%, respectively (P = 0.01). The mHHS at FU was lower in the GRA group than in the HA group (22 [range 0-50] vs. 46 [11-80]). 82% of patients in the GRA group were bedridden post-surgery as opposed to 19% in the HA group. CONCLUSION: Patients with HA after FNF had higher survival and better functional outcomes when compared with GRA in matched patient groups. Considering this, GRA for FNF should be selected restrictively.
