36515857|a|We previously reported the critical involvement of metabotropic GluR1 (mGluR1) signaling in complement C1q-dependent microglial phagocytosis of glutamatergic synapses in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) injected with amyloid fibrils. Here, we explored the role of type 2A protein phosphatase (type 2A PPase), a key enzyme downstream of mGluR1 signaling, in the pathogenesis of AD in rats. Significant local upregulation of PP2A expression was observed in the hippocampal CA1 after bilateral microinjection of amyloid-beta (Abeta1-40) fibrils. Amyloid fibrils induced remarkable dephosphorylation of pFMRP (fragile X mental retardation protein) and C1q upregulation in hippocampal glutamatergic synapses, which was ameliorated by microinjection of type 2A PPase inhibitor okadaic acid (OA). Microinjection of OA further attenuated the microglial phagocytosis of glutamatergic synapses, recovered the hippocampal glutamatergic transmission, and improved the performance in Morris water maze test. These findings demonstrated that dysfunction of type 2A PPase signaling contributed to complement C1q-dependent microglial phagocytosis of glutamatergic synapses and the cognitive impairments in the rat model of AD.
