25302097|t|Persistent perioperative tachycardia and hypertension diagnosed as thyroid storm induced by a hydatidiform mole: a case report.
25302097|a|Thyroid storm is a critical complication of molar pregnancy. However, early diagnosis of it is difficult because it is a rare complication and usually presents nonspecific findings. In this case report, we present a woman with molar pregnancy who had persistent tachycardia and hypertension. She was diagnosed initially with preeclampsia and sepsis as complications of molar pregnancy. During dilation and curettage under general anesthesia with sevoflurane and remifentanil, tachycardia and hypertension remained even with continuous infusion of labetalol. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with thyroid storm associated with molar pregnancy. She was restored to a clinically euthyroid state 1 day after the operation, and her thyroid function test and beta-hCG values were normal 3 months later. The anesthesiologists should bear in mind the possibility of thyroid storm in patients with molar pregnancies who show persistent tachycardia and hypertension.
