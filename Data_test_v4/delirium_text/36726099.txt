However, more knowledge is needed about the MIND diet's other favorable impacts. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the MIND diet, mental health, and metabolic markers in individuals with obesity. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we included 339 individuals with obesity (BMI >= 30 kg/m2) aged 20-50 years. We utilized a semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), we assessed dietary intake, including 168 food items, and calculated the value of MIND. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) guidelines. We assessed biochemical parameters using Enzymatic methods. Blood pressure and body composition were also determined. RESULTS: Higher tertiles of the MIND diet score were associated with significantly higher energy intake, macronutrients, and brain-healthy food intakes (P < 0.001). Among the brain-unhealthy foods, only the intake of sweets and pastries was significantly lower in the highest versus lowest MIND tertiles. We also observed lower odds of stress (P < 0.05) and higher insulin sensitivity (P < 0.05) in the highest versus lowest MIND diet tertiles. We witnessed no significant changes in other parameters. CONCLUSION: Lower stress levels and higher insulin sensitivity independent of some confounders like age, BMI, sex, and physical activity were associated with the highest tertile of MIND diet score.
