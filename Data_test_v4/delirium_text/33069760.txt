33069760|a|Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by progressive loss of neurons. To date, no efficacious therapies exist for these disorders, and current therapies provide only symptomatic relief. The neuroprotective effects of natural compounds have been reported in several neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), cerebral ischemia and brain tumors. Flavonoids are the most widely studied natural products for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. The nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) represents a complex gene regulated cytoprotective pathway. Several natural compounds have been identified as Nrf2 regulators in various chronic disorders, including carcinogenic, liver ailments, inflammatory conditions, neurodegeneration, diabetes and cardiotoxicities. The current review focuses on Nrf2 targeting by flavonoids in the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, addressing the most contemporary information available on this timely subject.
