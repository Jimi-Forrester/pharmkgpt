32489659|a|Esophageal cancer is one of the most common cancers associated with the high mortality rate. Timely diagnosis and treatment are important to manage the disease and prevent comorbidities. Surgical resection of the tumor and lymph nodes is usually practiced either with or without chemo or chemoradiotherapy. Despite advancements in surgical methods and skills, complex nature of the esophagus and invasiveness of the surgery can lead to serious complications in these patients. In order to predict postoperative outcomes, preoperative examination of the patients, in addition to risk factors, should be conducted. Conclusion: Lastly, early detection of adverse postoperative events may help faster recovery, reduce hospital stay and prevent other morbidities.
