38258288|t|Decoding the Neurological Sequelae of General Anesthesia: A Review.
38258288|a|General anesthesia is an integral part of modern surgical practice, but it is associated with a number of complications, including neurological ones. This article provides a thorough analysis of these complications, taking into account the most common ones like drug complications, through delirium, postoperative cognitive impairment (POCD), to the rarest ones like perioperative stroke (POS), spinal cord ischemia (SCI), and postoperative visual loss (POVL). Its main goal is to familiarize healthcare professionals, especially those involved in anesthesiology, with the intricacies of neurological complications. Given their specificity and frequency of occurrence, it is well known that the diagnosis and management of these complications can sometimes cause problems for physicians without advanced neurological knowledge. Also, in addition to complex diagnostics, the pathomechanism of non-pharmacological complications is often not fully understood due to their multifactoriality and sometimes paucity of research. For this reason, an increasing amount of work is being done in the medical community to better understand this group of conditions, enabling faster diagnosis and more effective treatment, as well as perioperative prevention. This paper aims to increase awareness and vigilance among physicians across the spectrum of surgical patient care, from premedication to postoperative follow-up. Drawing on the authors' experience and the extensive medical literature, this paper includes 39 selected articles from 1994 to 2023, seeking the latest insights in the constantly evolving field of neurology and anesthesiology. This article aims to review the neurological complications of general anesthesia.
