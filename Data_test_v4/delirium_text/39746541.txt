39746541|a|Sepsis is characterised by dysregulated immune responses to infection, leading to multi-organ dysfunction and high rates of mortality. With increasing survival rates in recent years long-term neurological and psychiatric consequences have become more apparent in survivors. Many patients develop sepsis associated encephalopathy (SAE) which encompasses the profound but usually transient neuropsychiatric syndrome delirium but also new brain injury that emerges in the months and years post-sepsis. It now clear that systemic inflammatory signals reach the brain during sepsis and that very significant neuroinflammation ensues. The major brain resident immune cell population, the microglia, has been implicated in acute and chronic cognitive dysfunction in animal models of sepsis based on a growing number of studies using bacterial endotoxin and in polymicrobial sepsis models such as cecal ligation and puncture. The current review explores the effects of sepsis on the brain, focussing on how systemic insults translate to microglial activation and neuroinflammation and how this disrupts neuronal function and integrity. We examine what has been demonstrated specifically with respect to microglial activation, revealing robust evidence for a role for neuroinflammation in sepsis-induced brain sequelae but less clear information on the extent of the specific microglial contribution to this, arising from findings using global knockout mice, non-selective drugs and treatments that equally target peripheral and central compartments. There is, nonetheless, clear evidence that microglia do become activated and do contribute to brain consequences of sepsis thus arguing for improved understanding of these neuroinflammatory processes toward the prevention and treatment of sepsis-induced brain dysfunction.
