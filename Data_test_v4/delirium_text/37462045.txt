37462045|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this study was to discuss how recent work has increased our understanding of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). The investigation of large and autopsy-confirmed cohorts, imaging modalities to assess different aspects of pathophysiology, clinical phenotypes and the application of advanced machine learning techniques, have led to recent advances in the field that will be discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: Literature over the past 18 months will be discussed under the following themes: studies assessing how different neuroimaging modalities can improve the diagnosis of PSP and CBD from other neurodegenerative and parkinsonian disorders, including the investigation of pathological targets such as tau, iron, neuromelanin and dopamine and cholinergic systems; work improving our understanding of clinical, neuroanatomical and pathological heterogeneity in PSP and CBD; and work using advanced neuroimaging tools to investigate patterns of disease spread, as well as biological mechanisms potentially driving spread through the brain in PSP and CBD. SUMMARY: The findings help improve the imaging-based diagnosis of PSP and CBD, allow more targeted prognostic estimates for patients accounting for phenotype or disease, and will aid in the development of appropriate and better-targeted disease biomarkers for clinical treatment trials.
