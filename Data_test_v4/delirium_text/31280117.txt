31280117|a|The regional relationships between tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain uncertain. We examined cross-sectional associations between cognitive performance, cerebral uptake of the novel tau PET tracer [18F]GTP1, and other neuroimaging indices ([18F]florbetapir amyloid PET, magnetic resonance imaging) in 71 participants with normal cognition, prodromal AD, or AD dementia. Greater [18F]GTP1 uptake was seen with increasing clinical severity and correlated with poorer cognition. [18F]GTP1 uptake and cortical volume (but not [18F]florbetapir uptake) were independently associated with cognitive performance, particularly within the temporal lobe. Delayed memory was more specifically associated with temporal [18F]GTP1 uptake; other domains correlated with a broader range of regional [18F]GTP1 uptake. These data confirm that [18F]GTP1 tau PET uptake significantly correlates with cognitive performance in AD, but regional correlations between performance in non-memory cognitive domains were less specific than reported by tau PET imaging studies that included participants with atypical focal cortical AD syndromes. Tau PET imaging may have utility as a surrogate biomarker for clinical AD progression in therapeutic trials of disease-modifying interventions.
