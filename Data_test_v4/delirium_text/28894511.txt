28894511|t|The Evaluation of Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Eucommia ulmoides Flavones Using Diquat-Challenged Piglet Models.
28894511|a|This study was designed to evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of Eucommia ulmoides flavones (EUF) using diquat-challenged piglet models. A total of 96 weaned piglets were randomly allotted to 1 of 3 treatments with 8 replication pens per treatment and 4 piglets per pen. The treatments were basal diet, basal diet + diquat, and 100 mg/kg EUF diet + diquat. On day 7 after the initiation of treatment, the piglets were injected intraperitoneally with diquat at 8 mg/kg BW or the same amount of sterilized saline. The experiment was conducted for 21 days. EUF supplementation improved the growth performance of diquat-treated piglets from day 14 to 21. Diquat also induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses and then impaired intestinal morphology. But EUF addition alleviated these negative effects induced by diquat that showed decreasing serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines but increasing antioxidant indexes and anti-inflammatory cytokines on day 14. Supplementation of EUF also increased villi height and villous height, crypt depth, but decreased the histopathological score and MPO activity compared with those of diquat-challenged pigs fed with the basal diet on day 14. Results indicated that EUF attenuated the inflammation and oxidative stress of piglets caused by diquat injection.
