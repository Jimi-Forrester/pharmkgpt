38462491|a|Sleep loss is associated with reduced health and quality of life, and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Up to 66% of persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias experience poor sleep, which can predict or accelerate the progression of cognitive decline. Exercise is a widely accessible intervention for poor sleep that can protect against functional and cognitive decline. No previous systematic reviews have investigated the effectiveness of exercise for sleep in older adults with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. We systematically reviewed controlled interventional studies of exercise targeting subjectively or objectively (polysomnography/actigraphy) assessed sleep in persons with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. We conducted searches in PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Cochrane-Library (n = 6745). Nineteen randomised and one non-randomised controlled interventional trials were included, representing the experiences of 3278 persons with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Ten had low-risk, nine moderate-risk, and one high-risk of bias. Six studies with subjective and eight with objective sleep outcomes were meta-analysed (random-effects model). We found moderate- to high-quality evidence for the beneficial effects of exercise on self-reported and objectively-measured sleep outcomes in persons with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. However, no studies examined key potential moderators of these effects, such as sex, napping or medication use. Our results have important implications for clinical practice. Sleep may be one of the most important modifiable risk factors for a range of health conditions, including cognitive decline and the progression of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Given our findings, clinicians may consider adding exercise as an effective intervention or adjuvant strategy for improving sleep in older persons with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
