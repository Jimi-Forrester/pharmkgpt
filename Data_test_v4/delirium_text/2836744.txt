2836744|t|Phagocytic cell function in aged subjects.
2836744|a|In order to study the activity of phagocytic cells in normal and pathological aging, we compared normal young and aged subjects and patients with Alzheimer's (AD) or Parkinson's (PD) disease. Blood granulocytes and monocytes were separately assayed for ingestion of three different particle species (opsonized zymosan, immunoglobulin-coated sheep red cells (IgG-SRC) and glutaraldehyde-treated sheep red cells (G-SRC]. The superoxide anion production induced by these particles was also measured. All granulocyte responses to zymosan and IgG-SRC were depressed in the three aged groups as compared to young controls. Hence, only functions involving a specific receptor (Fc or C3b receptor) seemed affected. Monocyte activity was slightly decreased in the same groups. No difference was found between AD or PD patients and normal aged subjects. Hence the phagocytic and oxidative defects we found were a consequence of aging.
