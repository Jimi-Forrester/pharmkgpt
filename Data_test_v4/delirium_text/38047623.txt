38047623|t|Aggregation and cytotoxicity of food additive dye (Azorubine)-albumin adducts: a multi-spectroscopic, microscopic and computational analysis.
38047623|a|Protein and peptide misfolding is a central factor in the formation of pathological aggregates and fibrils linked to disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Therefore, it's essential to understand how food additives, particularly Azorubine, affect protein structures and their ability to induce aggregation. In this study, human serum albumin (HSA) was used as a model protein to investigate the binding and conformational changes caused by azorubine, a common food and drink colorant. The research revealed that azorubine destabilized the conformation of HSA at both physiological (pH 7.4) and acidic (pH 3.5) conditions. The loss of tryptophan fluorescence in HSA suggested significant structural alterations, particularly around aromatic residues. Far UV-CD analysis demonstrated disruptions in HSA's secondary structure, with a notable reduction in alpha-helical structures at pH 7.4. At pH 3.5, Azorubine induced even more extensive perturbations, resulting in a random coil conformation at higher azorubine concentrations. The study also investigated aggregation phenomena through turbidity measurements, RLS analysis, and TEM imaging. At pH 3.5, larger insoluble aggregates formed, while at pH 7.4, only conformational changes occurred without aggregate formation. Cytotoxicity assessments on neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells highlighted the concentration-dependent toxicity of albumin aggregates. Molecular dynamics simulations reaffirmed the stable interaction between azorubine and HSA. This research provides valuable insights into the mechanisms by which azorubine influences protein conformations. To further advance our understanding and contribute to the broader knowledge in this area, several future directions can be considered such as exploring other proteins, studying dose-response relationship, gaining mechanistic insights, biological relevance, toxicity assessment, identifying alternative food colorants, and mitigation strategies to prevent adverse effects of azorubine on serum proteins.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
