37206486|t|The Effect of Postoperative Physical Therapy Following Hip Fracture: A Literature Review.
37206486|a|Hip fractures in the elderly have become a major public health concern as the population ages. Post-operative rehabilitation is associated with improved outcomes and a greater likelihood of returning to pre-operative functional capacity. Several studies have been conducted to investigate various post-operative recovery pathways. However, little is known about which post-operative rehabilitation pathways for hip fractures are most effective in improving patient outcomes. No clear evidence-based guidelines for a standard mobilization protocol for patients are currently available. This review aims to investigate post-operative recovery pathways to help patients suffering from hip fracture return to pre-fracture condition and to quantify pre-operative and post-operative scores for objective rehabilitation evaluation. Measuring pre-operative activity and comparing it to post-operative follow-up values can help predict post-operative rehabilitation functional outcomes.
