12807662|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is widely recognized as the second most common neurodegenerative cause of dementia in patients over the age of 65. The clinical distinction between DLB and Alzheimers's disease (AD) can be difficult due to the significant clinical overlap between the two disorders. Although the specificity of current consensus criteria is high, the sensitivity of case detection is lower and more variable. In some cases, the diagnosis is only made at postmortem examination. CASE REPORT: Monozygotic twins with the neuropathological diagnosis of Lewy body disease are presented in this report. Despite a very similar presentation and a comparable course of illness, the twins received different clinical diagnoses during life, one DLB and the other AD. This highlights the difficulty of making a clinical diagnosis of DLB, which very much depends on recognizing the features of fluctuation in level of awareness, hallucinations, delusions and the occurrence of falls, and the interpretation of the importance of these signs and symptoms. Pathological examination was virtually identical for the two cases showing the classic neuropathological features of Lewy Body disease.
