The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential influence of statins and cholesterol diet on selected parameters relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. METHODS: For 15 days, rats were orally administered simvastatin (10 or 20mg/kg b.wt.), atorvastatin (10 or 20mg/kg b.wt.), or aqua (control group); and one group was fed high-cholesterol (2%) diet. At the end of experiments brain (and plasma) cholesterol, lathosterol, hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase protein, acetylcholinesterase activity, amyloid beta (40 and 42) and cholesterol synthesis rate (using the incorporation of deuterium from deuterated water) were determined and statistically compared to those of aqua. RESULTS: Both statins were able to lower cholesterol in the plasma, but none elicited an effect on total brain cholesterol. Significant reductions of brain lathosterol and cholesterol synthesis rate were observed after simvastatin and atorvastatin treatment. Acetylcholinesterase activity, amyloid beta and hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase levels remained unaffected by the two drugs. CONCLUSIONS: This study brings additional evidence of a role for statins in cholesterol synthesis in the brain. Our data question the relationship between amyloid beta, acetylcholinesterase activity and cholesterol synthesis in the rat brain as well as the assumption about no exchange between peripheral and brain cholesterol pools.
