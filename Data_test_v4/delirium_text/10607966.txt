10607966|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the ability of colour naming, colour discrimination and colour preference in Alzheimer's disease (AD). DESIGN: Descriptive, consecutive sample. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty subjects >65 years with AD. INTERVENTIONS: Testing colour discrimination, colour naming and colour preferences. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ability to detect colour differences in the yellow, red, blue and green areas, ability to assign a name to 22 colour samples, ability to rank seven colours in order of preference. MAIN RESULTS: Discrimination ability was significantly better in the yellow and red area and for lightness variations. Cognitive decline had a significant impact on naming mixed colours and using elaborate colour names. Severity of dementia did not affect the preference rank order of colours. CONCLUSIONS: Ability to discriminate is affected in AD, with most errors in the blue and green area. Naming colours shows a cognitive decline. Preferences for colour are stable despite the disease.
