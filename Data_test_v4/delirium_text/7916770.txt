7916770|a|The distributions of various immunohistochemical markers of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) were compared to that of a normal nerve cell cytoskeletal marker, SMI32, in the inferior temporal cortex of Alzheimer brains and normal aged controls. NFT markers included antibodies to the microtubule-associated proteins tau, ubiquitin, or amyloid P component (AP). The results showed that, in our group of patients, the decrease of SMI32 immunoreactivity in the Alzheimer temporal cortex is paralleled by an increase in AP immunoreactivity in neurons and neurofibrillary tangles. This suggests that AP may play an important role in NFT formation or evolution in Alzheimer disease.
