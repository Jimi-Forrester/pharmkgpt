10726294|a|Twelve patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and their caregivers were interviewed with the SEIQoL. The SEIQoL measures quality of life by taking into account the relevant determinants for a particular individual. The subject rates 5 areas in life most important to the quality of life. The relative contribution of each area to the overall quality of life is then calculated with a multiple regression analysis programme developed for the purpose. Next the SEIQoL Index score, validity and reliability are computed. One patient was unable to complete the interview. The remaining (8 women, 3 men, mean age 71.3 years) had a mean SEIQoL Index score of 79.9 (median: 85.4), which is comparable to healthy Dutch elderly. The caregivers (10 spouses, 2 daughters; mean age 67.4 years), on the other hand, had a lower SEIQoL Index score: 62.2 (median: 63.8). Validity and reliability were good for both groups. Thus, caregivers in this pilot study experienced a lower quality of life than AD patients and healthy Dutch elderly. The SEIQoL allows quantitative measurement of completely individualised quality of life for AD patients and their caregivers.
