The aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant and inhibitory effects of Citrus aurantium extract on the acetylcholinesterase and production of amyloid nanobiofibrils from bovine serum albumin (BSA). The Citrus aurantium petals were harvested from Rasht city in northern IRAN. Chemical composition was investigated by GC-MS. The anti-Alzheimer's effects were evaluated by determining the antioxidant percentage by DPPH method and determining acetylcholinesterase activity. Congored spectroscopy was used for investigation of the inhibitory properties of the extract on the production of amyloid nanobiofibrils, and amyloid fibers was confirmed by electron microscopy. The most abundant ingredients were D-Glucuronic acid (9.53%), D-Limonene (5.54%), Linalool (2.06%), Daphnetin (3.73%), Phthalic acid (0.72%), Octadecenoic acid (3.98%), Hexadecanoic acid (2.13%), Pyrrolidinone (1.17%) and the highest antioxidant capacity was at 8 mg/ml (EC50: 2.36 mg/ml). The extract reduced the Acetylcholinesterase activity less than 47.04% (IC50: 42.8 mg/ml) and amyloid production less than 22% (EC50: 3.135). Citrus aurantium petals with inhibitory properties for the production of amyloid nanobiofibrils, can be used as a beneficial drugs for reducing side effects of Alzheimer's disease.
