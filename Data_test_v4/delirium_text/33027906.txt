33027906|t|Calmodulin Binding Proteins and Alzheimer's Disease: Biomarkers, Regulatory Enzymes and Receptors That Are Regulated by Calmodulin.
33027906|a|The integral role of calmodulin in the amyloid pathway and neurofibrillary tangle formation in Alzheimer's disease was first established leading to the "Calmodulin Hypothesis". Continued research has extended our insight into the central function of the small calcium sensor and effector calmodulin and its target proteins in a multitude of other events associated with the onset and progression of this devastating neurodegenerative disease. Calmodulin's involvement in the contrasting roles of calcium/CaM-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and calcineurin (CaN) in long term potentiation and depression, respectively, and memory impairment and neurodegeneration are updated. The functions of the proposed neuronal biomarker neurogranin, a calmodulin binding protein also involved in long term potentiation and depression, is detailed. In addition, new discoveries into calmodulin's role in regulating glutamate receptors (mGluR, NMDAR) are overviewed. The interplay between calmodulin and amyloid beta in the regulation of PMCA and ryanodine receptors are prime examples of how the buildup of classic biomarkers can underly the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's. The role of calmodulin in the function of stromal interaction molecule 2 (STIM2) and adenosine A2A receptor, two other proteins linked to neurodegenerative events, is discussed. Prior to concluding, an analysis of how targeting calmodulin and its binding proteins are viable routes for Alzheimer's therapy is presented. In total, calmodulin and its binding proteins are further revealed to be central to the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease.
