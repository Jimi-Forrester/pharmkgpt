38161287|a|OBJECTIVES: Determine if biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and neural injury may play a role in the prediction of delirium risk. METHODS: In a cohort of older adults who underwent elective surgery, delirium case-no delirium control pairs (N = 70, or 35 matched pairs) were matched by age, sex and vascular comorbidities. Biomarkers from CSF and plasma samples collected prior to surgery, including amyloid beta (Abeta)42 , Abeta40 , total (t)-Tau, phosphorylated (p)-Tau181 , neurofilament-light (NfL), and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) were measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or ultrasensitive single molecule array (Simoa) immunoassays. RESULTS: Plasma GFAP correlated significantly with CSF GFAP and both plasma and CSF GFAP values were nearly two-fold higher in delirium cases. The median paired difference between delirium case and control without delirium for plasma GFAP was not significant (p = 0.074) but higher levels were associated with a greater risk for delirium (odds ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 0.85, 2.72 per standard deviation increase in plasma GFAP concentration) in this small study. No matched pair differences or associations with delirium were observed for NfL, p-Tau 181, Abeta40 and Abeta42 . CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest that plasma GFAP, a marker of astroglial activation, may be worth further investigation as a predictive risk marker for delirium.
