37763766|t|A New Model of Salivary Pacemaker-A Proof of Concept and First Clinical Use.
37763766|a|Background and Objectives: Saliva is of utmost importance for maintaining oral health. Management of saliva flow rate deficiency recently includes salivary neuro-electrostimulation. The aim of this paper is to present a new model of salivary pacemaker-the MICROSAL device (MD), an intelligent, miniaturized, and implant-supported oral device used for salivary stimulation. Materials and Methods: This report presents the development, calibration, and first clinical tests which involved the MD. The novel features of this device are the pH sensor and the fact that it communicates with the patient's smartphone, where oral wetness and pH are graphically exposed. Saliva samples were taken before and after the MD was used on a 68-year-old patient suffering from post-irradiation xerostomia, and albumin and total protein were analyzed. Results: The device uses up to 3 V and time intervals of 2 s seconds for stimulation. The total volume of all saliva samples collected during the clinical trial was almost seven times higher after the device was used. Albumin decreased from a maximum of 0.15 g/dL to 0.04 g/dL, and total proteins from 0.65 g/dL to 0.21 g/dL, after salivary stimulation. Conclusions: The MD increased saliva secretion of the patient, and we are confident it will be a good solution for future management of salivary gland hypofunction.
