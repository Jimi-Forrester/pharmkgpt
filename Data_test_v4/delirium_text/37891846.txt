37891846|a|Reelin is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein involved in neuronal migration during embryonic brain development and synaptic plasticity in the adult brain. The role of Reelin in the developing central nervous system has been extensively characterized. Indeed, a loss of Reelin or a disruption in its signaling cascade leads to neurodevelopmental defects and is associated with ataxia, intellectual disability, autism, and several psychiatric disorders. In the adult brain, Reelin is critically involved in neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Reelin's signaling potentiates glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, induces synaptic maturation, and increases AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits' expression and activity. As a result, there is a growing literature reporting that a loss of function and/or reduction of Reelin is implicated in numerous neurodegenerative diseases. The present review summarizes the current state of the literature regarding the implication of Reelin and Reelin-mediated signaling during aging and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting Reelin as a possible target in the prevention or treatment of progressive neurodegeneration.
