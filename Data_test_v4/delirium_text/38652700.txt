38652700|t|A rare case of bilateral frontal lobe lesions due to thyroid storm.
38652700|a|Thyroid storm is a rare but well-known life-threatening complication that occurs due to acute exacerbation of thyrotoxicosis with the increased levels of circulating thyroid hormones. Reports of metabolic encephalopathy associated with thyroid storm are scarce. We describe the case of a 23-year-old male patient with no previous history of abnormal thyroid function who had consumed excessive amounts of alcohol before disease onset. The patient was found unconscious and febrile on a roadside by a passerby and was admitted to our hospital's emergency department. His primary clinical presentation included hyperthermia (40.8  C), nodal tachycardia (180 beats/min), seizures, coma, and hypoglycemia (2.18 mmol/L). The hypoglycemia was quickly corrected after admission, but his level of consciousness showed no improvement. With aggressive screening, the patient was found to have severe thyroid dysfunction (T3 = 6.67 nmol/L, T4 = 252.00 nmol/L, free T3 = 29.20 pmol/L, free T4 = 65.30 pmol/L, and TSH = 0.001 muIU/mL). After medical treatment, plasmapheresis, hemofiltration, and hemoperfusion, the patient showed substantial improvement in thyroid hormone levels and stabilization of vital signs, but the impaired consciousness and seizures persisted. Multiple computed tomography scans revealed brain abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging performed after tracheal extubation revealed bilateral frontal lobe lesions. We reported a case of metabolic encephalopathy in a patient with life-threatening thyroid storm and bilateral frontal lobe lesions. Hypoglycemia may have been involved in the development of encephalopathy in our patient. Health care providers should consider thyroid storm in the differential diagnosis of hyperthermia, seizures, and coma. Early plasmapheresis, hemofiltration, and hemoperfusion can lower T4 levels and improve prognosis in patients with thyroid storm and encephalopathy.
