38512688|t|Cultivation, Differentiation, and Lentiviral Transduction of Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (hiPSC)-Derived Glutamatergic Neurons for Studying Human Tau.
38512688|a|Tau pathology is a major hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases summarized under the term tauopathies. In most of these disorders,  such as Alzheimer's disease, the neuronal axonal microtubule-binding Tau protein becomes mislocalized to the somatodendritic compartment. In human disease, this missorting of Tau is accompanied by an abnormally high phosphorylation state of the Tau protein, and several downstream pathological consequences (e.g., loss of microtubules, degradation of postsynaptic spines, impaired synaptic transmission, neuronal death). While some mechanisms of Tau sorting, missorting, and associated pathologies have been addressed in rodent models, few studies have addressed human Tau in physiological disease-relevant human neurons. Thus, suitable human-derived in vitro models are necessary. This protocol provides a simple step-by-step protocol for generating homogeneous cultures of cortical glutamatergic neurons using an engineered Ngn2 transgene-carrying WTC11 iPSC line. We further demonstrate strategies to improve neuronal maturity, that is, synapse formation, Tau isoform expression, and neuronal activity by co-culturing hiPSC-derived glutamatergic neurons with mouse-derived astrocytes. Finally, we describe a simple protocol for high-efficiency lentiviral transduction of hiPSC-derived neurons at almost all stages of differentiation.
