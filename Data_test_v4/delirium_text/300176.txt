300176|t|Psychologic response to coronary artery bypass.
300176|a|This study reports the psychologic findings in 30 patients undergoing this operation. Approximately one third developed postcardiotomy delirium, an occurrence consistent with that after other forms of open-heart surgery. Acceptance of the operation as opposed to preoperative anxiety, depression or denial, adequate comprehension of the proposed procedure, and a stable postoperative environment seem associated with less postcardiotomy delirium. Preventive preoperative therapeutic suggestions based on these findings are given.
