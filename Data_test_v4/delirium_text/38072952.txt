38072952|t|Targeting NR1D1 in organ injury: challenges and prospects.
38072952|a|Nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1, also known as REV-ERBalpha) belongs to the nuclear receptor (NR) family, and is a heme-binding component of the circadian clock that consolidates circadian oscillators. In addition to repressing the transcription of multiple clock genes associated with circadian rhythms, NR1D1 has a wide range of downstream target genes that are intimately involved in many physiopathological processes, including autophagy, immunity, inflammation, metabolism and aging in multiple organs. This review focuses on the pivotal role of NR1D1 as a key transcription factor in the gene regulatory network, with particular emphasis on the milestones of the latest discoveries of NR1D1 ligands. NR1D1 is considered as a promising drug target for treating diverse diseases and may contribute to research on innovative biomarkers and therapeutic targets for organ injury-related diseases. Further research on NR1D1 ligands in prospective human trials may pave the way for their clinical application in many organ injury-related disorders.
