35036280|t|Informed or anxious: patient preferences for release of test results of increasing sensitivity on electronic patient portals.
35036280|a|Worldwide, governments and healthcare systems are moving towards increased transparency to improve care quality, increase patient engagement, and decrease costs. For example, the American 21st Century Cures Act Final Rule requires providers to grant patients access to their electronic medical record. Unfortunately, limited research guides release of test results to online patient portals, especially concerning emotionally sensitive information. To address this gap, we surveyed the largest patient sample published to date. This cross-sectional survey project was conducted by the Market Research & Insights and Office of Patient Experience departments at a large academic medical center. Data were analyzed in SPSS using descriptive statistics and Z-tests. Of 8030 respondents, 74% and 57% accepted first learning their results online for cholesterol and strep throat tests, respectively. Most prefer in-person appointments for more serious tests detecting cancer (54%) and fetal miscarriage (53%). Excluding sexually transmitted disease (STD) testing, there are no clinically significant differences in preference between respondents previously diagnosed with the condition in question and respondents without such experience. When weighing the possibility of a 3-week wait to hear from their provider, most patients want automatic release of cholesterol (94%), strep throat (90%), genetic (68%), and STD (60%) test results, but the majority say it is unacceptable to receive Alzheimer's (52%), fetal miscarriage (51%), and cancer (59%) test results this way. Electronic results release is acceptable for less serious tests, but not for more consequential tests. Providers should consider patient preferences when developing policies to increase healthcare transparency.
