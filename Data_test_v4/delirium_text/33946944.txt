33946944|t|Genetic Evidence Supporting Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 Signalling as a Pharmacological Target for Cardiometabolic Outcomes and Alzheimer's Disease.
33946944|a|Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a human metabolic hormone whose effects include modification of macronutrient preference and energy homeostasis. In animal models, FGF21 has been shown to have beneficial effects on cardiometabolic outcomes, Alzheimer's disease risk and lifespan. In this study, the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs838133 in the FGF21 gene region was leveraged to investigate the potential clinical effects of targeting FGF21. The FGF21 G allele was associated with lower intakes of total sugars and alcohol, and higher intakes of protein and fat as well as favourable with lipid levels, blood pressure traits, waist-to-hip ratio, systemic inflammation, cardiovascular outcomes, Alzheimer's disease risk and lifespan. These findings may be used to anticipate the effects of pharmacologically increasing FGF21 signalling.
