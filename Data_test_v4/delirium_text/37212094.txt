37212094|t|Midlife Neuropsychological Profiles and Associated Vascular Risk: The Bogalusa Heart Study.
37212094|a|BACKGROUND: Individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) often present with coexisting vascular pathology that is expressed to different degrees and can lead to clinical heterogeneity. OBJECTIVE: To examine the utility of unsupervised statistical clustering approaches in identifying neuropsychological (NP) test performance subtypes that closely correlate with carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in midlife. METHODS: A hierarchical agglomerative and k-means clustering analysis based on NP scores (standardized for age, sex, and race) was conducted among 1,203 participants (age 48+-5.3 years) from the Bogalusa Heart Study. Regression models assessed the association between cIMT >=50th percentile and NP profiles, and global cognitive score (GCS) tertiles for sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Three NP profiles were identified: Mixed-low performance [16%, n = 192], scores >=1 SD below the mean on immediate, delayed free recall, recognition verbal memory, and information processing; Average [59%, n = 704]; and Optimal [26%, n = 307] NP performance. Participants with greater cIMT were more likely to have a Mixed-low profile [OR = 3.10, 95% CI (2.13, 4.53), p < 0.001] compared to Optimal. After adjusting for education and cardiovascular (CV) risks, results remained. The association with GCS tertiles was more attenuated [lowest (34%, n = 407) versus highest (33%, n = 403) tertile: adjusted OR = 1.66, 95% CI (1.07, 2.60), p = 0.024]. CONCLUSION: As early as midlife, individuals with higher subclinical atherosclerosis were more likely to be in the Mixed-low profile, underscoring the potential malignancy of CV risk as related to NP test performance, suggesting that classification approaches may aid in identifying those at risk for AD/vascular dementia spectrum illness.
