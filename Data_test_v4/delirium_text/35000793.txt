35000793|t|Long-term outcomes after NeuroCOVID: A 6-month follow-up study on 60 patients.
35000793|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Long-term outcomes after neurological manifestations due to COVID-19 are poorly known. The aim of our study was to evaluate the functional outcome and identify the risk factors of neurologic sequelae after COVID-19 associated with neurological manifestations (NeuroCOVID). METHODS: We conducted a multi-center observational study six months after the acute neurological symptoms in patients from the French NeuroCOVID hospital-based registry. RESULTS: We obtained data on 60 patients. NeuroCOVID had a negative impact on the quality of life (QoL) of 49% of patients. Age was a predictor of residual QoL impairment (OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01-1.13, p=0.026). At six months, a significant residual disability was found in 51.7% of patients, and impaired cognition in 68.9% of cases. The main persistent neuropsychiatric manifestations were a persistent smell/taste disorder in 45% of patients, memory complaints in 34% of patients, anxiety or depression in 32% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: NeuroCOVID likely carries a high risk of long-term neuropsychiatric disability. Long-term care and special attention should be given to COVID-19 patients, especially if they had neurological manifestations during acute infection.
