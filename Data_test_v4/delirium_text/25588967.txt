25588967|a|A new series of-fluoro chalcones-substituted amino-alkyl derivatives (3a~3l) were designed, synthesized, characterized and evaluated for the inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. The results showed that the alteration of fluorine atom position and amino-alkyl groups markedly influenced the activity and the selectivity of chalcone derivates in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. Among them, compound 3l possesses the most potent inhibitory against acetylcholinesterase (IC50  = 0.21 +- 0.03 mumol/L), and the highest selectivity for acetylcholinesterase over butyrylcholinesterase (IC50 (BuChE)/IC50 (AChE) = 65.0). Molecular modeling and enzyme kinetic study on compound 3l supported its dual acetylcholinesterase inhibitory profile, simultaneously binding at the catalytic active and peripheral anionic site of the enzyme.
