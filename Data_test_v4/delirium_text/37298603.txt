37298603|t|Transcranial Electromagnetic Wave Treatment: A Fountain of Healthy Longevity?
37298603|a|Most diseases of older age have as their common denominator a dysfunctional immune system, wherein a low, chronic level of inflammation is present due to an imbalance of pro-inflammatory cytokines over anti-inflammatory cytokines that develops during aging ("inflamm-aging"). A gerotherapeutic that can restore the immune balance to that shared by young/middle-aged adults and many centenarians could reduce the risk of those age-related diseases and increase healthy longevity. In this perspectives paper, we discuss potential longevity interventions that are being evaluated and compare them to a novel gerotherapeutic currently being evaluated in humans-Transcranial Electromagnetic Wave Treatment (TEMT). TEMT is provided non-invasively and safety through a novel bioengineered medical device-the MemorEM-that allows for near complete mobility during in-home treatments. Daily TEMT to mild/moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients over a 2-month period rebalanced 11 of 12 cytokines in blood back to that of normal aged adults. A very similar TEMT-induced rebalancing of cytokines occurred in the CSF/brain for essentially all seven measurable cytokines. Overall inflammation in both blood and brain was dramatically reduced by TEMT over a 14-27 month period, as measured by C-Reactive Protein. In these same AD patients, a reversal of cognitive impairment was observed at 2 months into treatment, while cognitive decline was stopped over a 21/2 year period of TEMT. Since most age-related diseases have the commonality of immune imbalance, it is reasonable to postulate that TEMT could rebalance the immune system in many age-related diseases as it appears to do in AD. We propose that TEMT has the potential to reduce the risk/severity of age-related diseases by rejuvenating the immune system to a younger age, resulting in reduced brain/body inflammation and a substantial increase in healthy longevity.
