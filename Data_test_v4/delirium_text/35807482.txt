35807482|t|Cluster-Assembled Nanoporous Super-Hydrophilic Smart Surfaces for On-Target Capturing and Processing of Biological Samples for Multi-Dimensional MALDI-MS.
35807482|a|Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) on cluster-assembled super-hydrophilic nanoporous titania films deposited on hydrophobic conductive-polymer substrates feature a unique combination of surface properties that significantly improve the possibilities of capturing and processing biological samples before and during the MALDI-MS analysis without changing the selected sample target (multi-dimensional MALDI-MS). In contrast to pure hydrophobic surfaces, such films promote a remarkable biologically active film porosity at the nanoscale due to the soft assembling of ultrafine atomic clusters. This unique combination of nanoscale porosity and super-hydrophilicity provides room for effective sample capturing, while the hydrophilic-hydrophobic discontinuity at the border of the dot-patterned film acts as a wettability-driven containment for sample/reagent droplets. In the present work, we evaluate the performance of such advanced surface engineered reactive containments for their benefit in protein sample processing and characterization. We shortly discuss the advantages resulting from the introduction of the described chips in the MALDI-MS workflow in the healthcare/clinical context and in MALDI-MS bioimaging (MALDI-MSI).
