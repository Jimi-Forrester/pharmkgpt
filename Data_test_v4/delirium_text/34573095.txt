34573095|t|Nrf2 and Heme Oxygenase-1 Involvement in Atherosclerosis Related Oxidative Stress.
34573095|a|Atherosclerosis remains the underlying process responsible for cardiovascular diseases and the high mortality rates associated. This chronic inflammatory disease progresses with the formation of occlusive atherosclerotic plaques over the inner walls of vascular vessels, with oxidative stress being an important element of this pathology. Oxidation of low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDL) induces endothelial dysfunction, foam cell activation, and inflammatory response, resulting in the formation of fatty streaks in the atherosclerotic wall. With this in mind, different approaches aim to reduce oxidative damage as a strategy to tackle the progression of atherosclerosis. Special attention has been paid in recent years to the transcription factor Nrf2 and its downstream-regulated protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), both known to provide protection against atherosclerotic injury. In the current review, we summarize the involvement of oxidative stress in atherosclerosis, focusing on the role that these antioxidant molecules exert, as well as the potential therapeutic strategies applied to enhance their antioxidant and antiatherogenic properties.
