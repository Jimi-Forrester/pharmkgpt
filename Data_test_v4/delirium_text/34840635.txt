34840635|a|BACKGROUND: Acute postoperative pain (APP) has a high incidence in breast surgery, and opioids are the most commonly used drugs for its management; however, they are not free from systemic side effects, which may increase comorbidity. In the past few years, opioid-free anaesthesia has been favoured with promising results. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive study including 71 patients who underwent breast cancer surgery. The opioid group (n = 41) received fentanyl for induction, remifentanil for maintenance, and rescue morphine before waking up, whereas the ketamine group (n = 30) received a ketamine bolus for induction followed by continuous ketamine infusion during surgery. Later, the presence and intensity of pain were registered, using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS 1-10) for pain, at different times in the recovery room, at 24 hours and at 3 months. RESULTS: Administration of ketamine is more effective than opioid use for APP prevention in breast cancer surgery because the ketamine group presented with less pain than the opioid group (p < 0.05) at all measured times. When there was pain, patients in the ketamine group gave a lower score to its intensity (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine could reduce the incidence of APP in breast cancer surgery, compared to opioids.
