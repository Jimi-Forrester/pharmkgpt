38452039|a|In addition to amyloid and tau pathology, elevated systemic vascular risk, white matter injury, and reduced cerebral blood flow contribute to late-life cognitive decline. Given the strong collinearity among these parameters, we proposed a framework to extract the independent latent features underlying cognitive decline using the Harvard Aging Brain Study (N = 166 cognitively unimpaired older adults at baseline). We used the following measures from the baseline visit: cortical amyloid, inferior temporal cortex tau, relative cerebral blood flow, white matter hyperintensities, peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity, and Framingham Heart Study cardiovascular disease risk. We used exploratory factor analysis to extract orthogonal factors from these variables and their interactions. These factors were used in a regression model to explain longitudinal Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite-5 (PACC) decline (follow-up = 8.5 +-2.7 years). We next examined whether gray matter volume atrophy acts as a mediator of factors and PACC decline. Latent factors of systemic vascular risk, white matter injury, and relative cerebral blood flow independently explain cognitive decline beyond amyloid and tau. Gray matter volume atrophy mediates these associations with the strongest effect on white matter injury. These results suggest that systemic vascular risk contributes to cognitive decline beyond current markers of cerebrovascular injury, amyloid, and tau.
