9172166|t|A beta 42 is the predominant form of amyloid beta-protein in the brains of short-term survivors of head injury.
9172166|a|Fatal head injury results in the formation of diffuse parenchymal deposits of amyloid beta-protein (A beta) in the brains of approximately 30% of individuals. We used carboxyl terminal-specific antisera to examine the exact nature of these deposits in paraffin sections of neocortex from seven head-injured patients. Immunostaining for A beta 42 was observed in all parenchymal deposits whereas staining for A beta 40, the form of the protein which predominates in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, was seen in only a small proportion of deposits. The relative paucity of A beta 40 suggests that post-traumatic deposits do not arise as a result of passive leakage from damaged cerebral blood vessels but are similar to the early A beta 42 parenchymal deposits seen in Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.
