32444146|a|BACKGROUND: Exercise is considered as an important intervention for treatment and prevention of several diseases, such as osteoarthritis, obesity, hypertension, and Alzheimer's disease. This review summarizes decadal exercise intervention studies with various rat models across 6 major systems to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the effects that exercise brought. METHODS: PubMed was utilized as the data source. To collect research articles, we used the following terms to create the search: (exercise [Title] OR physical activity [Title] OR training [Title]) AND (rats [Title/Abstract] OR rat [Title/Abstract] OR rattus [Title/Abstract]). To best cover targeted studies, publication dates were limited to "within 11 years." The exercise intervention methods used for different diseases were sorted according to the mode, frequency, and intensity of exercise. RESULTS: The collected articles were categorized into studies related to 6 systems or disease types: motor system (17 articles), metabolic system (110 articles), cardiocerebral vascular system (171 articles), nervous system (71 articles), urinary system (2 articles), and cancer (21 articles). Our review found that, for different diseases, exercise intervention mostly had a positive effect. However, the most powerful effect was achieved by using a specific mode of exercise that addressed the characteristics of the disease. CONCLUSION: As a model animal, rats not only provide a convenient resource for studying human diseases but also provide the possibility for exploring the molecular mechanisms of exercise intervention on diseases. This review also aims to provide exercise intervention frameworks and optimal exercise dose recommendations for further human exercise intervention research.
