34215561|a|BACKGROUND: The characteristics, outcomes, and risk factors for in-hospital death of critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) have been described in patients from Europe, North America and China, but there are few data from COVID-19 patients in Middle Eastern countries. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics, outcomes, and risk factors for in-hospital death of critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the ICUs of a University Hospital in Egypt. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted between April 28 and July 29, 2020 to two ICUs dedicated to the isolation and treatment of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in Cairo University Hospitals. Diagnosis was confirmed in all patients using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on respiratory samples and radiologic evidence of pneumonia. RESULTS: Of the 177 patients admitted to the ICUs during the study period, 160 patients had COVID-19 pneumonia and were included in the analysis (mean age: 60 +- 14 years, 67.5% males); 23% of patients had no known comorbidities. The overall ICU and hospital mortality rates were both 24.4%. The ICU and hospital lengths of stay were 7 (25-75% interquartile range: 4-10) and 10 (25-75% interquartile range: 7-14) days, respectively. In a multivariable analysis with in-hospital death as the dependent variable, ischemic heart disease, history of smoking, and secondary bacterial pneumonia were independently associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death, whereas greater PaO2/FiO2 ratio on admission to the ICU was associated with a lower risk. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, ischemic heart disease, history of smoking, and secondary bacterial pneumonia were independently associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death.
