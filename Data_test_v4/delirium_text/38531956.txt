38531956|a|Darier disease (DD) is a rare monogenetic skin disorder with limited data on its potential association with neurological disorders. This study aimed to investigate the association between DD and neurological disorders, specifically Parkinson's disease, dementias, and epilepsy. Using Swedish national registers in a period spanning between 1977 and 2013, 935 individuals with DD were compared with up to 100 comparison individuals each, randomly selected from the general population based on birth year, sex, and county of residence at the time of the first diagnosis of DD. Individuals with DD had increased risks of being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (RR 2.1, CI 1.1; 4.4), vascular dementia (RR 2.1, CI 1.0; 4.2), and epilepsy, (RR 2.5, CI 1.8; 3.5). No association of DD with other dementias were detected. This study demonstrates a new association between DD and neurodegenerative disorders and epilepsy, underlining the need for increased awareness, interdisciplinary collaboration, and further research to understand the underlying mechanisms. Early identification and management of neurological complications in DD patients could improve treatment strategies and patient outcomes. The findings also highlight the role of SERCA2 in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders, offering new targets for future research and potentials for novel treatments.
