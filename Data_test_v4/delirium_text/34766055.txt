34766055|t|Critical neurological features of COVID-19: Role of imaging methods and biosensors for effective diagnosis.
34766055|a|COVID-19 is a respiratory infection that has been declared as a global health crisis by the WHO. It mainly affects the respiratory system. Apart from respiratory system, it also affects other organs as well including the brain. Numerous emerging reports have demonstrated that the COVID-19 has detrimental effects on neurological functions, and can lead to severe impairment of the central nervous system (CNS). The neurological manifestations linked with COVID-19 include headache, anosmia, encephalitis, epileptic seizures, Guillain-Barre syndrome, stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage alongwith multiple others complications. The CNS related complications may be severe and are linked with poor diagnosis which may worsen the condition. Therefore, there is a need to precisely understand the neurological sequelae along with upcoming clinical outcomes. Here, we present a brief review of the neurological complications and symptoms associated with COVID-19 along with brain imaging findings. Further, we have discussed about the emerging biosensing approaches which may aid in rapid, precise and mass diagnosis of COVID-19.
