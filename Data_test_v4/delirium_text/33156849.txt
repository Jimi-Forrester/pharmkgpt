33156849|t|The impact of delayed mobilization on post-discharge outcomes after emergency abdominal surgery: A prospective cohort study in older patients.
33156849|a|Surgeons are increasingly treating seniors with complex care needs who are at high-risk of readmission and functional decline. Yet, the prognostic importance of post-operative mobilization in older surgical patients is under-investigated and remains unclear. Thus, we evaluated the relationship between post-operative mobilization and events after hospital discharge in older people. Overall, 306 survivors of emergency abdominal surgery aged >=65y who required help with <3 activities of daily living were prospectively followed at two Canadian tertiary-care hospitals. Time until mobilization after surgery was attained from hospital charts and a priori defined as 'delayed' (>=36h) or 'early' (<36h). Primary outcomes for 30-day and 6-month all-cause readmission/death after discharge were assessed in multivariable logistic regression. Patients had a mean age of 76 +- 7.7 years, 45% were women, 41% were 'vulnerable-to-moderately-frail', according to the Clinical Frailty Scale. Most common reasons for admission were gallstones (23%), intestinal obstructions (21%), and hernia (17%). Median time to post-operative mobilization was 19h (interquartile range 9-35); 74 (24%) patients had delayed mobilization. Delayed mobilization was independently associated with higher risk of 30-day readmission/death (19 [26%] vs. 22 [10%], P<0.001; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.24, 95%CI 0.99-5.06, P = 0.05), but this was not statistically significant at 6-months (38 [51%] vs. 64 [28%], P<0.001; aOR 1.72, 95%CI 0.91-3.25, P = 0.1). One-quarter of older surgical patients stayed in bed for 1.5 days post-operatively. Delayed mobilization was associated with increased risk of short-term readmission/death. As older, more frail patients undergo surgery, mobilization of older surgical patients remains an understudied post-operative factor. Trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02233153.
