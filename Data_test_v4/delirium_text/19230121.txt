19230121|t|Caffeine: neuroprotective functions in cognition and Alzheimer's disease.
19230121|a|Alzheimer's disease is a common problem in our elderly population. Although research is leading to improvements in our understanding of the underlying biology, we still have little understanding of the environmental risk factors associated with this disorder. Caffeine, an easily modifiable environmental factor, may have a protective effect on the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease. This article reviews the association between caffeine from both a biologic and epidemiologic perspective. Further studies are needed to determine whether caffeine consumption could have a major affect on the development of Alzheimer's disease or age-related cognitive decline.
