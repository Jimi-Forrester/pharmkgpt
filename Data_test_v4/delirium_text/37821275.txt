37821275|t|A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of delirium in burn injury compared to other surgical specialities.
37821275|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is an acute cerebral disorder characterised by a disturbance in cognition, attention, and awareness. Often, it's undiagnosed and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. For burn patients, the reported prevalence ranges from 16% to 39%, with a multifactorial aetiology, increasing when intensive care is required. A direct comparison of delirium between surgical specialities has not been made. AIM: 1. To audit the use of the 4AT for those who become delirious during their stay. 2. Assess the proportion of patients diagnosed with delirium during hospitalisation by surgical specialities. 3. Identification of the factors associated with delirium in surgical patients. METHODS: Investigators at a single centre conducted a two-phase study. An initial retrospective audit of delirious patients under burns, general, and orthopaedic specialities over 16months, as defined by ICD-10 coding, identified compliance screening with the 4 A's Test. This informed the design of a retrospective, observational cohort study to compare factors associated with delirium and statistical comparison between four specialities to identify delirium-associated factor, where an analysis corrects for age. RESULTS: 37% of patients with an ICD-10 code indicating delirium had a 4AT test completed. Speciality, number of operations, LOS, ICU hours, age, and discharge destination were all statistically significant independent variables. When all other variables were equal, burns had the highest predicted probability of delirium diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Further analysis to identify and diagnose across the specialties is required. From a patient viewpoint, their LOS, ICU hours, and operations are increased for patients coded as delirious compared to non-delirious across the specialities. On a hospital level, the mean difference in cost for a delirious compared to a non-delirious patient is AU$9317. Despite the low incidence of delirium amongst the observed specialities, burns patients were most likely to develop delirium when demographic and clinical profiles were the same, and were more likely to develop delirium at a younger age and if in ICU.
