35616950|t|Association Between Retinal Layer Thickness and Cognitive Decline in Older Adults.
35616950|a|Importance: Retinal layer thickness is hypothesized to be related to cognitive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD). However, longitudinal cohort studies of the healthy older population are scarce. Objective: To investigate the association between retinal layer thickness and cognitive impairment and future cognitive decline in a community-based population cohort. Design, Setting, and Participants: A total of 430 randomly sampled community-dwelling Korean individuals 60 years or older participated in the baseline assessment (mean [SD], 76.3 [6.6] years) 215 of whom completed a mean (SD) of 5.4 (0.6) years (range, 4.1-6.2 years) of follow-up. Using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, the study team assessed the thickness of 6 retinal layers in the macular region, the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layers (RNFLs), and the subfoveal choroid at baseline. Exposures: Age, sex, education, diabetes, hypertension, and apolipoprotein E4 gene status. Main Outcomes and Measures: Retinal layer thickness and cognitive function test scores were analyzed. Results: This study included 430 participants (female, 208 [48.6%]). Baseline macular RNFL thickness was associated with baseline Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) score (coefficient [beta] = 0.077; 95% CI, 0.054-0.100; P = .04 for total macular area) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (coefficient [beta] = 0.082; 95% CI, 0.063-0.101; P = .03 for total macular area). A thinner baseline total macular RNFL thickness (lowest quartile, <231 mum) was associated with a larger decline in the CERAD and MMSE scores during the follow-up period (P = .003 and P = .01, respectively). Furthermore, participants with baseline total macular RNFL thickness below the lowest quartile cutoff value presented a greater decline in cognitive scores and a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease than those with RNFL thickness above the lowest quartile cutoff value. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, macular RNFL thickness could be used as a prognostic biomarker of long-term cognitive decline in adults 60 years or older. However, to confirm these results, further large-scale population-based studies should be performed.
