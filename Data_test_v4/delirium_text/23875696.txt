23875696|t|Novel gamma-secretase modulators for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: a review focusing on patents from 2010 to 2012.
23875696|a|INTRODUCTION: gamma-Secretase is the enzyme responsible for the final step of amyloid precursor protein proteolysis to generate Abeta peptides including Abeta42 which is believed to be a toxic species involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. gamma-Secretase modulators (GSMs) have been shown to selectively lower Abeta42 production without affecting total Abeta levels or the formation of gamma-secretase substrate intracellular domains such as APP intracellular domain and Notch intracellular domain. Therefore, GSMs have emerged as an important therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD. AREAS COVERED: The literature covering novel GSMs will be reviewed focusing on patents from 2010 to 2012. EXPERT OPINION: During the last review period (2008 - 2010) considerable progress was made developing GSMs with improved potency for lowering Abeta42 levels, but most of the compounds resided in unfavorable central nervous system (CNS) drug space. In this review period (2010 - 2012), there is a higher percentage of potent GSM chemical matter that resides in favorable CNS drug space. It is anticipated that clinical candidates will emerge out of this cohort that will be able to test the GSM mechanism of action in the clinic.
