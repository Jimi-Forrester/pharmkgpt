33924036|a|(1) Background: The study aimed to analyze the effectiveness of clinical pharmacist services on drug-related problems (DRPs) and patient outcomes in inpatients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). (2) Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, the participants in the intervention group received pharmacist services, including medication reconciliation, medication evaluation and management, and discharge pharmaceutical care transition services. Participants in the control group received usual care. The primary outcome was the number of DRPs per patient at discharge. (3) Results: The baseline characteristics of 100 participants included the following: mean age, 52.5 years; median eGFR, 9.2 mL/min/1.73 m2. The number of DRPs in the intervention group during hospitalization increased significantly with decreasing eGFR (PR, 0.970; 95% CI, 0.951-0.989) and an increasing number of unintentional medication discrepancies at admission (PR, 1.294; 95% CI, 1.034-1.620). At discharge, the number of DRPs per patient was 0.94 +- 1.03 and 1.96 +- 1.25 in the intervention and control groups, respectively (p < 0.001). The service had a significant effect on the reduction of the unintentional discrepancies at discharge (p < 0.001). (4) Conclusion: Hospital pharmacists play an important role in the prevention of DRPs at discharge and unintentional medication discrepancies in inpatients with CKD.
