38474065|t|Quantification of Circulating Cell-Free DNA in Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease Patients.
38474065|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders globally and leads to an excessive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain. Circulating cell-free DNA (ccf-DNA) are double-stranded DNA fragments of different sizes and origins that are released into the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) due to cell death (i.e., necrosis and apoptosis) or are actively released by viable cells via exocytosis and NETosis. Using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), we comprehensively analyzed and distinguished circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ccf mtDNA) and circulating cell-free nuclear DNA (ccfDNA) in the serum and CSF of PD and control patients. The quantitative analysis of serum ccf-DNA in PD patients demonstrated a significant increase in ccf mtDNA and ccfDNA compared to that in healthy control patients and a significantly higher copy of ccf mtDNA when compared to ccfDNA. Next, the serum ccf mtDNA levels significantly increased in male PD patients compared to those in healthy male controls. Furthermore, CSF ccf mtDNA in PD patients increased significantly compared to ccfDNA, and ccf mtDNA decreased in PD patients more than it did in healthy controls. These decreases were not statistically significant but were in agreement with previous data. Interestingly, ccf mtDNA increased in healthy control patients in both serum and CSF as compared to ccfDNA. The small sample size of serum and CSF were the main limitations of this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study on serum and CSF of PD patients using ddPCR to indicate the distribution of the copy number of ccf mtDNA as well as ccfDNA. If validated, we suggest that ccf mtDNA has greater potential than ccfDNA to lead the development of novel treatments for PD patients.
