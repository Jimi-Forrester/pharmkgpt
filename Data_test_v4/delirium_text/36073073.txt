36073073|a|BACKGROUND:  Residential care homes for older persons were especially affected during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic lockdowns which resulted in limited social interactions and service provision. Communication became challenging due to the prophylactic use of masks and social distancing. OBJECTIVES:  This qualitative research study set out to explore audiological service considerations in residential care homes for older persons during the COVID-19 restrictions. METHOD:  Through purposive sampling, nine managers from residential care homes for older persons in Johannesburg participated in semi-structured, online interviews. The transcriptions of these recorded interviews underwent thematic analysis. RESULTS:  Managers employed various strategies to attend to residents' audiological needs, audiological health, hearing aid use, and hearing aid provision. Furthermore, it transpired that other health related services were prioritised over audiological services in general, but especially during the pandemic lockdowns. Managers reported that staff had to use various communication strategies due to COVID-19 precautions and that masks and social distancing made communication more challenging for residents with hearing loss. Moreover, isolation and modified service provision were extremely taxing on residents. CONCLUSION:  This study highlights the need for continued audiological services at residential care homes, but also the need to balance audiological needs with other health needs because these seem to be prioritised over hearing loss, especially in this population who may have limited agency and choice in the health care options available to them. Furthermore, adapted strategies need to be considered to support communication considering COVID-19 precautions so that communicative difficulties do not exacerbate lockdown isolation.
