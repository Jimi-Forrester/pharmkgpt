38223334|t|Outcome Prediction by Combining Corticospinal Tract Lesion Load with Diffusion-tensor Fractional Anisotropy in Patients after Hemorrhagic Stroke.
38223334|a|Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the predictive precision of combining the corticospinal tract lesion load (CST-LL) with the diffusion-tensor fractional anisotropy of the corticospinal tract (CST-FA) in the lesioned hemispheres regarding motor outcomes. Methods: Patients with putaminal and/or thalamic hemorrhage who had undergone computed tomography (CT) soon after onset in our hospital were retrospectively enrolled. The CST-LL was calculated after registration of the CT images to a standard brain. Diffusion-tensor imaging was performed during the second week after onset. Standardized automated tractography was employed to calculate the CST-FA. Outcomes were assessed at discharge from our affiliated rehabilitation facility using total scores of the motor component of the Stroke Impairment Assessment Set (SIAS-motor total; null to full, 0 to 25). Multivariate regression analysis was performed with CST-LL and CST-FA as explanatory variables and SIAS-motor total as a target value. Results: Twenty-five patients participated in this study. SIAS-motor total ranged from 0 to 25 (median, 17). CST-LL ranged from 0.298 to 7.595 (median, 2.522) mL, and the lesion-side CST-FA ranged from 0.211 to 0.530 (median, 0.409). Analysis revealed that both explanatory variables were detected as statistically significant contributory factors. The estimated t values indicated that the contributions of these two variables were almost equal. The obtained regression model accounted for 63.9% of the variability of the target value. Conclusions: Incorporation of the CST-LL with the lesion-side CST-FA enhances the precision of the stroke outcome prediction model.
