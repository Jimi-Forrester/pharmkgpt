34312579|a|PURPOSE: Resuming joint replacement arthroplasty amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown has come with various challenges that had to be dealt with utmost caution. Patients with severe arthritis experiencing a state of intolerable pain, could not be left unaddressed. Guidelines published by surgical associations, collaborative surgical author groups including public health organisations had to be modified to suit the Indian scenario and obtain optimal functional outcomes in these patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of 147 patients who underwent arthroplasty during the pandemic (March 2020 to April 2021), for either primary or secondary arthritis, was performed. We assess the efficacy and safety of the newly established Institutional surgical peri-operative protocol at our tertiary care centre in the National Capital Region, India in response to COVID-19 guidelines. The primary outcome measures appraised was 30-day mortality and the secondary outcome measures included length of stay, peri-operative complications and COVID-19 infection. RESULT: The most common indication for arthroplasty during the pandemic was neglected trauma. One patient died, due to myocardial infarction during the follow-up period. About 67% of patients were discharged to their usual residence within 7 days of admission. Two patients tested positive for COVID-19 postoperatively, but none required Intensive Care Unit admission. CONCLUSION: Joint replacement arthroplasty can be undertaken safely with diligent patient selection, application of a stringent COVID appropriate behaviour and a 'ring-fenced' peri-operative pathway.
