37270812|t|RAGE Against the Glycation Machine in Synucleinopathies: Time to Explore New Questions.
37270812|a|Oligomerization and aggregation of misfolded forms of alpha-synuclein are believed to be key molecular mechanisms in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies, so extensive research has attempted to understand these processes. Among diverse post-translational modifications that impact alpha-synuclein aggregation, glycation may take place at several lysine sites and modify alpha-synuclein oligomerization, toxicity, and clearance. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is considered a key regulator of chronic neuroinflammation through microglial activation in response to advanced glycation end-products, such as carboxy-ethyl-lysine, or carboxy-methyl-lysine. The presence of RAGE in the midbrain of PD patients has been reported in the last decades and this receptor was proposed to have a role in sustaining PD neuroinflammation. However, different PD animal models demonstrated that RAGE is preferentially expressed in neurons and astrocytes, while recent evidence demonstrated that fibrillar, non-glycated alpha-synuclein binds to RAGE. Here, we summarize the available data on alpha-synuclein glycation and RAGE in the context of PD, and discuss about the questions yet to be answered that may increase our understanding of the molecular bases of PD and synucleinopathies.
