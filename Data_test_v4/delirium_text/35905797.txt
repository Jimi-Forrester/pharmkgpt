35905797|a|BACKGROUND: Frailty is prevalent amongst geriatric inpatients and worsens clinical outcomes. Determinants of admission frailty and changes in frailty severity are potential targets for intervention. OBJECTIVE: To identify characteristics associated with frailty severity at admission and change in frailty severity during geriatric rehabilitation. METHODS: The observational, prospective, longitudinal inception cohort REStORing health of acutely unwell adulTs (RESORT) includes geriatric rehabilitation inpatients. Demographic, medical, nutritional, functional, and psychological characteristics were analysed according to admission Clinical Frailty Scale. Linear and multinomial logistic regression prediction models identified admission characteristics predicting change in frailty severity during rehabilitation. RESULTS: A total 1716 inpatients (median age [IQR] 83.4 [77.7-88.6] years, 56.4 % females) were included. Poorer admission medical, nutritional, functional, and psychological status was associated with more severe frailty. Cardiac admissions, higher Cumulative Illness Rating Scale, greater number of medications, and better Short Physical Performance Battery at admission predicted improved frailty severity. Admission cognitive impairment, delirium, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety predicted worsened frailty severity. Explained variation was low. CONCLUSIONS: Frailer geriatric rehabilitation inpatients have more complicated disease and impaired nutritional, physical, and psychological markers. Admission cognitive impairment, delirium, comorbidity, and anxiety predict worsening frailty during rehabilitation, and require prompt management.
