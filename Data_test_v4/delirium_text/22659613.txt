22659613|t|AD gene 3-D: moving past single layer genetic information to map novel loci involved in Alzheimer's disease.
22659613|a|Over the past 5 years, there has been considerable advancement in the genetics of Alzheimer's disease. This review will provide an overview of the current state of the field for analysis of genetic variation and Alzheimer's disease. Highlighted in this review will be the results from some of the more conventional approaches, including linkage and association studies, as well as an overview of an alternate approach: eQTL analysis. The emphasis will be on taking genomics to the next level by applying additional datasets to truly create maps of a 3-dimensional Alzheimer's genome by including the downstream effects of risk variation.
