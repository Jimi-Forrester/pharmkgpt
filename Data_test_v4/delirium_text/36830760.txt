36830760|t|A Vegetarian Diet Significantly Changes Plasma Kynurenine Concentrations.
36830760|a|Tryptophan is an essential amino acid and a precursor of a number of physiologically important metabolites, including serotonin, melatonin, tryptamine, and kynurenines. We assessed tryptophan, kynurenines, and vitamin B2 and B6, as well as biomarkers of liver function and inflammation, in a group of 158 female omnivores and vegetarians aged 18-40 years. The majority of women were omnivores, and 22% were vegetarians. Vegetarians had 25% lower serum ALT, significantly higher pyridoxal concentrations, and significantly lower plasma concentrations of most kynurenines, varying from 8% lower concentrations of median plasma kynurenine to 42% lower concentrations of plasma xanthurenic acid, compared to omnivores. No significant differences were observed in vitamin B2 status or in inflammation markers, C-reactive protein and neopterin between the groups. Vegetarians had lower levels of several plasma kynurenines compared to omnivores. The reason for this is unknown; however, lower ALT concentrations, suggesting a better liver status, and a more favourable vitamin B6 status might be contributing factors.
