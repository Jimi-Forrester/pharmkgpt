36505554|a|Context: Thirty-day readmissions are used to gauge health care accountability, which occurs as part of the natural course of the illness or due to avoidable fallacies during the index admission. The utility of this metric is unknown in older adults from developing countries. Aim: To ascertain the unplanned 30-day readmission rate and enumerate predictors of avoidable hospital readmission among early (0-7 days) and late (8-30 days) readmissions. Settings and Design: A retrospective chart audit of 140 older adults who were readmitted to a premier tertiary care teaching hospital under Geriatrics from the neighboring states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Kerala were undertaken. Methods and Materials: Data from health records were collected from the hospital electronic database from May 2015 to May 2020. The data was reviewed to determine the 30-day readmission rate and to ascertain the predictors of avoidable readmissions among both early and late readmissions. Results: Out of 2698 older adults admitted to the geriatric wards from the catchment areas, the calculated 30-day hospital readmission rate was 5.18%, and 41.4% of these readmissions were potentially avoidable. The median duration from discharge to the first readmission was ten days (Interquartile range: 5-18 days). Patients had to spend INR 44,000 (approximately 602 USD) towards avoidable readmission. The most common causes for readmission included an exacerbation, reactivation, or progression of a previously existing disease (55.7%), followed by the emergence of a new disease unrelated to index admission (43.2%). Fifty-eight patients (41.4%) were readmitted within seven days following discharge. Early readmissions were seen in patients with malignancies [8 (13.5%) vs. 4 (4.8%); P = 0.017], on insulin (P = 0.04) or on antidepressants (P = 0.01). Advanced age was found to be an independent predictor of avoidable early readmission (OR 2.99 95%CI 1.34-6.62, P = 0.007), and admission to a general ward (as compared to those admitted in a private ward) was an independent predictor of early readmissions (OR 2.99 95%CI 1.34-6.62, P = 0.007). Conclusion: The 30-day readmission rate in a geriatric unit in a tertiary care hospital was 5.2%. Advanced age was considered to be an independent predictor of avoidable early readmission. Future prospective research on avoidable readmissions should be undertaken to delineate factors affecting 30-day avoidable hospital readmissions in developing nations.
