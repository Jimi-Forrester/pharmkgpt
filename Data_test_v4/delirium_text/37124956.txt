37124956|t|Immunohistochemical Analysis of Mitochondrial Ferritin in the Midbrain of Patients with Parkinson's Disease.
37124956|a|Mitochondrial ferritin (FtMt) is an endogenous iron-storage protein localized in the mitochondria. FtMt is mainly observed in restricted tissues, such as those in the testis, islets of Langerhans, and brain. Further, it may protect cells from oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. However, the role of FtMt in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. Therefore, the current study investigated the localization and expression level of FtMt in the midbrain of patients with PD and healthy controls using immunohistochemical techniques. FtMt immunoreactivity was mainly detected in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) in both healthy controls and patients with PD. In addition, FtMt-positive particles were observed outside the dopaminergic neurons in patients with PD. Based on a quantitative comparison, patients with PD had a significantly upregulated FtMt immunoreactivity in dopaminergic neurons than healthy controls. Our result might be helpful in future studies on the role of FtMt in PD.
