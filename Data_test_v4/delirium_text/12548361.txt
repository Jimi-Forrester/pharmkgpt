12548361|a|We investigated the presence of cytogenetic alterations in peripheral blood lymphocytes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Detection of spontaneous structural and/or numerical chromosome damage has been assessed by micronucleus (MN) assay coupled with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The cytogenetic investigation was performed on 22 AD patients, 18 PD patients, and 20 controls. The spontaneous frequencies of micronuclei (MN) in human lymphocytes of both AD and PD patients were significantly higher than in controls. The majority of MN was composed of whole chromosomes in AD patients, while a prevalence of MN arising from chromosome breakage was observed in PD patients. Different molecular mechanisms underlie cytogenetic alterations observed in peripheral lymphocytes of AD and PD patients.
