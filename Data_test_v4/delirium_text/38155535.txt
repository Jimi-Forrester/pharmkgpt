38155535|t|A cohort study comparing the effects of medical cannabis for anxiety patients with and without comorbid sleep disturbance.
38155535|a|BACKGROUND: Research on cannabis-based medicinal products (CBMPs) in anxiety remains inconclusive due to a paucity of high-quality evidence. Studies indicate a bidirectional relationship between generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and sleep disruption, but it is unclear how this affects CBMP treatment outcomes. This study aims to compare the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of patients prescribed CBMPs for GAD, with and without impaired sleep. METHODS: Changes in PROMs were recorded from baseline to 1, 3, 6, and 12 months between those with impaired or unimpaired sleep. Multivariate logistic regression was applied to compare factors associated with a clinically significant improvement in GAD-7 at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included adverse event incidence and frequency. RESULTS: Of the 302 patients that fit the inclusion criteria, mean GAD-7, single-item sleep quality, and EQ-5D-5L index values improved at all time points (p < 0.001). A relationship between sleep impairment and clinically significant changes in GAD-7 at 1 and 3 months was identified (p <= 0.01). On multivariate regression, only baseline GAD severity was associated with an increased likelihood of observing a clinically significant improvement in anxiety (p < 0.001). Seven hundred and seven (234%) adverse events were reported by 55 (18.21%) participants. CONCLUSIONS: This study observed an association between CBMP treatment and improvements in anxiety in patients with GAD. While patients with comorbid sleep disruption had greater improvements in anxiety, the differences were not maintained in a multivariate analysis. Baseline anxiety severity may be a predictor for CBMP treatment outcomes.
