28286801|t|Modulation of Autophagy as a Therapeutic Target for Alzheimer's Disease.
28286801|a|Macroautophagy (autophagy) is a conserved cellular pathway that regulates the degradation of long-lived proteins, protein aggregates, and cellular organelles. Autophagy is essential for maintaining neuronal homeostasis; however, neuronal autophagic efficiency decreases with age. Therefore, aging is one of the greatest risk factors for development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a slowly progressing form of neurodegeneration that develops over the course of 10-20 years prior to the onset of overt clinical symptoms. AD is defined neuropathologically by the presence of extracellular aggregates of the amyloidogenic protein amyloid-beta (Abeta) and intracellular accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. At end-stage Alzheimer's disease, abnormal autophagic pathology has been reported in human brain and in multiple mouse models of AD, suggesting that an intimate association may exist between neuronal autophagy stasis and Alzheimer's-related pathology. Here, we highlight recent evidence that the autophagic pathway plays a role in both the generation and clearance of the pathogenic Abeta protein and its precursors. The primary focus of this review is to examine the compelling research that highlights the autophagic pathway as a therapeutic target for AD and to discuss the therapeutic space around autophagy-regulating programs for AD. Finally, we propose that programs targeting autophagy regulation for AD ought to consider prophylactic or early stage intervention trials based on evidence against druggability of this pathway in late-stage disease.
