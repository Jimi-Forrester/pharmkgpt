38331825|t|Diagnostic and progression biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer's disease patients.
38331825|a|In this commentary, we address a paper published by Johnson et al. by assessing the robustness of their method to discover diagnostic biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, we examine how these newly discovered and previously discovered biomarkers, can play a role in assisting patients with AD and those at risk for developing AD, with an emphasis on the translational hurdles that accompany such discoveries.
