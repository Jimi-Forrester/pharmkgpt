36350125|t|Antimicrobial Activity of Auranofin, Cannabidivarin, and Tolfenamic Acid against Multidrug-Resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
36350125|a|Alternative antimicrobial therapies are urgently required for the multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae, for which currently ceftriaxone is the only remaining recommended first-line therapy. Repurposing of drugs that are approved for other clinical applications offers an efficient approach for development of alternative antimicrobial therapies. Auranofin, cannabidivarin, and tolfenamic acid were recently identified to display antimicrobial activity against N. gonorrhoeae. Here, we investigated their activity against a collection of 575 multidrug-resistant clinical isolates. All three compounds displayed consistent antimicrobial activity against all isolates, including against strains associated with the high-level ceftriaxone-resistant FC428 clone, with both the mode and MIC90 for auranofin of 0.5 mg/L, while both the mode and MIC90 for cannabidivarin and tolfenamic acid were 8 mg/L. Correlations between MICs of ceftriaxone and auranofin, cannabidivarin or tolfenamic acid were low, indicating that development of cross-resistance is unlikely. Furthermore, antimicrobial synergy analysis between ceftriaxone and auranofin, cannabidivarin, or tolfenamic acid by determination of the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) resulted in an interpretation of indifference. Finally, time-kill analyses showed that all three compounds are bactericidal against both the N. gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226 reference strain and an FC428-associated clinical isolate, with particularly cannabidivarin displaying rapid bactericidal activity. Overall, auranofin, cannabidivarin, and tolfenamic acid displayed consistent antimicrobial activity against multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae, warranting further exploration of their suitability as alternative antimicrobials for treatment of gonococcal infections. IMPORTANCE Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a major public health concern because of the high incidence of gonorrhea and the increasingly limited options for antimicrobial therapy. Strains associated with the FC428 clone are a particular concern because they have shown global dissemination and they display high-level resistance against the currently recommended ceftriaxone therapy. Therefore, development of alternative antimicrobial therapies is urgently required to ensure treatment of gonorrhea remains available in the future. Repurposing of clinically approved drugs could be a rapid approach for the development of such alternative antimicrobials. In this study, we showed that repurposing of auranofin, cannabidivarin, and tolfenamic acid for antimicrobial therapy of gonorrhea deserves further clinical explorations because these compounds displayed consistent antimicrobial activity against a large collection of contemporary multidrug-resistant gonococcal isolates that included strains associated with the FC428 clone.
