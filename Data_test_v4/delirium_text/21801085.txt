21801085|t|Toxicity of Alzheimer's disease-associated Abeta peptide is ameliorated in a Drosophila model by tight control of zinc and copper availability.
21801085|a|Amyloid plaques consisting of aggregated Abeta peptide are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Among the different forms of Abeta, the one of 42aa length (Abeta42) is most aggregation-prone and also the most neurotoxic. We find that eye-specific expression of human Abeta42 in Drosophila results in a degeneration of eye structures that progresses with age. Dietary supplements of zinc or copper ions exacerbate eye damage. Positive effects are seen with zinc/copper chelators, or with elevated expression of MTF-1, a transcription factor with a key role in metal homeostasis and detoxification, or with human or fly transgenes encoding metallothioneins, metal scavenger proteins. These results show that a tight control of zinc and copper availability can minimize cellular damage associated with Abeta42 expression.
