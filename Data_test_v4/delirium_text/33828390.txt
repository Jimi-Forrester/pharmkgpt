33828390|t|Primary localized gastric amyloidosis: A scoping review of the literature from clinical presentations to prognosis.
33828390|a|Localized gastric amyloidosis (LGA) is a rare disease characterized by abnormal extracellular deposition of amyloid protein restricted to the stomach and it is confirmed by positive results of Congo red staining. Over decades, only a few cases have been reported and studies or research focusing on it are few. Although LGA has a low incidence, patients may suffer a lot from it and require proper diagnosis and management. However, the pathology of LGA remains unknown and no overall review of LGA from its presentations to its prognosis has been published. Patients with LGA are often asymptomatic or manifest atypical symptoms, making it difficult to differentiate from other gastrointestinal diseases. Here, we report the case of a 70-year-old woman with LGA and provide an overview of case reports of LGA available to us. Based on that, we conclude current concepts of clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of LGA, aiming at providing a detailed diagnostic procedure for clinicians and promoting the guidelines of LGA. In addition, a few advanced technologies applied in amyloidosis are also discussed in this review, aiming at providing clinicians with a reference of diagnostic process. With this review, we hope to raise awareness of LGA among the public and clinicians.
