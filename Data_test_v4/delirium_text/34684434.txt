34684434|a|Despite the progress in the development of new anticancer strategies, cancer is rapidly spreading around the world and remains one of the most common diseases. For more than 40 years, doxorubicin has been widely used in the treatment of solid and hematological tumors. At the same time, the problem of its cardiotoxicity remains unresolved, despite the high efficiency of this drug. Symptomatic therapy is used as a treatment for side-effects of doxorubicin or pathological conditions that have already appeared in their background. To date, there are no treatment methods for doxorubicin cardiomyopathy as such. A drug such as nicotinamide riboside can play an important role in solving this problem. Nicotinamide riboside is a pyridine nucleoside similar to vitamin B3 that acts as a precursor to NAD+. There is no published research on nicotinamide riboside effects on cardiomyopathy, despite the abundance of works devoted to the mechanisms of its effects in various pathologies. The review analyzes information about the effects of nicotinamide riboside on various experimental models of pathologies, its role in the synthesis of NAD+, and also considers the possibility and prospects of its use for the prevention of doxorubicin cardiomyopathy.
