38674383|t|Predictive Role of Cluster Bean (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba) Derived miRNAs in Human and Cattle Health.
38674383|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding conserved molecules with lengths varying between 18-25nt. Plants miRNAs are very stable, and probably they might have been transferred across kingdoms via food intake. Such miRNAs are also called exogenous miRNAs, which regulate the gene expression in host organisms. The miRNAs present in the cluster bean, a drought tolerant legume crop having high commercial value, might have also played a regulatory role for the genes involved in nutrients synthesis or disease pathways in animals including humans due to dietary intake of plant parts of cluster beans. However, the predictive role of miRNAs of cluster beans for gene-disease association across kingdoms such as cattle and humans are not yet fully explored. Thus, the aim of the present study is to (i) find out the cluster bean miRNAs (cb-miRs) functionally similar to miRNAs of cattle and humans and predict their target genes' involvement in the occurrence of complex diseases, and (ii) identify the role of cb-miRs that are functionally non-similar to the miRNAs of cattle and humans and predict their targeted genes' association with complex diseases in host systems. Here, we predicted a total of 33 and 15 functionally similar cb-miRs (fs-cb-miRs) to human and cattle miRNAs, respectively. Further, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed the participation of targeted genes of fs-cb-miRs in 24 and 12 different pathways in humans and cattle, respectively. Few targeted genes in humans like LCP2, GABRA6, and MYH14 were predicted to be associated with disease pathways of Yesinia infection (hsa05135), neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction (hsa04080), and pathogenic Escherichia coli infection (hsa05130), respectively. However, targeted genes of fs-cb-miRs in humans like KLHL20, TNS1, and PAPD4 are associated with Alzheimer's, malignant tumor of the breast, and hepatitis C virus infection disease, respectively. Similarly, in cattle, targeted genes like ATG2B and DHRS11 of fs-cb-miRs participate in the pathways of Huntington disease and steroid biosynthesis, respectively. Additionally, the targeted genes like SURF4 and EDME2 of fs-cb-miRs are associated with mastitis and bovine osteoporosis, respectively. We also found a few cb-miRs that do not have functional similarity with human and cattle miRNAs but are found to target the genes in the host organisms and as well being associated with human and cattle diseases. Interestingly, a few genes such as NRM, PTPRE and SUZ12 were observed to be associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Asthma and Endometrial Stromal Sarcoma diseases, respectively, in humans and genes like SCNN1B associated with renal disease in cattle.
