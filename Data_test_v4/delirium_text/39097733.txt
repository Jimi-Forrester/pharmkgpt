39097733|t|Palliative care for patients with heart failure and family caregivers in rural Appalachia: a randomized controlled trial.
39097733|a|BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a debilitating disease with worsening symptoms and family caregiving burden. HF affects more than 8 million Americans. West Virginia has the highest HF death rate in the U.S. and limited healthcare services. This study tested whether the family HF palliative and end-of-life care intervention (FamPALcare) improved patient and caregiver outcomes at 3- and 6-month study endpoints. METHODS: This study used a randomized controlled trial design. Patients with HF and their caregivers were randomly assigned together to the intervention (n = 21) or control (n = 18) group. The intervention included five telephone coaching sessions on the HF home, palliative, and end-of-life care. The outcome data collected at baseline and at 3 and 6 months were from the patients' (a) HF-related health status and depression/anxiety scale scores; and from caregivers' (b) caregiving burden and depression/anxiety scale scores; and (c) anonymous ratings on the 11-item FamPALcare helpfulness scale, completed by the intervention participants. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 65.66 (SD = 13.72) years, and 67% were White males. The mean age of the caregivers was 62.05 (SD = 13.14) years, and 77% were White females. Compared to the controls, patients in the intervention group had significantly greater scores for HF-related health status (p < .05) and lower depression/anxiety scores at 6 months, the study endpoint. The family caregivers in the intervention group had significantly lower scores on caregiving burden (p < .05) and depression/anxiety (p < .01) at 3 months. The mean helpfulness rating was M = 4.46 out of 5 (SD = 0.49). CONCLUSIONS: The FamPALcare intervention was found to be effective at improving patient HF-related health status and reducing caregiver burden and improving both patient and caregiver depression and anxiety scores. The FamPALcare HF intervention was found feasible and consistently delivered (fidelity). The FamPALcare intervention's cost-effectiveness and helpfulness ratings information will be used to plan for subsequent clinical trials.
