30763607|t|Role of DAPK1 in neuronal cell death, survival and diseases in the nervous system.
30763607|a|DAPK (death-associated protein kinase) is a calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) regulated serine/threonine kinase. Structurally, it assumes a multi-domain structure and participates in various apoptotic systems which imply that it may interact with a wide range of intracellular components to exert its action. DAPK plays vital roles in pro-apoptotic, apoptotic and autophagic pathways. In addition, it plays important roles in many diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, cerebral ischemia and epilepsy. Although a novel protein, DAPK's various cellular signal transduction pathways proves that it can be a target for a potential future therapeutic effects. Specific role of DAPK in the development and maintenance of the nervous system needs to be further investigated as it is involved in neurodegeneration, traumatic brain injury and neuronal development or recovery from injury. This review summarizes DAPK signaling pathways in autophagy, apoptosis, and stresses the important role it might play in the nervous system.
