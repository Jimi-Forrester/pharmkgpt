33525334|t|Neurometals in the Pathogenesis of Prion Diseases.
33525334|a|Prion diseases are progressive and transmissive neurodegenerative diseases. The conformational conversion of normal cellular prion protein (PrPC) into abnormal pathogenic prion protein (PrPSc) is critical for its infection and pathogenesis. PrPC possesses the ability to bind to various neurometals, including copper, zinc, iron, and manganese. Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that PrPC plays essential roles in the maintenance of homeostasis of these neurometals in the synapse. In addition, trace metals are critical determinants of the conformational change and toxicity of PrPC. Here, we review our studies and other new findings that inform the current understanding of the links between trace elements and physiological functions of PrPC and the neurotoxicity of PrPSc.
