36777080|a|Although many diseases in which reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals are involved in their pathogenesis are known, and antioxidants that effectively capture ROS have been identified and developed, there are only a few diseases for which antioxidants have been used for treatment. Here, we discuss on the following four concepts regarding the development of applications for disease treatment by regulating ROS, free radicals, and lipid oxidation with the findings of our research and previous reports. Concept 1) Utilization of antioxidants for disease treatment. In particular, the importance of the timing of starting antioxidant will be discussed. Concept 2) Therapeutic strategies using ROS and free radicals. Methods of inducing ferroptosis, which has been advocated as an iron-dependent cell death, are mentioned. Concept 3) Treatment with drugs that inhibit the synthesis of lipid mediators. In addition to the reduction of inflammatory lipid mediators by inhibiting cyclooxygenase and leukotriene synthesis, we will introduce the possibility of disease treatment with lipoxygenase inhibitors. Concept 4) Disease treatment by inducing the production of useful lipid mediators for disease control. We describe the treatment of inflammatory diseases utilizing pro-resolving mediators and propose potential compounds that activate lipoxygenase to produce these beneficial mediators.
