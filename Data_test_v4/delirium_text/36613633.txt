36613633|a|To investigate if the artificial delivery of microRNAs naturally present in the breastmilk can impact the gut and brain of young rats according to weaning. Animals from a new transgenic rat line expressing the green-fluorescent protein in the endocrine lineage (cholecystokinin expressing cells) received a single oral bolus of miR-320-3p or miR-375-3p embedded in DiOleyl-Succinyl-Paromomycin (DOSP) on D-12. The pups were weaned early (D-15), or regularly (D-30). The expression of relevant miRNA, mRNAs, chromatin complexes, and duodenal cell density were assessed at 8 h post-inoculation and on D-45. The miR-320-3p/DOSP induced immediate effects on H3K4me3 chromatin complexes with polr3d promoter (p < 0.05). On regular weaning, on D-45, miR-320-3p and 375-3p were found to be downregulated in the stomach and upregulated in the hypothalamus (p < 0.001), whereas miR-320-3p was upregulated in the duodenum. After early weaning, miR-320-3p and miR-375-3p were downregulated in the stomach and the duodenum, but upregulated in the hypothalamus and the hippocampus. Combination of miR-320-3p/DOSP with early weaning enhanced miR-320-3p and chromogranin A expression in the duodenum. In the female brain stem, miR-320-3p, miR-504, and miR-16-5p levels were all upregulated. Investigating the oral miRNA-320-3p loads in the duodenal cell lineage paved the way for designing new therapeutics to avoid unexpected long-term impacts on the brain.
