39114371|t|Rehabilitation after musculoskeletal injury: Israeli and South African perspectives.
39114371|a|Rehabilitation for patients sustaining isolated and multiple musculoskeletal injuries due to trauma remains a mainstay of recovery. There are a wide variety of systems in place to manage the rehabilitation process. This article describes the post-traumatic rehabilitation procedures from 2 member countries of the International Orthopaedic Trauma Association, Israel and South Africa. The systems are reflective of the clear differences between these 2 countries with vastly different economic strata and health care systems. In Israel, the rehabilitation programs and resources are most likely the result of the mature social support systems and the trauma experience. In South Africa, the programs are reflective of a two-tier health care system, with patients exposed to varying levels of rehabilitation resources.
