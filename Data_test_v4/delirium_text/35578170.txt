35578170|a|BACKGROUND: Low tidal volume (VT) ventilation and its associated increase in arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) may affect postoperative neurologic function. We aimed to test the hypothesis that intraoperative low VT ventilation affect the incidence of postoperative ICD-10 coded delirium and/or the need for antipsychotic medications. METHODS: This is a post-hoc analysis of a large randomized controlled trial evaluating low vs. conventional VT ventilation during major non-cardiothoracic, non-intracranial surgery. The primary outcome was the incidence of ICD-10 delirium and/or the use of antipsychotic medications during hospital stay, and the absolute difference with its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. RESULTS: We studied 1206 patients (median age of 64 [55-72] years, 59.0% males, median ARISCAT of 26 [19-37], and 47.6% of ASA 3). ICD-10 coded delirium and /or antipsychotic medication use was diagnosed in 11.2% with similar incidence between low and conventional VT ventilation (11.1% vs. 11.3%; absolute difference, -0.24 [95%CI, -3.82 to 3.32]; p = 0.894). There was no interaction between allocation group and type of surgery. CONCLUSION: In adult patients undergoing major surgery, low VT ventilation was not associated with increased risk of ICD-10 delirium and/or the use of antipsychotic medications during hospital stay.
