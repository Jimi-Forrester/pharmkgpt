37888623|t|Exploring the Interplay between the Clinical and Presumed Effect of Botulinum Injections for Cervical Dystonia: A Pilot Study.
37888623|a|BACKGROUND: Repetitive intramuscular injections of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) are the treatment of choice in patients with cervical dystonia (CD). As soon as BoNT therapy is initiated, the natural course of CD cannot be observed anymore. Nevertheless, the present study focuses on the "presumed" course of disease severity under the assumption that no BoNT therapy had been performed. The "experienced" benefit is compared with the "presumed" worsening. METHODS: Twenty-seven BoNT/A long-term-treated CD patients were recruited. They had to assess the remaining severity of CD in percent of its severity at the start of BoNT therapy (RS-%). Then, they had to draw the course of severity from the onset of symptoms to the start of BoNT/A therapy (CoDB graph), as well as the course of severity from the start of BoNT/A therapy until the day of recruitment (CoDA graph). Then, they were instructed to presume the development of CD severity from the day of the start of BoNT/A therapy until the day of recruitment under the assumption that no BoNT/A therapy had been performed, and to assess the maximal severity they could presume in percent of the severity at the start of BoNT therapy (IS-%). Then, they had to draw the "presumed" development of CD severity (CoDI graph). The "experienced" change in disease severity and the "presumed" change since the start of BoNT/A therapy were compared and correlated with a variety of demographical and treatment-related data, including the actual severity of CD at the day of recruitment, which was assessed using the TSUI score and the actual dose per session (ADOSE). RESULTS: No CD patients expected an improvement without BoNT therapy. "Presumed" worsening ((IS-%)-100) was about 50% in the mean and did not correlate with the "experienced" benefit (100-(RS-%)). However, IS-% was significantly correlated with ATSUI and ADOSE. CONCLUSION: Obviously, CD patients have the opinion that their CD would have further progressed and worsened if no BoNT/A therapy had been performed. Thus, the total benefit of BoNT/A therapy for a patient with CD is a combination of the "experienced" benefit under BoNT/A therapy and the prevented worsening of CD that the patient expects to occur without BoNT/A therapy.
