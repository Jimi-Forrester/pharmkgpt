8844033|a|The efficacy of the diazepam loading dose method of treatment of delirium tremens was assessed in comparison with the traditional therapy. The experimental group and the control group comprised 51 and 45 patients respectively. The clinical institute withdrawal assessment for alcohol (CIWA-A) scale was applied to assess the intensity of the symptoms. Diazepam doses in the experimental group oscillated from 40 to 210 mg (mean 86.9 +/- 47.2 mg). The control group was receiving diazepam and other psychotropic drugs in divided doses. In the experimental group deliric symptoms were present from 2 to 24 h (mean 6.9 +/- 4.8 h), and in the control group from 2 to 123 h (mean 33.8 +/- 25.7 h). The results show a large efficacy of the loading dose method corresponding to substantial reduction of the psychosis duration (fivefold in comparison to the control group). The method proved to be safe, with no significant complications.
