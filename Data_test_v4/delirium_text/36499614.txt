36499614|t|Identification of Novel Hub Genes Associated with Psoriasis Using Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis.
36499614|a|Psoriasis is a chronic, prolonged, and recurrent inflammatory skin disease and the current therapeutics can only alleviate the symptoms rather than cure it completely. Therefore, we aimed to identify the molecular signatures and specific biomarkers of psoriasis to provide novel clues for psoriasis and targeted therapy. In the present study, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was used to retrieve three microarray datasets (GSE166388, GSE50790 and GSE42632) and to explore the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in psoriasis using the Affy package in R software. The gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG) pathway enrichment were utilized to determine the common DEGs and their capabilities. The STRING database was used to develop DEG-encoded proteins and a protein-protein interaction network (PPI) and the Cytohubba plugin to classify hub genes. Using the NetworkAnalyst platform, we detected transcription factors (TFs), microRNAs and drug candidates interacting with hub genes. In addition, the expression levels of hub genes in HaCaT cells were detected by western blot. We screened the up- and downregulated DEGs from the transcriptome microarrays of corresponding psoriasis patients. Functional enrichment of DEGs in psoriasis was mainly associated with positive regulation of leukocyte cell-cell adhesion and T cell activation, cytokine binding, cytokine activity and the Wnt signaling pathway. Through further data processing, we obtained 57 intersecting genes in the three datasets and probed them in STRING to determine the interaction of their expressed proteins and we obtained the critical 10 hub genes in the Cytohubba plugin, including TOP2A, CDKN3, MCM10, PBK, HMMR, CEP55, ASPM, KIAA0101, ESC02, and IL-1beta. Using these hub genes as targets, we obtained 35 TFs and 213 miRNAs that may regulate these genes and 33 potential therapeutic agents for psoriasis. Furthermore, the expression levels of TOP2A, MCM10, PBK, ASPM, KIAA0101 and IL-1beta were observably increased in HaCaT cells. In conclusion, we identified potential biomarkers, risk factors and drugs for psoriasis.
