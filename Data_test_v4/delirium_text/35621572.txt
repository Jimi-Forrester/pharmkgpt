35621572|t|Modulation of the Structure and Stability of Novel Camel Lens Alpha-Crystallin by pH and Thermal Stress.
35621572|a|Alpha-crystallin protein performs structural and chaperone functions in the lens and comprises alphaA and alphaB subunits at a molar ratio of 3:1. The highly complex alpha-crystallin structure challenges structural biologists because of its large dynamic quaternary structure (300-1000 kDa). Camel lens alpha-crystallin is a poorly characterized molecular chaperone, and the alphaB subunit possesses a novel extension at the N-terminal domain. We purified camel lens alpha-crystallin using size exclusion chromatography, and the purity was analyzed by gradient (4-12%) sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Alpha-crystallin was equilibrated in the pH range of 1.0 to 7.5. Subsequently, thermal stress (20-94  C) was applied to the alpha-crystallin samples, and changes in the conformation and stability were recorded by dynamic multimode spectroscopy and intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence spectroscopic methods. Camel lens alpha-crystallin formed a random coil-like structure without losing its native-like beta-sheeted structure under two conditions: >50  C at pH 7.5 and all temperatures at pH 2.0. The calculated enthalpy of denaturation, as determined by dynamic multimode spectroscopy at pH 7.5, 4.0, 2.0, and 1.0 revealed that alpha-crystallin never completely denatures under acidic conditions or thermal denaturation. Alpha-crystallin undergoes a single, reversible thermal transition at pH 7.5. The thermodynamic data (unfolding enthalpy and heat capacity change) and chaperone activities indicated that alpha-crystallin does not completely unfold above the thermal transition. Camels adapted to live in hot desert climates naturally exhibit the abovementioned unique features.
