34422354|t|Safe implementation of robotic-assisted minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass: application of learning curves and cumulative sum analysis.
34422354|a|BACKGROUND: Learning curves are inevitably encountered when first implementing an innovative and complex surgical technique. Nevertheless, a cluster of failures or complications should be detected early, but not deter learning, to ensure safe implementation. Here, we aimed to examine the presence and impact of learning curves on outcome after robotic-assisted minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (RA-MIDCAB). METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the first 300 RA-MIDCAB surgeries between July 2015 and December 2020 was performed. Learning curves were obtained via logarithmic regression for surgical time. Cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis was performed for (I) major complications including MI, stroke, repeat revascularization, and mortality, and (II) other complications, including prolonged ventilation, pneumonia, pleura puncture, lung herniation, pericarditis, pleuritis, arrhythmia, wound complications, and delirium. Expected and unacceptable rates were set at 12% and 20%, respectively, for major complications, and at 40% and 60% for other complications, based on historical data in conventional coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). RESULTS: Demographic characteristics did not differ between terciles, except for more smokers in the first tercile, and less hypercholesterolemia and more complex procedures in the third tercile. The mean surgical time for all operations was 258+-81 minutes, ranging from 127 to 821 minutes. A learning curve was only observed in the first tercile. Subgroup analysis revealed that this learning curve was only observed for procedures consisting of single internal mammary artery (SIMA) with 1 or 2 distal anastomoses but not with bilateral internal mammary arteries (BIMA) or more than 2 distal anastomoses. CUSUM analysis showed that the cumulative rate of major and other complications never crossed the lines for unacceptable rates. Rather, the lower 95% confidence boundary was crossed after 50 cases, indicating improvement in safety. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that integration of RA-MIDCAB in the surgical landscape can be safely achieved and complication rates can quickly be reduced below those expected in traditional CABG. Collective experience plays a key role in overcoming the learning curve when more complex procedures and cases are introduced.
