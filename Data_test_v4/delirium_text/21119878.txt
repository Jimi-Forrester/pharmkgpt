21119878|t|Aquaporins and glia.
21119878|a|Glial cells coordinate the differentiation, metabolism, and excitability of neurons; they modulate synaptic transmission and integrate signals emanating from neurons and other glial cells. Several evidences underlying the relation between these pathways and the regulatory mechanisms of ion concentration, supporting the role of Aquaporins (AQPs) in these processes. The goal of this review is to summarize the localization of different isoforms of AQPs in relation to glial cells both in central and peripheral nervous system, underlying AQP involvement in physiological and in pathophysiological conditions such as brain edema, glioma and epilepsy.
