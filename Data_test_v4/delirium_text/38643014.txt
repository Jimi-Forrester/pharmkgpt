38643014|t|Sleep and circadian biomarkers of postoperative delirium (SLEEP-POD): protocol for a prospective and observational cohort study.
38643014|a|INTRODUCTION: Surgical patients over 70 experience postoperative delirium (POD) complications in up to 50% of procedures. Sleep/circadian disruption has emerged as a potential risk factor for POD in epidemiological studies. This protocol presents a single-site, prospective observational study designed to examine the relationship between sleep/circadian regulation and POD and how this association could be moderated or mediated by Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and genetic risk for AD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Study staff members will screen for eligible patients (age >=70) seeking joint replacement or spinal surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). At the inclusion visit, patients will be asked a series of questionnaires related to sleep and cognition, conduct a four-lead ECG recording and be fitted for an actigraphy watch to wear for 7 days before surgery. Blood samples will be collected preoperatively and postoperatively and will be used to gather information about AD variant genes (APOE-epsilon4) and AD-related pathology (total and phosphorylated tau). Confusion Assessment Method-Scale and Montreal Cognitive Assessment will be completed twice daily for 3 days after surgery. Seven-day actigraphy assessments and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System questionnaires will be performed 1, 3 and 12 months after surgery. Relevant patient clinical data will be monitored and recorded throughout the study. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is approved by the IRB at MGH, Boston, and it is registered with the US National Institutes of Health on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06052397). Plans for dissemination include conference presentations at a variety of scientific institutions. Results from this study are intended to be published in peer-reviewed journals. Relevant updates will be made available on ClinicalTrials.gov. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT06052397.
