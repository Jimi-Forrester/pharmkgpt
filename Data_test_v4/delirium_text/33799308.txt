33799308|t|Longitudinal normative OCT retinal thickness data for wild-type mice, and characterization of changes in the 3xTg-AD mice model of Alzheimer's disease.
33799308|a|Mice are widely used as models for many diseases, including eye and neurodegenerative diseases. However, there is a lack of normative data for retinal thickness over time, especially at young ages. In this work, we present a normative thickness database from one to four-months-old, for nine layers/layer-aggregates, including the total retinal thickness, obtained from the segmentation of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) data from the C57BL6/129S mouse strain. Based on fifty-seven mice, this normative database provides an opportunity to study the ageing of control mice and characterise disease models' ageing, such as the triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (3xTg-AD) used in this work. We report thickness measurements, the differences in thickness per layer, demonstrate a nasal-temporal asymmetry, and the variation of thickness as a function to the distance to the optic disc centre. Significant differences were found between the transgenic group's thickness and the normative database for the entire period covered in this study. Even though it is well accepted that retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thinning is a hallmark of neurodegeneration, our results show a thicker RNFL-GCL (RNFL-Ganglion cell layer) aggregate for the 3xTg-AD mice until four-months-old.
