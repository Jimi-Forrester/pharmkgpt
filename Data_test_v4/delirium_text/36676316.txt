36676316|t|A Robust Strontium Coordination Polymer with Selective and Sensitive Fluorescence Sensing Ability for Fe3+ Ions.
36676316|a|Exploration of sensitive and selective fluorescence sensors towards toxic metal species is of great importance to solve metal pollution issues. In this work, a three-dimensional (3D) strontium coordination polymer of Sr2(tcbpe) (H4tcbpe = 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(4-(4-carboxy-phenyl)phenyl)ethene) has been synthesized and developed as a fluorescent sensor to Fe3+ ions. Sr2(tcbpe) shows a mechanochromic fluorescence with emission shifting from blue of the pristine to green after being ground. Notably, based on a fluorescence quenching mechanism, Sr2(tcbpe) displays a sensitive and selective fluorescent sensing behavior to Fe3+ ions with a detection limit of 0.14 mM. Moreover, Sr2(tcbpe) exhibits high tolerance to water in a wide pH range (pH = 3-13), demonstrating that Sr2(tcbpe) is a potential fluorescent sensor of Fe3+ in water.
