33294603|t|Improving Sleep in Intensive Care Unit: An Overview of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Options.
33294603|a|Good quality sleep is considered to be essential for healthy living and recovering from illness. It would be logical to think that good quality sleep is most required when a patient is critically ill in an intensive care unit (ICU). Several studies have demonstrated poor quality of sleep while the patients are in ICU. Subjective tools such as questionnaires while simple are unreliable to accurately assess sleep quality. Relatively few studies have used standardized polysomnography. The use of novel biological markers of sleep such as serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor concentrations may help in conjunction with polysomnography to assess sleep quality in critically ill patients. Attempts to improve sleep included nonpharmacological interventions including the use of earplugs, eye sleep masks, and pharmacological agents including ketamine, propofol, dexmedetomidine, and benzodiazepines. The evidence for these interventions remains unclear. Further research is needed to assess quality of sleep and improve the sleep quality in intensive care settings.
