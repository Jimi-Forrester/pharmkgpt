37696087|t|1,8-cineole (eucalyptol): A versatile phytochemical with therapeutic applications across multiple diseases.
37696087|a|1,8-cineole (Eucalyptol), a naturally occurring compound derived from botanical sources such as eucalyptus, rosemary, and camphor laurel, has a long history of use in traditional medicine and exhibits an array of biological properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, bronchodilatory, analgesic, and pro-apoptotic effects. Recent evidence has also indicated its potential role in managing conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, neuropathic pain, and cancer. This review spotlights the health advantages of 1,8-cineole, as demonstrated in clinical trials involving patients with respiratory disorders, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, bronchitis, and rhinosinusitis. In addition, we shed light on potential therapeutic applications of 1,8-cineole in various conditions, such as depression, epilepsy, peptic ulcer disease, diarrhea, cardiac-related heart diseases, and diabetes mellitus. A comprehensive understanding of 1,8-cineole's pharmacodynamics and safety aspects as well as developing effective formulations, might help to leverage its therapeutic value. This thorough review sets the stage for future research on diverse health benefits and potential uses of 1,8-cineole in tackling complex medical conditions.
