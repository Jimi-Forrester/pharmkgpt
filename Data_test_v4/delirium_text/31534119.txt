31534119|a|Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone tumor. The prognosis of metastatic and recurrent OS patients still remains unsatisfactory. Cisplatin reveals undeniable anti-tumor effect while induces severe side effects that threatening patients' health. Dynasore, a cell-permeable small molecule that inhibits dynamin activity, has been widely studied in endocytosis and phagocytosis. However, the anti-tumor effect of dynasore on OS has not yet been ascertained. In the present study, we suggested that dynasore inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and induced G0/G1 arrest of OS cells. Besides, dynasore repressed tumorigenesis of OS in xenograft mouse model. In addition, we demonstrated that dynasore improved the anti-tumor effect of cisplatin in vitro and in vivo without inducing nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. Mechanistically, dynasore repressed the expression of CCND1, CDK4, p-Rb, and MMP-2. Furthermore, we found that dynasore exerts anti-tumor effects in OS partially via inhibiting STAT3 signaling pathway but not ERK-MAPK, PI3K-Akt or SAPK/JNK pathways. P38 MAPK pathway served as a negative regulatory mechanism in dynasore induced anti-OS effects. Taken together, our study indicated that dynasore does suppress cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via STAT3 signaling pathway, and enhances the antitumor capacity of cisplatin in OS. Our results suggest that dynasore is a novel candidate drug to inhibit the tumor growth of OS and enhance the anti-tumor effects of cisplatin.
