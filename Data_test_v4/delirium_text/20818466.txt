20818466|t|Assessing attitudes and behaviours surrounding Alzheimer's disease in Europe: key findings of the Important Perspectives on Alzheimer's Care and Treatment (IMPACT) survey.
20818466|a|The Important Perspectives on Alzheimer's Care and Treatment (IMPACT) survey is an assessment in Europe of the attitudes of caregivers, physicians, the general public and payors towards Alzheimer's disease and dementia. This was an Internet-based questionnaire study, which sought to determine the opinion and perception of responders on issues relating to ageing and dementia. There were additional questions for caregivers on the impact of caregiving on their life. Responses were analysed from 949 members of the general public, 500 physicians (generalists and specialists), 250 caregivers and 50 payors from 5 countries--France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. The survey highlighted the difficulty of diagnosing dementia, especially in the initial stages of the disease. The average time from first noticing symptoms to diagnosis varied from 36 to 63 weeks. Caregivers and the general public felt they had insufficient information about the benefits of treatment and care, although more than half the general public, caregiver and physician responders agreed that early treatment could delay the progression of the disease. The majority of respondents recognised the devastating effects of AD on caregivers and families, and a majority of caregivers, the general public and physicians agreed that their governments fail to view AD as a health care priority. This study occurs roughly 5 years after a similar survey, and provides a timely update. Despite some important differences between the methodologies used in these surveys, diagnosis of dementia is still a key issue, especially amongst generalists, as is the provision of information and support to caregivers. Despite the prevalence of AD in the ageing population of Europe, the perception within each of the 5 countries surveyed is that AD is not viewed as a health care priority.
