35486017|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly. Studies have shown that acupuncture can effectively alleviate the symptoms of AD and slow down the disease progression, and its mechanism has been intensively explored. This paper summarized the researches on the mechanism of acupuncture intervention on AD in the past 5 years. It has been found that acupuncture intervention on AD is correlated with the regulation of the expression levels of relevant proteins, the inhibition of central inflammatory response, the resistance to oxidative stress injury, the modulation of brain energy metabolism, the improvement of neuronal synaptic plasticity, the adjustment of autophagy activity and the suppression of neuronal apoptosis.
