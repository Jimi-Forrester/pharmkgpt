30374196|a|Tau and amyloid beta (Abeta) proteins accumulate along neuronal circuits in Alzheimer's disease. Unraveling the genetic background for the regional vulnerability of these proteinopathies can help in understanding the mechanisms of pathology progression. To that end, we developed a novel graph theory approach and used it to investigate the intersection of longitudinal Abeta and tau positron emission tomography imaging of healthy adult individuals and the genetic transcriptome of the Allen Human Brain Atlas. We identified distinctive pathways for tau and Abeta accumulation, of which the tau pathways correlated with cognitive levels. We found that tau propagation and Abeta propagation patterns were associated with a common genetic profile related to lipid metabolism, in which APOE played a central role, whereas the tau-specific genetic profile was classified as 'axon related' and the Abeta profile as 'dendrite related'. This study reveals distinct genetic profiles that may confer vulnerability to tau and Abeta in vivo propagation in the human brain.
