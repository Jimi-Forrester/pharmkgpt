37268436|t|Clinicoradiologic and Neuropathologic Evaluation of Corticobasal Syndrome.
37268436|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is a clinical phenotype characterized by asymmetric parkinsonism, rigidity, myoclonus, and apraxia. Originally thought secondary to corticobasal degeneration (CBD), mounting clinicopathologic studies have revealed heterogenous neuropathologies. The objectives of this study were to determine the pathologic heterogeneity of CBS, the clinicoradiologic findings associated with different underlying pathologies causing CBS, and the positive predictive value (PPV) of current diagnostic criteria for CBD amongst patients with a CBS. METHODS: Clinical data, brain MRI and neuropathologic data of patients followed at Mayo Clinic and diagnosed with CBS ante-mortem were reviewed according to neuropathology category at autopsy. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 113 CBS patients, 61 (54%) females. Mean +- SD disease duration was 7 +- 3.7 years; mean +- SD age at death was 70.5 +- 9.1 years. The primary neuropathologic diagnoses were: 43 (38%) CBD, 27 (24%) progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), 17 (15%) Alzheimer's disease (AD), 10 (9%) frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP), 7 (6%) diffuse Lewy body disease/Alzheimer's disease (DLBD/AD), and 9 (8%) with other diagnoses. CBS-AD or CBS-DLBD/AD patients were youngest at death (median [IQR]: 64 [13], 64 [11] years) while CBS-PSP were oldest (77 [12.5] years, P=0.024). CBS-DLBD/AD patients had the longest disease duration (9 [6] years), while CBS-other had the shortest (3 [4.25] years, P=0.04). Posterior cortical signs and myoclonus were more characteristic of CBS-AD and CBS-DLBD/AD patients. CBS-DLBD/AD patients displayed more features of LBD. Voxel-based morphometry revealed widespread cortical gray-matter loss characteristic of CBS-AD, while CBS-CBD and CBS-PSP predominantly involved premotor regions with greater amount of white-matter loss. CBS-DLBD/AD patients showed atrophy in a focal parieto-occipital region, and CBS-FTLD-TDP patients had predominant prefrontal cortical loss. CBS-PSP patients had the lowest midbrain/pons ratio (P=0.012). Of 67 cases meeting clinical criteria for possible CBD at presentation, 27 were pathology-proven CBD, yielding a PPV of 40%. DISCUSSION: A variety of neurodegenerative disorders can be identified in CBS patients, but clinical and regional imaging differences aid in predicting underlying neuropathology. PPV analysis of the current CBD diagnostic criteria revealed suboptimal performance. Biomarkers adequately sensitive and specific for CBD are needed.
