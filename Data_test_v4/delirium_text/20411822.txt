20411822|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease encountered in patients over 60 years. By its prevalence and the consequent individual and social loss of function Alzheimer's disease is a major public health problem. With the presentation of a clinical story of Alzheimer's disease in an elderly patient, we propose a diagnostic and therapeutic discussion on this clinical problem. We must adjust the treatment for each patient and overall not omit the non pharmacological therapeutic approaches.
