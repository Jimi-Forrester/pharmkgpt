33043683|t|Low Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus Volume Associated With Hypertension-Related Cognitive Impairment.
33043683|a|Hypertension increases the risk of cognitive impairment independent of detectable stroke or cerebral lesions. However, the principal pathophysiological basis of this increase has not been fully elucidated. The present study investigates the relationships among blood pressure, hippocampal subfields volume, and cognitive function in a relatively young non-stroke population. A total of 59 non-stroke non-dementia subjects (mean age, 57.2 +- 4.9 years) were enrolled. All subjects were subjected to complete assessment of vascular risk factors including 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, various neuropsychological tests, and 3D-T1 MR scan. Freesurfer V6.0 was used for segmentation of hippocampal subfields. Our analyses revealed that both 24-hour and daytime mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) were significantly associated with the low volume of the left DG. Higher coefficient of variation (CV) of daytime SBP was significantly associated with lower volume of the left Cornu Ammonis 4 and dentate gyrus (DG) region. Both higher CV of 24-hour mean SBP and daytime SBP were significantly associated with lower performance in both executive and linguistic function. The low volume of the left DG was significantly associated with the low performance in linguistic function. Our findings support that reduced DG volume and increased SBP variability associated with hypertension-related cognitive impairment.
