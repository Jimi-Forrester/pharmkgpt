37266643|a|The objective was to provide a basis for the rational clinical application of moxifloxacin through its comprehensive clinical evaluation, and to serve as a reference for the clinical comprehensive evaluation of relevant drugs in the future. We obtained data from 91 community-acquired pneumonia patients admitted to Weifang people's hospital from April 2020 to November 2021, including 46 in the evaluation group and 45 in the control group. Based on the requirements of the "Guidelines for the Management of Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation of Drugs" (for trial implementation), systematic evaluations are conducted in terms of drug safety, effectiveness, economy, innovation, suitability, and accessibility. The incidence of adverse drug reactions was low, drug quality, safety and stable efficacy; treatment efficiency was 91.3% and 93.3%, respectively (P > .05); the average total cost of the evaluation group was 9765.28RMB and 10250.69RMB, respectively; efficient cost-effectiveness ratio was 104.67 and 112.52 and cost-effectiveness ratio was 242.71. The economy of the evaluation group had a low price and was highly available.
