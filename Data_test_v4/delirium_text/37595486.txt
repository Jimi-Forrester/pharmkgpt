37595486|a|INTRODUCTION: The incidence of hemiarthroplasty dislocation for fracture neck of femurs ranges between 1 and 15% and the one-year mortality is 49- 70%. Revision of hemiarthroplasty to total hip replacement using a constrained liner has shown to improve the morbidity and mortality rates. The aim of the study was to assess whether conversion of dislocated hemiarthroplasty to total hip replacement improve functional and one year mortality. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the number of patients who had recurrent dislocations of hemiarthroplasty for fracture neck of femurs were carried out. The data were obtained from NHFD (National Hip Fracture Database) and internal hospital computer systems (Medway, Theatre notes and PACS) between Dec 2008 and Dec 2020. Patient demographics including age, sex, Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS), functional assessment, mortality at one and two years were documented. The risk factors which led to dislocations such as Parkinsons disease, Cerebrovascular accidents, Musculo-neuropathies and Alzheimer`s disease was also noted. RESULTS: A total of 3994 patients were admitted during the study period of which 1735 (43.4%) patients had hemiarthroplasty. Fifty-six (3.23%) patients had dislocation of hemiarthroplasty. The mean age was 81.4 years (range - 61 to 95). There were 40 (71.4%) females and 16 males (28.6%). The average AMTS score was 5.3. All 56 patients had closed manipulative reduction under anaesthesia within in 12 h of admission. Thirty-one patients (55.4%) went on to have recurrent dislocations of which 18 patients (58.4%) had total hip replacement using captive cup, 6 patients (19.4%) had open reduction,3 patients (9.7%) had excision arthroplasty procedure and four patients (12.5%) had no intervention, Eighteen patients who had total hip replacement with constrained captive for followed up to a minimum of two years (range2- 12 years). There were no intraoperative complications, dislocation or periprosthetic fractures in the follow up period. There was no mortality at the end of two years of follow up in this group, two-year mortality for the patients with alternative management for dislocated hemiarthroplasty was 76.67. CONCLUSION: Treatment of recurrent hemiarthroplasty dislocation by revising to a total hip replacement with a constrained liner gives good functional and mortality outcomes.
