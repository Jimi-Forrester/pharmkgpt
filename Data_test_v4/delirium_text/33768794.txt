33768794|t|Patient with Down syndrome and relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia with sustained remission despite only partial R3 chemotherapy.
33768794|a|DS-ALL has a higher rate of relapse and treatment-related mortality. The newer immunotherapies are potentially better options. Relapsed ALL with positive MRD has a poor prognosis.
