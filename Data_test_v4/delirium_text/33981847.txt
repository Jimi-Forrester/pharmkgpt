33981847|a|In this study, we aimed to observe the effects of Loofah cylindrica (LC) extract on learning and memory ability, brain tissue morphology, and immune function of aging mice. Kunming mice were selected and randomly divided into a control group, a positive control group, an aging group, and three dose groups. Three dose groups were administered 187.5, 375, and 750 mg/kg of LC extract, respectively. Except for the control group, the mice in any other group were continuously subcutaneously injected d-galactose on the back and neck. Platform tests and Morris water maze (MWM) were adopted to test the learning and memory ability of each group. The brain index, thymus index, and spleen index of each group were determined by the organ-to-body ratio method. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to measure the concentration of cytokines interleukin 2 and interferon gamma and the proliferation activity of T lymphocytes in mouse serum. In addition, the hematoxylin and eosin staining was employed to observe the morphological changes in mouse brain tissues of each group. The results show that the aging group made more errors in the platform test, had longer escape latency, shorter swimming time in the platform quadrant, and fewer platform crossings in the MWM; much fewer brain tissue cells; and smaller brain index, thymus index, and spleen index. The LC extracts (375 and 750 mg/kg) can significantly antagonize the changes in the above indices. It can be concluded that LC extract can improve the learning and memory of aging mice, enhance their immune activity, and delay the aging process.
