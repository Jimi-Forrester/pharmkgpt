11965088|a|Inflammatory muscular diseases of adult and child consist of dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM) and inclusion body myositis (IBM). Muscular biopsy takes a seminal place in their diagnosis, through analysis of the topography and clustering of individual histological lesions: endomysial, perimysial and perivascular inflammation, muscular necrosis with regeneration, fibre modifications, fibrosis, micro-angiopathy. They can be associated with collagen diseases or malignant tumors that usually precede them. IBM seems somewhat apart among inflammatory myopathies, being characterised by the association of neurogenic and myogenic features and the presence of vacuoles containing filaments with an accumulation of proteins previously reported in Alzheimer's disease (beta amyloid protein, tau, ubiquitin,.). Inflammation is of various intensity, lacking in familial IBM (hereditary inclusion body myopathy) that otherwise shares the same histologic characteristics as sporadic forms. Other inflammatory muscular diseases: focal myositis, eosinophilic polymyositis, are less frequent. Macrophagic myofasciitis, viral myositis and drug induced myositis are discussed in other articles.
