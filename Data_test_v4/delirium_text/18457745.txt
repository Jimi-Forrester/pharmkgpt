18457745|t|Nutritional status and delirium in long-term care elderly individuals.
18457745|a|Delirium is physiologically plausible in elderly individuals with a poor nutritional status. We explored body composition, serum protein levels, and delirium in a multicenter long-term care study using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Estimates from the BIA procedure included the body cell mass and fat-free mass (FFM) of nursing home elderly residents (N = 312). Increased delirium was identified in men and women who were leaner and had lower FFM. Clinical surveillance for delirium in frail elderly individuals with low serum albumin levels and polypharmacy is recommended because of their increased likelihood of having drug toxicities for medications with protein-binding properties.
