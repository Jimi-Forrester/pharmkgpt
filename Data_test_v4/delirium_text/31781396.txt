31781396|t|Cognitive Impairment among Cardiac Arrest Survivors in the ICU: A Retrospective Study.
31781396|a|BACKGROUND: Recent studies have presented the effects of cardiac arrest on long-term cognitive function and quality of life. However, no study has evaluated cognitive function in the early stage after regaining consciousness. PURPOSE: The objectives of this study were to analyse the incidence, clinical course, and associated factors of cognitive impairment of cardiac arrest survivors in intensive care unit (ICU). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We administered the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to cardiac arrest survivors who were treated with targeted temperature management (TTM) immediately after regaining consciousness. Patients whose MMSE scores indicated impaired cognitive function (MMSE < 24) were retested before ICU discharge. RESULTS: In 92 patients, the median MMSE score was 21.0 (interquartile range (IQR), 16.0-24.0), and cognitive impairment was found in 64 patients. Fifty-three patients completed follow-up MMSEs, and the median scores were 20.0 (IQR, 13.5-23.0) for the first and 25.0 (IQR, 21.5-28.0) for the last test. Of the specific domains, recall (0.0 (IQR, 0.0-1.0) to 2.0 (IQR, 1.0-3.0)) and attention/calculation (3.0 (IQR, 1.0-4.0) to 4.0 (IQR, 2.0-5.0)) were the most affected domains until ICU discharge. The factors that were correlated with cognitive impairment on the last MMSE were older age (OR, 1.07 (95% CI, 1.01-1.14), p=0.016), increased time to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) (OR, 1.08 (95% CI, 1.02-1.15), p=0.012), and length of hospital stay (OR, 1.07 (95% CI, 1.00-1.14), p=0.044). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairments were common immediately after patients regained consciousness but recovered substantially before ICU discharge. Recall and attention/calculation still were impaired until ICU discharge, and older age, increased time to ROSC, and LOS were associated with this cognitive decline.
