38778325|t|White matter alterations and their associations with biomarkers and behavior in subjective cognitive decline individuals: a fixel-based analysis.
38778325|a|BACKGROUND: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is an early stage of dementia linked to Alzheimer's disease pathology. White matter changes were found in SCD using diffusion tensor imaging, but there are known limitations in voxel-wise tensor-based methods. Fixel-based analysis (FBA) can help understand changes in white matter fibers and how they relate to neurodegenerative proteins and multidomain behavior data in individuals with SCD. METHODS: Healthy adults with normal cognition were recruited in the Northeastern Taiwan Community Medicine Research Cohort in 2018-2022 and divided into SCD and normal control (NC). Participants underwent evaluations to assess cognitive abilities, mental states, physical activity levels, and susceptibility to fatigue. Neurodegenerative proteins were measured using an immunomagnetic reduction technique. Multi-shell diffusion MRI data were collected and analyzed using whole-brain FBA, comparing results between groups and correlating them with multidomain assessments. RESULTS: The final enrollment included 33 SCD and 46 NC participants, with no significant differences in age, sex, or education between the groups. SCD had a greater fiber-bundle cross-section than NC (pFWE < 0.05) at bilateral frontal superior longitudinal fasciculus II (SLFII). These white matter changes correlate negatively with plasma Abeta42 level (r = -0.38, p = 0.01) and positively with the AD8 score for subjective cognitive complaints (r = 0.42, p = 0.004) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale score for the degree of anxiety (Ham-A, r = 0.35, p = 0.019). The dimensional analysis of FBA metrics and blood biomarkers found positive correlations of plasma neurofilament light chain with fiber density at the splenium of corpus callosum (pFWE < 0.05) and with fiber-bundle cross-section at the right thalamus (pFWE < 0.05). Further examination of how SCD grouping interacts between the correlations of FBA metrics and multidomain assessments showed interactions between the fiber density at the corpus callosum with letter-number sequencing cognitive score (pFWE < 0.01) and with fatigue to leisure activities (pFWE < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Based on FBA, our investigation suggests white matter structural alterations in SCD. The enlargement of SLFII's fiber cross-section is linked to plasma Abeta42 and neuropsychiatric symptoms, which suggests potential early axonal dystrophy associated with Alzheimer's pathology in SCD. The splenium of the corpus callosum is also a critical region of axonal degeneration and cognitive alteration for SCD.
