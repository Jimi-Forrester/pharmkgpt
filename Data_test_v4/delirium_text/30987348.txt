30987348|t|Insights into Triterpene Acids in Fermented Mycelia of Edible Fungus Poria cocos by a Comparative Study.
30987348|a|As an edible sclerotia-forming fungus, Poria cocos is widely used as a food supplement and as a tonic in China. High-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF-MS/MS) was applied to identify triterpene acids in fermented mycelia of P. cocos, as well as the epidermis and inner part of natural sclerotia. A total of 19 triterpene acids were identified in fermented mycelia, whereas 31 were identified in the epidermis and 24 in the inner part. Nine triterpene acids were quantitatively determined, and the concentrations of two valuable triterpenes, dehydropachymic acid and pachymic acid, reached 1.07 mg/g and 0.61 mg/g in the fermented mycelia part, respectively, and were both significantly higher than the concentration in the two natural parts. The fermented mycelia could be a good choice for producing some target triterpene compounds and functional foods through fermentation thanks to the high concentration of some triterpene acids.
