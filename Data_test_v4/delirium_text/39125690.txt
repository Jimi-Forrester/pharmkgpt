39125690|t|Stigmasterol: An Enigmatic Plant Stress Sterol with Versatile Functions.
39125690|a|Sterols play important structural and regulatory roles in numerous intracellular processes. Unlike animals, plants contain a distinctive and diverse variety of sterols. Recently, information has emerged showing that stigmasterol is a "stress sterol". Stigmasterol is synthesized via the mevalonate biosynthesis pathway and has structural similarity to beta-sitosterol but differs in the presence of a trans-oriented double bond in the side chain. In plants, the accumulation of stigmasterol has been observed in response to various stresses. However, the precise ways that stigmasterol is involved in the stress responses of plants remain unclear. This comprehensive review provides an update on the biology of stigmasterol, particularly the physicochemical properties of this ethylsterol, its biosynthesis, and its occurrence in higher plants and extremophilic organisms, e.g., mosses and lichens. Special emphasis is given to the evolutionary aspects of stigmasterol biosynthesis, particularly the variations in the gene structure of C22-sterol desaturase, which catalyzes the formation of stigmasterol from beta-sitosterol, in a diversity of evolutionarily distant organisms. The roles of stigmasterol in the tolerance of plants to hostile environments and the prospects for its biomedical applications are also discussed. Taken together, the available data suggest that stigmasterol plays important roles in plant metabolism, although in some aspects, it remains an enigmatic compound.
