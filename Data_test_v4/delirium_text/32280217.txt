32280217|a|Rapid emergence of aggressive, multidrug-resistant Mycobacteria strain represents the main cause of the current antimycobacterial-drug crisis and status of tuberculosis (TB) as a major global health problem. The relatively low-output of newly approved antibiotics contributes to the current orientation of research towards alternative antibacterial molecules such as advanced materials. Nanotechnology and nanoparticle research offers several exciting new-concepts and strategies which may prove to be valuable tools in improving the TB therapy. A new paradigm in antituberculous therapy using silver nanoparticles has the potential to overcome the medical limitations imposed in TB treatment by the drug resistance which is commonly reported for most of the current organic antibiotics. There is no doubt that AgNPs are promising future therapeutics for the medication of mycobacterial-induced diseases but the viability of this complementary strategy depends on overcoming several critical therapeutic issues as, poor delivery, variable intramacrophagic antimycobacterial efficiency, and residual toxicity. In this paper, we provide an overview of the pathology of mycobacterial-induced diseases, andhighlight the advantages and limitations of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in TB treatment.
