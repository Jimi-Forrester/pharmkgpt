39053190|a|Timely diagnosis and therapy of Alzheimer's disease remains one of the greatest questions in medicinal chemistry of neurodegenerative disease. The lack of low-cost sensors capable of reliable detection of structural changes in AD-related proteins is the driving factor for the development of novel molecules with affinity for AD hallmarks. The development of cheap, safe diagnostic methods is a highly sought-after area of research. Optical fluorescent probes are of great interest due to their non-radioactivity, low cost, and ability of the real-time visualization of AD hallmarks. Boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)-based fluorophore is one promising fluorescent unit for in vivo labeling due to its high photostability, easy modification, low toxicity, and cell-permeability. In recent years, many fluorescent BODIPY-based probes capable of Abeta plaque, Abeta soluble oligomers, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) optical detection, as well as probes with copper ion chelating units and viscosity sensors have been developed. In this review, we summarized BODIPY derivatives as fluorescent sensors capable of detecting pathological features of Alzheimer's disease, published from 2009 to 2023, as well as their design strategies, optical properties, and in vitro and in vivo activities.
