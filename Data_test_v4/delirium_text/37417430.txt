37417430|t|Role of A-Kinase Anchoring Protein 12 in the Central Nervous System.
37417430|a|A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) 12 is a scaffolding protein that anchors various signaling proteins to the plasma membrane. These signaling proteins include protein kinase A, protein kinase C, protein phosphatase 2B, Src-family kinases, cyclins, and calmodulin, which regulate their respective signaling pathways. AKAP12 expression is observed in the neurons, astrocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, and oligodendrocytes of the central nervous system (CNS). Its physiological roles include promoting the development of the blood-brain barrier, maintaining white-matter homeostasis, and even regulating complex cognitive functions such as long-term memory formation. Under pathological conditions, dysregulation of AKAP12 expression levels may be involved in the pathology of neurological diseases such as ischemic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease. This minireview aimed to summarize the current literature on the role of AKAP12 in the CNS.
