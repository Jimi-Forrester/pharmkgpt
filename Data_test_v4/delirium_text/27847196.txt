27847196|a|Recent brain imaging studies have found changes in subcortical regions in presymptomatic autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD). These regions are also affected in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD), but whether such changes are seen in early-stage disease is still uncertain. In this review, we discuss imaging studies published in the past 12 years that have found evidence of subcortical involvement in early-stage ADAD and/or sAD. Several papers have reported amyloid deposition in the striatum of presymptomatic ADAD mutation carriers, prior to amyloid deposition elsewhere. Altered caudate volume has also been implicated in early-stage ADAD, but findings have been variable. Less is known about subcortical involvement in sAD: the thalamus and striatum have been found to be atrophied in symptomatic patients, but their involvement in the preclinical phase remains unclear, in part due to the difficulties of studying this stage in sporadic disease. Longitudinal imaging studies comparing ADAD mutation carriers with individuals at high-risk for sAD may be needed to elucidate the significance of subcortical involvement in different AD clinical stages.
