33835731|t|Association of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor rs6265 G>A polymorphism and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder susceptibility: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
33835731|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 G > A polymorphism is closely related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) risk. However, the results were not consistent. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to explore the underlying relationships between BDNF rs6265 G > A polymorphism and PTSD risk. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five online databases were searched, and all related studies were reviewed up to July 1, 2020. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to examine the statistical power of each genetic model. In addition, heterogeneity, sensitivity accumulative analysis, and publication bias were examined to check the statistical power. RESULT: Overall, 16 publications involving 5,369 subjects were included in this systematic review and 11 case-control studies were analyses in meta-analysis. The pooled results indicated an increasing risk of A allele mutations with PTSD risk. Moreover, the sequential subgroup analysis also demonstrated some similar situations in Asian populations and other groups. CONCLUSION: Current meta-analysis suggests that the BDNF rs6265 G > A polymorphism might be involved in PTSD susceptibility.
