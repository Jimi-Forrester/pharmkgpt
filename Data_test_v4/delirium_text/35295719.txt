35295719|t|Microtubule Organization Is Essential for Maintaining Cellular Morphology and Function.
35295719|a|Microtubules (MTs) are highly dynamic polymers essential for a wide range of cellular physiologies, such as acting as directional railways for intracellular transport and position, guiding chromosome segregation during cell division, and controlling cell polarity and morphogenesis. Evidence has established that maintaining microtubule (MT) stability in neurons is vital for fundamental cellular and developmental processes, such as neurodevelopment, degeneration, and regeneration. To fulfill these diverse functions, the nervous system employs an arsenal of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) to control MT organization and function. Subsequent studies have identified that the disruption of MT function in neurons is one of the most prevalent and important pathological features of traumatic nerve damage and neurodegenerative diseases and that this disruption manifests as a reduction in MT polymerization and concomitant deregulation of the MT cytoskeleton, as well as downregulation of microtubule-associated protein (MAP) expression. A variety of MT-targeting agents that reverse this pathological condition, which is regarded as a therapeutic opportunity to intervene the onset and development of these nervous system abnormalities, is currently under development. Here, we provide an overview of the MT-intrinsic organization process and how MAPs interact with the MT cytoskeleton to promote MT polymerization, stabilization, and bundling. We also highlight recent advances in MT-targeting therapeutic agents applied to various neurological disorders. Together, these findings increase our current understanding of the function and regulation of MT organization in nerve growth and regeneration.
