21777016|a|Ongoing interest in brain ischemia research has provided data showing that ischemia may be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Brain ischemia in the rat produces a stereotyped pattern of selective neuronal degeneration, which mimics early Alzheimer disease pathology. The objective of this study was to further develop and characterize cardiac arrest model in rats, which provides practical way to analyze Alzheimer-type neurodegeneration. Rats were made ischemic by cardiac arrest. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) insufficiency, accumulation of different parts of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and platelets inside and outside BBB vessels were investigated in ischemic brain up to 1-year survival. Ischemic brain tissue demonstrated haphazard BBB changes. Toxic fragments of APP deposits were associated with the BBB vessels. Moreover our study revealed platelet aggregates in- and outside BBB vessels. Toxic parts of APP and platelet aggregates correlated very well with BBB permeability. Progressive injury of the ischemic brain parenchyma may be caused not only by a degeneration of neurons destroyed during ischemia but also by chronic damage in BBB. Chronic ischemic BBB insufficiency with accumulation of toxic components of APP in the brain tissue perivascular space, may gradually over a lifetime, progress to brain atrophy and to full blown Alzheimer-type pathology.
