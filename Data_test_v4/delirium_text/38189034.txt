38189034|a|Due to the increase in the population of the elderly, there is a growing trend in some diseases such as cognitive disorders (dementia) which are common in this era, and the diagnosis and treatment of this disease are still facing challenges. Therefore, early identification of cognitive disorders is of particular importance. In this regard, the use of any tool or cognitive tests may not be enough to diagnose dementia in the early stages and a special tool is needed. Objective: The validity and reliability of the Persian version of the Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (P-TICS-M) in older adults living in the Iranian community for a comprehensive screening of mild cognitive impairment and dementia was investigated. Methods: In the first phase, translation, re-translation, and word-taking were performed by using the face validity and content validity. In the second phase, a stratified convenient sampling with 150 participants aged >=60 years was conducted based on cognitive status using the global deterioration scale in 2018. The external and internal reliability of the P-TICS-M using the interclass correlation coefficient and Cronbach's alpha coefficient of total items of this tool were estimated. Results: The mean age of the participants was 68.6 (standard deviation+-7.4) years. According to global deterioration scale, 87 (58.0%) had normal cognition, 40 (26.7%) had mild cognitive impairment, and 23 (15.3%) had dementia. The Spearman's correlation coefficient between P-TICS-M scores and Mini-Mental State Examination scale was 0.764. In exploratory factor analysis, seven domains were detected, which were compatible with those defined by the tool developer. The Cronbach's alpha of the P-TICS-M was 0.920. The absolute agreement between test-retest score was >0.90. The sensitivity of 92.2, 94.8, and 100%, and also the specificity of 79.4, 88.2, and 89.8% were calculated for detecting subjects with dementia, respectively. Furthermore, a mild cognitive impairment cutoff of >28 was determined. Conclusion: The development and validation of a P-TICS-M tool can be useful in identifying older adult people with cognitive impairment. Demographic characteristics (level of education, age) can also affect the cutoff point of this tool.
