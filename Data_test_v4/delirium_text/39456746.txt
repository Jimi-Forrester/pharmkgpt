39456746|a|Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) is traditionally viewed as a central nervous system disorder driven by the cerebral accumulation of toxic beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide, new interpretations of the amyloid cascade hypothesis have led to the recognition of the dynamic equilibrium in which Abeta resides and the importance of peripheral Abeta production and degradation in maintaining healthy Abeta levels. Our review sheds light on the critical role of peripheral organs, particularly the liver, in the metabolism and clearance of circulating Abeta. We explore the mechanisms of Abeta transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via transport proteins such as LRP1 and P-glycoprotein. We also examine how peripheral clearance mechanisms, including enzymatic degradation and phagocytic activity, impact Abeta homeostasis. Our review also discusses potential therapeutic strategies targeting peripheral Abeta clearance pathways. By enhancing these pathways, we propose a novel approach to reducing cerebral Abeta burden, potentially slowing AD progression.
