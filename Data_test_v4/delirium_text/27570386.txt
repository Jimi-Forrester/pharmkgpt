27570386|t|Evaluating the efficacy of memantine on improving cognitive functions in epileptic patients receiving anti-epileptic drugs: A double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial (Phase IIIb pilot study).
27570386|a|OBJECTIVES: People with epilepsy have greater cognitive and behavioral dysfunction than the general population. There is no specific treatment available for cognitive impairment of these patients. We aimed to evaluate the effects of memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptor noncompetitive antagonist, on improving cognition and memory functions in epileptic patients with cognitive and memory impairment, who received anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). METHODS: We did a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trial, in SRM Medical College Hospital and Research Centre, Kattankulathur, Kancheepuram, Tamil Nadu, India between April 2013 and September 2013. Fifty-nine epileptic patients taking AEDs with subjective memory complaints were recruited and randomized to either Group 1 to receive 16 weeks of once-daily memantine, (5 mg for first 8 weeks, followed by memantine 10 mg for next 8 weeks) or Group 2 to receive once daily placebo. This trial is registered with Clinical Trial Registry of India CTRI/2013/04/003573. RESULTS: Of 59 randomized patients, 55 patients completed the study (26 memantine and 29 placebo). Memantine group showed statistically significant improvement in total mini mental state examination score from baseline (P = 0.765) to 16(th) week (P < 0.001) in comparison with the placebo. The Weshler's Memory Scale total score in memantine group improved significantly after 8 weeks (P = 0.002) compared with baseline (P = 0.873) and highly significant at the end of 16(th) week (P < 0.001). The self-rated quality of life and memory in memantine group also significantly improved at the study end. CONCLUSION: We conclude that once-daily memantine (10 mg) treatment significantly improved cognition, memory and quality of life in epileptic patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment and was found to have a favorable safety profile.
