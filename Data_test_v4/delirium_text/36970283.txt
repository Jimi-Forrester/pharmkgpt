In this pilot study, we aimed to elucidate the association between longitudinal changes in CP volume, sex and cognitive impairment. Methods: We assessed longitudinal changes in CP volume in a cohort of n = 613 subjects across n = 2,334 datapoints from ADNI 2 and ADNI-GO, belonging to cognitively unimpaired (CN), stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI), clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD) or convertor (to either AD or MCI) subgroups. CP volume was automatically segmented and used as a response variable in linear mixed effect models with random intercept clustered by patient identity. Temporal effects of select variables were assessed by interactions and subgroup analyses. Results: We found an overall significant increase of CP volume in time (14.92 mm3 per year, 95% confidence interval, CI (11.05, 18.77), p < 0.001). Sex-disaggregated results showed an annual rate of increase 9.48 mm3 in males [95% CI (4.08, 14.87), p < 0.001], and 20.43 mm3 in females [95% CI (14.91, 25.93), p < 0.001], indicating more than double the rate of increase in females, which appeared independent of other temporal variables. The only diagnostic group with a significant CP increase as compared to CN was the convertors group, with an increase of 24.88 mm3/year [95% CI (14, 35.82), p < 0.001]. ApoE exhibited a significant temporal effect, with the E4 homozygote group's CP increasing at more than triple the rate of non-carrier or heterozygote groups [40.72, 95% CI (25.97, 55.46), p < 0.001 vs. 12.52, 95% CI (8.02, 17.02), p < 0.001 for ApoE E4 homozygotes and E4 non-carriers, respectively], and may have modified the diagnostic group relationship. Conclusion: Our results contribute to potential mechanisms for sex differences in cognitive impairment with a novel finding of twice the annual choroid plexus enlargement in females and provide putative support for CP-related mechanisms of cognitive deterioration and its relationship to ApoE E4.
