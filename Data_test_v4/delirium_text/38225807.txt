38225807|a|Background: Increasing numbers of reports have suggested a deterioration in cognitive performance after recovery from coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), however insufficient information is available regarding long-term brain health and risk factors related to reduced cognitive performance in advanced age. We investigated the prevalence of reduced cognitive performance and its associated factors among older adults after COVID-19. Methods: This prospective observational study enrolled older individuals (aged >=65 years) hospitalized for COVID-19. Discharged patients were contacted after an average of 15 months and a brief battery was administered during telephone interviews to assess their mental status. Results: Among the 174 patients, 77 (44.3%) showed reduced cognitive performance at follow-up. Multivariate analysis revealed that female sex, education level, and increased Deyo/Charlson Comorbidity Index score, which is an objective indicator of chronic disease burden, were independent risk factors for long-term cognitive performance. Depression and anxiety symptoms, assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and generalized anxiety disorder 2-item questionnaire (GAD-2) at the end of the study, were not associated with reduced cognitive performance. Conclusions: Our findings provide key insights into discharged older adults with COVID-19 at risk of long-term cognitive impairment, and help to ascertain the factors associated with this problem.
