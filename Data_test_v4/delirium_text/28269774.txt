28269774|t|Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Anatomical Correlation of Human Temporal Lobe Landmarks, in 3D Euclidean Space: A Study of Control and Alzheimer's Disease Subjects.
28269774|a|BACKGROUND: The medial temporal lobe (MTL), and in particular the hippocampal formation, is essential in the processing and consolidation of declarative memory. The 3D environment of the anatomical structures contained in the MTL is an important issue. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to explore the spatial relationship of the anatomical structures of the MTL and changes in aging and/or Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: MTL anatomical landmarks are identified and registered to create a 3D network. The brain network is quantitatively described as a plane, rostrocaudally-oriented, and presenting Euclidean/real distances. Correspondence between 1.5T RM, 3T RM, and histological sections were assessed to determine the most important recognizable changes in AD, based on statistical significance. RESULTS: In both 1.5T and 3T RM images and histology, inter-rater reliability was high. Sex and hemisphere had no influence on network pattern. Minor changes were found in relation to aging. Distances from the temporal pole to the dentate gyrus showed the most significant differences when comparing control and AD groups. The best discriminative distance between control and AD cases was found in the temporal pole/dentate gyrus rostrocaudal length in histological sections. Moreover, more distances between landmarks were required to obtain 100% discrimination between control (divided into <65 years or >65 years) and AD cases. DISCUSSION: Changes in the distance between MTL anatomical landmarks can successfully be detected by using measurements of 3D network patterns in control and AD cases.
