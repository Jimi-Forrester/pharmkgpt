11193785|t|Genetic factors in the genesis of Alzheimer's disease.
11193785|a|At least four different genes have been identified that are associated with inherited susceptibiltiy to Alzheimer's disease. Some of the genes are highly penetrant (PS1, PS2, beta APP); the other, APOE, is a weaker susceptibility factor. Several additional genes are suspected to exist but have not yet been cloned.
