34980523|a|BACKGROUND: Seizure disorders are considered a serious health issue because of the vast number of people affected globally and the limited treatment options. Approximately 15 million epileptic patients worldwide do not respond to any of the currently available medications. Carbamazepine (CBZ) is one of the most widely used antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for the treatment of epilepsy, which is discontinued in less than 5% of epileptic patients due to its side effects. In traditional medicine, to establish the foundation of health care, plant extracts are utilized to a great extent to treat different pathologies. Withania somnifera (W. somnifera) is an herbal component with anticonvulsant properties. OBJECTIVES: To compare the medicinal effects of W. somnifera on lifespan, fecundity, fertility and epileptic phenotype in Drosophila paralytic mutant (parabss1) model system with CBZ, a commonly used AED. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Flies were exposed to three different doses of W. somnifera or CBZ in standard wheat flour-agar media for six days. Drosophila Oregon-R strain was used as a control. RESULTS: Results indicate that a high dose of W. somnifera increased the lifespan in Drosophila parabss1 while remaining safe for fecundity and fertility. CBZ decreased the lifespan of parabss1 mutant at higher dose (40 mug/ml), as expected, and also reduced the fecundity and fertility of the flies. Our findings indicate that W. somnifera was more effective than CBZ to control epileptic phenotype. CONCLUSION: W. somnifera is an effective medication with no side effects for treating epilepsy in Drosophila paralytic mutant.
