31328121|a|This study was performed to investigate the effect of aged black garlic ethyl acetate extract on scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment in mice. Aged garlic ethyl acetate extract (BG) was administrated at a dose of 25 or 50 mg/ kg in scopolamine-induced mice. Cognitive ability was evaluated using a Morris water maze test and a passive avoidance test. BGs (50 mg/kg) shortened the latency time that was increased by scopolamine and increased the platform crossing numbers that was significantly shortened by scopolamine after 5 days training in the Morris water maze test (P<0.05). BG (50 mg/kg) also significantly prolonged the latency time in the passive avoidance test (P<0.05). Result from biochemical analysis showed that BG increased levels of glutathione, glutathione peroxidase activity, and glutathione reductase activity, whereas BG significantly inhibited lipid peroxidation (P<0.05). BG also attenuated cholinergic degradation through inhibiting acetylcholinesterase activity and increasing choline acetyltransferase activity (P<0.05). In conclusion, BG protected against scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment through decreasing oxidative damage and regulating cholinergic function in the brains of mice. BG may therefore be a beneficial food for protecting against neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's disease.
