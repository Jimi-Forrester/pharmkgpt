25710473|a|Interleukin (IL-15), a pro-inflammatory cytokine has been studied as a possible marker of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however its exact role in neuro-inflammation or the pathogenesis AD is not well understood yet. A Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) approach was used to examine the relationship between serum IL-15 levels and AD in a well characterized AD cohort, the Texas Alzheimer's Research and Care Consortium (TARCC). Instead of categorical diagnoses, we used two latent construct d (for dementia) and g' (for cognitive impairments not contributing to functional impairments) in our analysis. The results showed that the serum IL-15 level has significant effects on cognition, exclusively mediated by latent construct d and g'. Contrasting directions of association lead us to speculate that IL-15's effects in AD are mediated through functional networks as d scores have been previously found to be specifically related to default mode network (DMN). Our finding warrants the need for further research to determine the changes in structural and functional networks corresponding to serum based biomarkers levels.
