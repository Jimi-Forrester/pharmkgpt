38344516|t|Exploring Novel Non-pharmacologic Approaches to Address Preoperative Anxiety and Postoperative Pain in Pediatric Patients Undergoing In-Patient Surgical Procedures: A Scoping Review.
38344516|a|The pediatric population is more prone to experiencing anxiety and fear before undergoing an inpatient surgical procedure than adults. Non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as music therapy and virtual reality programs, have shown significant promise in reducing the post-operative pain associated with pre-operative anxiety of patients and their caregivers. While there is evidence to support the use of non-pharmaceutical treatment in the mitigation of pre-operative anxiety, there are limited published reports of non-pharmacological interventions for pre-operative anxiety in children undergoing inpatient surgical procedures. The goal of this scoping review was to identify and classify specific non-pharmacological interventions utilized inpatient among children to improve pre-operative anxiety and post-operative complications inflicting pain. Comprehensive searches were conducted using Ovid Medline, Embase Emtree, CINAHL Complete, and COCHRANE Central databases. The articles had to be peer-reviewed, written in English, published between 2000-2022, and contain measurements of pre-operative anxiety and post-operative pain to be included in the scoping review. Articles that reported findings on patients younger than 18 undergoing elective and/or routine surgeries, excluding emergent surgical cases, were selected. After a systemized screening process, 9 articles were selected for the final review. The findings indicated that non-pharmacological interventions such as virtual reality, hypnosis, and clowns reduced pre-operative anxiety and post-operative pain in pediatric patients. This scoping review identified a wide range of non-pharmacological interventions to mitigate the post-operative effects of pre-operative anxiety among children, including but not limited to music, visual reality, and other holistic methods. More longitudinal studies are warranted to understand the specific interventions that may be the most efficacious.
