36060553|a|The therapeutic landscape of multiple myeloma (MM) has benefited from an emergence of novel therapies over the last decade. By inducing T-cell kill of target cancer cells, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies have improved outcomes of patients with hematologic malignancies. B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is the current target antigen of choice for most CAR T-cell products under investigation for MM. However, their shortcomings deal with logistical and clinical challenges, including limited availability, manufacturing times, and toxicities. This article provides an overview of recently developed and investigational CAR T-cell therapies for MM, highlighting current evidence and challenges.
