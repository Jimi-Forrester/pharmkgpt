39251220|t|[Pathogenesis and Treatment of Amyloid-related Imaging Abnormalities Caused by Disease-modifying Drugs in Alzheimer's Disease].
39251220|a|Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) represent the most frequent adverse effect of lecanemab, a monoclonal antibody drug that targets amyloid beta. ARIA is observed in approximately 20% of patients who receive lecanemab. Most patients are asymptomatic; however, some develop serious neurological symptoms, and optimal management remains clinically challenging in such cases. In this review, I summarize the pathomechanism underlying ARIA and associated disorders, in addition to countermeasures for ARIA.
