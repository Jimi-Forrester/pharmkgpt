39100404|t|Effects of Reflexology on Anorexia and Sleep Quality in Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
39100404|a|Background: Cancer and associated treatment methods present numerous complications, including anorexia and disturbances in sleep patterns. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to examine the impact of reflexology on the symptoms of anorexia and sleep quality among individuals afflicted with cancer. Materials and Methods: In this double-blinded randomized clinical trial, a total of 60 patients undergoing chemotherapy at Khansari Hospital, Arak, Iran, were selected using convenience sampling and then assigned to two groups of control and experimental using blocked randomization (30 patients in each group). The sample intervention group received reflexology in an exceedingly 4-week amount (two sessions a week), By contrast, the control group was administered a placebo treatment without exerting any pressure on the reflex points during the same time frame. Sleep quality and anorexia in patients were measured using a Pittsburgh questionnaire and visual analog scale before and right after the intervention. Eventually, the data were analyzed, and we used the tests of central tendency, dispersion, independent- and paired-samples t-tests, and Chi-square. Results: The findings of the study revealed a significant improvement in sleep quality and reduction in anorexia symptoms among patients who received reflexology treatment scores (p < 0.001). Conversely, there was no significant difference in the control group before and after the intervention (without pressure effect on the foot points) (p > 0.05). Conclusions: According to the positive effects on sleep quality and the reduction of anorexia symptoms, it is recommended to incorporate this therapeutic modality along with conventional medication for the treatment of individuals with cancer.
