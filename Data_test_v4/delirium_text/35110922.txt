35110922|t|Prevalence of Inherited Procoagulant States in Cerebral Venous Thrombosis and its Correlation with Severity and Outcome.
35110922|a|Background Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is one of the important causes of stroke in young adults. It is caused by complete or partial thrombotic occlusion of the cerebral venous sinuses or cortical veins. There are many risk factors associated with this condition, out of which common ones are oral contraceptives use, genetic, or acquired thrombophilias, infections, malignancy, pregnancy, and puerperium. We aimed to study the prevalence of inherited procoagulant states in patients with CVT and correlate these states with the severity and outcome. Materials and Methods  It was a prospective observational study of 2 years duration in which 75 patients, 18 to 50 years old, with confirmed CVT were included. The baseline data, imaging findings were recorded for all the patients. After 3 months of the onset of CVT, anticoagulants were stopped and a procoagulant test was done for all patients. Severity was assessed by Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) at the onset of illness. Functional assessments were done using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at presentation, at 7 days, 6 weeks, and 3 months. Results  In the present study, any procoagulant state was seen in 9 out of 75 patients with CVT that accounted for 12% of the total population. There was no significant correlation between the presence of procoagulant states and severity of illness as assessed by GCS at presentation. The presence of any thrombophilia did not affect the final outcome at 7 days, 6 weeks or 3 months ( p  = 0.532, p  = 0.944 and p  = 0.965 respectively) as assessed by modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Conclusion  Inherited procoagulant states are an important risk factor for CVT. The presence of an inherited procoagulant state does not have any correlation with the disease severity and outcome.
