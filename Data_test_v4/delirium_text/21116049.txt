21116049|a|Antibodies that specifically bind to either amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) isoform Abeta40 or Abeta42 contribute to the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and to the development of cerebrospinal fluid-based tests for the probable diagnosis of AD. Polyclonal rabbit anti-Abeta antibodies possess high affinity and specificity, but their generation requires a long immunization period, and the resulting antibodies exhibit variable specificities and affinities. To secure a continuing supply of antibodies with uniform properties, we generated and partially characterized rabbit monoclonal antibodies specific for either Abeta40 or Abeta42. These antibodies possess nanomolar or sub-nanomolar dissociation constants and are at least 3,000-fold more selective for one isoform over the other. These antibodies are suitable for immunoblotting and, in a sandwich ELISA, RabmAb42 (anti-Abeta42) is sensitive enough to measure plasma levels of Abeta42. In addition, these antibodies have been applied to the immunohistology of Down syndrome and AD brain tissues, where they reveal fibrillar and diffuse amyloid deposits and are almost free of non-specific staining. The data indicate that diffuse amyloid deposits contain only minute amounts of Abeta40. Thus these rabbit monoclonal anti-Abeta antibodies can be widely applied in AD and Down syndrome research and diagnosis.
