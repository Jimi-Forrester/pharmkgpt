37513564|a|BACKGROUND: Klotho is an aging-related marker closely associated with a number of diseases. A growing body of evidence suggests that dietary factors and lifestyle habits can impact serum Klotho levels. The effect of dietary fiber, a key component of a healthy diet, on the body's serum Klotho levels has not been fully elucidated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between dietary fiber intake and serum Klotho levels in people aged 40-79 years in the United States. METHODS: A total of 11,282 participants were included in this study, all from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2007 to 2016. Dietary fiber intake was assessed by uniformly trained interviewers using the 24 h dietary recall method. Serum Klotho was quantified using commercially available ELISA kits manufactured by IBL International, Japan. The relationship between dietary fiber intake and serum Klotho levels was analyzed using a multiple linear regression model. Subsequently, the non-linear dose-response relationship between the two was further explored using a restricted cubic spline (RCS) model. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, serum Klotho levels increased by 1.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.8%, 3.0%) for each interquartile range increase in dietary fiber intake in all participants. Considering dietary fiber intake as a categorical variable, serum Klotho levels were found to be 4.7% higher in participants in the highest quartile of dietary fiber intake than in those in the lowest quartile (95% CI: 1.8%, 7.6%). RCS plots depicted a non-linear positive correlation between dietary fiber intake and serum Klotho levels. Subgroup analysis revealed that the relationship between dietary fiber intake and serum Klotho levels was more pronounced in older (percentage change: 7.0%; 95% CI: 2.5%, 11.7%) and overweight and obese participants (percentage change: 4.9%; 95% CI: 1.5%, 8.4%). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that dietary fiber intake was significantly associated with serum Klotho levels in participants. This finding is yet to be further confirmed by prospective studies.
