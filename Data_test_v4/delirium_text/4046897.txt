4046897|t|The anatomy and chemistry of hallucinations and a rational surgical approach to the treatment of some schizophrenic syndromes.
4046897|a|The hallucinations of schizophrenia and delirium tremens are suggested to be caused by the intrusion of the chemistry of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep into the wake period. Hippocampal and temporal lobe sites seem to contain the substrate for hallucinations. Elimination of the sympathetic nerve supply to the pineal gland could be curative in some schizophrenic syndromes.
