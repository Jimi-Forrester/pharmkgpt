23182308|a|BACKGROUND: In line with population ageing, the number of individuals with dementia is expected to increase. Nursing students are more likely to care for dementia patients during their clinical placements and once they qualify. Nevertheless, they may not be adequately prepared during their undergraduate programme. Furthermore, lack of support during their placements may negatively influence nursing students' attitudes. Measuring the level of knowledge and attitudes of nursing students could be an important step in providing evidence on the need of enhancing dementia care training in the nursing curriculum. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess knowledge and attitudes of nursing students in Malta towards dementia and identify factors related to these attributes. Moreover, the students were asked to rate their training and educational needs from a list of topics about this subject area. DESIGN: A questionnaire survey. SETTING: Department of Nursing within the Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of Malta. PARTICIPANTS: 280 full-time diploma and degree nursing students who are currently in their first, second and third year of their undergraduate programme. METHOD: The data was collected using a questionnaire consisting of the Alzheimer's disease Knowledge Scale and the Dementia Attitude Scale. A 3-point Likert scale was also used by students to rate their training and educational needs from a list of 20 topics related to dementia care. The data was analysed using quantitative methods. RESULTS: Maltese nursing students had an adequate knowledge and showed positive attitudes towards Alzheimer's disease and dementia patients. Age, academic year, training and previous care of dementia patients during their clinical placement were all found to be associated with increased knowledge and positive attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge and attitudes of nursing students in Malta towards persons with dementia could be improved by enhancing dementia care training and improving the clinical experience.
