34660040|t|Cefepime-Induced Neurotoxicity.
34660040|a|Cefepime is a common antibiotic used to treat various infections such as pneumonia, skin infections, and intra-abdominal infections due to its broad gram-positive and gram-negative spectrum. However, patients with acute kidney injury, end-stage renal disease, and renal transplantation are disproportionately at higher risk of developing complications from administration of cefepime, secondary to its predominant renal excretion. Current guidelines prescribe cefepime renal-dosing, dependent on the glomerular filtration rate, to prevent toxicity. This study presents a rare case where an acutely hospitalized patient undergoing chronic renal transplant rejection was administered renal-dose cefepime. Despite renal dosing, the patient developed neurotoxicity that manifested as delirium, inability to tolerate oral intake, and non-convulsive status epilepticus. Solely adjusting for renal dysfunction may be inadequate to prevent the accumulation of cefepime metabolites, which may present in an atypical manner in the patient. Such possibilities emphasize the need for continued evaluation of a patient's mentation in case of cefepime administration. Cefepime-induced neurotoxicity incidences need to be evaluated and researched thoroughly.
