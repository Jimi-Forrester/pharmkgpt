37547222|a|Objectives: Conducting a systematic analysis of objective measurement tools to assess the characteristics of macroscopic sleep architecture in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), amnestic MCI (aMCI), and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI) in order to provide sleep disorder guidance for MCI patients. Methods: PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CNKI, SinoMed, Wanfang Data, and VIP Data were examined to find literature relating to sleep in patients with MCI, aMCI, and naMCI, with a search time frame of build to April 2023. Following independent literature screening, data extraction, and quality evaluation by two researchers, statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4 software. Results: Twenty-five papers with 1,165 study subjects were included. Patients with MCI and aMCI were found to have altered total sleep time (TST), reduced sleep efficiency (SE), more wake-time after sleep onset (WASO), longer sleep latency (SL), a higher proportion of N1 stage and a lower proportion of N2 and N3 stage. naMCI was only found to have statistically significant differences in WASO. Conclusions: The results of this study provide evidence for macroscopic sleep architecture abnormalities among MCI patients with sleep disorders. Maintaining a normal sleep time, improving SE, and reducing sleep fragmentation may have an association with a slowed development of cognitive impairment. Further exploration is required of the effects each component of macroscopic sleep structure after the intervention has on altered sleep disturbance and cognition in MCI, aMCI, and naMCI.
