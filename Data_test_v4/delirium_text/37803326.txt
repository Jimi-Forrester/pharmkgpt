37803326|a|Astrocytic tau aggregates are seen in several primary and secondary tauopathies, including progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In all of these diseases, astrocytic tau consists mostly of the longer (4R) tau isoform, even when adjacent neuronal aggregates consist of a mixture of 3- and 4R tau, as in CTE. Even the rare astrocytic tau aggregates seen in Pick's disease appear to contain both 3R and 4R tau. The reasons for this, and the mechanisms by which astrocytic tau aggregates form, remain unclear. We used a combination of RNA in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence in post-mortem human brain tissue, as well as tau uptake studies in human stem cell-derived astrocytes, to determine the origins of astrocytic tau in 4R tauopathies. We found no differences in tau mRNA expression between diseases or between tau positive and negative astrocytes within PSP. We then found that stem cell-derived astrocytes preferentially take up long isoform (4R) recombinant tau and that this uptake is impaired by induction of reactivity with inflammatory stimuli or nutritional stress. Astrocytes exposed to either 3R or 4R tau also showed downregulation of genes related to astrocyte differentiation. Our findings suggest that astrocytes preferentially take up neuronal 4R tau from the extracellular space, potentially explaining why 4R tau is the predominant isoform in astrocytic tau aggregates.
