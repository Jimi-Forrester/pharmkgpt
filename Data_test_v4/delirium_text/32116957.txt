32116957|t|Relationship Between Psychological Distress and Cognitive Function Differs as a Function of Obesity Status in Inpatient Heart Failure.
32116957|a|Heart failure (HF) is a chronic medical condition rapidly growing in prevalence. Evidence links HF to cognitive decline, obesity, and psychological distress. The current study examined the association between cognitive function and ejection fraction (EF%), anxiety, depression, and obesity in inpatient HF. Patients completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item Scale (PHQ-9), and Mini-Cog while hospitalized for HF. Additional demographic and medical information was gathered via chart review. All models controlled for age. Of 117 patients assessed (49% male), 55% (n = 64) were obese. ANCOVA analyses were conducted comparing those with obesity and without on cognitive function: model A included EF%, model B included depression, and model C included anxiety. All three models were significantly related to cognitive function. There was a significant interaction effect of EF% and obesity and of anxiety and obesity to predict Mini-Cog scores. Post hoc partial correlational analyses revealed that anxiety was negatively associated with Mini-Cog scores among only patients without obesity. Depression was not significantly related to cognitive function in either group. However, patients with obesity demonstrated higher depression and anxiety than patients without. Results suggest that at lower EF%, and with higher anxiety, patients without obesity may be at greater risk of cognitive dysfunction than those with obesity. Cognitive dysfunction among HF patients with obesity may be independent of psychological distress. These findings may reflect the "obesity paradox" observed among HF patients, in that patients with obesity may have a different biopsychosocial presentation, which may lead to unexpected clinical outcomes. Further research is necessary to articulate the relationship of obesity and cognitive function in HF.
