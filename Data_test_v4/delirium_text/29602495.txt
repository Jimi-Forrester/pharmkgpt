29602495|t|Longitudinal accrual of neocortical amyloid burden is associated with microstructural changes of the fornix in cognitively normal adults.
29602495|a|The fornix and parahippocampal cingulum are 2 major limbic tracts in the core memory network of the hippocampus. Although these fiber tracts are known to degrade with Alzheimer's disease (AD), little is known about their vulnerability in the asymptomatic phase of AD. In this longitudinal study of cognitively normal adults, we assessed amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques using positron emission tomography and white matter microstructure using diffusion tensor imaging. We found that an increase of neocortical Abeta burden over time was associated with an increase of radial diffusivity in the fornix but not in the parahippocampal cingulum. The effect of increasing neocortical Abeta burden on the fornix remained significant after controlling for baseline measures, head motion, global brain atrophy, regional Abeta burden in the hippocampus, or microstructural changes in the global white matter. In addition, microstructural changes in the fornix were not associated with decline of episodic memory or other cognitive abilities. Our findings suggest that microstructural changes in the fornix may be an early sign in the asymptomatic phase of AD.
