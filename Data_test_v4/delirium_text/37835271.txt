37835271|a|Oxidative stress is closely associated with the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. The seeds of Carthamus tinctorius L. (CTS) and Taraxacum coreanum (TC) are reported as herbal medicines for neuroprotection. This study investigated the protective effect of CTS, TC, and their combination against oxidative stress induced by H2O2 in SH-SY5Y cells. The CTS and TC combination dose-dependently increased DPPH and  OH radical scavenging activities compared with non-combination. The combination showed a higher increased cell survival rate in H2O2-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells than CTS or TC. Moreover, CTS, TC, and their combination-treated cells reduced LDH release and apoptotic cells. CTS, TC, and their combination also inhibited NO and ROS generation. Further, the combination of up-regulated antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) and Bcl-2 protein expressions and down-regulated Bax expression. These findings suggest that the combination of CTS and TC may be beneficial to prevent and treat oxidative stress-mediated neurodegenerative diseases.
