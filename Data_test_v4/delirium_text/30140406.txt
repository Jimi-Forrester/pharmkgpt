30140406|a|OBJECTIVES: Maternal high-fat diet (HFD) is linked with metabolic and cognitive deficits in offspring. Neuroprotective effects of troxerutin, a natural bioflavonoid, have been reported recently. This study aimed to investigate the effects of troxerutin on spatial memory and serum and hippocampal apelin levels in the male offspring of HFD fed mothers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three-week-old female Wistar rats (n= 40) received HFD or control diet (CD) for 8 weeks. After mating, pregnant animals were divided into two subgroups according to the troxerutin (TRO) supplementation: CD, CD+TRO, HFD, and HFD+TRO. HFD continued to the end of lactation in HFD and HFD+TRO groups. TRO was gavaged (150 mg/kg/day) during pregnancy. After weaning, the male offspring were fed a normal diet until 12 weeks of age. Spatial memory was evaluated in the Morris water maze (MWM) on postnatal day (PND) 90. Total apelin concentration was measured in the serum of maternal rats before mating and after lactation and also in the serum and hippocampus of their male offspring. RESULTS: Both traveled distance (P<0.05) and time spent (P<0.05) in the target quadrant were significantly decreased in the offspring of HFD-fed dams, which were reversed by TRO treatment. Moreover, TRO significantly (P<0.05) decreased serum apelin levels in dams. Furthermore, TRO treatment in dams significantly (P<0.05) increased serum and hippocampal levels of apelin in their offspring. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that TRO treatment during pregnancy improved maternal HFD-induced spatial memory impairments of the offspring possibly through modulation of serum and hippocampal apelin levels.
