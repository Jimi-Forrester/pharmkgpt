37937972|a|Central nervous system infections (CNSIs) are common complications after neurosurgery with a poor prognosis. The traditional microbiological culture methodology has a low detection rate and time consuming. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has demonstrated the advantages of being faster, more accurate, and more comprehensive in clinical microbiology. Previous studies had suggested that mNGS had a high sensitivity in the diagnosis of CNSIs. Whether the application of mNGS has health economic value in clinical applications remains to be studied. We designed a prospective, single-center, superiority randomized controlled trial to compare the cost-effectiveness of mNGS with traditional methods for diagnosing CNSIs using a decision tree model. A total of 204 patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned to either the mNGS group or the traditional method group. The two groups of patients entered different decision points according to different clinical manifestations and examination results. They will be then given treatment decisions by a panel of specialists at the corresponding decision point. The primary outcome is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, which is the increased cost for every 1% increase in recovery rate. The secondary outcomes are a comparison of time cost, detection cost, and costs associated with antibiotics treatment between the two groups.IMPORTANCEDiagnosing and treating postoperative central nervous system infections (PCNSIs) remains challenging due to the low detection rate and time-consuming nature of traditional methods for identifying microorganisms in cerebrospinal fluid. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) technology provides a rapid and comprehensive understanding of microbial composition in PCNSIs by swiftly sequencing and analyzing the microbial genome. The current study aimed to assess the economic impact of using mNGS versus traditional bacterial culture-directed PCNSIs diagnosis and therapy in post-neurosurgical patients from Beijing Tiantan Hospital. mNGS is a relatively expensive test item, and whether it has the corresponding health-economic significance in the clinical application of diagnosing intracranial infection has not been studied clearly. Therefore, the investigators hope to explore the clinical application value of mNGS detection in PCNSIs after neurosurgery.
