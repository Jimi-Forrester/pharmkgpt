15138359|t|Apolipoprotein E and the risk of breast cancer in African-American and non-Hispanic white women. A review.
15138359|a|The apolipoprotein genetic polymorphism (APO E) is part of a broader paradigm, highlighting the role of gene-environment interactions as risk factors for human diseases such as cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, peripheral artery disease, diabetes, stroke, and most recently, cancer. APO E, a normal constituent of very-low-density lipoproteins and high-density lipoproteins, is involved in many functions, including lipid metabolism, cholesterol transport, tissue repair, immune response and regulation, as well as cell growth and differentiation. The location, frequency and functional effects of this gene have been reviewed elsewhere in terms of cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, neuromuscular disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke and diabetes. However, while the majority of studies have examined the significance of APO E as a molecular marker for a variety of diseases in multiethnic populations, few evaluate its role as a putative marker of cancer susceptibility. Fewer explore the importance of APO E on the risk of breast cancer, although some report an association. None have been designed to study its relevance as a marker of breast cancer risk in multiethnic populations. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the association between APO E and the risk for breast cancer in non-Hispanic white and African-American women.
