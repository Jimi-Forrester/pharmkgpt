38084148|t|Copper - a scoping review for Nordic Nutrition Recommendations 2023.
38084148|a|Copper functions as a structural component in many proteins involved in energy and iron metabolism, production of neurotransmitters, formation of connective tissue and endogenous antioxidant defence. Several biochemical indices have been suggested and used to assess copper status, but none of these has been found suitable for the detection of marginal copper deficiency or marginal copper toxicity. Copper imbalances have been linked to the pathogenesis of several chronic inflammatory diseases. During the last decade, a number of meta-analyses and systematic reviews have been published shedding light on the association between copper imbalances and some of these pathologies. Most of these meta-analyses are based on case-control studies. All show that blood copper concentrations are higher in cases than in controls, but there is inconclusive evidence to change the recommendations.
