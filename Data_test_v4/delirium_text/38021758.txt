38021758|t|A Rare Presentation of Artery of Percheron Infarct: A Case Report.
38021758|a|The artery of Percheron (AOP), a variation of the thalamic vasculature, supplies both the thalamus and the midbrain. An infarct in this area is characterized by wide neurological abnormalities, the most common of which are altered mental state, decreased degree of consciousness, and memory impairment. AOP infarcts tend to be missed during the initial computed tomography (CT) scan. The number of reports on AOP infarction has been increasing, highlighting the range of clinical presentations and challenges that clinicians can face. This case study discusses a 58-year-old male patient who was diagnosed with stroke in AOP territory without any clear neurological symptoms, and it serves as a model for patients with similar conditions.
