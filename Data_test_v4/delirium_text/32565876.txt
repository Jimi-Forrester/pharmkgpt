32565876|t|Association between DRD2 and ANKK1 polymorphisms with the deficit syndrome in schizophrenia.
32565876|a|BACKGROUND: The clinical course of schizophrenia varies among patients and is difficult to predict. Some patient populations present persistent negative symptoms, referred to as the deficit syndrome. Compared to relatives of non-deficit schizophrenia patients, family members of this patient population are at an increased risk of developing schizophrenia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to search for genetic underpinnings of the deficit syndrome in schizophrenia. METHODS: Three SNPs, i.e., rs1799732 and rs6276 located within DRD2, and rs1800497 within ANKK1, were identified in the DNA samples of 198 schizophrenia probands, including 103 patients with deficit (DS) and 95 patients with non-deficit schizophrenia (NDS). Results: No significant differences concerning any of the analyzed polymorphisms were found between DS and NDS patients. However, significant links were observed between family history of schizophrenia and the deficit syndrome, G/G genotype and rs6276 G allele. In a separate analysis, we identified significant differences in frequencies of rs6276 G allele between DS and NDS patients with family history of schizophrenia. No significant associations were found between DRD2 and ANKK1 SNPs and the age of onset or schizophrenia symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our preliminary study fail to provide evidence of associations between DRD2 and ANKK1 polymorphisms with the deficit syndrome or schizophrenia symptom severity, but suggest potential links between rs6276 in DRD2 and the deficit syndrome in patients with hereditary susceptibility to schizophrenia. However, further studies are necessary to confirm this observation.
