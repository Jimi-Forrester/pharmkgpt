35974943|a|Background: MS is a demyelinating disease that can result in significant disability. Along with physical complications, this disease is associated with significant psychological complications, including cognitive decline. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the efficacy of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy in combination with rTMS on information processing and working memory in patients with MS. Methods: The current study used a single-case experimental design and included a follow-up (A-B-A). The statistical population of the present study was all MS patients in Tehran who referred to Imam Khomeini Hospital in Tehran in 2020. The present study sample consisted of 5 MS patients selected by the sampling methods available. Subjects were assessed three times before, during, and after the intervention using the Zahlen-Verbindongs and n-back tests in the two-back position. Subjects received cognitive therapy based on mindfulness and rTMS at a frequency of 10 Hz. Visual and graphical recovery percentage and effect size methods were used to analyze the data. Results: The current study's findings indicate that combining mindfulness with rTMS has a beneficial effect on the information processing and working memory of MS patients. Overall, 67.24% recovered following the intervention stage, 53.64% recovered following the follow-up for information processing, 104.04% recovered following the intervention stage, and 76.98% recovered following the follow-up for working memory. Conclusion: The study shows the effect of mindfulness combined with rTMS on cognitive problems in MS patients. Significant improvements in MS patients' information processing, working memory, and therapeutic outcomes were observed throughout the follow-up period.
