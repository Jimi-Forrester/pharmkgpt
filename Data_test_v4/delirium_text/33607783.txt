33607783|a|ABSTRACT: A history of transient ischemic attack, severity of disease, urinary output, hematocrit, hypocapnia, and hypotension during direct revascularization (superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery [STA-MCA]) in patients with Moyamoya disease (MMD) may lead to a poor prognosis, however, to our knowledge evidence for end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) targets is lacking. Within the ranges of standardized treatment, the article was primarily designed to study the risk factors associated with the neurologic outcomes during STA-MCA for MMD especially including ETCO2 ranges and the duration in different groups. The primary goals of this study were to investigate the risk factors for neurologic deterioration and explore the association between ETCO2 ranges and neurologic outcome during general anesthesia for STA-MCA.This retrospective observational study included 56 consecutively adult Moyamoya patients who underwent STA-MCA under general anesthesia between January 2015 and August 2019. ETCO2 was summarized per patient every 5 minutes. Clinical outcome was assessed with clinical presentation, computed tomography findings, magnetic resonance imaging findings, cerebral angiography, and the modified Rankin Scale scores at discharge as main outcome measure. The outcomes were also compared for the duration of surgery, anesthesia, and the length of stay.A total of 56 patients were studied, all patients had comprehensive ETCO2 measurements. The incidence of postoperative complications was 44.6% (25/56). There was no association between age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, smoking history, drinking history, sevoflurane use, invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring, combined encephalomyosynangiosis and postoperative complications. Duration of surgery (P = .04), anesthesia (P = .036), hospital stay (P = .023) were significant correlates of postoperative complications. In the multiple logistic regression model, they were not the significant predictors. The ETCO2 ranges and the length of time in different groups within the current clinical setting was not associated with postoperative complications (P > .05).Within a standardized intraoperative treatment strategy, we found that postoperative complications had no significant correlation with sex, age, hypertension, diabetes, smoking history, drinking history, invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring, combined encephalomyosynangiosis, or sevoflurane use. Further, hypocapnia and hypercapnia during STA-MCA were not found to be associated with postoperative complications in patients with MMD.
