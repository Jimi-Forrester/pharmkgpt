39064140|t|Charting Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia: Epidemiological Insights, Risk Factors and Prevention Pathways.
39064140|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is a complex and multifactorial condition without cure at present. The latest treatments, based on anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies, have only a modest effect in reducing the progression of cognitive decline in AD, whereas the possibility of preventing AD has become a crucial area of research. In fact, recent studies have observed a decrease in dementia incidence in developed regions such as the US and Europe. However, these trends have not been mirrored in non-Western countries (Japan or China), and the contributing factors of this reduction remain unclear. The Lancet Commission has delineated a constrained classification of 12 risk factors across different life stages. Nevertheless, the scientific literature has pointed to over 200 factors-including sociodemographic, medical, psychological, and sociocultural conditions-related to the development of dementia/AD. This narrative review aims to synthesize the risk/protective factors of dementia/AD. Essentially, we found that risk/protective factors vary between individuals and populations, complicating the creation of a unified prevention strategy. Moreover, dementia/AD explanatory mechanisms involve a diverse array of genetic and environmental factors that interact from the early stages of life. In the future, studies across different population-based cohorts are essential to validate risk/protective factors of dementia. This evidence would help develop public health policies to decrease the incidence of dementia.
