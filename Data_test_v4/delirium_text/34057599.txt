34057599|a|PURPOSE: The prolonged life expectancy and increase in aging of the population have led surgeons to propose hepatectomy in the elderly population. In this study, we evaluate the surgical outcome of octogenarians in a single French center. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2020, 78 patients over 80 years old were retrospectively analyzed. The risk factors of major complications (Clavien-Dindo >= grade IIIa) and patient performance after surgery by using textbook outcome (TO) (no surgical complications, no prolonged hospital stay (<= 15 days), no readmission <=90 days after discharge, and no mortality <=90 days after surgery) were studied. RESULTS: The main surgical indication was for malignancy (96%), including mainly colorectal liver metastases (n = 41; 53%) and hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 22; 28%), and major hepatectomy was performed in 28 patients (36%). There were 6 (8%) postoperative mortalities. The most frequent complications were pulmonary (n = 22; 32%), followed by renal insufficiency (n = 22; 28%) and delirium (n = 16; 21%). Major complications occurred in 19 (24%) patients. On multivariate analysis, the main risk factors for major complications were the median vascular clamping time (0 vs 35; P = 0.04) and male sex (P = 0.046). TO was ultimately achieved in 30 patients (38%), and there was no prognostic factor for achievement of TO. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatectomy in octogenarians is associated with acceptable morbidity and mortality. Meanwhile, prolonged hepatic pedicle clamping should be avoided especially if hepatectomy is planned in a male patient.
