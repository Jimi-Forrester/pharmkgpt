23675013|a|To help elucidate rabies disease patterns and control issues, a full assessment of a human case of dog-variant rabies was undertaken. In 2000, a 54-year-old man presented to a New York hospital with lower back discomfort four days after arrival from Africa. Rabies was first suspected 8 days after hospitalization based on clinical signs, specimens were collected on the same day, and rabies infection was confirmed the following day (fluorescence antibody testing on nuchal skin biopsy specimen). By the 12(th) day after illness onset, he was unresponsive, and life support was removed on day 15. Subsequently, an African dog variant was confirmed by nucleic acid sequence analysis of rabies viral RNA extracted and amplified from the patient's saliva. Management of human concerns about exposure to the patient kept the number of persons receiving postexposure prophylaxis to 26. With less than half of the U.S. human rabies cases being diagnosed antemortem, this case emphasizes the need to routinely include rabies in the differential diagnosis of any unexplained encephalitis to ensure early confirmation and triage of human contacts to reduce associated healthcare costs.
