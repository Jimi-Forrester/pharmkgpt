7079394|t|Length of operation and morbidity: is there a relationships?
7079394|a|In summary, it is clear that duration of surgery is positively correlated with postoperative morbidity in both major and relatively minor procedures. It should be kept in mind that the reason for this in many cases may be that the preoperative condition of the patient or the nature of the surgical procedure can affect both operative time and postoperative outcome. However, there can be little doubt of the independent influence of operative time on the incidence of wound infection and sepsis. It is also highly probably that prolonged anesthesia tends to make postoperative atelectasis and other pulmonary complications more likely to occur, especially if tidal volumes are inadequate. It can be said, too, that the anesthetist will be more likely to see arrhythmias the longer the surgeon operates. The association of myocardial infarction, renal failure, thromboembolic disease, and delirium with prolonged operation time is also a possibility.
