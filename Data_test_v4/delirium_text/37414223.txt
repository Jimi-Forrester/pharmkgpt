37414223|t|p-Coumaric acid attenuates the effects of Abeta42 in vitro and in a Drosophila Alzheimer's disease model.
37414223|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative condition in civilizations worldwide. The distinctive occurrence of amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation into insoluble fibrils is part of the disease pathophysiology with Abeta42 being the most toxic and aggressive Abeta species. The polyphenol, p-Coumaric acid (pCA), has been known to boost a number of therapeutic benefits. Here, pCA's potential to counteract the negative effects of Abeta42 was investigated. First, pCA was confirmed to reduce Abeta42 fibrillation using an in vitro activity assay. The compound was next examined on Abeta42-exposed PC12 neuronal cells and was found to significantly decrease Abeta42-induced cell mortality. pCA was then examined using an AD Drosophila melanogaster model. Feeding of pCA partially reversed the rough eye phenotype, significantly lengthened AD Drosophila's lifespan, and significantly enhanced the majority of the AD Drosophila's mobility in a sex-dependent manner. The findings of this study suggest that pCA may have therapeutic benefits for AD.
