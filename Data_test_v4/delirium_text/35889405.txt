35889405|a|Ozone (O3) is an oxidating tropospheric pollutant. When O3 interacts with biological substrates, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) are formed. Severe oxidative damage exhausts the endogenous antioxidant system, which leads to the decreased activity of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Curcumin (CUR) is a natural polyphenol with well-documented antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this work is to evaluate the effects of curcumin on CAT, GPx, and SOD activity and the inhibition of oxidative damage after the acute and chronic exposure to O3. Fifty male Wistar rats were divided into five experimental groups: the intact control, CUR-fed control, exposed-to-O3 control, CUR-fed (preventive), and CUR-fed (therapeutic) groups. These two last groups received a CUR-supplemented diet while exposed to O3. These experiments were performed during acute- and chronic-exposure phases. In the preventive and therapeutic groups, the activity of plasma CAT, GPx, and SOD was increased during both exposure phases, with slight differences; concomitantly, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation were inhibited. For this reason, we propose that CUR could be used to enhance the activity of the antioxidant system and to diminish the oxidative damage caused by exposure to O3.
