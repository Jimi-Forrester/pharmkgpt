37146123|a|Pathological changes in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and astrocytes are closely associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Voluntary running has been found to effectively delay AD. However, the effects of voluntary running on mPFC astrocytes in AD are unclear. A total of 40 10-month-old male amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice and 40 wild-type (WT) mice were randomly divided into control and running groups, and the running groups underwent voluntary running for 3 months. Mouse cognition was assessed by the novel object recognition (NOR), Morris water maze (MWM), and Y maze tests. The effects of voluntary running on mPFC astrocytes were investigated using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and stereology. APP/PS1 mice performed significantly worse than WT mice in the NOR, MWM, and Y maze tests, and voluntary running improved the performance of APP/PS1 mice in these tests. The total number of mPFC astrocytes was increased, cell bodies were enlarged, and protrusion number and length were increased in AD mice compared with WT mice, but there was no difference in component 3 (C3) levels in the mPFC (total mPFC level); however, C3 and S100B levels in astrocytes were increased in AD mice. Voluntary running reduced the total number of astrocytes and S100B levels in astrocytes and increased the density of PSD95+ puncta in direct contact with astrocyte protrusions in the APP/PS1 mouse mPFC. Three months of voluntary running inhibited astrocyte hyperplasia and S100B expression in astrocytes, increased the density of synapses in contact with astrocytes, and improved cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice.
