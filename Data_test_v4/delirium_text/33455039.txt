Mobilization of hippocampal neurogenesis has been regarded as a promising therapeutic approach to restore injured neurons in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Icarisid II (ICS II), an active ingredient derived from Epimedii Folium, has been reported to exhibit multiple neuroprotective effects. In the present study, we investigated the effects of ICS II on the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) and amyloid precusor protein (APP)-overexpressing NSCs (APP-NSCs) in vitro. Our results demonstrated that ICS II dose-dependently suppressed apoptosis and elevated viability of APP-NSCs. ICS II (1 muM) potently promoted proliferation and neuronal differentiation of NSCs and APP-NSCs. ICS II (1 muM) significantly upregulated Wnt-3a expression, increased the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta and enhanced the nuclear transfer of beta-catenin. Moreover, ICS II also promoted astrocytes to secrete Wnt-3a, which positively modulates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. These findings demonstrate that ICS II promotes NSCs proliferation and neuronal differentiation partly by activating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.
