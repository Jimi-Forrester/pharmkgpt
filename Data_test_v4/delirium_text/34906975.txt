34906975|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of a plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 assay in classifying amyloid PET status across global research studies using samples collected by multiple centers that utilize different blood collection and processing protocols. METHODS: Plasma samples (n = 465) were obtained from 3 large Alzheimer disease (AD) research cohorts in the United States (n = 182), Australia (n = 183), and Sweden (n = 100). Plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 was measured by a high precision immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IPMS) assay and compared to the reference standards of amyloid PET and CSF Abeta42/Abeta40. RESULTS: In the combined cohort of 465 participants, plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 had good concordance with amyloid PET status (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve [AUC] 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80-0.87); concordance improved with the inclusion of APOE epsilon4 carrier status (AUC 0.88, 95% CI 0.85-0.91). The AUC of plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 with CSF amyloid status was 0.85 (95% CI 0.78-0.91) and improved to 0.93 (95% CI 0.89-0.97) with APOE epsilon4 status. These findings were consistent across the 3 cohorts, despite differences in protocols. The assay performed similarly in both cognitively unimpaired and impaired individuals. DISCUSSION: Plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 is a robust measure for detecting amyloid plaques and can be utilized to aid in the diagnosis of AD, identify those at risk for future dementia due to AD, and improve the diversity of populations enrolled in AD research and clinical trials. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that plasma Abeta42/Abeta40, as measured by a high precision IPMS assay, accurately diagnoses brain amyloidosis in both cognitively unimpaired and impaired research participants.
