39044934|a|Obesity is a global health concern owing to its association with numerous degenerative diseases and the fact that it may lead to early aging. Various markers of aging, including telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, altered protein homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell disorders, and intercellular communication, are influenced by obesity. Consequently, there is a critical need for safe and effective approaches to prevent obesity and mitigate the onset of premature aging. In recent years, intermittent fasting (IF), a dietary strategy that alternates between periods of fasting and feeding, has emerged as a promising dietary strategy that holds potential in counteracting the aging process associated with obesity. This article explores the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which IF affects obesity-related early aging. IF regulates various physiological processes and organ systems, including the liver, brain, muscles, intestines, blood, adipose tissues, endocrine system, and cardiovascular system. Moreover, IF modulates key signaling pathways such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), sirtuins, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and fork head box O (FOXO). By targeting these pathways, IF has the potential to attenuate aging phenotypes associated with obesity-related early aging. Overall, IF offers promising avenues for promoting healthier lifestyles and mitigating the premature aging process in individuals affected by obesity.
