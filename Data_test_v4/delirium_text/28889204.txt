28889204|t|A microfluidics-based mobility shift assay to identify new inhibitors of beta-secretase for Alzheimer's disease.
28889204|a|The beta-secretase (BACE1) initiates the generation of toxic amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) from amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), which was widely considered to play a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, a novel microfluidics-based mobility shift assay (MMSA) was developed, validated, and applied for the screening of BACE1 inhibitors for AD. First, the BACE1 activity assay was established with a new fluorescent peptide substrate (FAM-EVNLDAEF) derived from the Swedish mutant APP, and high-quality ratiometric data were generated in both endpoint and kinetic modes by electrophoretic separation of peptide substrate from the BACE1 cleaved product (FAM-EVNL) before fluorescence quantification. To validate the assay, the inhibition and kinetic parameter values of two known inhibitors (AZD3839 and AZD3293) were evaluated, and the results were in good agreement with those reported by other methods. Finally, the assay was applied to screen for new inhibitors from a 900-compound library in a 384-well format, and one novel hit (IC50 = 26.5 +- 1.5 muM) was identified. Compared with the common fluorescence-based assays, the primary advantage of the direct MMSA was to discover novel BACE1 inhibitors with lower auto-fluorescence interference, and its superb capability for kinetic study.
