33915783|a|Obesity has recently emerged as a public health issue facing developing countries in the world. It is caused by the accumulation of fat in adipose, characterized by insulin resistance, excessive lipid accumulation, inflammation, and oxidative stress, leading to an increase in adipokine levels. Herein, we investigated the capacity of a bioactive polyphenolic compound (ferulic acid (FA)) to control adipocyte dysfunction in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (in vitro). Key adipocyte differentiation markers, glycerol content, lipolysis-associated mRNA, and proteins were measured in experimental adipocytes. FA-treated adipocytes exhibited downregulated key adipocyte differentiation factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), CCAT enhancer binding-proteins-alpha (C/EBP-alpha) and its downstream targets in a time-dependent manner. The FA-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes showed an increased release of glycerol content compared with non-treated adipocytes. Also, FA treatment significantly up-regulated the lipolysis-related factors, including p-HSL, and p-perilipin, and down-regulated ApoD, Sema3C, Cxcl12, Sfrp2, p-stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), adiponectin, and Grk5. Also, the FA treatment showed significantly down-regulated adipokines leptin, chemerin, and irisin than the non-treated cells. The present findings indicated that FA showed significant anti-adipogenic and lipogenic activities by regulating key adipocyte factors and enzyme, enhanced lipolysis by HSL/perilipin cascade. FA is considered a potent molecule to prevent obesity and its associated metabolic changes in the future.
