38070888|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease and other dementias affect >50 million individuals globally and are characterised by broad clinical and biological heterogeneity. Cohort and biobank studies have played a critical role in advancing the understanding of disease pathophysiology and in identifying novel diagnostic and treatment approaches. However, further discovery and validation cohorts are required to clarify the real-world utility of new biomarkers, facilitate research into the development of novel therapies and advance our understanding of the clinical heterogeneity and pathobiology of neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Tallaght University Hospital Institute for Memory and Cognition Biobank for Research in Ageing and Neurodegeneration (TIMC-BRAiN) will recruit 1000 individuals over 5 years. Participants, who are undergoing diagnostic workup in the TIMC Memory Assessment and Support Service (TIMC-MASS), will opt to donate clinical data and biological samples to a biobank. All participants will complete a detailed clinical, neuropsychological and dementia severity assessment (including Addenbrooke's Cognitive Assessment, Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, Clinical Dementia Rating Scale). Participants undergoing venepuncture/lumbar puncture as part of the clinical workup will be offered the opportunity to donate additional blood (serum/plasma/whole blood) and cerebrospinal fluid samples for longitudinal storage in the TIMC-BRAiN biobank. Participants are followed at 18-month intervals for repeat clinical and cognitive assessments. Anonymised clinical data and biological samples will be stored securely in a central repository and used to facilitate future studies concerned with advancing the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been granted by the St. James's Hospital/Tallaght University Hospital Joint Research Ethics Committee (Project ID: 2159), which operates in compliance with the European Communities (Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products for Human Use) Regulations 2004 and ICH Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. Findings using TIMC-BRAiN will be published in a timely and open-access fashion.
