39594091|a|Probiotics have garnered escalating attention in the treatment and prevention of inflammatory disorders. In this study, Lactobacillus rhamnosus RL-H3-005 (RL5) and Pediococcus acidilactici RP-H3-006 (RP6), which possess anti-inflammatory effects and favorable probiotic attributes, were selected through the comparison of an RAW264.7 inflammatory cell model screening and in vitro probiotic properties. Subsequently, it was implemented in an animal model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. The results demonstrated that RL5 and RP6 could inhibit the release of proinflammatory factors in RAW264.7 inflammatory cells and exhibited excellent environmental adaptability, adhesion, safety, and antibacterial activity. Additionally, RL5 and RP6 provided protective effects on the intestines of mice with acute colitis by reducing the levels of intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress. Concurrently, supplementation with RL5 and RP6 modulated the composition of the gut microbiota in mice. These discoveries suggest that RL5 and RP6 can be used as a novel probiotic for alleviating intestinal inflammation.
