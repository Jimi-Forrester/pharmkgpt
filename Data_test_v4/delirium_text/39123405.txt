39123405|t|Evaluating the Cellular Roles of the Lysine Acetyltransferase Tip60 in Cancer: A Multi-Action Molecular Target for Precision Oncology.
39123405|a|Precision (individualized) medicine relies on the molecular profiling of tumors' dysregulated characteristics (genomic, epigenetic, transcriptomic) to identify the reliance on key pathways (including genome stability and epigenetic gene regulation) for viability or growth, and then utilises targeted therapeutics to disrupt these survival-dependent pathways. Non-mutational epigenetic changes alter cells' transcriptional profile and are a key feature found in many tumors. In contrast to genetic mutations, epigenetic changes are reversable, and restoring a normal epigenetic profile can inhibit tumor growth and progression. Lysine acetyltransferases (KATs or HATs) protect genome stability and integrity, and Tip60 is an essential acetyltransferase due to its roles as an epigenetic and transcriptional regulator, and as master regulator of the DNA double-strand break response. Tip60 is commonly downregulated and mislocalized in many cancers, and the roles that mislocalized Tip60 plays in cancer are not well understood. Here we categorize and discuss Tip60-regulated genes, evaluate Tip60-interacting proteins based on cellular localization, and explore the therapeutic potential of Tip60-targeting compounds as epigenetic inhibitors. Understanding the multiple roles Tip60 plays in tumorigenesis will improve our understanding of tumor progression and will inform therapeutic options, including informing potential combinatorial regimes with current chemotherapeutics, leading to improvements in patient outcomes.
