36166064|a|BACKGROUND: Mortality and delirium in critically ill patients are affected by the provided analgesics and sedatives. The deeper the sedation and the higher the dose of analgesics applied, the more difficult it is to assess pain and the depth of sedation. Therefore, instrumental measurement methods, such as the measurement of the stimulus threshold of the nociceptive flexion reflex (NFRT), are becoming increasingly more important. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to investigate a potential association between the level of the nociceptive flexion reflex, mortality, and the occurrence of delirium. MATERIAL AND METHODS: By retrospectively analyzing a pilot data set of 57 ICU patients from the interdisciplinary surgical ICU of Ulm University Hospital surveyed between 11/2018 and 03/2020, a possible association between the NFRT, mortality, and the occurrence of delirium was calculated in an adjusted logistic regression model. Depending on the cut-off value, the stimulus threshold corridors result in the following comparison pairs: < 20 mA vs. 20-40 mA/20-50 mA/20-60 mA, > 40 mA vs. 20-40 mA, > 50 mA vs. 20-50 mA and > 60 mA vs. 20-60 mA. Results are presented as odds ratios (OR) adjusted for age, sex, height, TISS-28, SAPS II, RASS, BPS, and applied analgesics. Pain assessment was performed, in addition to the Behavioral Pain scale, >= 3 times daily by measuring NFRT. RESULTS: A statistically nonsignificant tendency for an increase in mortality incidence occurred with an NFRT > 50 mA, versus a stimulus threshold corridor of 20-50 mA (OR 3.3, CI: 0.89-12.43, p = 0.07). A trend toward a reduction in delirium incidence occurred at an NFRT < 20 mA, versus a stimulus threshold corridor of 20-40 mA (OR 0.40, CI: 0.18-0.92, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Based on the level of the NFRT, no recommendation can be made at this point to adjust the analgesic regimen of critically ill patients, who are unable to communicate. The observation of a tendency towards an increase in mortality at high stimulus thresholds or a reduction in the occurrence of delirium at low stimulus thresholds of the NFRT must be verified in standardized studies.
