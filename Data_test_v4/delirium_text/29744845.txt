29744845|t|Disaggregation of Abeta42 for Structural and Biochemical Studies.
29744845|a|The amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides that form the amyloid fibrils associated with Alzheimer's disease are generated by sequential proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein by beta- and gamma-secretase. The two predominant Abeta peptides, Abeta40 and Abeta42, differ by two amino acids, are soluble as monomers at low concentration (and/or low temperature) and are normally cleared from the brain parenchyma. In order to study the structure and assembly of these peptides, they are often synthesized using solid-phase peptide synthesis and purified. Here, we outline the method we use to prepare monomeric Abeta for structural and biochemical studies.
