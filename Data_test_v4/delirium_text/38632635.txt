38632635|a|BACKGROUND: Patients requiring coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are often loaded with antithrombotic drugs (AT) and are at an increased risk for perioperative bleeding complications. Active AT removal by a hemoadsorption cartridge integrated in the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit is increasingly used in this setting to reduce bleeding, and herein we describe the extension of this application in patients on AT undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB). METHODS: Ten patients (80% male; mean age: 67.4 +- 9.2years) were treated with ticagrelor (eight patients), rivaroxaban and ticagrelor (one patient), and rivaroxaban (one patient) prior to OPCAB surgery. AT's were discontinued one day before surgery in nine patients and on the day of surgery in one patient, and all patients were also on aspirin. The cohort mean EuroSCORE-II was 2.9 +- 1.5%. A hemoadsorption cartridge was integrated into a dialysis device (n=4) or a stand-alone apheresis pump (n=6) periprocedural, for a treatment time of 145 +- 33 min. Outcome measures included bleeding according to Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC)-4 and 24-hour chest-tube-drainage (CTD). RESULTS: Mean operation time was 184 +- 35 min. All patients received a left internal thoracic artery with a mean of 2.3 +- 0.9 total grafts. One patient had a BARC-4 bleeding event and there were no surgical re-explorations for bleeding. Mean 24-hours CTD was 680 +- 307mL. During follow-up of 19.5 +- 17.0 months, none of the patients died or required further reinterventions. No device-related adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Hemoadsorption via a stand-alone apheresis pump during OPCAB surgery was feasible and safe. This innovative and new approach showed favorable bleeding rates in patients on antithrombotic drugs requiring bypass surgery.
