38833712|t|Geographic Variation of Antidementia and Antipsychotic Medication Use Among US Nursing Home Residents With Dementia.
38833712|a|BACKGROUND: Several antidementia medications have been approved for symptomatic treatment of cognitive and functional impairment due to Alzheimer disease. Antipsychotics are often prescribed off-label for behavioral symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the basis for regional variation in antidementia and antipsychotic medication use. SETTING: US nursing homes (n=9735), hospital referral regions (HRR; n=289). SUBJECTS: Long-stay residents with dementia (n=273,004). METHODS: Using 2018 Minimum Data Set 3.0 linked to Medicare data, facility information, and Dartmouth Atlas files, we calculated prevalence of use and separate multilevel logistic models [outcomes: memantine, cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI), antipsychotic use] estimated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% CIs for resident, facility, and HRR characteristics. We then fit a series of cross-classified multilevel logistic models to estimate the proportional change in cluster variance (PCV). RESULTS: Overall, 20.9% used antipsychotics, 16.1% used memantine, and 23.3% used ChEIs. For antipsychotics, facility factors [eg, use of physical restraints (aOR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.05-1.11) or poor staffing ratings (aOR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.06-1.14)] were associated with more antipsychotic use. Nursing homes in HRRs with the highest health care utilization had greater antidementia drug use (aOR memantine: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.44-1.96). Resident/facility factors accounted for much regional variation in antipsychotics (PCV STATE : 27.80%; PCV HRR : 39.54%). For antidementia medications, HRR-level factors accounted for most regional variation (memantine PCV STATE : 37.44%; ChEI PCV STATE : 39.02%). CONCLUSION: Regional variations exist in antipsychotic and antidementia medication use among nursing home residents with dementia suggesting the need for evidence-based protocols to guide the use of these medications.
