38872387|t|Gray matter volume mediates the association of long-term blood pressure variability with cognitive function in an adult population.
38872387|a|INTRODUCTION: We delineated the associations among long-term blood pressure variability (BPV), brain structure, and cognitive function. METHODS: We included 1254 adult participants from the Kailuan study. BPV was calculated from 2006 to 2020. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were conducted in 2020. RESULTS: Higher systolic BPV (SBPV) and diastolic BPV (DBPV) were associated with lower total and frontal gray matter (GM) volume, and higher SBPV was associated with lower temporal GM volume. Elevated DBPV was associated with lower volume of total brain and parietal GM, and higher white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume. Higher SBPV and DBPV were associated with lower MoCA scores. Decreased total and regional GM volume and increased WMH volume were associated with lower MoCA scores. The association between SBPV and cognitive function was mediated by total, frontal, and temporal GM volume. DISCUSSION: GM volume may play key roles in the association between SBPV and cognitive function. HIGHLIGHTS: SBPV and DBPV were negatively associated with total and regional brain volume. SBPV and DBPV were negatively associated with cognitive function. Decreased brain volume was associated with cognitive decline. GM volume mediated the negative association between SBPV and cognitive function.
