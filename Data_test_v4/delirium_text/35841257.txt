35841257|a|Improving the prevention, detection, and treatment of Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) across racial, ethnic, and other diverse populations is a national priority. To this end, this paper proposes the development of the Standard Health Record for Dementia (SHRD, pronounced "shared") for collecting and sharing AD/ADRD real-world data (RWD). SHRD would replace the current unstandardized, fragmented, or missing state of key RWD with an open source, consensus-based, and interoperable common data standard. This paper describes how SHRD could leverage the best practices of the Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODETM) initiative to advance prevention, detection, and treatment; gain adoption by clinicians and electronic health record (EHR) vendors; and establish sustainable business and governance models. It describes a range of potential use cases to advance equity, including strengthening public health surveillance by facilitating AD/ADRD registry reporting; improving case detection and staging; and diversifying participation in clinical trials.
