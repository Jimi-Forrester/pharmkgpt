36140216|a|Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are endopeptidases responsible for the cleavage of intra- and extracellular proteins. Several brain MMPs have been implicated in neurological disorders including epilepsy. We recently showed that the novel gelatinase inhibitor ACT-03 has disease-modifying effects in models of epilepsy. Here, we studied its effects on neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Using the rapid kindling rat model of epilepsy, we examined whether ACT-03 affected astro- and microgliosis in the brain using immunohistochemistry. Cellular and molecular alterations were further studied in vitro using human fetal astrocyte and brain endothelial cell (hCMEC/D3) cultures, with a focus on neuroinflammatory markers as well as on barrier permeability using an endothelial and astrocyte co-culture model. We observed less astro- and microgliosis in the brains of kindled animals treated with ACT-03 compared to control vehicle-treated animals. In vitro, ACT-03 treatment attenuated stimulation-induced mRNA expression of several pro-inflammatory factors in human fetal astrocytes and brain endothelial cells, as well as a loss of barrier integrity in endothelial and astrocyte co-cultures. Since ACT-03 has disease-modifying effects in epilepsy models, possibly via limiting gliosis, inflammation, and barrier integrity loss, it is of interest to further evaluate its effects in a clinical trial.
