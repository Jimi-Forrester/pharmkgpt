9491620|a|The knowledge in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders, and their classification has been dramatically improved by the progresses in genetics and molecular biology. Such a progress has not yet been observed in therapeutics but sustained symptomatic results may occur in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and to a lesser extent in Alzheimer's disease. More recently, other therapeutic approaches were used in trials with neuroprotective drugs with some encouraging results.
