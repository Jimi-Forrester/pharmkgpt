35909868|t|Classification of EEG Signals Using Neural Network for Predicting Consumer Choices.
35909868|a|EEG, or Electroencephalogram, is an instrument that examines the brain's functions while it is executing any activity. EEG signals to aid in the identification of brain processes and movements and are thus useful in the detection of neurobiological illnesses. Pulses have a very weak magnitude and are recorded from peak to peak, with pulse width ranging from 0.5 to 100 V, which is around 100 times below than ECG signals. As a result, many types of noise can easily influence them. Because EEG signals are so important in detecting brain illnesses, it is critical to preprocess them for accurate assessment and detection. The crown of your head The EEG is a weighted combination of the signals generated by the different small locations beneath the electrodes on the cortical plate. The rhythm of electrical impulses is useful for evaluating a broad range of brain diseases. Hypertension, Alzheimer, and brain damage are all possibilities. We can compare and distinguish the brainwaves for different emotions and illnesses linked with the brain by studying the EEG signal. Multiple research studies and methodologies for preprocessing, extraction of features, and evaluation of EEG data have recently been created. The use of EEG in human-computer communication could be a novel and demanding field that has acquired traction in recent years. We present predictive modeling for analyzing the customer's preference of likes and dislikes via EEG signal in our report. The impulses were obtained when clients used the Internet to seek for multiple items. The studies were carried out on a dataset that included a variety of consumer goods.
