23636548|a|OBJECTIVES: There is discussion about the effect of cholinesterase inhibitors (CERs) on weight of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Given the adverse outcomes of weight loss in AD patients, it is important to establish the effect of CERs on weight. This study aimed tot assess the long-term effect of galantamine on weight of AD patients. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This longitudinal study was performed at a large memory clinic in the North of the Netherlands. During the period 2002 to 2010, 303 community-dwelling AD patients, aged 65 years or older who started using a cholinesterase inhibitor (CER), were included. MEASUREMENTS: Socio-demographic characteristics and data on comorbidity, number of medications, type and dosage of CER, use of care, cognitive function, behaviour and nutritional status (weight, Body Mass Index (BMI)) were recorded at the time the diagnosis AD was made and at subsequent outpatient clinic visits. The Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model was used to determine the effect of galantamine of 16 mg and 24 mg on weight. The effect of galantamine in a dose of 16 and 24 mg was investigated because the other groups (rivastigmine, galantamine 8 mg) were too small to determine the effect on weight by GEE analysis. Donepezil is not available in the Netherlands. RESULTS: The median follow-up time between the moment patients started using a CER (T0) and the 1st visit was 6 months (n=300); between T0 and the 2nd visit 13 months (n=212); between T0 and the 3rd visit 25 months (n=117) and between T0 and the 4th visit 37 months (n=58). Galantamine 16 mg and 24 mg, corrected for age, gender, social status, informal care, professional care, comorbidity, number of medications, cognition, behaviour and appetite, had no effect on weight (p > 0.05). Male patients had a higher average weight compared to female patients (p=0.000, B=8.333). Patients without an informal caregiver (p=0.01, B=-3.697) or partner (p=0.042, B=-3.197) had a lower average weight compared to patients with an informal caregiver or partner. CONCLUSION: Weight loss in AD patients should not be attributed to long-term treatment with galantamine. This is in accordance with the French guideline. If AD patients are losing weight, other causes, including insufficient care, should be investigated.
