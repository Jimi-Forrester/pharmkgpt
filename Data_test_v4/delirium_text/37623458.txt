37623458|t|Association of Delirium and Depression with Respiratory and Outcome Measures in COVID-19 Inpatients.
37623458|a|Delirium (DEL) and depression (DEP) may impair the course and severity of acute respiratory illness. The impact of such syndromes on respiratory and outcome parameters in inpatients with COVID-19 needs clarification. To clarify the relationship between DEL and DEP and respiratory outcome measures, we enrolled 100 inpatients from COVID-19 units of the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS of Rome. Participants were divided into those with DEL, DEP, or absence of either delirium or depression (CONT). Delirium severity was assessed with the Neelson and Champagne Confusion Scale (NEECHAM). Psychopathology was assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Dependent variables include: (a) respiratory parameters, i.e., partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2), oxygen saturation (SpO2), ratio between arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), and fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2); (b) outcome parameters, i.e., duration of hospitalization and number of pharmacological treatments used during the hospitalization. We investigated between-group differences and the relationships between severity of delirium/depression and the dependent variables. Duration of hospitalization was longer for DEL than for either DEP or CONT and for DEP compared to CONT. NEECHAM and HAM-D scores predicted lower PaO2 and PaO2/FiO2 levels in the DEL and DEP groups, respectively. In DEP, BPRS scores positively correlated with duration of hospitalization. Delirium impacted the course of COVID-19 more severely than depression. The mechanisms by which delirium and depression worsen respiratory parameters differ.
