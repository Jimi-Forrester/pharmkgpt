31644927|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive and memory problems. Scopolamine (SCOP) is a natural anticholinergic drug that was proven to cause memory impairment in rats. Chelating agents are potential neuroprotective and memory enhancing agents as they can trap iron that enters in pathological deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) which is a hallmark in AD and memory disorders. This study investigated the potential neuroprotective and memory enhancing effects of the iron chelating drug, Deferiprone. Three doses (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) were administered to rats treated with SCOP (1.14 mg/kg/day). Systemic administration of SCOP for seven days caused memory impairment which manifested as decreased time spent in platform quadrant in Morris water maze test, decreased retention latencies in passive avoidance test, and increased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, Abeta, and free iron deposition. It was observed that pretreatment with Deferiprone increased platform quadrant time in Morris water maze and increased retention latencies in the passive avoidance test. It also attenuated the increase in AChE activity and decreased Abeta and iron deposition. Overall, Deferiprone (10 mg/kg) was determined as the most effective dose. Therefore, this study suggests neuroprotective and memory enhancing effects for Deferiprone in SCOP-treated rats which might be attributed to its iron chelating action and anti-oxidative effect.
