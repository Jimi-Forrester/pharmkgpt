31197326|t|Developing a Spatial Navigation Screening Tool Sensitive to the Preclinical Alzheimer Disease Continuum.
31197326|a|OBJECTIVE: There remains a need for a non-invasive and cost-effective screening measure that could be administered prior to the provision of a lumbar puncture or positron emission tomography scan for the detection of preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD). Previous findings suggest that a hippocampally-based spatial navigation task may be effective for screening individuals for the preclinical AD continuum (i.e., low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta42). Unfortunately, this task took 1.5-2 hours to administer, which would be time-prohibitive in a clinical setting. Therefore, the goal of this study was to compare psychometric properties of six spatial navigation-related tasks in order to take the next steps in developing a clinically appropriate screening measure. METHODS: Psychometric properties (i.e., reliability, diagnostic accuracy, validity) of a modified version of the cognitive mapping task, two binding tasks, a visual perspective taking task, and self- and informant report versions of a questionnaire were examined in a sample of 91 clinically normal (CN) individuals. CSF Abeta42 and ptau181 were available for 30 individuals. RESULTS: The learning phase of the cognitive mapping task and the self-report questionnaire were sensitive to identifying individuals in the preclinical AD continuum (93% and 87% sensitivity, 60% and 67% specificity, respectively). These two measures also demonstrated good test-retest stability (intraclass correlation coefficients = .719 and .838, respectively) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alphas = .825 and .965, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a self-report questionnaire and aspects of a cognitive mapping task may be particularly appropriate for development as screening tools for identifying individuals in the preclinical AD continuum.
