36254106|a|BACKGROUND: Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) diagnosis is based solely on glycaemia, even though it is an endpoint of numerous dysmetabolic pathways. Type 2 Diabetes complexity is challenging in a real-world scenario; thus, dissecting T2D heterogeneity is a priority. Cluster analysis, which identifies natural clusters within multidimensional data based on similarity measures, poses a promising tool to unravel Diabetes complexity. METHODS: In this review, we scrutinize and integrate the results obtained in most of the works up to date on cluster analysis and T2D. RESULTS: To correctly stratify subjects and to differentiate and individualize a preventive or therapeutic approach to Diabetes management, cluster analysis should be informed with more parameters than the traditional ones, such as etiological factors, pathophysiological mechanisms, other dysmetabolic co-morbidities, and biochemical factors, that is the millieu. Ultimately, the above-mentioned factors may impact on Diabetes and its complications. Lastly, we propose another theoretical model, which we named the Integrative Model. We differentiate three types of components: etiological factors, mechanisms and millieu. Each component encompasses several factors to be projected in separate 2D planes allowing an holistic interpretation of the individual pathology. CONCLUSION: Fully profiling the individuals, considering genomic and environmental factors, and exposure time, will allow the drive to precision medicine and prevention of complications.
