6310763|a|The observations of six patients, who were given dogmatil as the main psychopharmaceutical agent for 6 to 13 years, are studied. Five patients had psychosis and one neurosis. From a therapeutic point of view, dogmatil ensured excellent control of delirium and apragmatism. Dogmatil is an advantageous alternative to incisive neuroleptics. That no escape phenomena occurs is emphasized by the duration of the study (6 to 13 years). Tolerance proved excellent, better than that of the neuroleptics used previously.
