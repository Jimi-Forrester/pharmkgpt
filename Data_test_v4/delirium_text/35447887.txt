35447887|a|Many severe inflammation conditions are complement-dependent with the complement component C5a-C5aR1 axis as an important driver. At the RNA level, the blood transcriptome undergoes programmed expression of coding and long non-coding RNAs to combat invading microorganisms. Understanding the expression of long non-coding RNAs containing Alu elements in inflammation is important for reconstructing cell fate trajectories leading to severe disease. We have assembled a pipeline for computation mining of new Alu-containing long non-coding RNAs by intersecting immune genes with known Alu coordinates in the human genome. By applying the pipeline to patient bulk RNA-seq data with sepsis, we found immune genes containing 48 Alu insertion as robust candidates for further study. Interestingly, 1 of the 48 candidates was located within the complement system receptor gene C5aR1 and holds promise as a target for RNA therapeutics.
