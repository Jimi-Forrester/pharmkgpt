34690566|t|Perineuronal Net Dynamics in the Pathophysiology of Epilepsy.
34690566|a|Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are condensed extracellular matrix (ECM) assemblies of polyanionic chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, hyaluronan, and tenascins that primarily wrap around GABAergic parvalbumin (PV) interneurons. During development, PNN formation terminates the critical period of neuroplasticity, a process that can be reversed by experimental disruption of PNNs. Perineuronal nets also regulate the intrinsic properties of the enclosed PV neurons thereby maintaining their inhibitory activity. Recent studies have implicated PNNs in central nervous system diseases as well as PV neuron dysfunction; consequently, they have further been associated with altered inhibition, particularly in the genesis of epilepsy. A wide range of seizure presentations in human and rodent models exhibit ECM remodeling with PNN disruption due to elevated protease activity. Inhibition of PNN proteolysis reduces seizure activity suggesting that PNN degrading enzymes may be potential novel therapeutic targets.
