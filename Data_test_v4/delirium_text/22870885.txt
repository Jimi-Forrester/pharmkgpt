22870885|t|Aggregation pathways of the amyloid beta(1-42) peptide depend on its colloidal stability and ordered beta-sheet stacking.
22870885|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) fibrils are present as a major component in senile plaques, the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Diffuse plaques (nonfibrous, loosely packed Abeta aggregates) containing amorphous Abeta aggregates are also formed in brain. This work examines the influence of Cu(2+) complexation by Abeta on the aggregation process in the context of charge and structural variations. Changes in the surface charges of Abeta molecules due to Cu(2+) binding, measured with a zeta-potential measurement device, were correlated with the aggregate morphologies examined by atomic force microscopy. As a result of the charge variation, the "colloid-like" stability of the aggregation intermediates, which is essential to the fibrillation process, is affected. Consequently, Cu(2+) enhances the amorphous aggregate formation. By monitoring variations in the secondary structures with circular dichroism spectroscopy, a direct transformation from the unstructured conformation to the beta-sheet structure was observed for all types of aggregates observed (oligomers, fibrils, and/or amorphous aggregates). Compared to the Abeta aggregation pathway in the absence of Cu(2+) and taking other factors affecting Abeta aggregation (i.e., pH and temperature) into account, our investigation indicates that formations of amorphous and fibrous aggregates diverge from the same beta-sheet-containing partially folded intermediate. This study suggests that the hydrophilic domain of Abeta also plays a role in the Abeta aggregation process. A kinetic model was proposed to account for the effects of the Cu(2+) binding on these two aggregation pathways in terms of charge and structural variations.
