33512783|t|Topical effect of benzalkonium bromide on wound healing and potential cellular and molecular mechanisms.
33512783|a|Benzalkonium bromide (BB) has been widely used as a skin antiseptic for wound management. However, BB had proinflammation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction effect, making its role in wound healing complex and unclear. A rat full-thickness skin defect wound model was established. The effects of BB, povidone iodine (PVP-I), chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), and normal saline (NS) on wound healing and infection control were then evaluated based on wound healing rate (WHr) and bacterial killing. The wound tissues were sectioned for histopathological evaluation and nuclear factor E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression determination. The ROS production, Nrf2 activation, and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) expression of the HaCat cells and the cytotoxicity treated with BB were further explored. Compared with NS, PVP-I, and CHG, BB showed the best wound infection control efficiency while delayed wound healing with the WHr of 91.42 +- 5.12% at day 20. The wound tissue of the BB group showed many inflammatory cells but few granulation tissue and capillaries and no obvious collagen deposition, resulting in the lowest histopathological scores of 4.17 +- 0.75 for BB group. BB showed higher cytotoxicity on HaCat cells with the lowest IC25, IC50, and IC75 of 1.90, 4.16, and 9.09 g/mL compared with PVP-I and CHG. TUNEL staining evaluated the cytotoxicity of BB on wound tissue, which indicates the high apoptosis index BB group (5.05 +- 1.77). Compared with PVP-I and CHG, BB induced much more cell apoptosis. The results of flow cytometry and fluorescence staining showed that PVP-I, CHG, and BB induced ROS production in a concentration-dependent manner and cells treated with BB had the highest ROS production at the same inhibition concentration. The cells and the wound tissues treated with BB showed highest Nrf2 activation and HO-1 expression than PVP-I and CHG. BB was highly efficient in wound infection control while delayed wound healing. The prolonged and strengthened inflammation and the raised ROS production originating from BB administration may contribute to delayed wound healing.
