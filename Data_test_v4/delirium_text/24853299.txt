24853299|a|The production, accumulation and aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are influenced by different modulators. Among these are iron and iron-related proteins, given their ability to modulate the expression of the amyloid precursor protein and to drive Abeta aggregation. Herein, we describe that lipocalin 2 (LCN2), a mammalian acute-phase protein involved in iron homeostasis, is highly produced in response to Abeta1-42 by choroid plexus epithelial cells and astrocytes, but not by microglia or neurons. Although Abeta1-42 stimulation decreases the dehydrogenase activity and survival of wild-type astrocytes, astrocytes lacking the expression of Lcn2 are not affected. This protection results from a lower expression of the proapoptotic gene Bim and a decreased inflammatory response. Altogether, these findings show that Abeta toxicity to astrocytes requires LCN2, which represents a novel mechanism to target when addressing AD.
