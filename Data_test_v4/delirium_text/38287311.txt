38287311|a|BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is an acute cerebral dysfunction caused by sepsis. Neuroinflammation induced by sepsis is considered a potential mechanism of SAE; however, very little is known about the role of the meningeal lymphatic system in SAE. METHODS: Sepsis was established in male C57BL/6J mice by intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide, and the function of meningeal lymphatic drainage was assessed. Adeno-associated virus 1-vascular endothelial growth factor C (AAV1-VEGF-C) was injected into the cisterna magna to induce meningeal lymphangiogenesis. Ligation of deep cervical lymph nodes (dCLNs) was performed to induce pre-existing meningeal lymphatic dysfunction. Cognitive function was evaluated by a fear conditioning test, and inflammatory factors were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The aged mice with SAE showed a significant decrease in the drainage of OVA-647 into the dCLNs and the coverage of the Lyve-1 in the meningeal lymphatic, indicating that sepsis impaired meningeal lymphatic drainage and morphology. The meningeal lymphatic function of aged mice was more vulnerable to sepsis in comparison to young mice. Sepsis also decreased the protein levels of caspase-3 and PSD95, which was accompanied by reductions in the activity of hippocampal neurons. Microglia were significantly activated in the hippocampus of SAE mice, which was accompanied by an increase in neuroinflammation, as indicated by increases in interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6 and Iba1 expression. Cognitive function was impaired in aged mice with SAE. However, the injection of AAV1-VEGF-C significantly increased coverage in the lymphatic system and tracer dye uptake in dCLNs, suggesting that AAV1-VEGF-C promotes meningeal lymphangiogenesis and drainage. Furthermore, AAV1-VEGF-C reduced microglial activation and neuroinflammation and improved cognitive dysfunction. Improvement of meningeal lymphatics also reduced sepsis-induced expression of disease-associated genes in aged mice. Pre-existing lymphatic dysfunction by ligating bilateral dCLNs aggravated sepsis-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: The meningeal lymphatic drainage is damaged in sepsis, and pre-existing defects in this drainage system exacerbate SAE-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction. Promoting meningeal lymphatic drainage improves SAE. Manipulation of meningeal lymphangiogenesis could be a new strategy for the treatment of SAE.
