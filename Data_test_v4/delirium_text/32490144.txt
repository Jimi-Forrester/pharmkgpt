32490144|t|Cerebral microbleeds and acute myocardial infarction: Screening and disease progression.
32490144|a|INTRODUCTION: Cerebral microbleeds (CMB) are associated with intracerebral haemorrhage. Therefore they may represent a concern if anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet therapy is needed. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of CMB in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and to follow their progression at 3 months under dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). METHODS: This prospective study included patients aged over 60 hospitalized in intensive cardiac care unit in our city for AMI. These patients underwent a first brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 72 h of admission, that was repeated 3 months. RESULTS: 108 patients were included between November 2016 and December 2018. The prevalence of CMB was 21.3%, with a female predominance of 65.2% vs 32.1% (p = 0.004). Diabetes is significantly associated with the presence of CMB, 45.5% vs 21.2% (p = 0.021). Patients with at least one acute CMB had higher haemorrhagic risk as evaluated with CRUSADE score (40.5 +- 13.6 vs 31.2 +- 14.8 (p = 0.004).Multivariate analysis showed that only female sex was associated with the presence of a CMB on the initial MRI. On repeated MRI, an increase in CMB was observed in 6% of patients.Our results suggest that discharge treatment with anticoagulant in combination with antiplatelet therapy may be an independent predictor of early progression of CMB. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the high prevalence of CMB in patients over 60 years with AMI. The association of anticoagulant with DAPT, 3 months after stenting, may be an independent factor of CMB progression.
