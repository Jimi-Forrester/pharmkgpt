34829541|a|In platelets, oxidative stress reportedly increases platelet adhesion to vessels, thus promoting the vascular pathology of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, it has been shown that beta-amyloid (Abeta) can increase oxidative stress in platelets; however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the signaling pathway of platelet adhesion induced by Abeta1-40, the major form of circulating Abeta, through Western blotting, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Additionally, we examined whether rosmarinic acid (RA), a natural polyphenol antioxidant, can modulate these processes. Our results show that Abeta1-40-induced platelet adhesion is mediated through NADPH oxidase/ROS/PKC-delta/integrin alphaIIbbeta3 signaling, and these signaling pathways are significantly inhibited by RA. Collectively, these results suggest that RA may have beneficial effects on platelet-associated vascular pathology in AD.
