34990060|t|PACSIN proteins in vivo: Roles in development and physiology.
34990060|a|Protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons (PACSINs), or syndapins (synaptic dynamin-associated proteins), are a family of proteins involved in the regulation of cell cytoskeleton, intracellular trafficking and signalling. Over the last twenty years, PACSINs have been mostly studied in the in vitro and ex vivo settings, and only in the last decade reports on their function in vivo have emerged. We first summarize the identification, structure and cellular functions of PACSINs, and then focus on the relevance of PACSINs in vivo. During development in various model organisms, PACSINs participate in diverse processes, such as neural crest cell development, gastrulation, laterality development and neuromuscular junction formation. In mouse, PACSIN2 regulates angiogenesis during retinal development and in human, PACSIN2 associates with monosomy and embryonic implantation. In adulthood, PACSIN1 has been extensively studied in the brain and shown to regulate neuromorphogenesis, receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity. Several genetic studies suggest a role for PACSIN1 in the development of schizophrenia, which is also supported by the phenotype of mice depleted of PACSIN1. PACSIN2 plays an essential role in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and participates in kidney repair processes after injury. PACSIN3 is abundant in muscle tissue and necessary for caveolar biogenesis to create membrane reservoirs, thus controlling muscle function, and has been linked to certain genetic muscular disorders. The above examples illustrate the importance of PACSINs in diverse physiological or tissue repair processes in various organs, and associations to diseases when their functions are disturbed.
