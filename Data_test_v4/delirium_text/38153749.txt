38153749|a|Purpose: Despite good photopic visual acuity, glaucoma patients report difficulty performing daily activities under dim light such as reading. Here we investigated the impact of mesopic lighting conditions on reading vision of glaucoma patients. Methods: The study design included 39 patients with glaucoma and 40 healthy controls. Reading vision was assessed with MNREAD charts under mesopic (2 cd/m2) and photopic (220 cd/m2) conditions. Four reading indexes: maximum reading speed (MRS), critical print size (CPS), reading acuity (RA), and reading accessibility index (ACC) were obtained from the MNREAD test yielding a plot of reading speed versus print size. Results: Compared to photopic conditions, reading vision of both healthy controls and glaucoma patients significantly decreased under mesopic conditions (P < 0.05). For glaucoma patients (85% with mild or moderate glaucoma), MRS and ACC decreased by six words per minute and 0.1, respectively under mesopic conditions; CPS and RA increased by 0.25 and 0.18 logMAR, respectively. Moreover, under both photopic and mesopic conditions, reading vision of glaucoma patients was significantly worse than that of healthy controls, but the difference was greater under mesopic conditions (P < 0.05) even after controlling for age and visual acuity. Conclusions: Mesopic conditions make reading more challenging for both healthy controls and glaucoma patients. However, reading in dim light appears to be more burdensome for glaucoma patients. Mesopic reading tests mediated by both cone and rod photoreceptor systems likely provide a more sensitive and comprehensive assessment of a patient's reading impairment than testing under photopic conditions.
