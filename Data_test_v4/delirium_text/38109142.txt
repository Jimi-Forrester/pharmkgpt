38109142|a|Introduction: Intensive care unit-acquired weakness is a frequent complication that affects the prognosis of critical illness during hospital stay and after hospital discharge. Objectives: To determine if a multicomponent protocol of early active mobility involving adequate pain control, non-sedation, non-pharmacologic delirium prevention, cognitive stimulation, and family support, reduces intensive care unit-acquired weakness at the moment of discharge. Materials and methods: We carried out a non-randomized clinical trial in two mixed intensive care units in a high-complexity hospital, including patients over 14 years old with invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. We compared the intervention -the multicomponent protocol- during intensive care hospitalization versus the standard care. Results: We analyzed 82 patients in the intervention group and 106 in the control group. Muscle weakness acquired in the intensive care unit at the moment of discharge was less frequent in the intervention group (41.3% versus 78.9%, p<0.00001). The mobility score at intensive unit care discharge was better in the intervention group (median = 3.5 versus 2, p < 0.0138). There were no statistically significant differences in the invasive mechanical ventilation-free days at day 28 (18 versus 15 days, p<0.49), and neither in the mortality (18.2 versus 27.3%, p<0.167). Conclusion: A multi-component protocol of early active mobility significantly reduces intensive care unit-acquired muscle weakness at the moment of discharge.
