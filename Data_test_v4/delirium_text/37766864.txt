37766864|t|Arylsulfatase D is a prognostic biomarker that promotes glioma cells progression through JAK2/STAT3 pathway and M2 macrophage infiltration.
37766864|a|Background: Arylsulfatase D (ARSD) belongs to the sulfatase family and plays a crucial role in maintaining the proper structure of bone and cartilage matrix. Although several researches have revealed the functions of ARSD in tumor progression, the prognostic value of ARSD in glioma and the related mechanisms have not been fully investigated. Methods: We performed a pan-cancer analysis of ARSD, and investigated the relationship between expression of ARSD and overall survival (OS) in multiple glioma datasets. ROC curves and nomograms were created to investigate the predictive capacity of ARSD. Immune and analysis were conducted to investigate the mechanisms underlying the roles of ARSD in glioma. Glioma tissue samples were collected to verify the expression of ARSD in glioma, while the functions of ARSD were explored using cell experiment. M2 macrophage infiltration assay was used to determine the relation between ARSD and tumor immune microenvironment. Results: Survival analysis indicated that individuals with high ARSD expression in glioma had a shorter survival time. Cox analysis showed that ARSD had a good ability for predicting prognosis in glioma. Immune analysis suggested that ARSD could regulate immune cell infiltration and affect the Cancer-Immunity Cycle to create an immunosuppressive environment. Combined with cell experiment and bioinformatic analysis, we found that ARSD can promote glioma progression through regulation of JAK2/STAT3 pathway and M2 macrophage infiltration. Conclusion: Our study found that ARSD can promote glioma development by regulating immune microenvironment and JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, which provided a potential therapy target for glioma treatment.
