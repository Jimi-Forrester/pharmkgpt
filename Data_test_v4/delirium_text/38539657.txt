38539657|t|Correlations of Plasma Biomarkers and Imaging Characteristics of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease.
38539657|a|Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), which is a group of pathological processes affecting cerebral microvessels, leads to functional loss in the elderly population and mostly presents as cognitive impairment and gait decline. CSVD is diagnosed based on brain imaging biomarkers, but blood biomarkers are of great significance for the early diagnosis and progression prediction of CSVD and have become a research focus because of their noninvasiveness and easy accessibility. Notably, many blood biomarkers have been reported to be associated with CSVD in a relatively large population, particularly serum neurofilament light chain (NfL), which has been regarded as a promising biomarker to track the variation trend in WMH and to predict the further status of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and lacunar infarcts. And neuro-glio-vascular unit structure and blood-brain barrier function have been proposed as underlying mechanisms of CSVD. The article starts from the neuroimaging markers of CSVD, including recent small subcortical infarcts (RSSI), white matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunes, cerebral microbleeds (CMB), enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS), cerebral atrophy, and the combined small vessel disease score, and attempts to systematically review and summarize the research progress regarding the blood biomarkers of CSVD that form the changes in the neuro-glio-vascular unit structure and blood-brain barrier function.
