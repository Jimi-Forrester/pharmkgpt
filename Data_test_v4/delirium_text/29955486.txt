29955486|t|Acute psychosis secondary to suspected hyperparathyroidism: A case report and literature review.
29955486|a|INTRODUCTION: Hyperparathyroidism begins as a benign disease that is often left undetected unless the patient presents with severe symptoms. Often, the first sign of hyperparathyroidism is elevation in serum calcium. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 38-year-old man presented with new onset acute psychosis. Laboratory testing revealed co-occurring untreated hyperparathyroidism. DISCUSSION: A literature search was performed using PubMed to identify articles published in English with the following key terms: "hyperparathyroidism," "psychosis," and "hypercalcemia." A review of findings follows the case report. Despite a thorough literature review, any pathophysiological explanation for psychiatric manifestations of hyperparathyroidism remains hypothetical.
