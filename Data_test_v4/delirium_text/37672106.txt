37672106|a|Deficits in social cognition may be present in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we conduct a qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis of facial expression recognition studies in which we compare the deficits between both disorders. Furthermore, we investigate the specificity of the deficit regarding phenotypic variant, domain-specificity, emotion category, task modality, and geographical region. The results reveal that both FTD and AD are associated with facial expression recognition deficits, that this deficit is more pronounced in FTD compared to AD and that this applies for the behavioral as well as for language FTD-variants, with no difference between the latter two. In both disorders, overall emotion recognition was most frequently impaired, followed by recognition of anger in FTD and by fear in AD. Verbal categorization was the most frequently used task, although matching or intensity rating tasks may be more specific. Studies from Oceania revealed larger deficits. On the other hand, non-emotional control tasks were more impacted by AD than by FTD. The present findings sharpen the social cognitive phenotype of FTD and AD, and support the use of social cognition assessment in late-life neuropsychiatric disorders.
