32985485|a|Previous studies have shown that Lycium barbarum polysaccharide, the main active component of Lycium barbarum, exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in treating neurological diseases. However, the therapeutic action of Lycium barbarum polysaccharide on depression has not been studied. In this investigation, we established mouse models of depression using aversive stimuli including exposure to fox urine, air puff and foot shock and physical restraint. Concurrently, we administered 5 mg/kg per day Lycium barbarum polysaccharide-glycoprotein to each mouse intragastrically for the 28 days. Our results showed that long-term exposure to aversive stimuli significantly enhanced depressive-like behavior evaluated by the sucrose preference test and the forced swimming test and increased anxiety-like behaviors evaluated using the open field test. In addition, aversive stimuli-induced depressed mice exhibited aberrant neuronal activity in the lateral habenula. Importantly, concurrent Lycium barbarum polysaccharide-glycoprotein treatment significantly reduced these changes. These findings suggest that Lycium barbarum polysaccharide-glycoprotein is a potential preventative intervention for depression and may act by preventing aberrant neuronal activity and microglial activation in the lateral habenula. The study was approved by the Jinan University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (approval No. 20170301003) on March 1, 2017.
