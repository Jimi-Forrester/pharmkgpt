39379683|a|Recent studies suggest that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) contribute to the predisposition to, protection from, and potential treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we used electronic health records (EHR) from two different health systems to examine whether heparin therapy was associated with a delayed diagnosis of AD dementia. Longitudinal EHR data from 15,183 patients from the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) and 6207 patients from Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) were used in separate survival analyses to compare those who did or did not receive heparin therapy, had a least 5 years of observation, were at least 65 years old by their last visit, and had subsequent diagnostic code or drug treatment evidence of possible AD dementia. Analyses controlled for age, sex, comorbidities, follow-up duration and number of inpatient visits. Heparin therapy was associated with significant delays in age of clinical diagnosis of AD dementia, including +1.0 years in the MSMS cohort (P < 0.001) and +1.0 years in the CUMC cohort (P < 0.001). While additional studies are needed, this study supports the potential roles of heparin-like drugs and HSPGs in the protection from and prevention of AD dementia.
