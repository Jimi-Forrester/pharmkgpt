37623035|t|Novel Cellular and Immunotherapy: Toxicities and Perioperative Implications.
37623035|a|Targeted cellular and immunotherapies have welcomed a new chapter in multi-modal cancer therapy. These agents harness our innate immune system and destroy malignant cells in a precise way as compared with "legacy" chemotherapeutic agents that largely rely on abolishing cell division. New therapies can augment the T-cell recognition of tumor antigens and effectively prevent tumor cells from their historically successful ability to evade immune recognition. These novel agents cause acute and chronic toxicities to a variety of organ systems (enteritis, pneumonitis, hypophysitis, and hepatitis), and this may masquerade as other chronic illnesses or paraneoplastic effects. As the perioperative footprint of cancer patients increases, it is essential that perioperative providers-anesthesiologists, surgeons, nurse anesthetists, and inpatient hospital medicine providers-be up to date on the physiologic mechanisms that underlie these new therapies as well as their acute and subacute toxicity profiles. Immunotherapy toxicity can significantly impact perioperative morbidity as well as influence perioperative management, such as prophylaxis for adrenal insufficiency, preoperative pulmonary assessment, and screening for thyroid dysfunction, among others.
