37926072|t|The Clearance of Midazolam and Metabolites during Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19.
37926072|a|INTRODUCTION: Midazolam-based continuous intravenous sedation in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) was a necessity during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, benzodiazepine-based sedation is associated with a high incidence of benzodiazepine-related delirium and additional days on mechanical ventilation. Due to the requirement of high midazolam doses in combination with the impaired renal clearance (CL) of the pharmacological active metabolite 1-OH-midazolam-glucuronide (10% compared to midazolam), ICU patients with COVID-19 and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) were at risk of unintended prolonged sedation. Several CRRT-related factors may have influenced the delivered CL of midazolam and its metabolites. Therefore, the aim of the study was to identify and describe these CRRT-related factors. METHODS: Pre-filter blood samples and ultrafiltrate samples were collected simultaneously. Midazolam, 1-OH-midazolam, and 1-OH-midazolam-glucuronide plasma samples were analyzed using an UPLC-MS/MS method. The prescribed CRRT dose was corrected for downtime and filter integrity using the urea ratio (urea concentration in effluent/urea concentration plasma). CL of midazolam and its metabolites were calculated with the delivered CRRT dose (corrected for downtime and saturation coefficient [SD]). RESULTS: Three patients on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) and 2 patients on continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) were included. Midazolam, 1-OH-midazolam, and 1-OH-midazolam-glucuronide concentrations were 2,849 (0-6,700) mug/L, 153 (0-295) mug/L, and 27,297 (1,727-39,000) mug/L, respectively. The SD was 0.03 (0.02-0.03) for midazolam, 0.05 (0.05-0.06) for 1-OH-midazolam, and 0.33 (0.23-0.43) for 1-OH-midazolam-glucuronide. The delivered CRRT CL was 1.4 (0-1.7) mL/min for midazolam, 2.7 (0-3.5) mL/min for 1-OH-midazolam, and 15.7 (4.0-27.7) mL/min for 1-OH-midazolam-glucuronide. CONCLUSIONS: Midazolam and 1-OH-midazolam were not removed during CVVHD and CVVHDF. However, 1-OH-midazolam-glucuronide was removed reasonably, approximately up to 43%. CRRT modality, filter integrity, and downtime affect this removal. These data imply a personalized titration of midazolam in critically ill patients with renal failure and awareness for the additional sedative effects of its active metabolites.
