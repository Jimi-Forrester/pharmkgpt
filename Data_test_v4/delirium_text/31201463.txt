31201463|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the sixth-leading cause of death in industrialized countries. Neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques are one of the pathological hallmarks in AD patient brains. Abeta accumulates in the brain upon sequential, proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases. However, so far disease-modifying drugs targeting beta- and gamma-secretase pathways seeking a decrease in the production of toxic Abeta peptides have failed in clinics. It has been demonstrated that the metalloproteinase meprin beta acts as an alternative beta-secretase, capable of generating truncated Abeta2-x peptides that have been described to be increased in AD patients. This indicates an important beta-site cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1)-independent contribution of the metalloprotease meprin beta within the amyloidogenic pathway and may lead to novel drug targeting avenues. However, meprin beta itself is embedded in a complex regulatory network. Remarkably, the anti-amyloidogenic alpha-secretase a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10) is a direct competitor for APP at the cell surface, but also a sheddase of inactive pro-meprin beta. Overall, we highlight the current cellular, molecular and structural understanding of meprin beta as alternative beta-secretase within the complex protease web, regulating APP processing in health and disease.
