36505520|a|Background: With increasing numbers of people crossing the age threshold of 65 years, there is a strong likelihood that the cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases will increase manifold in the upcoming decades. It is essential for the healthcare professionals to have a reasonable background knowledge about this neurodegenerative condition. This study was done to assess the level of knowledge of AD among the healthcare staff appointed at a tertiary care hospital. Methodology: A cross-sectional survey study was done in a tertiary care hospital with healthcare workers. The knowledge level of AD was investigated using Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS) while a self-assessment scale was used by the participants to rate their own knowledge about the disease. The extent of background knowledge was then statistically evaluated on the basis of multiple subject-oriented factors. The impact of any prior dementia-specific training was also assessed. Data were analyzed by using SPSS-23 where P value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Out of a total of 124 participants recruited during the study period, the average score on the ADKS scale was 19.2 +- 3.1. Self-rated Alzheimer's scale depicted a mean value of 4.89 +- 1.7. The participants having a positive family history and personal/professional caring experience for AD did not obtain any remarkably better score. The doctors were more likely to score better than nurses and other healthcare staff (p < 0.001). Moreover, dementia-related training had a significantly better outcome in terms of promoting the knowledge base of AD (p < 0.001). Conclusion: There is a below-par knowledge of Alzheimer's dementia among the healthcare staff of the hospital. The staff of the hospital realizes this shortcoming, and there is a need for dementia-specific training to overcome this knowledge gap.
