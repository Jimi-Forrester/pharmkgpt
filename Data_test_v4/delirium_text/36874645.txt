36874645|t|Non-interventional Feasibility Assessment for Fast-Track Cardiac Anesthesia.
36874645|a|Background The introduction of fast-track extubation procedures following cardiac surgery has significantly shortened hospitalization duration in intensive care units (ICUs). Early extubation is the most crucial step in getting out of the ICU early and providing ideal patient circulation. In times of crisis such as pandemics, it is vital to provide rapid flow through the hospital to prevent the postponement or inability to operate on patients awaiting surgery. This study aimed to determine the obstacles to early extubation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and the perioperative characteristics that were affected in terms of fast-track extubation. Methodology This was an observational, cross-sectional study with data collected prospectively from October 1 to November 30, 2021. Preoperative data and comorbidities were recorded. Intraoperative and postoperative data were recorded and analyzed. Intraoperative cross-clamp duration, cardiopulmonary bypass duration, length of operation, and erythrocytes (red blood cells) transfused were recorded for each patient. Early postoperative clinical conditions were defined in patients whose mechanical ventilation duration exceeded eight hours (such as pulmonary complications, cardiovascular complications, renal complications, neurological conditions, and infective complications ). The length of ICU stay (hours), length of hospital stay (days), return to the ICU, reasons for return to the ICU, and overall hospital mortality were investigated. A total of 226 patients were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups: extubated within eight hours (FTCA, fast-track cardiac anesthesia) and late extubation (after eight hours) postoperatively, and the data were evaluated accordingly. Results While 138 (61.1%) of the patients were extubated in eight hours or less, 88 (38.9%) patients were extubated after more than eight hours. The most common complications (55.7%) in patients with late extubation were cardiovascular complications, followed by respiratory complications (15.9%), and the surgeon's refusal (15.9%). In the logistic model created with the independent variables affecting the extubation time, the American Society of Anesthesiologists score and red blood cell transfusion were risk factors for longer extubation time. Conclusions In our research to reveal the feasibility of and barriers to FTCA, it was found that cardiac and respiratory problems were the most common reasons for delayed extubation. Due to the refusal of the surgical team, it was observed that some patients remained intubated despite meeting the FTCA requirements. It was considered the most improvable obstacle. Regarding cardiovascular complications, the team should aim to optimally control patient comorbidities in the preoperative period, reduce the use of red blood cell transfusions, and ensure that the entire team is updated on current extubation protocols, in particular surgeons and anesthesiologists.
