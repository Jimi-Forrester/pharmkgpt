10705232|t|Relationships between cholesterol, apolipoprotein E polymorphism and dementia: a cross-sectional analysis from the PAQUID study.
10705232|a|This study assesses the cross-sectional relationship between serum cholesterol level and dementia, controlling for apolipoprotein E (apoE) genotype, in a nested case-control study of 334 elderly French subjects aged 73 and over who participated in the PAQUID study (37 demented subjects and 297 nondemented controls). A diagnosis of dementia was established by two-step screening: (1) psychometric testing and DSM-III-R criteria and (2) neurologist's confirmation. Cholesterol, its fractions and apoE genotype were determined from a blood sample. Elevated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was associated with a significantly decreased risk of dementia, independent of apoE status and other potential confounding variables, suggesting that cholesterol fractions could be involved in both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.
