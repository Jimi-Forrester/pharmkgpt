31868266|t|SERS-based biosensor for Alzheimer disease evaluation through the fast analysis of human serum.
31868266|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly, progressively affecting the cognitive functions with a complex diagnostic procedure that limits the time for a prompt intervention. In this study we optimized a reliable protocol for the analysis of AD patients and healthy subjects' serum using the Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS), taking into consideration the effect of different variables on the final spectra, analyzed and compared through multivariate analysis and correlated with hippocampus volume. As results, we demonstrated a statistical difference between the spectra collected from the two investigated groups, with an accuracy, precision and specificity of respectively 83%, 86%, and 86%. The correlation of these data with those obtained from MRI, demonstrated a direct correlation between Raman spectra and hippocampus degeneration showing the Raman Spectroscopy (RS) as a potential tool for the monitoring of AD progression and rehabilitation treatments.
