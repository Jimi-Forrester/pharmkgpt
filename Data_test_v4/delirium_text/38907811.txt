38907811|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the literature on visual dysfunction in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), including its mechanisms and clinical implications. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have explored novel aspects of visual dysfunction in DLB, including visual texture agnosia, mental rotation of 3-dimensional drawn objects, and reading fragmented letters. Recent studies have shown parietal and occipital hypoperfusion correlating with impaired visuoconstruction performance. While visual dysfunction in clinically manifest DLB is well recognized, recent work has focused on prodromal or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Lewy body pathology with mixed results. Advances in retinal imaging have recently led to the identification of abnormalities such as parafoveal thinning in DLB. Patients with DLB experience impairment in color perception, form and object identification, space and motion perception, visuoconstruction tasks, and illusions in association with visual cortex and network dysfunction. These symptoms are associated with visual hallucinations, driving impairment, falls, and other negative outcomes.
