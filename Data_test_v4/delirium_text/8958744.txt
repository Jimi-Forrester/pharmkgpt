8958744|t|[The elevation of serum creatine kinase in the course of Parkinson disease.--in relation to malignant syndrome].
8958744|a|In the long course of Parkinson disease, we encounter the elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK) occasionally. Such elevation was not necessarily accompanied by severe symptoms as malignant syndrome. To delineate the basis of its situation, we selected the patients showing CK-elevation from 697 cases of Parkinson disease who had entered our hospital and their serum CK level had been measured. The cases with common cause of CK-elevation like trauma or myocardial infarction were excluded in advance. Those patients with CK-elevation were investigated with reference to age, gender, severity, duration of illness, dementia, and psychiatric symptoms retrospectively. High CK level was observed in 95 cases who were composed predominantly of advanced male patients. No obvious anticipatory cause of CK-elevation like a modification of anti-parkinson drug was recognized in 65 cases. On the other hand, CK-elevation caused by the modification of anti-parkinson drug was recognized in 10 cases. CK-elevation was observed in patients with dementia, delirium, and hallucination at higher rate. Most of these patients with CK-elevation did not show high fever and did not necessarily meet the criteria of malignant syndrome. However, 9 cases who showed marked increase of CK level over 10 times of upper limit of normal value contained some cases who had features of malignant syndrome. In Parkinson disease, especially in advanced cases dopamine may be unstable controlled in a few locations of their brain. Some situation of the disease may elicit imbalance of dopamine in patients' brain and induce CK elevation as in the similar condition in which neuroleptics are administrated.
