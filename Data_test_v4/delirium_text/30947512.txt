30947512|a|BACKGROUND: Most people in the United States and other countries cite their preferred location of death as their homes. However, intractable symptoms sometimes require hospitalization, especially if significant sedation becomes necessary. For over a decade, Hospice of Central New York has been using compounded phenobarbital suppositories with individuals in whom adequate sedation has not been achieved using sufficient doses of antipsychotics or benzodiazepines but prefer to remain in their homes. OBJECTIVES: (1) Describe the use of phenobarbital suppositories in homes for the purpose of sedation. (2) Understand patient characteristics of potential users and those in whom suppositories were actually used. (3) Measure time to death after initiating the phenobarbital suppositories. SETTING: Medicare-certified not-for-profit hospice organization in New York State. METHOD: Retrospective case series. RESULTS: Of 1675 patients enrolled in hospice over an 18-month period, phenobarbital suppositories were placed in the homes of 90 patients for potential use. Suppositories were initiated in 31 of the 90 patients. Agitated delirium was the major symptom for which suppositories were placed and initiated. Both groups had a greater prevalence of cancer diagnoses than the target population. The mean time to death after initiation of phenobarbital suppositories was 38.8 hours. None of the users were hospitalized. CONCLUSION: The use of compounded phenobarbital suppositories for the purpose of palliative sedation is an alternative for patients and families who desire to remain home despite refractory symptoms.
