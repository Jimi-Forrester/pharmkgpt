38821772|a|Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitute multifaceted behavioral manifestations that reflect processes of emotional regulation, thinking, and social behavior. They are as prevalent in AD as cognitive impairment and develop independently during the progression of neurodegeneration. As studying NPSs in AD is clinically challenging, most AD research to date has focused on cognitive decline. In this opinion article we summarize emerging literature on the prevalence, time course, and the underlying genetic, molecular, and pathological mechanisms related to NPSs in AD. Overall, we propose that NPSs constitute a cluster of core symptoms in AD, and understanding their neurobiology can lead to a more holistic approach to AD research, paving the way for more accurate diagnostic tests and personalized treatments embracing the goals of precision medicine.
