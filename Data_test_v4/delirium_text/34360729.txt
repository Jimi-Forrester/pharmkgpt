34360729|t|Mitochondrion as a Target of Astaxanthin Therapy in Heart Failure.
34360729|a|Mitochondria are considered to be important organelles in the cell and play a key role in the physiological function of the heart, as well as in the pathogenesis and development of various heart diseases. Under certain pathological conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, stroke, traumatic brain injury, neurodegenerative diseases, muscular dystrophy, etc., mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is formed and opened, which can lead to dysfunction of mitochondria and subsequently to cell death. This review summarizes the results of studies carried out by our group of the effect of astaxanthin (AST) on the functional state of rat heart mitochondria upon direct addition of AST to isolated mitochondria and upon chronic administration of AST under conditions of mPTP opening. It was shown that AST exerted a protective effect under all conditions. In addition, AST treatment was found to prevent isoproterenol-induced oxidative damage to mitochondria and increase mitochondrial efficiency. AST, a ketocarotenoid, may be a potential mitochondrial target in therapy for pathological conditions associated with oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction, and may be a potential mitochondrial target in therapy for pathological conditions.
