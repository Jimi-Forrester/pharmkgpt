12805356|a|Chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is associated with a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Recent evidence indicates that some NSAIDs specifically inhibit secretion of the amyloidogenic A beta 42 peptide in cultured cells and mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. The reduction of A beta 42 peptides is not mediated by inhibition of cyclooxygenases (COX) but the molecular mechanism underlying this novel activity of NSAIDs has not been further defined. We now demonstrate that NSAIDs efficiently reduce the intracellular pool of A beta 42 in cell-based studies and selectively decrease A beta 42 production in a cell-free assay of gamma-secretase activity. Moreover, we find that presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations, which affect gamma-secretase activity, differentially modulate the cellular A beta 42 response to NSAID treatment. Overexpression of the PS1-M146L mutation enhances the cellular drug response to A beta 42 lowering NSAIDs as compared with cells expressing wild-type PS1. In contrast, expression of the PS1-Delta Exon9 mutation strongly diminishes the A beta 42 response, showing that PS1 mutations can modulate the cellular drug response to NSAID treatment both positively and negatively. Enhancement of the NSAID drug response was also observed with overexpression of the APP V717F mutation but not with Swedish mutant APP, which affects beta-secretase cleavage. In sum, these results strongly suggest that NSAIDs represent a founding group of compounds that lower A beta 42 production by direct modulation of gamma-secretase activity or its substrate.
