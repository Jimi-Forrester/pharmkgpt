38634242|a|AIMS: Hirano bodies (HBs) are eosinophilic pathological structures with two morphological phenotypes commonly found in the hippocampal CA1 region in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study evaluated the prevalence and distribution of HBs in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: This cross-sectional study systematically evaluated HBs in a cohort of 193 cases with major neurodegenerative diseases, including AD (n = 91), Lewy body disease (LBD, n = 87), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP, n = 36), multiple system atrophy (MSA, n = 14) and controls (n = 26). The prevalence, number and morphology of HBs in the stratum lacunosum (HBL) and CA1 pyramidal cell layer were examined. In addition, we investigated the presence of HBs in five additional hippocampal subregions. RESULTS: The morphological types of HBs in CA1 were divided into three, including a newly discovered type, and were evaluated separately, with their morphology confirmed in three dimensions: (1) classic rod-shaped HB (CHB), (2) balloon-shaped HB (BHB) and the newly described (3) string-shaped HB (SHB). The prevalence of each HB type differed between disease groups: Compared with controls, for CHB in AD, AD + LBD, PSP and corticobasal degeneration, for BHB in AD + LBD and PSP, and SHB in AD + LBD and PSP were significantly increased. Regression analysis showed that CHBs were independently associated with higher Braak NFT stage, BHBs with LBD and TDP-43 pathology, SHBs with higher Braak NFT stage, PSP and argyrophilic grain disease and HBLs with MSA. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that HBs are associated with diverse neurodegenerative diseases and shows that morphological types appear distinctively in various conditions.
