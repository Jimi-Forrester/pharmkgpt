33265620|t|Automatic Analysis of Archimedes' Spiral for Characterization of Genetic Essential Tremor Based on Shannon's Entropy and Fractal Dimension.
33265620|a|Among neural disorders related to movement, essential tremor has the highest prevalence; in fact, it is twenty times more common than Parkinson's disease. The drawing of the Archimedes' spiral is the gold standard test to distinguish between both pathologies. The aim of this paper is to select non-linear biomarkers based on the analysis of digital drawings. It belongs to a larger cross study for early diagnosis of essential tremor that also includes genetic information. The proposed automatic analysis system consists in a hybrid solution: Machine Learning paradigms and automatic selection of features based on statistical tests using medical criteria. Moreover, the selected biomarkers comprise not only commonly used linear features (static and dynamic), but also other non-linear ones: Shannon entropy and Fractal Dimension. The results are hopeful, and the developed tool can easily be adapted to users; and taking into account social and economic points of view, it could be very helpful in real complex environments.
