39862968|a|BACKGROUND: Research links gut microbiota to postoperative delirium (POD) through the gut-brain axis. However, changes in gut microbiota and fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in POD patients during the perioperative period and their association with POD are unclear. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study among patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, focusing on POD as the main outcome. POD patients were matched 1:1 with non-POD patients based on sociodemographic characteristics, health, and diet. Fecal samples were collected pre- and post-surgery to assess gut microbiota and SCFA changes. Postoperative fecal samples were transplanted into antibiotic-treated mice to evaluate delirium-like behavior and neuroinflammation. RESULTS: Out of 120 patients, 60 were matched. Before surgery, gut microbiota in both groups was similar. After surgery, POD patients had lower alpha diversity and distinct microbiota compared to non-POD patients. LEfSe analysis showed POD was linked to increased opportunistic pathogens (Enterococcus) and decreased SCFA producers (Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, etc.). SCFAs were significantly reduced in POD patients and negatively correlated with delirium severity and plasma inflammation. Mice receiving fecal transplants from POD patients exhibited delirium-like behavior and neuroinflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative delirium is associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis, marked by an increase in opportunistic pathogens and a decrease in SCFA-producing genera.
