35274485|t|Effects of cognitive reserve proxies on cognitive function and frontoparietal control network in subjects with white matter hyperintensities: A cross-sectional functional magnetic resonance imaging study.
35274485|a|AIMS: This study aimed to analyze the potential association between cognition reserve (CR) components, including education, working activity, and leisure time activity, and cognitive function in subjects with white matter hyperintensities (WMH). The study also explored the role of the frontoparietal control network (FPCN) in such association. METHODS: White matter hyperintensities subjects with and without cognitive impairment (CI) were evaluated with multimodal magnetic resonance imaging, neuropsychological testing, and CR survey. FPCN patterns were assessed with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex seed-based functional connectivity analysis. RESULTS: Education was positively associated with cognitive function in WMH subjects with or without CI, whereas working activity and leisure time activity were positively associated with cognitive function only in those without CI. Similarly, education was associated with bilateral FPCN in both WMH groups, whereas working activity and leisure time activity were associated with bilateral FPCN mainly in the group without CI. Furthermore, FPCN partially mediated the association between education and cognitive function in both WMH groups. CONCLUSION: Education showed a positive impact on cognitive function in WMH subjects regardless of their cognitive status, whereas working activity and leisure time activity exhibited beneficial effects only in those without CI. The FPCN mediated the beneficial effect of education on cognitive function.
