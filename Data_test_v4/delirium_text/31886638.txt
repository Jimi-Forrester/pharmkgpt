31886638|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to review the findings from an audit of the implementation of a consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLiP) database in all inpatients referred to a CLiP service at the largest hospital in Malaysia with the aim of improving the quality CLiP services. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: All inpatient referrals to the CLiP team were recorded over a three-month period and compared to previous audit data from 2017. Four audit standards were assessed: the reporting of referrals, timeliness of response indication of reason for referral and presence of a management plan. FINDINGS: The compliance of reporting using the CLiP form was 70.1 per cent compared to 28 per cent in the audit data from 2017 after interventions were conducted. Analysis of the completed CLiP form reveals that 89 per cent of referrals were seen within the same working day. All referrals included the reason for referral. The most common reason for referral was for depressive disorders, but post-assessment, delirium was the most common diagnosis. In total, 87.8 per cent satisfied the audit criteria for a completed written care plan. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Specialised CLiP services are relatively new in Malaysia and this is the first paper to examine the quality of such services in the country. Interventions were effective in improving the compliance of reporting using the CLiP database. The findings suggest that the CLiP services are on par with international audit standards. Furthermore, data from this clinical audit can serve as a benchmark for the development of national operating policies in similar settings.
