12426044|a|Transgenic mice overexpressing the betaAPP gene with the Swedish mutation under the control of the murine thy-1 promoter show Alzheimer-like characteristics including the accumulation of Abeta protein in the cerebral cortex. Female 16-month-old APP23 transgenic mice were compared to age-matched non-transgenic mice in behavioral tests measuring spatial learning, exploration of environmental stimuli, anxiety, and motor coordination. APP23 transgenic mice had fewer fast ambulatory movements, either fast or slow stereotypy movements, and slow rears in a photocell activity chamber. The acquisition of spatial learning in the Morris water maze was impaired in APP23 transgenic mice, but not during the probe test or while swimming towards a visible platform. Neither were there intergroup differences in tests of anxiety or motor coordination. These results indicate that a learning deficit and hypoactivity, concordant with the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, characterize this mouse model with Abeta accumulation.
