8791514|t|Genetic analysis of mechanisms of aging.
8791514|a|A wide range of genetic models with postponed aging are now available, from selected mice and Drosophilia to mutant Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These systems allow efficient testing of alternative mechanistic hypotheses for aging. Genetic analysis is forging stronger connections between particular alleles and susceptibility to particular 'diseases of aging'; for example, two different genes for Alzheimer disease have been identified.
