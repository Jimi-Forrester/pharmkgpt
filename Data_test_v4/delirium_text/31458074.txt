31458074|t|Fluorescent Chemosensors for Various Analytes Including Reactive Oxygen Species, Biothiol, Metal Ions, and Toxic Gases.
31458074|a|The development of fluorescent chemosensors for various analytes has been actively pursued by chemists. Since their inception, these efforts have led to many new sensors that have found wide applications in the fields of chemistry, biology, environmental science, and physiology. The search for fluorescent chemosensors was initiated by a few pioneering groups in the late 1970s and 1980s and blossomed during the last two decades to include more than hundreds of research groups around the world. The targets for these sensors vary from metal ions, anions, reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, biothiols, and toxic gases. Our group has made contributions to this area in last 18 years. In this perspective, we briefly introduce the history of chemosensors and review studies that we have carried out.
