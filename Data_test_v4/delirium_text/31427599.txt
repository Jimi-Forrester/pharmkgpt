31427599|t|Visualizing Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Brain with Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography using a Fluorescent probe, CDnir7.
31427599|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is now clinically considered as a chronic inflammation-based neurodegenerative disease. The CDnir7 probe was previously developed as an optical imaging probe to target macrophages in order to image mouse inflammation using in vivo optical imaging modalities such as In Vivo imaging system (IVIS) and fluorescent molecular tomography (FMT). Here, we demonstrate the application of CDnir7 in AD mouse brain imaging via multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT). Longitudinal MSOT imaging of CDnir7 showed higher CDnir7 localization in AD mouse cerebral cortex compared to that of normal mice. MSOT signals of CDnir7 localization in mouse brain were verified by ex vivo near-infrared (NIR) imaging and immunohistochemistry. Histological evaluation showed strong CDnir7 staining in AD cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia and thalamus area. Based on the supporting evidence, CDnir7 has great potential as a molecular imaging probe for AD brain imaging.
