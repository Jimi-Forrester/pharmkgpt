37752791|a|BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Therapeutic options for advanced HCC are limited, which is due to a lack of full understanding of pathogenesis. Cellular senescence is a state of cell cycle arrest, which plays important roles in the pathogenesis of HCC. Mechanisms underlying hepatocellular senescence are not fully understood. LncRNA NEAT1 acts as an oncogene and contributes to the development of HCC. Whether NEAT1 modulates hepatocellular senescence in HCC is unknown. METHODS: The role of NEAT1 and KIF11 in cellular senescence and tumor growth in HCC was assessed both in vitro and in vivo. RNA pulldown, mass spectrometry, Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), luciferase reporter assays, RNA FISH and immunofluorescence (IF) staining were used to explore the detailed molecular mechanism of NEAT1 and KIF11 in cellular senescence of HCC. RESULTS: We found that NEAT1 was upregulated in tumor tissues and hepatoma cells, which negatively correlated with a senescence biomarker CDKN2A encoding p16INK4a and p14ARF proteins. NEAT1 was reduced in senescent hepatoma cells induced by doxorubicin (DOXO) or serum starvation. Furthermore, NEAT1 deficiency caused senescence in cultured hepatoma cells, and protected against the progression of HCC in a mouse model. During senescence, NEAT1 translocated into cytosol and interacted with a motor protein KIF11, resulting in KIF11 protein degradation and subsequent increased expression of CDKN2A in cultured hepatoma cells. Furthermore, KIF11 knockdown caused senescence in cultured hepatoma cells. Genetic deletion of Kif11 in hepatocytes inhibited the development of HCC in a mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusively, NEAT1 overexpression reduces senescence and promotes tumor progression in HCC tissues and hepatoma cells, whereas NEAT1 deficiency causes senescence and inhibits tumor progression in HCC. This is associated with KIF11-dependent repression of CDKN2A. These findings lay the foundation to develop potential therapies for HCC by inhibiting NEAT1 and KIF11 or inducing senescence.
