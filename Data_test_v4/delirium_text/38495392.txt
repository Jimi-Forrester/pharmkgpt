38495392|t|Cognitive Exercise for Persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia Using a Social Robot.
38495392|a|Reminiscence therapy (RT) can improve the mood and communication of persons living with Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease related dementias (PLWD). Traditional RT requires professionals' facilitation, limiting its accessibility to PLWD. Social robotics has the potential to facilitate RT, enabling accessible, home-based RT. However, studies are needed to investigate how PLWD would perceive a robot-mediated RT (RMRT) and how to develop RMRT for positive user experience and successful adoption. In this paper, we developed a prototype of RMRT using a humanoid social robot and tested it with 12 participants (7 PLWD, 2 with mild cognitive impairment, and 3 informal caregivers). The robot automatically displayed a memory trigger on its tablet and engaged participants in a relatable conversation during RMRT. A mixed-method approach was employed to assess its acceptability and usability. Our results showed that PLWD had an overall positive user experience with the RMRT. Participants laughed and sang along with the robot during RMRT and demonstrated intention to use it. We additionally discussed robot control method and several critical problems for RMRT. The RMRT can facilitate both verbal and nonverbal social interaction for PLWD and holds promise for engaging, personalized, and efficient home-based cognitive exercises for PLWD.
