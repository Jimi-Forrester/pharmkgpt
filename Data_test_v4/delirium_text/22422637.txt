22422637|t|Inhibition of Cu-amyloid-beta by using bifunctional peptides with beta-sheet breaker and chelator moieties.
22422637|a|Breaking the mold: Inhibition of toxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates and disruption of Cu-Abeta with subsequent redox-silencing of Cu have been considered promising strategies against Alzheimer's disease. The design and proof of concept of simple peptides containing a Cu-chelating/redox-silencing unit and an Abeta-aggregation inhibition unit (beta-sheet breaker) is described (see scheme).
