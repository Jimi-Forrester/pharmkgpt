37718166|a|Brain age prediction is a practical method used to quantify brain aging and detect neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, very few studies have considered brain age prediction as a biomarker for the conversion of cognitively normal (CN) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this study, we developed a novel brain age prediction model using brain volume and cortical thickness features. We calculated an acceleration of brain age (ABA) derived from the suggested model to estimate different diagnostic groups (CN, MCI, and AD) and to classify CN to MCI and MCI to AD conversion groups. We observed a strong association between ABA and the 3 diagnostic groups. Additionally, the classification models for CN to MCI conversion and MCI to AD conversion exhibited acceptable and robust performances, with area under the curve values of 0.66 and 0.76, respectively. We believe that our proposed model provides a reliable estimate of brain age for elderly individuals and can identify those at risk of progressing from CN to MCI. This model has great potential to reveal a diagnosis associated with a change in cognitive decline.
