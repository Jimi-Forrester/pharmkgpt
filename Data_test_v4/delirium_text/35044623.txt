35044623|t|The Role of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms of Monoamine Oxidase B, Dopamine D2 Receptor, and DOPA Decarboxylase Receptors Among Patients Treated for Parkinson's Disease.
35044623|a|This study aimed to investigate the association between selected variants of genes related to dopamine metabolism pathways and the risk of and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). This prospective cohort study was conducted in one academic teaching hospital. The study was conducted on 126 patients diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Blood samples were collected to conduct a genotyping of MAOB, DRD1, DRD2, and DDC genes. Genotype and allele frequencies of MAOB (rs1799836) variants were not associated with the course of PD. Genotype and allele frequencies of DRD2 (rs2283265) variants were associated with risk of dementia (p = 0.001) and resulted in parts II and III of the UPDRS scale (p = 0.001). Genotype and allele frequencies of DRD2 (rs1076560) variants were associated with risk of dementia (p = 0.001) and resulted in parts II and III of the UPDRS scale (p = 0.001). Genotype and allele frequencies of DDC (rs921451) variants were not associated with the course of PD.
