38654932|a|Background: Plasma biomarkers are preferable to invasive and expensive diagnostic tools, such as neuroimaging and lumbar puncture that are gold standard in the clinical management of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Here, we investigated plasma Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP), Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL) and Phosphorylated-tau-181 (pTau 181) in AD and in its early stages: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and Mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Material and methods: This study included 152 patients (42 SCD, 74 MCI and 36 AD). All patients underwent comprehensive clinical and neurological assessment. Blood samples were collected for Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping and plasma biomarker (GFAP, NfL, and pTau 181) measurements. Forty-three patients (7 SCD, 27 MCI, and 9 AD) underwent a follow-up (FU) visit after 2 years, and a second plasma sample was collected. Plasma biomarker levels were detected using the Simoa SR-X technology (Quanterix Corp.). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 28 (IBM SPSS Statistics). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: GFAP, NfL and pTau 181 levels in plasma were lower in SCD and MCI than in AD patients. In particular, plasma GFAP levels were statistically significant different between SCD and AD (p=0.003), and between MCI and AD (p=0.032). Plasma NfL was different in SCD vs MCI (p=0.026), SCD vs AD (p<0.001), SCD vs AD FU (p<0.001), SCD FU vs AD (p=0.033), SCD FU vs AD FU (p=0.011), MCI vs AD (p=0.002), MCI FU vs AD (p=0.003), MCI FU vs AD FU (p=0.003) and MCI vs AD FU (p=0.003). Plasma pTau 181 concentration was significantly different between SCD and AD (p=0.001), MCI and AD (p=0.026), MCI FU and AD (p=0.020). In APOE epsilon4 carriers, a statistically significant increase in plasma NfL (p<0.001) and pTau 181 levels was found (p=0.014). Moreover, an association emerged between age at disease onset and plasma GFAP (p = 0.021) and pTau181 (p < 0.001) levels. Discussion and conclusions: Plasma GFAP, NfL and pTau 181 are promising biomarkers in the diagnosis of the prodromic stages and prognosis of dementia.
