21335619|a|There is a significant flux of the neurotoxic oxysterol 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OHC) from the circulation across the blood-brain barrier. Because there is a correlation between 27OHC and cholesterol in the circulation and lipoprotein-bound cholesterol does not pass the blood-brain barrier, we have suggested that 27OHC may mediate the effects of hypercholesterolemia on the brain. We previously demonstrated a modest accumulation of 27OHC in brains of patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), consistent with a role of 27OHC as a primary pathogenetic factor. We show here that there is a 4-fold accumulation of 27OHC in different regions of the cortexes of patients carrying the Swedish amyloid precursor protein (APPswe) 670/671 mutation. The brain levels of sitosterol and campesterol were not significantly different in the AD patients compared with the controls, suggesting that the blood-brain barrier was intact in the AD patients. We conclude that accumulation of 27OHC is likely to be secondary to neurodegeneration, possibly a result of reduced activity of CYP7B1, the neuronal enzyme responsible for metabolism of 27OHC. We discuss the possibility of a vicious circle in the brains of the patients with familial AD whereby neurodegenerative changes cause an accumulation of 27OHC that further accelerates neurodegeneration.
