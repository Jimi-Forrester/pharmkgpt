33860337|t|Hospital Frailty Risk Score predicts adverse events in revision total hip and knee arthroplasty.
33860337|a|INTRODUCTION: The Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) is a validated risk stratification model referring to the cumulative deficits model of frailty. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the HFRS as a predictor of 90-day readmission and complications after revision total hip (rTHA) and knee (rTKA) arthroplasty. METHODS: In a retrospective analysis of 565 patients who had undergone rTHA or rTKA between 2011 and 2019, the HFRS was calculated for each patient. Rates of adverse events were compared between patients with low and intermediate or high frailty risk. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between the HFRS and post-operative adverse events. RESULTS: Patients with intermediate or high frailty risk showed higher rates of readmission (30days: 23.8% vs. 9.9%, p = 0.006; 90days: 26.2% vs. 13.0%, p < 0.018), surgical complications (28.6% vs. 7.8%, p < 0.001), medical complications (11.9% vs. 1.0%, p < 0.001), other complications (28.6% vs. 2.3%, p < 0.001), Clavien-Dindo grade IV complications (14.3% vs. 4.8%, p = 0.009), and transfusion (33.3% vs. 6.1%, p < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed a high HFRS as independent risk factor for surgical complications (OR = 3.45, 95% CI 1.45-8.18, p = 0.005), medical complications (OR = 7.29, 95% CI 1.72-30.97, p = 0.007), and other complications (OR = 14.15, 95% CI 5.16-38.77, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The HFRS predicts adverse events after rTHA and rTKA. As it derives from routinely collected data, the HFRS could be implemented automated in hospital information systems to facilitate identification of at-risk patients.
