23412312|a|This article summarizes the detailed cost-effectiveness analysis of delirium prevention interventions in people undergoing surgical repair of hip fracture. We compared a multi-component delirium prevention intervention with usual care using a model based on a decision tree analysis. The model was used to estimate the incremental net monetary benefit (INMB). The robustness of the cost-effectiveness result was explored using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The multi-component prevention intervention was cost-effective when compared to usual care. It was associated with an INMB of $8,180 using a cost-effectiveness threshold of $20,000 per QALY. It remained cost-effective in the majority of the deterministic sensitivity analyses and was cost-effective in 96.4 % of the simulations carried out in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We have demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of a multi-component delirium prevention intervention that targets modifiable risk factors for delirium in older people undergoing surgical repair of hip fracture. It is an attractive intervention for practitioners and health care policy makers as they address the double burden of hip fracture and delirium.
