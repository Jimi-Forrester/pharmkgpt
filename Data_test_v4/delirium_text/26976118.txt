26976118|a|OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for worsened quality of life (QoL) and activities of daily living (ADL) at 3 and 12 months after discharge from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in patients on mechanical ventilation (MV). DESIGN: A prospective, multicentric observational study was made. SETTING: Three ICUs in Argentina. PATIENTS: The study included a total of 84 out of 129 mainly clinical patients admitted between 2011-2012 and requiring over 24hours of MV. INTERVENTIONS: No interventions were carried out. VARIABLES: Quality of life was assessed with the EQ-5D (version for Argentina), and ADL with the Barthel index. RESULTS: The EQ-5D and Barthel scores were assessed upon admission to the ICU (baseline) and after three months and one year of follow-up. Comorbidities, delirium, ICU acquired weakness (ICUAW), and medication received were daily assessed during ICU stay. The baseline QoL of the global sample showed a median index of [0.831 (IQR25-75% 0.527-0.931)], versus [0.513 (IQR0.245-0.838)] after three months and [0.850 (IQR0.573-1.00)] after one year. Significant differences were observed compared with QoL in the Argentinean general population [mean 0.880 (CI 0.872-0.888), p<0.001; p<0.001; p0.002]. Individual analysis showed that 67% of the patients had worsened their QoL at three months, while 33% had recovered their QoL. In the multivariate analysis, the variables found to be independent predictors of worsened QoL were a hospital stay >=21 days [OR 12.57 (2.75-57.47)], age >=50 years [OR 5.61 (1.27-24.83)], previous poor QoL [OR 0.11 (0.02-0.54)] and persistent ICUAW [OR 8.32 (1.22-56.74)]. Similar results were found for the worsening of ADL. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life is altered after critical illness, and its recovery is gradual over time. Age, length of hospital stay, previous QoL and persistent ICUAW seem to be risk factors for worsened QoL.
