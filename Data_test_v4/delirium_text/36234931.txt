36234931|a|Sweet pepper fruits (Capsicum annuum L.) contain various nutrients and phytochemicals that enhance human health and prevent the pathogenesis of certain diseases. Here, we report that oral administration of orange sweet pepper juices prepared by a high-speed blender and low-speed masticating juicer reduces UVB-induced skin damage in SKH-1 hairless mice. Sweet pepper juices reduced UVB-induced skin photoaging by the regulation of genes involved in dermal matrix production and maintenance such as collagen type I alpha 1 and matrix metalloproteinase-2, 3, 9. Administration of sweet pepper juices also restored total collagen levels in UVB-exposed mice. In addition, sweet pepper juices downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory proteins such as cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-17, and IL-23, which was likely via inhibiting the NF-kappaB pathway. Moreover, primary antioxidant enzymes in the skin were enhanced by oral supplementation of sweet pepper juices, as evidenced by increased expression of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase-2. Immunohistochemical staining showed that sweet pepper juices reduced UVB-induced DNA damage by preventing 8-OHdG formation. These results suggest that sweet pepper juices may offer a protective effect against photoaging by inhibiting the breakdown of dermal matrix, inflammatory response, and DNA damage as well as enhancing antioxidant defense, which leads to an overall reduction in skin damage.
