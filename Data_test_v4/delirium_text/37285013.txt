37285013|t|Glofitamab: First Approval.
37285013|a|Glofitamab (Columvi ) is a CD20 x CD3 T-cell-engaging bispecific monoclonal antibody being developed by Roche for the treatment of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Glofitamab received its first approval (with conditions) on 25 March 2023, in Canada, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL not otherwise specified, DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma, or primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, who have received two or more lines of systemic therapy and are ineligible to receive or cannot receive CAR T-cell therapy or have previously received CAR T-cell therapy. Glofitamab is also under regulatory review for relapsed or refractory DLBCL in the EU and USA and in April 2023 received a positive opinion recommending the granting of a conditional marketing authorization in the EU. Clinical development of glofitamab, as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, is continuing worldwide. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of glofitamab leading to this first approval for relapsed or refractory DLBCL.
