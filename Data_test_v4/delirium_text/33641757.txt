33641757|t|Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults and Oral Health Considerations: Treatment and Management.
33641757|a|Current research aims at improving early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment (CI), particularly in patients at high risk for progression to dementia. It is important to treat signs and symptoms as early as possible to normalize quality of life. In older cognitively impaired patients, dentists and physicians should consider polypharmacy, uncontrolled cardiovascular risk factors, depression, metabolic or endocrine derangements, delirium due to intercurrent illness, and dementia, all of which may increase risk for CI and other negative outcomes. An interdisciplinary team approach is a necessity for a responsible and safe treatment sequence.
