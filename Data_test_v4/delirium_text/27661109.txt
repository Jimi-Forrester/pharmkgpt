27661109|t|IMPA2 polymorphisms and risk of ischemic stroke in a northwest Han Chinese population.
27661109|a|Genetic association analysis has suggested that IMPA2 is a susceptibility gene for ischemic stroke (IS). To explore the association between IMPA2 polymorphisms and the risk of IS in a Han Chinese population, candidate gene association was performed using data from a case-control study of 488 IS patients and 503 control subjects. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the association, and associations were evaluated under dominant, recessive, and additive genetic models using PLINK software. There was a statistically significant difference in the "TC" genotype frequency of the IMPA2 polymorphism rs589247, between cases and controls (50.0% vs. 45.3%). Under the dominant model, rs589247 was associated with an increased risk of IS (OR=1.32, 95%CI: 1.01-1.73; P=0.040). There were no other associations between any of the seven additional IMPA2 polymorphisms and IS risk. This study is the first to find a correlation between an IMPA2 polymorphism and IS risk in a northwest Han Chinese population. These results may help to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of this disease, and could potentially be used to predict IS risk. However, further studies are still needed to validate this association in other populations and with larger sample sizes.
