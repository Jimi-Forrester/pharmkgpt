30430888|a|Objective: To evaluate the effects of isolated impaired fasting glucose (IIFG) on brain injury in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery. Methods: Patients with rheumatic heart valve disease who underwent elective mitral valve replacement were included and divided into control and IIFG groups. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative blood glucose levels, serum insulin levels, insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), lactic acid levels, and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S100B levels were measured. The cerebral oxygen extraction ratio (OER) was calculated. Cognitive function was assessed via the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Results: HOMA-IR levels were higher in the IIFG group than the control group 30 min after the beginning of CPB, at the termination of CPB, and 2 h after the termination of CPB. Cerebral OER and lactic acid increased intraoperatively in both groups, especially in the IIFG group. NSE and S100B levels were higher in the IIFG group than in the control group at the termination of CPB, 2 h after the termination of CPB, and at 24 h postoperatively. The MMSE scores did not significantly differ between the two groups. Delirium occurred in two patients in the IIFG group, and one in the control group. No other signs and symptoms of brain injuries were detected in either group. Conclusions: The increased postoperative NSE and S100B levels in the IIFG group compared with controls may be associated with severe insulin resistance and stress hyperglycemia. However, the IIFG group did not have clinical manifestations of brain injuries, including cognitive impairment.
