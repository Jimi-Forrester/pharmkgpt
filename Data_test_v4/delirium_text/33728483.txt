33728483|t|Association of early and later depressive symptoms with functional outcome after ischemic stroke.
33728483|a|BACKGROUND: Post-stroke depressive symptoms (DS) can be chronic or transient, occurring shortly or long after stroke and lasting only few months. It remains unclear if the prognosis differs between patients with DS in the acute phase of stroke and those who develop DS several months later. We aimed to determine whether outcomes vary among patients with different trajectories of post-stroke depressive symptoms. METHODS: Of 698 enrolled patients with ischemic stroke, we included 335 participants (median age: 68, 48% female) who were assessed for DS both 8 days and 3 months post-stroke. We divided patients into 4 groups: without greater DS (Group 1), only earlier DS (Group 2), only later DS (Group 3), and persistent DS (Group 4). Logistic regression was used to determine the association between DS and 3- and 12-month functional outcome. RESULTS: Group 2 was predominantly female and had the highest rate of previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. Group 3 was more likely to suffer from delirium and more severe stroke. Group 4 had the highest frequency of vascular risk factors, pre-morbid psychiatric symptoms, and cognitive decline. In multivariate analysis, Group 3, but not Groups 2 and 4, had an increased risk of poor 3- and 12-month functional outcome (adjusted OR 2.59, 95% CI 1.64-4.07, P < 0.01 and OR 3.97, 95% CI 2.32-6.76, P < 0.01, respectively) compared with Group 1. CONCLUSIONS: Different trajectories of post-stroke DS are related to different outcomes. Patients who only have later DS also have the worst prognosis.
