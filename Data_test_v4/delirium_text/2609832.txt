2609832|a|The authors investigated the impact of single CT investigation of senile dementia patients. CT was assessed visually. Investigated were 214 patients (23 with senile dementia, 29 with Alzheimer disease, 14 with Pick disease, 90 with vasculogenic dementia, 58 with other forms of dementia). The overall high efficiency of CT was shown in diagnosis of senile dementia. Depending on peculiar clinico-morphological relations different patterns of CT contribution to dementia diagnosis are determined: its verification, detection of concomitant (clinically latent) pathology, establishment of an alternative diagnosis, reduction of the number of diagnostic hypotheses, correction of a diagnostic error.
