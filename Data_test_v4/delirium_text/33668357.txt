33668357|t|Influence of Circadian Rhythm in the Eye: Significance of Melatonin in Glaucoma.
33668357|a|Circadian rhythm and the molecules involved in it, such as melanopsin and melatonin, play an important role in the eye to regulate the homeostasis and even to treat some ocular conditions. As a result, many ocular pathologies like dry eye, corneal wound healing, cataracts, myopia, retinal diseases, and glaucoma are affected by this cycle. This review will summarize the current scientific literature about the influence of circadian patterns on the eye, focusing on its relationship with increased intraocular pressure (IOP) fluctuations and glaucoma. Regarding treatments, two ways should be studied: the first one, to analyze if some treatments could improve their effect on the ocular disease when their posology is established in function of circadian patterns, and the second one, to evaluate new drugs to treat eye pathologies related to the circadian rhythm, as it has been stated with melatonin or its analogs, that not only could be used as the main treatment but as coadjutant, improving the circadian pattern or its antioxidant and antiangiogenic properties.
