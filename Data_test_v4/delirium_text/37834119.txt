37834119|t|Sigma Receptors: Novel Regulators of Iron/Heme Homeostasis and Ferroptosis.
37834119|a|Sigma receptors are non-opiate/non-phencyclidine receptors that bind progesterone and/or heme and also several unrelated xenobiotics/chemicals. They reside in the plasma membrane and in the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and nucleus. Until recently, the biology/pharmacology of these proteins focused primarily on their role in neuronal functions in the brain/retina. However, there have been recent developments in the field with the discovery of unexpected roles for these proteins in iron/heme homeostasis. Sigma receptor 1 (S1R) regulates the oxidative stress-related transcription factor NRF2 and protects against ferroptosis, an iron-induced cell death process. Sigma receptor 2 (S2R), which is structurally unrelated to S1R, complexes with progesterone receptor membrane components PGRMC1 and PGRMC2. S2R, PGRMC1, and PGRMC2, either independently or as protein-protein complexes, elicit a multitude of effects with a profound influence on iron/heme homeostasis. This includes the regulation of the secretion of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin, the modulation of the activity of mitochondrial ferrochelatase, which catalyzes iron incorporation into protoporphyrin IX to form heme, chaperoning heme to specific hemoproteins thereby influencing their biological activity and stability, and protection against ferroptosis. Consequently, S1R, S2R, PGRMC1, and PGRMC2 potentiate disease progression in hemochromatosis and cancer. These new discoveries usher this intriguing group of non-traditional progesterone receptors into an unchartered territory in biology and medicine.
