37162686|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) are incurable and the most prevalent cognitive and motor disorders of elderly. Mitochondria are essential for a wide range of cellular processes playing a pivotal role in a number of cellular functions like metabolism, intracellular signaling, apoptosis, and immunity. A plethora of evidence indicates the central role of mitochondrial functions in pathogenesis of many aging related NDD. Considering how mitochondria function in neurodegenerative diseases, oxidative stress, and mutations in mtDNA both contribute to aging. Many substantial reports suggested the involvement of numerous contributing factors including, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, mitophagy, accumulation of somatic mtDNA mutations, compromised mitochondrial dynamics, and transport within axons in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Therapies therefore target fundamental mitochondrial processes such as energy metabolism, free-radical generation, mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial redox state, mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial protein synthesis, mitochondrial quality control, and metabolism hold great promise to develop pharmacological based therapies in NDD. By emphasizing the most efficient pharmacological strategies to target dysfunction of mitochondria in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, this review serves the scientific community engaged in translational medical science by focusing on the establishment of novel, mitochondria-targeted treatment strategies.
