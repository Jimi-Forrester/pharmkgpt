36998129|a|BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative procedures include a large spectrum of disorders with diverse pathological features and clinical manifestations, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Multiple sclerosis, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are indicated by progressive loss of neurons and cognitive function, which is associated with free radical formation, extra and intercellular accumulation of misfolded proteins, oxidative stress, mitochondrial and neurotrophins dysfunction, bioenergetic impairment, inflammation, and apoptotic cell death. Boswellic acid is a pentacyclic triterpene molecule of plant origin that has been applied for treating several inflammatory disorders. Numerous studies have also investigated its' therapeutic potential against multiple NDs. OBJECTIVE: In this article, we aim to review the neuroprotective effects of boswellic acid on NDs and the related mechanisms of action. METHODS: The databases of PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Sciences, and Scopus were searched to find studies that reported the effects of boswellic acid on NDs without time limits. Review articles, letters, editorials, unpublished data, and articles not published in the English language were not included in the study Results: Overall, 17 studies were included in the present study (8 NDs in general, 5 AD, 3 PD, and 1 ALS). According to the reports, boswellic acid exerts anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and neuromodulatory effects against NDs. Boswellic acid decreases Tau phosphorylation and amyloid-beta (Abeta) generation in AD. This substance also protects nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and improves motor impairments in PD and modulates neurotransmitters, decreases the demyelination region, and improves behavioral functions in ALS. CONCLUSION: Due to the significant effects of boswellic acid in NDs, more clinical studies are necessary to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of this substance because it seems that boswellic acid can be used as a complementary or alternative treatment in patients with NDs.
