21318142|t|Formation of Toxic Amyloid Fibrils by Amyloid beta-Protein on Ganglioside Clusters.
21318142|a|It is widely accepted that the conversion of the soluble, nontoxic amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) monomer to aggregated toxic Abeta rich in beta-sheet structures is central to the development of Alzheimer's disease. However, the mechanism of the abnormal aggregation of Abeta in vivo is not well understood. Accumulating evidence suggests that lipid rafts (microdomains) in membranes mainly composed of sphingolipids (gangliosides and sphingomyelin) and cholesterol play a pivotal role in this process. This paper summarizes the molecular mechanisms by which Abeta aggregates on membranes containing ganglioside clusters, forming amyloid fibrils. Notably, the toxicity and physicochemical properties of the fibrils are different from those of Abeta amyloids formed in solution. Furthermore, differences between Abeta-(1-40) and Abeta-(1-42) in membrane interaction and amyloidogenesis are also emphasized.
