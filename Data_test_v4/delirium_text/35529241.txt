35529241|a|Benzofuran compounds are a class of compounds that are ubiquitous in nature. Numerous studies have shown that most benzofuran compounds have strong biological activities such as anti-tumor, antibacterial, anti-oxidative, and anti-viral activities. Owing to these biological activities and potential applications in many aspects, benzofuran compounds have attracted more and more attention of chemical and pharmaceutical researchers worldwide, making these substances potential natural drug lead compounds. For example, the recently discovered novel macrocyclic benzofuran compound has anti-hepatitis C virus activity and is expected to be an effective therapeutic drug for hepatitis C disease; novel scaffold compounds of benzothiophene and benzofuran have been developed and utilized as anticancer agents. Novel methods for constructing benzofuran rings have been discovered in recent years. A complex benzofuran derivative is constructed by a unique free radical cyclization cascade, which is an excellent method for the synthesis of a series of difficult-to-prepare polycyclic benzofuran compounds. Another benzofuran ring constructed by proton quantum tunneling has not only fewer side reactions, but also high yield, which is conducive to the construction of complex benzofuran ring systems. This review summarizes the recent studies on the various aspects of benzofuran derivatives including their important natural product sources, biological activities and drug prospects, and chemical synthesis, as well as the relationship between the bioactivities and structures.
