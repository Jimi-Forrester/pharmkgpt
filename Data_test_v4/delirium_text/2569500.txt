2569500|t|Reduced glycine stimulation of [3H]MK-801 binding in Alzheimer's disease.
2569500|a|The novel N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channel ligand (+)-[3H]5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]-cyclohepten-5, 10-imine maleate ([3H]MK-801) has been utilized to label this receptor in human brain tissue. Characteristics of [3H]MK-801 binding to well-washed membranes from 17 control subjects and 16 patients with Alzheimer's disease were determined in frontal, parietal, and temporal cerebral cortex and cerebellar cortex. In control tissue the pharmacological specificity of the binding of this substance is entirely consistent with the profile previously reported for rat brain. Binding could be stimulated by the addition of glutamic acid to the incubation medium; addition of glycine produced further enhancement which was not prevented by strychnine. The specificity of the effects of these and other amino acids on the binding was the same as in the rat. In Alzheimer's disease significantly less binding was observed in the frontal cortex under glutamate- and glycine-stimulated conditions. This appears to be associated with a reduced affinity of the site whereas the pharmacological specificity of the site remained unchanged. The effect did not appear to be due to differences in mode of death between Alzheimer's disease and control subjects and is unlikely to be related to factors for which the groups were matched. In contrast, binding was not altered in the absence of added amino acids and presence of glutamate alone. These results imply that in the cerebral cortex the agonist site and a site in the cation channel of the receptor are not selectively altered, but that their coupling to a strychnine-insensitive glycine recognition site is impaired.
