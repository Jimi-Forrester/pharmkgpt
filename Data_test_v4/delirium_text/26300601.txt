26300601|a|SUMMARY: Oligodendrogliomas may present with a variety of psychological symptoms but it only rarely presents with mania. The patient described in this case report is a 55-year-old man with a three year history of progressive mania who was initially diagnosed as chronic mania but a subsequent MRI identified a brain tumor. This report highlights the importance of considering differential organic diagnosis when patients present with atypical presentations of psychiatric disorders. A brain tumor should be considered and brain imaging studies conducted for patients with a late age of onset who do not respond to appropriate medication.
