37400758|t|The impact of a pharmacist intervention on post-discharge hypnotic drug discontinuation in geriatric inpatients: a before-after study.
37400758|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic use of hypnotic agents is prevalent in older adults, who as a result are at increased risk for certain adverse events, such as day-time drowsiness and falls. Multiple strategies to discontinue hypnotics have been tested in geriatric patients, but evidence remains scarce. Hence, we aimed to investigate a multicomponent intervention to reduce hypnotic drug use in geriatric inpatients. METHODS: A before-after study was performed on the acute geriatric wards of a teaching hospital. The before group (= control group) received usual care, while intervention patients (= intervention group) were exposed to a pharmacist-led deprescribing intervention, comprising education of health care personnel, access to standardized discontinuation regimens, patient education and support of transitional care. The primary outcome was hypnotic drug discontinuation at one month after discharge. Secondary outcomes among others were sleep quality and hypnotic use at one and two weeks after enrolment and at discharge. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) upon inclusion, two weeks after enrolment and one month after discharge. Determinants for the primary outcome were identified using regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 173 patients were enrolled, with 70.5% of patients taking benzodiazepines. Average age was 85 years (interquartile range 81-88.5) and 28.3% were male. A higher discontinuation rate at one month after discharge was observed in favour of the intervention (37.7% vs. 21.9%, p = 0.02281). No difference in sleep quality was found between both groups (p = 0.719). The average sleep quality was 8.74 (95% confidence interval (CI): 7.98-9.49) and 8.57 (95% CI: 7.75-9.39) in the control and intervention groups respectively. Determinants for discontinuation at one month were: the intervention (odds ratio (OR) 2.36, 95% CI: 1.14-4.99), fall on admission (OR 2.05; 95% CI: 0.95-4.43), use of a z-drug (OR 0.54, 95% CI: 0.23-1.22), PSQI score on admission (OR 1.08, 95% CI: 0.97-1.19) and discontinuation prior to discharge (OR 4.71, 95% CI: 2.26-10.17). CONCLUSIONS: A pharmacist-led intervention in geriatric inpatients was associated with a reduction of hypnotic drug use one month after discharge, without any loss in sleep quality.
