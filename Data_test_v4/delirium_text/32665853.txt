32665853|t|The influence of mitochondrial-directed regulation of Wnt signaling on tumorigenesis.
32665853|a|Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that play a key role in integrating cellular signaling. Mitochondrial alterations are evident in all stages of tumorigenesis and targeting mitochondrial pathways has emerged as an anticancer therapeutic strategy. The Wnt-signaling pathway regulates many fundamental cellular functions such as proliferation, survival, migration, stem-cell maintenance, and mitochondrial metabolism and dynamics. Emerging evidence demonstrates that mitochondrial-induced regulation of Wnt signaling provides an additional mechanism to influence cell-fate decisions. Crosstalk between mitochondria and Wnt signaling presents a feedforward loop in which Wnt activation regulates mitochondrial function that, in turn, drives Wnt signaling. In this mini-review, we will discuss the recent evidence revealing the mitochondrial control of Wnt signaling and its implications for tumorigenesis and anticancer therapeutic targeting.
