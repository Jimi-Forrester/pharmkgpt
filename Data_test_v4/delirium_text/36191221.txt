36191221|a|Recurrent seizure is a common comorbidity in early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may contribute to AD pathogenesis and cognitive decline. Similarly, many mouse models of Alzheimer's disease that overproduce amyloid beta are prone to epileptiform seizures that may result in early sudden death. We studied one such model, designated APP/PS1, and found that mutation of the TAM receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) Mer or its ligand Gas6 greatly exacerbated early death. Lethality was tied to violent seizures that appeared to initiate in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, where Mer plays an essential role in the microglial phagocytosis of both apoptotic and newborn cells normally generated during adult neurogenesis. We found that newborn DG neurons and excitatory synapses between the DG and the cornu ammonis field 3 (CA3) field of the hippocampus were increased in TAM-deficient mice, and that premature death and adult neurogenesis in these mice were coincident. In contrast, the incidence of lethal seizures and the deposition of dense-core amyloid plaques were strongly anticorrelated. Together, these results argue that TAM-mediated phagocytosis sculpts synaptic connectivity in the hippocampus, and that seizure-inducing amyloid beta polymers are present prior to the formation of dense-core plaques.
