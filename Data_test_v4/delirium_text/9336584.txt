9336584|t|Nutritional needs of the person with Alzheimer's disease: practical approaches to quality care.
9336584|a|Intellectual losses in Alzheimer's disease include ever-decreasing attention span, lack of judgment, compromised logic and reasoning skills, and lack of ability to plan and organize complex tasks. Patients have great difficulty staying focused on the task of eating. Extensive damage to the parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes causes altered processing of sensory input, resulting in distorted perceptions of the world around them. Many so-called "behaviors" are the direct result of clients' responses to their perceived environment. The ability to use utensils deteriorates because of both cognitive and motor losses. These patients commonly have slow, progressive weight loss over the span of their illness, despite high-energy diets. Altering the environment, staff approaches, and food items will make patients' lives easier and maintain good nutrition for as long as possible.
