37512158|t|Prevalence, Recognition, and Risk Factors of Constipation among Medically Hospitalized Patients: A Cohort Prospective Study.
37512158|a|Background and Objective: Constipation is a prevalent gastrointestinal condition that has a substantial impact on individuals and healthcare systems. This condition adversely affects health-related quality of life and leads to escalated healthcare expenses due to an increase in office visits, referrals to specialists, and hospital admission. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence, recognition, risk factors, and course of constipation among hospitalized patients in medical wards. Materials and Methods: A prospective study was conducted, including all adult patients admitted to the General Medicine Unit between 1 February 2022 and 31 August 2022. Constipation was identified using the Constipation Assessment Scale (CAS), and relevant factors were extracted from the patients' medical records. Results: Among the patients who met the inclusion criteria (n = 556), the prevalence of constipation was determined to be 55.6% (95% CI 52.8-58.4). Patients with constipation were found to be older (p < 0.01) and had higher frailty scores (p < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis revealed that heart failure (Odds ratio (OR) 2.1; 95% CI 1.2-3.7; p = 0.01), frailty score (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.2-1.5; p < 0.01), and dihydropyridines calcium channel blockers (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.2-2.8; p < 0.01) were independent risk factors for constipation. Furthermore, the medical team did not identify constipation in 217 patients (64.01%). Conclusions: Constipation is highly prevalent among medically hospitalized patients. To ensure timely recognition and treatment, it is essential to incorporate a daily constipation assessment scale into each patient's medical records.
