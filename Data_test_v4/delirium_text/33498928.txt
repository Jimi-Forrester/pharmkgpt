33498928|t|Therapeutic Application of Exosomes in Inflammatory Diseases.
33498928|a|Immunomodulation is on the cusp of being an important therapy for treating many diseases, due to the significant role of the immune system in defending the human body. Although the immune system is an essential defense system, overactivity can result in diverse sicknesses such as inflammation and autoimmune disease. Exosomes are emerging as a state-of-the-art therapeutic strategy for treating an overactive immune system. Thus, exosomes have drawn great interest for their potential clinical applications in treating diseases associated with abnormal immune regulation. Hence, in this review, we will discuss trends in exosome research related to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Possible therapeutic applications of exosomes will be summarized. Finally, an outlook to the future of exosomal therapy will be introduced.
