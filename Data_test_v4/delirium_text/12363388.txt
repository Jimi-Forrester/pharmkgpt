12363388|a|Several lines of evidence suggest a possible role for reelin in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental diseases, particularly schizophrenia. Genes encoding reelin and proteins involved in the signal pathway of reelin are thus candidate genes for schizophrenia. We examined the polymorphic CGG repeat in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of the reelin gene, which was recently found to be associated with autistic disorder, and the CGG repeat in the 5' UTR region of the very low density protein receptor (VLDLR) gene, which was reported to be associated with sporadic Alzheimer's disease, for allelic association with schizophrenia. The subjects consisted of 150 patients and 150 controls matched for sex, age and ethnicity (Japanese). We found no significant association of schizophrenia with the trinucleotide repeat polymorphism of the reelin or VLDLR genes, suggesting that these polymorphisms do not have a major role in the pathogenesis of the disease.
