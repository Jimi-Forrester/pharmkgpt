38534519|t|Molecular Dynamics and In Vitro Studies Elucidating the Tunable Features of Reconfigurable Nanodiscs for Guiding the Optimal Design of Curcumin Formulation.
38534519|a|In this study, we advance our exploration of Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) peptide analogs (APAs) for their application in nanodisc (ND) assembly, focusing on the dynamic conformational characteristics and the potential for drug delivery. We explore APA-ND interactions with an emphasis on curcumin encapsulation, utilizing molecular dynamic simulations and in vitro assessments to evaluate the efficacy of various APA-ND formulations as drug carriers. The methodological approach involved the generation of three unique apoA-I alpha-11/3 helical mimics, resulting in fifteen distinct APAs. Their structural integrity was rigorously assessed using ColabFold-AF2, with particular attention to pLDDT and pTM scores. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations, covering 1.7 mus across 17 ND systems, were conducted to investigate the influence of APA sequence variations on ND stability and interactions. This study reveals that the composition of APAs, notably the presence of Proline, Serine, and Tryptophan, significantly impacts ND stability and morphology. Oligomeric APAs, in particular, demonstrated superior stability and distinct interaction patterns compared to their monomeric counterparts. Additionally, hydrodynamic diameter measurements over eight weeks indicated sequence-dependent stability, highlighting the potential of specific APA configurations for sustained colloidal stability. In vitro study successfully encapsulated curcumin in [AA]3/DMPC ND formulations, revealing concentration-dependent stability and interaction dynamics. The findings underscore the remarkable capability of APA-NDs to maintain structural integrity and efficient drug encapsulation, positioning them as a promising platform for drug delivery. The study concludes by emphasizing the tunability and versatility of APA-NDs in drug formulation, potentially revolutionizing nanomedicine by enabling customized APA sequences and ND properties for targeted drug delivery.
