37569515|t|Adipose-Derived Stem Cells Spontaneously Express Neural Markers When Grown in a PEG-Based 3D Matrix.
37569515|a|Neurological diseases are among the leading causes of disability and death worldwide and remain difficult to treat. Tissue engineering offers avenues to test potential treatments; however, the development of biologically accurate models of brain tissues remains challenging. Given their neurogenic potential and availability, adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are of interest for creating neural models. While progress has been made in differentiating ADSCs into neural cells, their differentiation in 3D environments, which are more representative of the in vivo physiological conditions of the nervous system, is crucial. This can be achieved by modulating the 3D matrix composition and stiffness. Human ADSCs were cultured for 14 days in a 1.1 kPa polyethylene glycol-based 3D hydrogel matrix to assess effects on cell morphology, cell viability, proteome changes and spontaneous neural differentiation. Results showed that cells continued to proliferate over the 14-day period and presented a different morphology to 2D cultures, with the cells elongating and aligning with one another. The proteome analysis revealed 439 proteins changed in abundance by >1.5 fold. Cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) markers were identified using immunocytochemistry and confirmed with proteomics. Findings indicate that ADSCs spontaneously increase neural marker expression when grown in an environment with similar mechanical properties to the central nervous system.
