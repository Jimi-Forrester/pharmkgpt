29125490|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of the beta-amyloid and microtubule associated protein tau metabolism have proven the capacity to improve classification of subjects developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). The blood plasma proteome was characterized to further elaborate upon the mechanisms involved and identify proteins that may improve classification of older adults developing an AD dementia. OBJECTIVE: Identify and describe plasma protein expressions that best classify subjects with CSF-defined presence of AD pathology and cerebral amyloidosis. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of samples collected from community-dwelling elderly with (n = 72) or without (n = 48) cognitive impairment. CSF Abeta1-42, tau, and phosphorylated tau (P-tau181) were measured using ELISA, and mass spectrometry quantified the plasma proteomes. Presence of AD pathology was defined as CSF P-tau181/Abeta1-42 > 0.0779, and presence of amyloidosis was defined as CSF Abeta1-42 < 724 pg/mL. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-eight plasma proteins were quantified. Plasma proteins did not improve classification of the AD CSF biomarker profile in the whole sample. When the analysis was separately performed in the cognitively impaired individuals, the diagnosis accuracy of AD CSF profile was 88.9% with 19 plasma proteins included. Within the full cohort, there were 16 plasma proteins that improved diagnostic accuracy of cerebral amyloidosis to 92.4%. CONCLUSION: Plasma proteins improved classification accuracy of AD pathology in cognitively-impaired older adults and appeared representative of amyloid pathology. If confirmed, those candidates could serve as valuable blood biomarkers of the preclinical stages of AD or risk of developing AD.
