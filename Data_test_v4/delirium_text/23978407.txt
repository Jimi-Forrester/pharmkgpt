23978407|a|OBJECTIVE: to examine the effect of a multi-component, delirium prevention intervention on rates of incident delirium for patients admitted to specialist elderly care wards. DESIGN: 'before' and 'after' study. SETTING: three specialist elderly care wards in a general hospital. SUBJECTS: older people admitted as emergencies. METHODS: a multi-component delirium prevention intervention that targeted delirium risk factors was implemented by clinical staff. Demographic information and assessments for delirium risk factors were recorded by research staff within 24 h of admission to the ward. New onset (incident) delirium was diagnosed by daily research staff assessments using the Confusion Assessment Method and Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98. RESULTS: a total of 436 patients were recruited (249 in the 'before' and 187 in the 'after' group). Incident delirium was significantly reduced ('before' = 13.3%; 'after' = 4.6%; P = 0.006). Delirium severity and duration were significantly reduced in the 'after' group. Mortality, length of stay, activities of daily living score at discharge and new discharge to residential or nursing home rates were similar for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: a multi-component, delirium prevention intervention directed at delirium risk factors and implemented by local clinical staff can reduce incident delirium on specialist elderly care wards.
