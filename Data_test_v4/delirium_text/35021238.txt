35021238|t|[Light Therapy for Prevention of Delirium in Critically Ill Patients: What's the Evidence?]
35021238|a|Circadian dysrhythmia affects the majority of ICU patients and has far-reaching effects on organ functioning. At the level of the central nervous system, circadian misalignment facilitates executive cognitive dysfunction and the development of ICU delirium. The pathophysiological mechanisms, especially in the cohort of critically ill patients, appear to be complex, multilayered and far from understood. Results from preliminary research indicate that multidimensional, patient-specific chronotherapeutic concepts developed specifically for the ICU setting may help improve the healing process of patients. Circadian lighting therapy might be a promising intervention in this context.
