32751526|t|Fyn Tyrosine Kinase Elicits Amyloid Precursor Protein Tyr682 Phosphorylation in Neurons from Alzheimer's Disease Patients.
32751526|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder with a few early detection strategies. We previously proposed the amyloid precursor protein (APP) tyrosine 682 (Tyr682) residue as a valuable target for the development of new innovative pharmacologic or diagnostic interventions in AD. Indeed, when APP is phosphorylated at Tyr682, it is forced into acidic neuronal compartments where it is processed to generate neurotoxic amyloid beta peptides. Of interest, Fyn tyrosine kinase (TK) interaction with APP Tyr682 residue increases in AD neurons. Here we proved that when Fyn TK was overexpressed it elicited APP Tyr682 phosphorylation in neurons from healthy donors and promoted the amyloidogenic APP processing with Abeta peptides accumulation and neuronal death. Phosphorylation of APP at Tyr (pAPP-Tyr) increased in neurons of AD patients and AD neurons that exhibited high pAPP-Tyr also had higher Fyn TK activity. Fyn TK inhibition abolished the pAPP-Tyr and reduced Abeta42 secretion in AD neurons. In addition, the multidomain adaptor protein Fe65 controlled the Fyn-mediated pAPP-Tyr, warranting the possibility of targeting the Fe65-APP-Fyn pathway to develop innovative strategies in AD. Altogether, these results strongly emphasize the relevance of focusing on pAPP Tyr682 either for diagnostic purposes, as an early biomarker of the disease, or for pharmacological targeting, using Fyn TKI.
