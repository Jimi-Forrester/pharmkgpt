12200623|a|The major component of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau aggregated as paired helical filaments (PHFs). Cell division cycle (cdc) 2 kinase is one of the main candidate kinases that phosphorylates normal tau in vitro at several sites seen in PHF-tau. Using brains staged according to Braak and Braak criteria, we investigated the role of cdc2 in neurofibrillary changes in the hippocampal formation, and the entorhinal and temporal cortices. Neurons with tangle-like inclusions positive for active cdc2 were found to appear first in the Pre-alpha layer of the entorhinal cortex, and then extend to other brain regions co-incident with the progressive sequence of neurofibrillary changes. This predictable progressive pattern is not associated with amyloid. The intraneuronal accumulation of active cdc2 appeared to precede the deposition of PHF-tau phosphorylated at Ser 202/Thr 205 sites. These data are consistent with the notion that cdc2 might be involved in the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau and consequently aggregation of tau into PHF at an early stage and that increased cdc2 activity is not consequent to the deposition of beta-amyloid in AD brain.
