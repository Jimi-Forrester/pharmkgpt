24319563|a|Head trauma and brain injuries are common causes of emergency admission and usually predispose multiple psychiatric complications. In turn, the traumas often occur after some psychiatric disorders. Therefore, the complicated interaction of these factors often causes difficulties in diagnosis and management of the patients. The side-effects of surgical and medical treatments may also complicate these processes more, as well. In this study, we present a case of a young patient with these complex factors and discuss the diagnosis and management.
