33087675|t|Possible Cerebral Vasculitis in a Case with Rheumatoid Arthritis.
33087675|a|Cerebral rheumatoid vasculitis (CRV) is a rare, fatal, and diagnostically challenging disorder. We herein report an 81-year-old woman with a 4-year history of rheumatoid arthritis who presented with a fever, progressive disturbance of consciousness, high level of rheumatoid factor, and hypocomplementemia. The enhancement of the perforating branches in the left middle cerebral artery led us to suspect CRV. A brain biopsy could not be performed. After we intensified steroid therapy, the size of the cerebral lesions temporarily decreased. However, recurrence in the left frontal lobe occurred one month later, and the patient subsequently died. Early intensive treatments may be needed for CRV.
