37228705|a|Introduction: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a severe central nervous system injury that leads to significant sensory and motor impairment. Copper, an essential trace element in the human body, plays a vital role in various biological functions and is strictly regulated by copper chaperones and transporters. Cuproptosis, a novel type of metal ion-induced cell death, is distinct from iron deprivation. Copper deprivation is closely associated with mitochondrial metabolism and mediated by protein fatty acid acylation. Methods: In this study, we investigated the effects of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) on disease progression and the immune microenvironment in acute spinal cord injury (ASCI) patients. We obtained the gene expression profiles of peripheral blood leukocytes from ASCI patients using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We performed differential gene analysis, constructed protein-protein interaction networks, conducted weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and built a risk model. Results: Our analysis revealed that dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD), a regulator of copper toxicity, was significantly associated with ASCI, and DLD expression was significantly upregulated after ASCI. Furthermore, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) showed abnormal activation of metabolism-related processes. Immune infiltration analysis indicated a significant decrease in T cell numbers in ASCI patients, while M2 macrophage numbers were significantly increased and positively correlated with DLD expression. Discussion: In summary, our study demonstrated that DLD affects the ASCI immune microenvironment by promoting copper toxicity, leading to increased peripheral M2 macrophage polarization and systemic immunosuppression. Thus, DLD has potential as a promising biomarker for ASCI, providing a foundation for future clinical interventions.
