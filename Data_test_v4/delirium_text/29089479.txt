29089479|a|It is not known exactly where amyloid-beta (Abeta) fibrils begin to accumulate in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, we showed that abnormal levels of Abeta42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be detected before abnormal amyloid can be detected using PET in individuals with preclinical AD. Using these approaches, here we identify the earliest preclinical AD stage in subjects from the ADNI and BioFINDER cohorts. We show that Abeta accumulation preferentially starts in the precuneus, medial orbitofrontal, and posterior cingulate cortices, i.e., several of the core regions of the default mode network (DMN). This early pattern of Abeta accumulation is already evident in individuals with normal Abeta42 in the CSF and normal amyloid PET who subsequently convert to having abnormal CSF Abeta42. The earliest Abeta accumulation is further associated with hypoconnectivity within the DMN and between the DMN and the frontoparietal network, but not with brain atrophy or glucose hypometabolism. Our results suggest that Abeta fibrils start to accumulate predominantly within certain parts of the DMN in preclinical AD and already then affect brain connectivity.
