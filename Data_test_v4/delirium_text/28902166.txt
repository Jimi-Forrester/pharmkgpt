28902166|t|Critical Roles of Dual-Specificity Phosphatases in Neuronal Proteostasis and Neurological Diseases.
28902166|a|Protein homeostasis or proteostasis is a fundamental cellular property that encompasses the dynamic balancing of processes in the proteostasis network (PN). Such processes include protein synthesis, folding, and degradation in both non-stressed and stressful conditions. The role of the PN in neurodegenerative disease is well-documented, where it is known to respond to changes in protein folding states or toxic gain-of-function protein aggregation. Dual-specificity phosphatases have recently emerged as important participants in maintaining balance within the PN, acting through modulation of cellular signaling pathways that are involved in neurodegeneration. In this review, we will summarize recent findings describing the roles of dual-specificity phosphatases in neurodegeneration and offer perspectives on future therapeutic directions.
