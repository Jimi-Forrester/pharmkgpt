35973340|t|Outcomes in Post-operative Delirium Following Bowel Resection: A Single Center Retrospective Review.
35973340|a|INTRODUCTION: Delirium is associated with adverse post-operative outcomes, long-term cognitive dysfunction, and prolonged hospitalization. Risk factors for its development include longer surgical duration, increased operative complexity and invasiveness, and medical comorbidities. This study aims to further evaluate the incidence of delirium and its impact on outcomes among patients undergoing both elective and emergency bowel resections. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study using an institutional patient registry. All patients undergoing bowel resection over a 3.5-year period were included. The study measured the incidence of post-operative delirium via the nursing confusion assessment method. This incidence was then compared to patient age, emergency versus elective admission, length of stay, mortality, discharge disposition, and hospital cost. RESULTS: A total of 1934 patients were included with an overall delirium incidence of 8.8%. Compared to patients without delirium, patients with delirium were more likely to have undergone emergency surgery, be greater than 70 y of age, have a longer length of stay, be discharged to a skilled nursing facility, and have a more expensive hospitalization. In addition, the overall mortality was 14% in patients experiencing delirium versus 0.1% in those that did not. Importantly, when broken down between elective and emergency groups, the mortality of those experiencing delirium was similar (11 versus 13%). CONCLUSIONS: The development of delirium following bowel resection is an important risk factor for worsened outcomes and mortality. Although the incidence of delirium is higher in the emergency surgery population, the development of delirium in the elective population infers a similar risk of mortality.
