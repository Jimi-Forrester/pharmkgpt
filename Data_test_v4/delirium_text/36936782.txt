36936782|a|Microglia play an important role in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Here, we report an approach for generating microglia-containing cerebral organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells involving the supplementation of growth factors (FGF, EGF, heparin) and 10% CO2 culture conditions. Using this platform, Western Pacific Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Parkinsonism-Dementia Complex (ALS-PDC) cerebral organoids were generated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These ALS-PDC-affected organoids had more reactive astrocytes and M1 microglia, and had fewer M2 microglia than their unaffected counterparts, leading to impaired microglia-mediated phagocytosis. RNA-seq analysis of ALS-PDC and control organoids indicated that the most significant changes were microglia- and astrocyte-related genes (IFITM1/2, TGF-beta, and GFAP). The most significantly downregulated pathway was type I interferon signaling. Interferon-gamma supplementation increased IFITM expression, enhanced microglia-mediated phagocytosis, and reduced beta-amyloid accumulation in ALS-PDC-affected network. The results demonstrated the feasibility of using microglia-containing organoids for the study of neurodegenerative diseases.
