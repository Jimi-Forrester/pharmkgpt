38525784|a|INTRODUCTION: Virtually all adults in aged care facilities are frail, a condition which contributes to falls, cognitive decline, hospitalisation, and mortality. Polypharmacy, malnutrition, sedentariness, and sarcopenia are risk factors amenable to intervention. The Asia-Pacific Frailty Management Guidelines recommend anabolic exercise and the optimisation of medications and nutrition. However, no study has evaluated this best practice intervention triad in aged care. METHODS: The Frailty Reduction via the Implementation of Exercise, Nutrition, and Deprescribing (FRIEND) Trial (ANZCTR No.ACTRN12622000926730p) is a staged 6-month translational trial evaluating resident outcomes, staff/caregiver knowledge, and institutional implementation in a Townsville aged care facility. Residents received high-intensity resistance exercise and balance training and medication and nutrition optimisation co-implemented by investigators (exercise physiologist, geriatrician, pharmacist, and nutritionist) and facility staff. Staff and caregivers completed comprehensive education modules and training. We report the trial protocol and recruitment results. RESULTS: 29 residents (21 female, age: 88.6 +- 6.3 years) were recruited. At baseline, the residents were frail (frailty scale nursing home (FRAIL-NH); 6.3 +- 2.4/14), cognitively impaired (Montreal Cognitive Assessment; 13.8 +- 6.8/30), functionally impaired (Short Physical Performance Battery; 4.9 +- 3.1/12, 6 min walk distance; 222.2 +- 104.4 m), and were prescribed numerous medications (15.5 +- 5.9). Two residents died and one withdrew before the intervention's commencement. Thirty family members and 19 staff (carers, allied health assistants, nurse managers, registered nurses, lifestyle-leisure officers, kitchen/hospitality staff, and senior leadership) were recruited to receive frailty education modules. CONCLUSIONS: The FRIEND trial is currently being implemented with results expected in mid-2024. This is the first trial to evaluate the implementation of the best practice frailty guidelines including anabolic exercise and medication/nutritional optimisation in residential aged care.
