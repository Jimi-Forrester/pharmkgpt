38149821|a|The development of multitargeted therapeutics has evolved as a promising strategy to identify efficient therapeutics for neurological disorders. We report herein new quinolinone hybrids as dual inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Abeta aggregation that function as multitargeted ligands for Alzheimer's disease. The quinoline hybrids (AM1-AM16) were screened for their ability to inhibit AChE, BACE1, amyloid fibrillation, alpha-syn aggregation, and tau aggregation. Among the tested compounds, AM5 and AM10 inhibited AChE activity by more than 80% at single-dose screening and possessed a remarkable ability to inhibit the fibrillation of Abeta42 oligomers at 10 muM. In addition, dose-dependent screening of AM5 and AM10 was performed, giving half-maximal AChE inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 1.29 +- 0.13 and 1.72 +- 0.18 muM, respectively. In addition, AM5 and AM10 demonstrated concentration-dependent inhibitory profiles for the aggregation of Abeta42 oligomers with estimated IC50 values of 4.93 +- 0.8 and 1.42 +- 0.3 muM, respectively. Moreover, the neuroprotective properties of the lead compounds AM5 and AM10 were determined in SH-SY5Y cells incubated with Abeta oligomers. This work would enable future research efforts aiming at the structural optimization of AM5 and AM10 to develop potent dual inhibitors of AChE and amyloid aggregation. Furthermore, the in vivo assay confirmed the antioxidant activity of compounds AM5 and AM10 through increasing GSH, CAT, and SOD activities that are responsible for scavenging the ROS and restoring its normal level. Blood investigation illustrated the protective activity of the two compounds against lead-induced neurotoxicity through retaining hematological and liver enzymes near normal levels. Finally, immunohistochemistry investigation revealed the inhibitory activity of beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation.
