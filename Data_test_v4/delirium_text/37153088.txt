37153088|a|Artificial intelligence (AI) has great potential to improve the field of critical care and enhance patient outcomes. This paper provides an overview of current and future applications of AI in critical illness and its impact on patient care, including its use in perceiving disease, predicting changes in pathological processes, and assisting in clinical decision-making. To achieve this, it is important to ensure that the reasoning behind AI-generated recommendations is comprehensible and transparent and that AI systems are designed to be reliable and robust in the care of critically ill patients. These challenges must be addressed through research and the development of quality control measures to ensure that AI is used in a safe and effective manner. In conclusion, this paper highlights the numerous opportunities and potential applications of AI in critical care and provides guidance for future research and development in this field. By enabling the perception of disease, predicting changes in pathological processes, and assisting in the resolution of clinical decisions, AI has the potential to revolutionize patient care for critically ill patients and improve the efficiency of health systems.
