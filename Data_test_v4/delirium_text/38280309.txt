38280309|a|Neurodegeneration disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), have garnered significant attention due to their impact on individuals and society as a whole. Understanding the mechanisms behind these disorders and developing effective therapy strategies is of utmost importance. One potential therapeutic target that has emerged is Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2), as its accumulation and activity have been closely linked to memory loss. In this report, we present the findings of a recent discovery involving a new molecule that has the ability to competitively inhibit ROCK2 activity. This molecule was identified through the utilization of a DNA-encoded library (DEL) screening platform. Following selection against ROCK2, an off-DNA compound was synthesized and examined to ascertain its inhibitory properties, selectivity, mechanism of action, and binding mode analysis. From the screening, compound CH-2 has demonstrated an IC50 value of 28 nM against ROCK2, while exhibiting a 5-fold selectivity over ROCK1. Further analysis through molecular docking has provided insights into the specific binding modes of this compound. Our findings suggest that DEL selection offers a rapid method for identifying new inhibitors. Among these, the CH-2 compound shows promise as a potential ROCK2 inhibitor and warrants further investigation.
