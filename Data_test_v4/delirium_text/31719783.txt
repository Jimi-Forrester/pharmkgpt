31719783|a|Several plants which contain the active component thymoquinone (TQ) have been traditionally used in herbal medicine to treat various diseases. Several studies indicated the protective effects of TQ against neurotoxic agents. The present study was aimed to highlight the protective effects of TQ against neurotoxic agents. For this reason, the literature from 1998 to 2017 regarding the protective effects of TQ against neurotoxic agents and their involvement mechanisms has been studied. The present review suggests the protective effects of TQ against neurotoxic agents in experimental models. More clinical trial studies are however needed to confirm the antidotal effects of TQ in human intoxication.
