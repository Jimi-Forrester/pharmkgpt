24712138|t|[Assessment of the association between nursing care services, hypertension, and Alzheimer's disease in elderly patients with late-stage diabetes].
24712138|a|In an aging society with fewer children, diabetes self-control is difficult for elderly patients. Under these circumstances, it is expected that living in care homes for the elderly and institutions where nursing care services could be provided will help improve the prognosis of diabetic patients. Therefore, we assessed whether HbA(1c). levels (National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program : NGSP) in 121 elderly patients with late-stage diabetes receiving home medical care in our clinic from March 2008 to March 2013 improved with nursing care services.
