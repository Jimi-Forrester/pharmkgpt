29156377|t|Establishment of induced pluripotent stem cell line (ZZUi010-A) from an Alzheimer's disease patient carrying an APP gene mutation.
29156377|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. Previous studies have identified mutations in several genes, such as amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), and presenilin-2 (PSEN2), in patients with early-onset (<65years) familial AD. Recently, a patient with an APP gene mutation was identified; the dermal fibroblasts of the patient were obtained and a line of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) was successfully generated using the Sendai-virus (SeV) delivery system. The iPSC line will be useful for further study of the pathomechanism and drug screening for AD.
