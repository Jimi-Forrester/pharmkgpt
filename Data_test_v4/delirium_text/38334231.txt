38334231|a|In recent years, sevoflurane and isoflurane are the most popular anesthetics in general anesthesia for their safe, rapid onset, and well tolerant. Nevertheless, many studies reported their neurotoxicity among pediatric and aged populations. This effect is usually manifested as cognitive impairment such as perioperative neurocognitive disorders. The wide application of sevoflurane and isoflurane during general anesthesia makes their safety a major health concern. Evidence indicates that iron dyshomeostasis and ferroptosis may establish a role in neurotoxicity of sevoflurane and isoflurane. However, the mechanisms of sevoflurane- and isoflurane-induced neuronal injury were not fully understood, which poses a barrier to the treatment of its neurotoxicity. We, therefore, reviewed the current knowledge on mechanisms of iron dyshomeostasis and ferroptosis and aimed to promote a better understanding of their roles in sevoflurane- and isoflurane-induced neurotoxicity.
