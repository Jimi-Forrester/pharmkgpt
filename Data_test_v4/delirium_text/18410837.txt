18410837|a|Many consider proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to be devoid of adverse effects; however, PPIs can cause serious adverse effects. We report on the case of an emergency department patient with omeprazole-induced hyponatremic delirium and rhabdomyolysis. Proton pump inhibitors are initially overlooked as a cause of hyponatremia and myopathy in the emergency department, as with our case. This case is also unique because no publication has reported on both hyponatremia and severe myopathy after PPI therapy. The patient recovered completely after cessation of omeprazole and initiation of intravenous saline hydration and desmopressin infusion.
