25009611|t|Hashimoto encephalopathy associated with hyperthyroidism: A case report.
25009611|a|Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE) is an acute encephalopathy associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The majority of reported cases have been associated with hypothyroidism, while cases with hyperthyroidism are rare. The current study reported on a 56-year old female patient with HE, who was found to have progressively aggregated dysarthria, gait disturbance, somniloquy and delirium. Thyroid function tests revealed that the patient had hyperthyroidism, with high levels of anti-thyroid antibodies. Following treatment with corticosteroids, the neurological/psychiatric symptoms of the patient were relieved quickly. The one-year follow-up investigation indicated that there was no recurrence of the disease, demonstrating that the treatment administered for this rare case was effective.
