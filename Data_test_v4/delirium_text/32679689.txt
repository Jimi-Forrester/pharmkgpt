32679689|a|Mitochondria play an essential role in bioenergetics and respiratory functions for cell viability through numerous biochemical processes. To maintain mitochondria quality control and homeostasis, mitochondrial morphologies change rapidly in response to external insults and changes in metabolic status through fusion and fission (so called mitochondrial dynamics). Furthermore, damaged mitochondria are removed via a selective autophagosomal process, referred to as mitophagy. Although mitochondria are one of the sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS), they are themselves vulnerable to oxidative stress. Thus, endogenous antioxidant defense systems play an important role in cell survival under physiological and pathological conditions. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a redox-sensitive transcription factor that maintains redox homeostasis by regulating antioxidant-response element (ARE)-dependent transcription and the expression of antioxidant defense enzymes. Although the Nrf2 system is positively associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial quality control, the relationship between Nrf2 signaling and mitochondrial dynamics/mitophagy has not been sufficiently addressed in the literature. This review article describes recent clinical and experimental observations on the relationship between Nrf2 and mitochondrial dynamics/mitophagy in various neurological diseases.
