7897629|t|Hereditary multi-infarct dementia unlinked to chromosome 19q12 in a large Scottish pedigree: evidence of probable locus heterogeneity.
7897629|a|Hereditary multi-infarct dementia is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that predominantly affects the cerebral white matter. A locus was recently mapped in French pedigrees to chromosome 19q12. We have examined a large Scottish pedigree with neuropathologically confirmed hereditary multi-infarct dementia using polymorphic DNA markers spanning the 19q12 region and found no evidence of linkage. This suggests that, as in familial Alzheimer's disease, there is more than one locus.
