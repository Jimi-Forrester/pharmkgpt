36291629|t|Mitophagy-A New Target of Bone Disease.
36291629|a|Bone diseases are usually caused by abnormal metabolism and death of cells in bones, including osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes, chondrocytes, and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Mitochondrial dysfunction, as an important cause of abnormal cell metabolism, is widely involved in the occurrence and progression of multiple bone diseases, including osteoarthritis, intervertebral disc degeneration, osteoporosis, and osteosarcoma. As selective mitochondrial autophagy for damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria, mitophagy is closely related to mitochondrial quality control and homeostasis. Accumulating evidence suggests that mitophagy plays an important regulatory role in bone disease, indicating that regulating the level of mitophagy may be a new strategy for bone-related diseases. Therefore, by reviewing the relevant literature in recent years, this paper reviews the potential mechanism of mitophagy in bone-related diseases, including osteoarthritis, intervertebral disc degeneration, osteoporosis, and osteosarcoma, to provide a theoretical basis for the related research of mitophagy in bone diseases.
