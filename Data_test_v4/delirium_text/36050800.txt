36050800|t|SNPs in apolipoproteins contribute to sex-dependent differences in blood lipids before and after a high-fat dietary challenge in healthy U.S. adults.
36050800|a|BACKGROUND: The effect of genetic polymorphisms on fasting blood lipid levels have been widely studied but the effects of these within the context of a high-fat meal challenge remain less characterized. The current study aimed to investigate the association of SNPs in lipoprotein-related genes with blood lipid profiles in healthy adults in the U.S. METHODS: Subjects (n = 393) between 18-66 years of age with BMIs ranging from 18.5-45 kg/m2 were enrolled the cross-sectional Nutritional Phenotyping Study. Among them, 349 subjects (men: 48%; women: 52%) gave consent for genotyping. SNPs in APOA5, APOB, APOC3, APOE, and LDLR were assessed. The association between lipid markers and genotypes was tested separately for each SNP with analysis of variance (ANOVA), adjusted for sex, age, and BMI. We also examined two-factor interactions between SNPs and sex, age, or BMI. RESULTS: Women carrying the C allele of rs3135506 in APOA5 or men carrying the C allele of rs429358 in APOE had reduced HDL-cholesterol levels during fasting and postprandially. The C allele in APOE was also correlated to increased LDL-C levels. The TT genotype of rs2854116 in APOC3 was associated with elevated total cholesterol. Additive effect of the risk alleles of APOA5 and APOE or APOC3 and APOE was detected. Nevertheless, the tested SNPs had little impact on the postprandial triglyceride responses to the high-fat challenge meal. We found no significant effects of SNPs in APOB (rs1042034) or LDLR (rs2228671) on triglycerides, cholesterol, or free fatty acid levels. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy adults, fasting and postprandial cholesterol levels are strongly correlated with the tested APOA5, APOE, and APOC3 genotypes. Sex contributes to the genetic impact of the tested SNPs on lipid profiles. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02367287.
