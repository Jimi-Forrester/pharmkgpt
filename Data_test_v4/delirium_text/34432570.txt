34432570|t|Function-Focused Goal Attainment and Discharge Outcomes in Hospitalized Persons With Dementia.
34432570|a|Hospitalized persons with dementia are at higher risk for functional decline and cognitive loss related to delirium. Family-centered, function-focused care (Fam-FFC) engages the family care partner in education and active participation in function-focused goal setting, implementation, and evaluation to support delirium prevention and abatement and return to baseline physical function. The purpose of the current study was to examine the association of function-focused goal attainment with two discharge outcomes, return to baseline physical function and delirium severity at discharge, in hospitalized persons with dementia. In the ongoing Fam-FFC clinical trial, the majority of goals (N = 433) developed by 134 care partner/patient dyads and nurses address mobility, cognitive stimulation, and self-care. Regression techniques demonstrated that goal attainment was significantly associated with return to baseline function (B = 0.826, Wald = 4.17 [1], p = 0.041) and lower delirium severity at discharge (B = 0.175, t = 2.239, p = 0.027). Results support the contribution of family engagement in promoting functional recovery of hospitalized persons with dementia. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 47(9), 13-20.].
