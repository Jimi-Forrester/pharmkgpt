35546753|a|BACKGROUND: Heat stroke (HS) is a serious disease accompany with central nervous system (CNS) injury, such as delirium, convulsion, and coma. Currently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been demonstrated novel neuroprotective effects, and thereofre it becomes the aim of the present research to explore the neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of MSCs against HS injury. METHODS: HS rat models were induced in a 40C and 65% humidity environment until the rectal temperature reached to 42C. The verified HS injury model rats were divided into HS group and MSCs-treated group. Each rat in the treated group was infused with 1x106 MSCs suspended in 0.3 ml physiological saline via the tail vein. The rats in the HS- or MSCs-treated groups were further divided into early stage (3d) and late stage (28d). At the set timepoint, the mortality was analyzed and levels of liver and kidney function indicators in blood were measured by automatic biochemical analyzer. The neurons morphologic changes were observed through Nissl staining, and neurological deficit score were performed. Moreover, the levels of inflammatory factors in brain tissue were measured by using a multi-cytokine detection platform, and expression of BDNF, phosphorylated TrkB and P38 were detected by Western Bolt. RESULTS: MSCs injection significantly reduced the mortality and alleviated the liver and kidney function. Moreover, the neurological deficit and neuronic edema of the hippocampus caused by HS both at 3d and 28d were significantly ameliorated by MSCs administration. Specifically, the injection of MSCs inhibited the high levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-17A caused by HS but elevated the levels of IL-10 and IL-13 in the early period (3d); while in the later period (28d), MSCs significantly increased the levels of IL-10 and IL-13 continuously and inhibited the high level of IL-17A. Furthermore, MSCs injection increased the expressions of BDNF and phosphorylated TrkB (BDNF receptor), meanwhile inhibited the expression of phosphorylated P38 (inflammatory factor) in the brains of HS rats in the early period (3d) but had no significant influence in the later period (28d). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that MSCs injection may provide therapeutic effects in HS of rats by improving the liver and kidney function, reducing the CNS damage. Moreover, MSCs injection inhibited the brain inflammatory response of HS rats, and the BDNF-TrkB and P38/MAPK signal pathways may be involved.which may provide a potential mechanism for HS therapy by MSCs administration.
