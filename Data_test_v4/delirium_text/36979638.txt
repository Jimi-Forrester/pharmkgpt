36979638|t|Myositis-Specific and Myositis-Associated Antibodies in Fibromyalgia Patients: A Prospective Study.
36979638|a|Fibromyalgia (FM) is a common rheumatologic disorder characterised by widespread muscular pain. Myalgia is also a common clinical feature in Connective Tissue Disease (CTD), and FM should be studied for the concomitant presence of a CTD. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of Myositis-Specific and Myositis-Associated Antibodies (MSA/MAA) in a cohort of FM patients. We enrolled 233 consecutive FM patients (defined according to the 2016 criteria) that did not report clinical signs of autoimmune disorders and followed them for at least one year. The patients were tested for MSA/MAA with immunoblotting. FM patients were seropositive for Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA) in 24% of cases, for MSA in 9%, and for MAA in 6%. A specific diagnosis of CTD was made in 12 patients (5.2%), namely, 5 cases of primary Sjogren's Syndrome and 7 of Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathy. Seropositive patients showed clinical features similar to those who were seronegative at baseline. A CTD diagnosis was associated with ANA positivity (p = 0.03, X2 4.9), the presence of a speckled pattern (p = 0.02, X2 5.3), positivity for MAA (p = 0.004, X2 8.1), and MSA (p = 0.003, X2 9.2). In conclusion, a non-negligible proportion of FM patients may be seropositive for MSA/MAA, and that seropositivity might suggest a diagnosis of CTD.
