36235574|t|Zinc Supplementation Partially Decreases the Harmful Effects of a Cafeteria Diet in Rats but Does Not Prevent Intestinal Dysbiosis.
36235574|a|Zinc (Zn) plays an important role in metabolic homeostasis and may modulate neurological impairment related to obesity. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of Zn supplementation on the intestinal microbiota, fatty acid profile, and neurofunctional parameters in obese male Wistar rats. Rats were fed a cafeteria diet (CAF), composed of ultra-processed and highly caloric and palatable foods, for 20 weeks to induce obesity. From week 16, Zn supplementation was started (10 mg/kg/day). At the end of the experiment, we evaluated the colon morphology, composition of gut microbiota, intestinal fatty acids, integrity of the intestinal barrier and blood-brain barrier (BBB), and neuroplasticity markers in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Obese rats showed dysbiosis, morphological changes, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) reduction, and increased saturated fatty acids in the colon. BBB may also be compromised in CAF-fed animals, as claudin-5 expression is reduced in the cerebral cortex. In addition, synaptophysin was decreased in the hippocampus, which may affect synaptic function. Our findings showed that Zn could not protect obese animals from intestinal dysbiosis. However, an increase in acetate levels was observed, which suggests a partial beneficial effect of Zn. Thus, Zn supplementation may not be sufficient to protect from obesity-related dysfunctions.
