37273654|a|Introduction: Intracerebroventricularly (icv) injected streptozotocin (STZ) is a widely used model for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD)-like pathology, marked by oxidative stress-mediated pathological progression. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a noninvasive technique for brain activity stimulation with the ability to induce long-term potentiation-like plasticity and represents a promising treatment for several neurological diseases, including AD. The present study aims to investigate the effect of the iTBS protocol on the animal model of STZ-induced sAD-like pathology in the context of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-amyloidogenic effects in the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Methods: Male Wistar rats were divided into four experimental groups: control (icv normal saline solution), STZ (icv STZ-3 mg/kg), STZ + iTBS (STZ rats subjected to iTBS protocol), and STZ + Placebo (STZ animals subjected to placebo iTBS noise artifact). Biochemical assays and immunofluorescence microscopy were used to evaluate functional and structural changes. Results: The icv STZ administration induces oxidative stress and attenuates antioxidative capacity in all examined brain regions. iTBS treatment significantly reduced oxidative and nitrosative stress parameters. Also, iTBS decreased Abeta-1-42 and APP levels. The iTBS enhances antioxidative capacity reported as elevated activity of its enzymatic and non-enzymatic components. In addition, iTBS elevated BDNF expression and attenuated STZ-induced astrogliosis confirmed by decreased GFAP+/VIM+/C3+ cell reactivity in the hippocampus. Discussion: Our results provide experimental evidence for the beneficial effects of the applied iTBS protocol in attenuating oxidative stress, increasing antioxidant capacity and decreasing reactive astrogliosis in STZ-administrated rats.
