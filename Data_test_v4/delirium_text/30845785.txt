30845785|t|Association of Glucose Fluctuations with Sarcopenia in Older Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
30845785|a|Type 2 diabetes mellitus accelerates loss of muscle mass and strength. Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) also show these conditions, even in the early stages of AD. The mechanism linking glucose management with these muscle changes has not been elucidated but has implications for clarifying these associations and developing preventive strategies to maintain functional capacity. This study included 69 type 2 diabetes patients with a diagnosis of cognitive impairment (n = 32) and patients with normal cognition (n = 37). We investigated the prevalence of sarcopenia in diabetes patients with and without cognitive impairment and examined the association of glucose alterations with sarcopenia. Daily glucose levels were evaluated using self-monitoring of blood glucose, and we focused on the effects of glucose fluctuations, postprandial hyperglycemia, and the frequency of hypoglycemia on sarcopenia. Diabetes patients with cognitive impairment displayed a high prevalence of sarcopenia, and glucose fluctuations were independently associated with sarcopenia, even after adjusting for glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and associated factors. In particular, glucose fluctuations were significantly associated with a low muscle mass, low grip strength, and slow walking speed. Our observation suggests the importance of glucose management by considering glucose fluctuations to prevent the development of disability.
