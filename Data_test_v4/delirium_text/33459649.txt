33459649|a|BACKGROUND: Neurofibrillary pathology of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau spreads along neuroanatomical connections, underlying the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The propagation of tau pathology to axonally connected brain regions inevitably involves trafficking of seeding-competent tau within the axonal compartment of the neuron. OBJECTIVE: To determine the seeding activity of tau in cerebral gray and white matters of AD. METHODS: Levels of total tau, hyperphosphorylation of tau, and SDS- and beta-mercaptoethanol-resistant high molecular weight tau (HMW-tau) in crude extracts from gray and white matters of AD frontal lobes were analyzed by immuno-blots. Tau seeding activity was quantitatively assessed by measuring RIPA buffer-insoluble tau in HEK-293FT/tau151-391 cells treated with brain extracts. RESULTS: We found a comparable level of soluble tau in gray matter versus white matter of control brains, but a higher level of soluble tau in gray matter than white matter of AD brains. In AD brains, tau is hyperphosphorylated in both gray and white matters, with a higher level in the former. The extracts of both gray and white matters of AD brains seeded tau aggregation in HEK-293FT/tau151-391 cells but the white matter showed less potency. Seeding activity of tau in brain extracts was positively correlated with the levels of tau hyperphosphorylation and HMW-tau. RIPA-insoluble tau, but not RIPA-soluble tau, was hyperphosphorylated tau at multiple sites. CONCLUSION: Both gray and white matters of AD brain contain seeding-competent tau that can template aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau, but the seeding potency is markedly higher in gray matter than in white matter.
