38019989|t|A facile approach to create sensitive and selective Cu(ii) sensors on carbon fiber microelectrodes.
38019989|a|A facile platform derived from deposition of ethynyl linkers on carbon fiber microelectrodes has been developed for sensitive and selective sensing of Cu(ii). This study is the first to demonstrate the successful anodic deposition of ethynyl linkers, specifically 1,4-diethynylbenzene, onto carbon fiber microelectrodes. Multi-scan deposition of DEB on these microelectrodes resulted in an increased sensitivity and selectivity towards Cu(ii) that persists amidst other divalent interferents and displays sustained performance over four days while stored at room temperature. This method can be extended to other ethynyl terminal moieties, thereby creating a versatile chemical platform that will enable improved sensitivity and selectivity for a new frontier of biomarker measurement.
