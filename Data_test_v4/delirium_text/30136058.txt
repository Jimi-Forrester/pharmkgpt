30136058|a|Association of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with cerebral glucose hypometabolism, likely due to impairments of insulin signaling, has been reported recently, with encouraging results when additional insulin is provided to AD patients. Here, we tested the potential effects of the anti-diabetic vanadium, vanadyl (IV) acetylacetonate (VAC), on AD in vitro and in vivo models. The experimental results showed that VAC at sub-micromolar concentrations improved the viability of neural cells with or without increased beta-amyloid (Abeta) burden; and in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, VAC treatment (0.1 mmol kg-1 d-1) preserved cognitive function and attenuated neuron loss, but did not reduce brain Abeta plaques. Further studies revealed that VAC attenuated Abeta pathogenesis by (i) activation of the PPARgamma-AMPK signal transduction pathway, leading to improved glucose and energy metabolism; (ii) up-regulation of the expression of glucose-regulated protein 75 (Grp75), thus suppressing p53-mediated neuronal apoptosis under Abeta-related stresses; and (iii) decreasing toxic soluble Abeta peptides. Overall, our work suggested that vanadyl complexes may have great potential for effective therapeutic treatment of AD.
