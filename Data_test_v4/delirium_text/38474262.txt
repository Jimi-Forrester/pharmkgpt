38474262|t|Targeted RNAseq Revealed the Gene Expression Signature of Ferroptosis-Related Processes Associated with Disease Severity in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis.
38474262|a|Detrimental molecular processes in multiple sclerosis (MS) lead to the cellular accumulation of lipid peroxidation products and iron in the CNS, which represents the main driving force for ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, with proposed roles in neurodegeneration, oligodendrocyte loss and neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of MS. Ferroptosis-related gene expression signature and molecular markers, which could reflect MS severity and progression, are currently understudied in humans. To tackle these challenges, we have applied a curated approach to create and experimentally analyze a comprehensive panel of ferroptosis-related genes covering a wide range of biological processes associated with ferroptosis. We performed the first ferroptosis-related targeted RNAseq on PBMCs from highly distinctive MS phenotype groups: mild relapsing-remitting (RR) (n = 24) and severe secondary progressive (SP) (n = 24), along with protein detection of GPX4 and products of lipid peroxidation (MDA and 4-HNE). Out of 138 genes, 26 were differentially expressed genes (DEGs), indicating changes in both pro- and anti-ferroptotic genes, representing a molecular signature associated with MS severity. The top three DEGs, as non-core ferroptosis genes, CDKN1A, MAP1B and EGLN2, were replicated by qPCR to validate findings in independent patient groups (16 RR and 16 SP MS). Co-expression and interactions of DEGs were presented as additional valuable assets for deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms and key targets related to MS severity. Our study integrates a wide genetic signature and biochemical markers related to ferroptosis in easily obtainable PBMCs of MS patients with clinical data and disease severity, thus providing novel molecular markers which can complement disease-related changes in the brain and undergo further research as potential therapeutic targets.
