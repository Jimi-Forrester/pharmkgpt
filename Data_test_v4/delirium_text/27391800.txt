27391800|t|Interrelationship between Changes in the Amyloid beta 42/40 Ratio and Presenilin 1 Conformation.
27391800|a|The ratio of the longer (i.e., Abeta42/Abeta43) to shorter (i.e. Abeta40) species is a critical factor determining amyloid fibril formation, neurotoxicity and progression of the amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease. The relative levels of the different Abeta species are affected by activity and conformation of the gamma-secretase complex catalytic component - presenilin 1 (PS1). The enzyme exists in a dynamic equilibrium of the conformational states, with so-called "close" conformation associated with the shift of the gamma-secretase cleavage towards the production of longer, neurotoxic Abeta species. In the current study, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, spectral Forster resonance energy transfer, calcium imaging and cytotoxicity assays were utilized to explore reciprocal link between the Abeta42 and Abeta40 peptides present at various ratios and PS1 conformation in primary neurons. We report that exposure to Abeta peptides at a relatively high ratio of Abeta42/40 causes conformational change within the PS1 subdomain architecture towards the pathogenic "closed" state. Mechanistically, the Abeta42/40 peptides present at the relatively high ratio increase intracellular calcium levels, which were shown to trigger pathogenic PS1 conformation. This indicates that there is a reciprocal crosstalk between the extracellular Abeta peptides and PS1 conformation within a neuron, with Abeta40 showing some protective effect. The pathogenic shift within the PS1 domain architecture may further shift the production of Abeta peptides towards the longer, neurotoxic Abeta species. These findings link elevated calcium, Abeta42 and PS1/gamma-secretase conformation, and offer possible mechanistic explanation of the impending exacerbation of the amyloid pathology.
