OBJECTIVES: Survey the presence and relevance of SOPs for palliative care (PC) within the network of German Comprehensive Cancer Centers (CCCs) funded by the German Cancer Aid. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a descriptive survey, palliative care services within 15 CCCs funded by the German Cancer Aid were asked to rate availability and thematic relevance of (1) symptom-related, (2) clinical pathways and (3) measures- and processes-oriented SOPs using a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: Pain management SOPs were the most common (n =11; 73 %). The most thematic relevance showed SOPs dedicated to pain management, care in the last days of life and delirium and other neuro-psychiatric diseases (each n =13; 87 %), followed by bowel obstruction, dyspnoea, nausea and palliative sedation (each n =12; 80 %). CONCLUSIONS: There is a wide gap between availability and perceived relevance of palliative care SOPs within the network of German CCCs funded by the German Cancer Aid. It is obvious that there is a need for further development of relevant SOPs in palliative care.
