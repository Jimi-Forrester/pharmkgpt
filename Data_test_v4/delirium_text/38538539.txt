38538539|t|Two Undescribed Germacrane-Type Sesquiterpenoids from Salvia cavaleriei var. simplicifolia Stib. and Their Anti-Alzheimer's Disease Activity.
38538539|a|Two undescribed germacrane-type sesquiterpenoids, salcasins A (1) and B (2), together with three known compounds (3-5) were isolated and identified from the whole plant of Salvia cavaleriei var. simplicifolia Stib. The structures of the undescribed compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic methods, such as HR-ESI-MS, 1D and 2D NMR data. The relative configurations of 1 and 2 were established by analyzing their NOESY spectra as well as by 13C NMR calculations with DP4+ probability analyses. The absolute configurations of 1 and 2 were determined by comparing experimental and calculated ECD spectra. Furthermore, the in vivo anti-Alzheimer's disease activities of 1-5 were evaluated using Caenorhabditis elegans AD pathological model. Among all isolated compounds, salcasin A (1) significantly delayed AD-like symptoms of worm paralysis, which may be a potential anti-AD candidate agent.
