19935495|a|Diagnostic recognition and distinguishing of psychotropic side effects which are phenomenological Identical/similar to symptoms and/or signs of psychiatric disorders undergoing psychotropic treatment, is an integral element within the general diagnostic procedure. Unrecognising and undistinguishing of psychotropic-induced side effects from psychopathological phenomena and/or physical signs which are, according to relevant classification criteria, standard parts of psychiatric disorders, most frequently can cause increase the dose of the psychotropic medication, assigning of the unwarranted diagnoses, and/or addition of unnecessary medications. Some of the most frequent side effects that can be caused by the diagnostic difficulties and/or misjudgements of the phenomenological recognition and differentiating side effects from psychiatric symptoms and signs are: drug-induced akathisia, intensive anticholinergic pharmacodynamic effects including delirium, neuroleptic induced Parkinsonism, paradoxically antidepressants-induced worsening or re-emerging depression, acute dystonia and tardive dyskinesia and others. In conclusion, differential diagnosis of these side effects requires careful evaluation based on clinical experience and knowledge.
