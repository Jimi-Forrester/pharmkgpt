33422543|a|AIMS: Memantine is a non-competitive antagonist of glutamatergic NMDA receptor that is mainly used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The excitatory toxicity mediated by glutamate via glutamatergic receptor signals is considered to be one of the mechanisms mediating neuronal injury and cognitive impairment after exposure to a hypoxic environment at a high altitude. Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that inhibiting glutamate signaling using memantine could alleviate neuronal injury and cognitive impairment in rats exposed to chronic hypoxia. MAIN METHODS: we made animal models in the natural environment of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau at an altitude of 4300 m, and used animal behavior, morphology, molecular biology and other methods to evaluate the impact of chronic hypoxia exposure on cognitive function and the neuroprotective effect of Memantine. KEY FINDINGS: Our results showed that the expression of NMDA receptors increased, while the expression of AMPA receptors decreased, after 4 weeks of chronic hypoxia exposure. Concomitantly, apoptotic neuronal cell death in the hippocampus and frontal cortex was significantly increased, along with levels of oxidative stress, whereas innate ability to inhibit free radicals decreased. Moreover, after 8 weeks of hypoxia exposure, learning, memory, and space exploration abilities were significantly decreased. Notably, after treatment with memantine, apoptotic neuronal cell death, oxidative stress, and free radical levels decreased, and the cognitive function of the animals improved. SIGNIFICANCE: Present study shows that chronic hypoxia can produce the excitatory toxicity leading to neural injury and cognitive impairment that can be suppressed with memantine treatment by inhibiting excitatory toxicity.
