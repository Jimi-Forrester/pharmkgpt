32736325|t|Fixel-based analysis reveals fiber-specific alterations during the progression of Parkinson's disease.
32736325|a|Disruption of brain circuits is one of the core mechanisms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Understanding structural connection alterations in PD is important for effective treatment. However, due to methodological limitations, most studies were unable to account for confounding factors such as crossing fibers and were unable to identify damages to specific fiber tracts. In the present study, we aimed to demonstrate tract-specific white matter structural changes in PD patients and their relationship with clinical symptoms. Ninety-eight PD patients, divided into early (ES) and middle stage (MS) groups, and 76 healthy controls (HCs) underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging scans and clinical assessments. Fixel-based analysis was used to investigate fiber tract alterations in PD patients. Compared to HCs, the PD patients showed decreased fiber density (FD) in the corpus callosum (CC), increased FD in the cortical spinal tract (CST), and increased fiber-bundle cross-section (FC, log-transformed: log-FC) in the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant differences in FD in the CST and log-FC in the SCP among the three groups. Post-hoc analysis revealed that the mean FD values of the CST were higher in ES and MS patient groups compared to HCs, and the mean log-FC values of the SCP were higher in ES and MS patient groups compared to HCs. Additionally, the FD values of the CC in PD patients were negatively correlated with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part-III (UPDRS-III) scores (r = -0.257, p = 0.032), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17 Items (HAMD-17) scores (r = -0.230, p = 0.033), and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) scores (r = -0.248, p = 0.032). Moreover, log-FC values of the SCP (r = 0.274, p = 0.028) and FD values of the CST (r = 0.384, p < 0.001) were positively correlated with the UPDRS-III scores. We concluded that PD patients had both decreased and increased white matter integrity within specific fiber bundles. Additionally, these white matter alterations were different across disease stages, suggesting the occurrence of complex pathological and compensatory changes during the development of PD.
