37725634|t|Hypotension and cognitive impairment among the elderly: Evidence from the CLHLS.
37725634|a|BACKGROUND: While high blood pressure has been linked to cognitive impairment, the relationship between low blood pressure, especially hypotension, and cognitive impairment has not been well studied. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of hypotension and cognitive impairment in the seniors of China, and the association between hypotension and cognitive function impairment. METHODS: The data was derived from the 2018 wave of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). Systolic blood pressures (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP) were measured by objective examination. The Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (CMMSE) was used to evaluate the cognitive impairment of the elderly. Generalized linear models were conducted to evaluate the association of hypotension with cognitive impairment. RESULTS: The prevalence of hypotension and cognitive impairment in the Chinese elderly were 0.76% and 22.06%, respectively. Participants with hypotension, lower SBP, and lower DBP, had odds ratios of 1.62, 1.38, and 1.48 for cognitive impairment, respectively. Besides, the CMMSE scores decreased by 2.08, 0.86, and 1.08 in the elderly with hypotension, lower SBP, and DBP, compared with those with non-hypotension, higher SBP, and DBP, respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the association of cognitive impairment with hypotension was stronger in Chinese elderly who had decreased activity of daily living. Moreover, there was statistical evidence of a nonlinear dose-response relationship of SBP and DBP with cognitive impairment (Pnonlinear < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Hypotension was a potential risk factor for cognitive impairment of the Chinese elderly, especially for those having decreased activity of daily living. Blood pressure management should be conducted to prevent them from cognitive impairment.
