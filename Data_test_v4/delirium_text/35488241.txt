35488241|a|BACKGROUND: It is very important to determine the indication of mold radiotherapy for the radical treatment of oral cancer. We investigated eight patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma who were treated by radical irradiation with mold radiotherapy using a customized device. METHODS: The subject is a case of curable superficial oral cancer of a few millimeters, or cancer of a size that can be cured by the placement of the radiation source. Of the eight patients, six were male and two were female, aged 64-93 years (mean, 78.9 years; median, 73.5 years). The primary sites were the buccal mucosa in three cases, gingiva in two cases, and floor of the mouth, soft palate, and lower lip in one case each. Five cases were in the T1 stage, and the remaining three cases were in T2. With respect to thickness, seven cases were of the superficial type and could not be detected by magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, and the remaining case showed a tumor thickness of 7.5 mm. All cases were diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma by biopsy. Radical irradiation using mold radiotherapy was planned for all eight patients. Irradiation was delivered in 9-10 sessions, with a total dose of 45-50 Gy. RESULTS: Complete response was attained in six of the eight patients and partial response was observed in two patients, requiring additional treatment. CONCLUSION: Since all patients with complete response had superficial cancers, we hypothesized that superficial cancers of the oral cavity with thicknesses of few millimeters could be indicated for mold irradiation. This method can be applied in complicated cases and older patients in whom surgery or chemotherapy may not be feasible. We believe that the results of our clinical studies will be of great help in choosing this method.
