36504990|a|Background: Lead hazards are ubiquitous in the environment, and lead exposure has been proved to damage human health. Nevertheless, there is limited data on the global burden of diseases attributable to lead exposure. In this study, we evaluated the temporal-spatial trend of disease burden caused by lead exposure in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. Methods: Based on Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019, deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and DALYs rate (ASDR) were estimated by region, country, sex and age. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to assess the temporal trends of ASMR and ASDR between 1990 and 2019. Results: Global deaths increased from 0.53 (95% UI: 0.31, 0.77) to 0.90 (95% UI: 0.55, 1.29) million, and the number of DALYs increased from 16.02 (95% UI: 10.32, 22.17) to 21.68 (95% UI: 13.81, 30.30) million between 1990 and 2019. China, India and Bangladesh were top three countries with the largest number of deaths and DALYs in 2019. The ASMR (per 100,000 population) decreased from 14.47 (95% UI: 8.40, 21.43) to 11.48 (95% UI: 7.00, 16.49) with EAPC of -0.75 (95% UI: -0.87, -0.64), and the ASDR (per 100,000 population) decreased from 378.01 (95% UI: 240.55, 524.18) to 267.52 (95% UI: 170.57, 373.44) with EAPC of -1.19 (95% UI: -1.32, -1.07). Most of disease burden of lead exposure occurred in the men and elderly population. Stroke and ischemic heart disease were two key sources of disease burden of lead exposure. Also, a negative association between sociodemographic index (SDI) and disease burden of lead exposure was observed. Conclusions: Lead exposure poses a significant disease burden globally, and is still a great threat to public health. Primary prevention measures of reducing lead exposure in the environment are essential.
