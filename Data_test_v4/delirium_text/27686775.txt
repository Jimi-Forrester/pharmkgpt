27686775|a|Parkinson's disease(PD)was the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. Incidence of PD was ascending year by year. The etiology of PD is poorly understood, involving aging, genetic and environmental factors. Recently, environmental compound had attracted more and more research interest. Studies and extrapolation from epidemiology, animal experiments and cell culture suggested that environmental compound had involved in the molecular mechanisms including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, microglia activation, abnormal aggregation of alpha-synuclein and autophagy damage ,which seemed to increase PD risk.
