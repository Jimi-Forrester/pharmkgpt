39544104|t|The Italian guideline on diagnosis and treatment of dementia and mild cognitive impairment.
39544104|a|INTRODUCTION: Approximately 2 million people in Italy are currently living with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 4 million are involved as family members or caregivers. Considering the significant impact of dementia, the Italian Ministry of Health entrusted the Italian National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanita) with the development of a guideline within the Italian National Guideline System (Sistema Nazionale Linee Guida, SNLG) on the diagnosis and treatment of dementia and MCI. The main objective was to provide evidence-based recommendations aimed at reducing the variability and ensuring the appropriateness of clinical practices throughout the whole care process from identification and diagnosis to the end of life for people with dementia (PwD) or MCI and their families/caregivers. METHODS: The GRADE-ADOLOPMENT approach was used to adopt, adapt and update the guideline developed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in 2018 (NG97). The methodology was based on the Methodological Handbook produced by the SNLG. A multidisciplinary panel of 29 experts and four representatives of family members/caregivers discussed and approved 47 review questions. Of these, 34 questions were adopted from the NG97, and 13 were new questions, including 10 questions referring to MCI. Systematic literature reviews were performed for each question, and a team of methodological and clinical experts qualitatively assessed and summarised results from included studies based on the GRADE approach. To facilitate the implementation and dissemination of the contents of this guideline, a care pathway and a leaflet dedicated to PwD or MCI and their families/caregivers were also developed. RESULTS: The literature review for this guideline included studies published up to November 2023. More than 1000 peer-reviewed publications were included, covering the following areas: (i) identification, diagnosis and post-diagnostic support; (ii) care models and care coordination; (iii) pharmacological interventions for cognitive symptoms; (iv) non-pharmacological interventions for cognitive symptoms; (v) non-cognitive symptoms, intercurrent illnesses and palliative care. The multidisciplinary panel discussed and approved 167 clinical practice recommendations and 39 research recommendations. COMMENTARY: Italy's first National Guideline on dementia and MCI addresses diagnosis, treatment and care within the National Healthcare System. It includes recommendations on pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches, and emphasises tailored interventions, comprehensive cognitive assessment, staff training and palliative care. The guideline also underlines the need to involve PwD in decision-making and supporting caregivers throughout the entire course of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Structured strategies for the dissemination and implementation of the guideline will be defined within the Italian Fund for Alzheimer and other Dementias 2024-2026. An interactive care pathway and a leaflet dedicated to PwD and their carers are already available. The guideline will be updated starting January 2027, but early updates may be planned in case of breakthrough advancements.
