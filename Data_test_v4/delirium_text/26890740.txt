26890740|a|BACKGROUND: While longitudinal studies have investigated the relationships between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subtypes and dementia subtypes, the results have been contradictory. In addition, some research shows that depression accompanied by MCI might increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to longitudinally investigate the relationships between MCI subtypes and dementia subtypes, with special attention to the effect of comorbid depressive symptoms in a Japanese rural community. METHODS: Non-demented participants (n = 802) completed a baseline and follow-up study. Outcomes were conversion to dementia especially AD, MCI, or no conversion. A complementary log-log analysis was conducted to investigate the risk of dementia and AD in amnestic MCI (aMCI) compared to nonamnestic MCI (naMCI) groups. The impact of depressive symptoms on the transition from MCI to AD and from cognitively normal to MCI or AD was also analyzed. RESULTS: The risk of developing dementia, in particular AD, for the aMCI group was significantly higher than that for the naMCI group. In the aMCI group, the presence of depressive symptoms increased the risk of developing AD, but depressive symptoms in the naMCI group did not. In the cognitively normal group, the presence of depressive symptoms increased the risk of aMCI but not naMCI or AD. CONCLUSION: MCI subtyping could be useful in finding a prodrome for dementia and in particular for AD. The differing impacts of depressive symptoms on the development of AD suggest that the relationship between depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment could differ in aMCI and naMCI patients.
