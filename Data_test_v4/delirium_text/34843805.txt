34843805|a|BACKGROUND: Emergence Delirium (ED) is a combination of disturbance of perception and psychomotor agitation that is common in pediatric patients after general anesthesia, especially at preschool age. Since the effect of ED on the length of stay has been studied in adults but infrequently in children, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between ED and length of stay in this population. METHODS: A single center, retrospective, observational study was carried out in children who underwent tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. The Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale was used to assess ED. In addition to the time to hospital discharge (time frame 24 hours), drugs used, comorbidities, early postoperative complications, and pain were investigated if potentially associated with the complication. RESULTS: Four hundred sixteen children aged from 1.5 to 10 years (183 female, 233 male) were included. ED occurred in 25.5% of patients (n = 106). Patients were divided into the ED group and the No-ED group. The discharge time was similar in both groups. No significant differences were observed in the frequency of postoperative complications. The use of fentanyl or dexmedetomidine did not affect ED occurrence. The frequency of pain was greater in the ED group, both in the recovery room and in the ward (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of ED in children after tonsillectomy/adenotonsillectomy did not extend the length of stay.
