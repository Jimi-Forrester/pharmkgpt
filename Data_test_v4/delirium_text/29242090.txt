29242090|a|BACKGROUND: Essential hypertension (EHTN) is emerging as one of the most prevalent disorder with high rate of complications, morbidity and mortality. Brahmi vati, an Ayurvedic medicine is explored for its efficacy in the management of EHTN. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of Brahmi vati and sarpagandha Ghana vati in the management of EHTN. METHODS: Total 68 patients meeting the JNC 7 criteria of EHTN of age group 20 to 60 years of either sex participated in the study. They were randomly divided into two groups, group A received capsule Brahmi vati 500 mg and group B capsule Sarpagandha Ghana vati 500 mg respectively twice a day for 30 days. Assessments were done through various variables like systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), lipid profiles, Hamilton anxiety rating scale, 2 weeks sleep diary, serum creatinine, hemoglobin, total leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Follow up visit was on every 15th day. RESULTS: Study showed that both Brahmi vati and Sarpagandha Ghanavati produced improvement in most of the variables and were comparable. Improvements were seen in various variables like SBP, DBP, MAP, Hamilton anxiety rating scale, subjective sleep profiles and total cholesterol. However Brahmi vati showed increase in weight and Body Mass Index (BMI). SarpagandhaGhanavati produced reduction in total cholesterol and LDL. Both groups showed good safety profile evaluated through the assessment of serum creatinine levels. CONCLUSION: Clinical efficacy of Sarpagandha Ghana vati and Brahmi vati on EHTN showed that both were effective, safe and comparable.
