38410515|t|Cognition-associated long noncoding RNAs are dysregulated upon severe COVID-19.
38410515|a|Severe COVID-19 leads to widespread transcriptomic changes in the human brain, mimicking diminished cognitive performance. As long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in the regulation of gene expression, identification of the lncRNAs differentially expressed upon COVID-19 may nominate key regulatory nodes underpinning cognitive changes. Here we identify hundreds of lncRNAs differentially expressed in the brains of COVID-19 patients relative to uninfected age/sex-matched controls, many of which are associated with decreased cognitive performance and inflammatory cytokine response. Our analyses reveal pervasive transcriptomic changes in lncRNA expression upon severe COVID-19, which may serve as key regulators of neurocognitive changes in the brain.
