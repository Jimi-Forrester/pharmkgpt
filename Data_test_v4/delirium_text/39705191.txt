39705191|a|A subpopulation of astrocytes expressing WD Repeat Domain 49 (WDR49) was recently identified in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with GRN pathogenic variants. This is the first study to investigate their expression and relation to pathology in other FTLD subtypes and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In a postmortem cohort of TDP-43 proteinopathies (12 GRN, 11 C9orf72, 9 sporadic TDP-43), tauopathies (13 MAPT, 8 sporadic tau), 10 AD, and four controls, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were performed for WDR49 and pathological inclusions on frontal, temporal, and occipital cortical sections. WDR49-positive cell counts (adjusted per mm2) were examined and related to digitally quantified percentage areas of TDP-43/tau pathology and semiquantitative scores of neurodegeneration. Quantitative colocalization analysis of WDR49 and pathological inclusions was done. WDR49-positive astrocytes were present across FTLD subtypes and AD in the brain parenchyma and (peri-)vascular space, with distinct morphological patterns, and were particularly enriched in gray matter. In controls, sporadic WDR49-positive cells were found enveloping vessels. WDR49-positive astrocytes were most abundant in the frontal cortex (FC) of GRN cases and temporal cortex in GRN, AD, and sporadic primary tauopathy. In the occipital cortex, only a few cells were found across groups. WDR49-positive astrocyte counts positively correlated with the severity of neurodegeneration and TDP-43 pathology but not tauopathy. Furthermore, in frontotemporal cortices, WDR49 partly colocalized with TDP-43 (14%-21%) and tau (31%-45%). In conclusion, WDR49 is a marker for a subset of astrocytes with different morphologies across FTLD and AD, reflecting the severity of neurodegeneration. These astrocytes may become activated in neurodegeneration in response to pathological damage and migrate from the vessel wall to the parenchyma.
