29304399|t|Establishment of induced pluripotent stem cell line (ZZUi009-A) from an Alzheimer's disease patient carrying a PSEN1 gene mutation.
29304399|a|Skin fibroblasts were obtained from a 42-year-old Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient carrying mutations in the PSEN1 gene. An iPSC line was successfully established using the Sendai-virus (SeV) delivery system. The patient-specific iPSCs were free of genomically integrated reprogramming genes, had the specific mutation, expressed the expected pluripotency markers, and had the potential to differentiate into cells of all three germ layers. Our model might offer a robust platform for further study of the pathomechanism of this disease as well as drug testing and gene therapy studies.
