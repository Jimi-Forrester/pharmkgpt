34639856|a|The aim of the present study was to estimate the risk of dementia in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), using a population cohort. Data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort for the population >=60 years of age from 2002 to 2013 were collected. A total of 11,432 individuals with dementia were matched for age, sex, income, region of residence, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia with 45,728 individuals comprising the control group. The crude (simple) and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of dementia in BPPV patients were analyzed using non-conditional logistic regression analyses. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to age and sex. A history of BPPV characterized 5.3% (609/11,432) of the dementia group and 2.6% (1,194/45,728) of the control group (p < 0.001). The adjusted OR of dementia for BPPV was 1.14 (95% CI = 1.03-1.26, p = 0.009). In subgroup analyses according to age and sex, males had higher ORs of dementia for BPPV. BPPV increases the risk of dementia in the 60 years of age or older population.
