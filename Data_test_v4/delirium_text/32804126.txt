32804126|a|BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial dysfunction and tau aggregation occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and exposing cells or rodents to mitochondrial toxins alters their tau. OBJECTIVE: To further explore how mitochondria influence tau, we measured tau oligomer levels in human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells with different mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) manipulations. METHODS: Specifically, we analyzed cells undergoing ethidium bromide-induced acute mtDNA depletion, rho0 cells with chronic mtDNA depletion, and cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) cell lines containing mtDNA from AD subjects. RESULTS: We found cytochrome oxidase activity was particularly sensitive to acute mtDNA depletion, evidence of metabolic re-programming in the rho0 cells, and a relatively reduced mtDNA content in cybrids generated through AD subject mitochondrial transfer. In each case tau oligomer levels increased, and acutely depleted and AD cybrid cells also showed a monomer to oligomer shift. CONCLUSION: We conclude a cell's mtDNA affects tau oligomerization. Overlapping tau changes across three mtDNA-manipulated models establishes the reproducibility of the phenomenon, and its presence in AD cybrids supports its AD-relevance.
