28106562|a|BACKGROUND: Plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels have rarely been investigated in type 2 diabetes despite its known associations with Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: To compare blood plasma Abeta concentrations (Abeta40 and Abeta42) in cognitively normal individuals with and without type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Plasma Abeta40 and Abeta42 were measured in 194 participants with diabetes recruited from the community-based Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II cohort (mean age 71 years, 59% males) and 194 age-, sex-, and APOEe4 allele-matched, control subjects without diabetes from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study using a multiplex microsphere-based immunoassay. RESULTS: Plasma Abeta40 and Abeta42 were normally distributed in the controls but were bimodal in the participants with diabetes. Median Abeta40 and Abeta42 concentrations were significantly lower in those with type 2 diabetes (Abeta40 median [inter-quartile range]: 125.0 [52.6-148.3] versus 149.3 [134.0-165.6] pg/mL; Abeta42: 26.9 [14.5-38.3] versus 33.6 [28.0-38.9] pg/mL, both p < 0.001) while the ratio Abeta42:Abeta40 was significantly higher (0.26 [0.23-0.32] versus 0.22 [0.19-0.25], p < 0.001). After adjustment, participants with diabetes and plasma Abeta40 levels in the low peak of the bimodal distribution were significantly more likely to have normal to high estimated glomerular filtration rates (odds ratio (95% CI): 2.40 (1.20-4.80), p = 0.013) although the group with diabetes had lower renal function overall. CONCLUSION: Type 2 diabetes is associated with altered plasma concentrations of Abeta peptides and is an important source of variation that needs to be taken into account when considering plasma Abeta peptides as biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.
