39071583|t|Trends and hot spots in research related to aqueous humor from 2014 to 2023: A bibliometric analysis.
39071583|a|Purpose: To analyze publication trends and investigate research hotspots of aqueous humor (AH) studies. Methods: A bibliometric study was conducted based on the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC). VOSviewer v. 1.6.18 was utilized to create a knowledge map visualizing the number of annual publications, the distribution of countries, international collaborations, author productivity, source journals and keywords in the field. Results: A grand total of 4020 peer-reviewed papers concerning AH were retrieved from 2014 to 2023. The United States of America secured the top position among the most published countries and Duke University emerged as the most active institution. Stamer, WD contributed the most papers in this area. Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science was the most prolific journal in AH research. Retrieved publications mainly concentrated on the correlation between AH as a biomarker carrier and different ocular disorders. Six clusters were formed based on the keywords: (1) the diagnosis of endophthalmitis and AH pharmacokinetics; (2) the association of AH with pathogenesis and prognosis of glaucoma; (3) diagnosis and treatment of AH associated with uveitis; (4) the relationship between AH and refractive diseases of the eye; (5) the association of AH with mechanism and biomarkers of ocular tumorigenesis; (6) the indicators of AH associated with fundus disease. Conclusions: This study unveiled present patterns of global collaboration, emerging frontiers, fundamental knowledge, research hotspots and current trends in AH.
