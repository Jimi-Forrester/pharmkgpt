10783429|t|Advances in pain management for older adult patients.
10783429|a|Management of pain is crucial to the success of any program of care and support for dying patients and their families. Pain can be controlled in more than 90% of older adults. Components of an effective program include comprehensive, repeated pain assessment; detection and treatment of complicating medical and psychological disorders (e.g., delirium); spiritual concerns; and the judicious use of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies, radiation, and radiopharmaceuticals. Strategies that enable clinicians to prevent and treat the expected complications of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and opioid therapies are reviewed. Strategies to change opioid agents or routes to minimize opioid-induced side effects and to provide effective pain relief as death nears are presented.
