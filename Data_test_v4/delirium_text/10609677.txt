10609677|t|Epidemiology of vascular dementia: some results despite research limitations.
10609677|a|Vascular dementia, the second most common dementia after Alzheimer disease, has great potential for prevention and treatment. Epidemiological data provide the basis for planning primary prevention and clinical trials. Nevertheless, general consensus on disease definition and diagnostic criteria are still not well defined.
