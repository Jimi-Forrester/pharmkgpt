39334773|t|Effects and Mechanisms of Lutein on Aging and Age-Related Diseases.
39334773|a|Aging and age-related diseases are serious public health issues that are receiving growing attention from researchers. Lutein has a critical function in the prevention and management of these issues. Possible mechanisms mainly include suppressing inflammation and oxidative stress, regulating cell activity, and modulating the levels of toxic substances. In this narrative review paper, we sum up the most current developments in the study of the effects of lutein on aging and five age-related diseases (age-related macular degeneration, cataracts, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and osteoporosis), and fundamental mechanisms are reviewed. The bioavailability of lutein and the strategies to improve its bioavailability are discussed. This piece of work can bring a clearer comprehension of the protective effects of lutein against aging and age-related diseases and can be also helpful for developing lutein as functional food and dietary supplements for these age-related diseases.
