11287729|a|Over the past few years, molecular biological research has considerably deepened our understanding of the pathophysiological basis of Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Although different genetic origins of the disease have been identified, all of the findings point to a common terminal sequence in familial AD. This consists of an increased production of beta-amyloid peptides from beta-amyloid precursor protein. For the cases of sporadic AD, which far outweigh the number of cases of familial AD, an impaired catabolism of the beta-amyloid peptides may also be pathophysiologically decisive according to the latest findings. Research into the molecular level of AD makes it possible to identify points of attack for rational drug treatment of the disease, while molecular markers of AD are increasingly being used as a part of early and differential neurochemical diagnostics.
