30310529|a|Cyanobacteria have been recognized as a source of bioactive molecules to be employed in nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, and functional foods. An extract of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (AFA), commercialized as Klamin , was subjected to chemical analysis to determine its compounds. The AFA extract Klamin  resulted to be nontoxic, also at high doses, when administered onto LAN5 neuronal cells. Its scavenging properties against ROS generation were evaluated by using DCFH-DA assay, and its mitochondrial protective role was determined by JC-1 and MitoSOX assays. Klamin  exerts a protective role against beta amyloid- (Abeta-) induced toxicity and against oxidative stress. Anti-inflammatory properties were demonstrated by NFbetaB nuclear localization and activation of IL-6 and IL-1beta inflammatory cytokines through ELISA. Finally, by using thioflavin T (ThT) and fluorimetric measures, we found that Klamin  interferes with Abeta aggregation kinetics, supporting the formation of smaller and nontoxic structures compared to toxic Abeta aggregates alone. Altogether, these data indicate that the AFA extract may play a protective role against mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration.
