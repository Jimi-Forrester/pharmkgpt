36855268|t|Incidence and Clinical Features of Venous Thromboembolism in Inpatients with Mental Illness.
36855268|a|AIMS: We investigated the incidence and clinical features of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in inpatients with mental illnesses. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed records of inpatients with mental illnesses and confirmed VTE at The First Hospital of Hebei Medical University between August 2018 and July 2022. We recorded demographic characteristics, psychosis-related conditions, and thrombus distribution. RESULTS: Among 12939 patients diagnosed with mental illness, 156 (1.21%) presented with VTE at the first visit or during the disease course. Crude VTE incidence varied significantly across mental illnesses, being highest in patients with organic mental disorders (5.20%), followed by emotional disorders (1.10%), and others (P < 0.001). Distal and proximal deep venous thromboses (DVT) occurred in 79.17% and 20.84% of patients, respectively. The Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) score was higher in patients with proximal DVT than in those with distal DVT (P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, the HAMD score (odds ratio [OR] 1.173, confidence interval [CI] 1.100-1.251, P<0.001) was a risk factor and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) (OR 0.862, CI 0.796-0.934, P<0.001), a protective factor against DVT progression. CONCLUSION: VTE is not rare in patients with mental illnesses and is most commonly associated with organic mental disorders. Psychosis-related DVT typically shows a significantly high incidence of distal DVT. Prevention and early treatment in patients with severe depression and distal DVT can prevent DVT aggravation.
