29254282|a|5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) is an important neurotransmitter in the modulation of the cognitive, behavioral and psychological functions in animals and humans. Among the fourteen subtypes of 5-HT receptor, 5-HT1A receptor has been extensively studied. Tandospirone, an azapirone derivative with strong and selective agonist effect on 5-HT1A receptor, has been used for the treatment of anxiety disorders especially generalized anxiety disorder for decades. Recently, tandospirone showed the efficacy in relieving the syndromes of social anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder as well as in potentiating the effect of antidepressants in the treatment of depression in both preclinical and clinical studies. More impressively, the beneficial effect of tandospirone has been revealed on improvement of motor dysfunction of Parkinson's disease and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia either in monotherapy or in combination with other drugs. This review discusses the superiority of tandospirone in the treatment of the disorders and associated mechanisms in central nervous system from the literature.
