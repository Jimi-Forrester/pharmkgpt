33925781|a|Neurodegenerative diseases associated with memory disturbances are important health issues occurring due to a prolonged life span. This article presents the results of a study targeting the emergence of a drug candidate with antiamnesic properties. The effect of berberine (BBR), an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from the overground parts of Berberis sibirica Pall., on memory and expression of parvalbumin in the mouse hippocampus proper were determined. High-purity BBR was isolated by centrifugal partition chromatography from a methanolic extract from B. sibirica by using a methyl-tert-butyl ether and water (1:1 v/v) solvent system with 10 mmol/L of triethylamine and hydrochloric acid. In an in vivo study, we assessed the influence of the chronic administration of BBR on different stages of memory-related responses in mice. Our results indicated that the chronic administration of BBR in a higher dose (5 mg/kg) improves long-term memory acquisition in mice, as determined in the passive avoidance test. The hippocampal CA1-CA3 fields showed an increased number of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons (PV-IR) and nerve fibers as compared to the control. No significant changes in the dentate gyrus were observed between the groups. The HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS analysis of the biological material revealed the content of BBR as 363.4 +- 15.0 ng (4.11% of RSD) per brain, 15.06 +- 0.89 ng (5.91% of RSD) per hippocampus, and 54.45 +- 1.40 (4.05% of RSD) ng in 100 microL plasma. The study showed that BBR could be a factor influencing the expression of PV in hippocampal neurons. We speculate that BBR may modulate the level of Ca2+ in neurons and thus potentially act as a neuroprotective factor against neuronal damages.
