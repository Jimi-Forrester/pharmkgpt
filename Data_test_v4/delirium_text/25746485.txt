Little is known about who is mostly likely to show associations between cognitive complaints and preclinical Alzheimer pathology. We sought to demonstrate associations between subjective complaints and brain amyloid-beta in cognitively normal older adults; and to explore personality factors as potential moderators of this association. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: Clinical neuroimaging research center. PARTICIPANTS: Community volunteer sample of 92 healthy older adults, screened for normal cognition with comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. MEASUREMENTS: Subjective cognitive self-report measures included the Memory Functioning Questionnaire (MFQ), Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, and the Subjective Cognitive Complaint Scale. Personality was measured with the NEO Five Factor Inventory. Brain amyloid-beta deposition was assessed with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET imaging. RESULTS: One of three cognitive complaint measures, the MFQ, was associated with global PiB retention (standardized beta = -0.230, p = 0.046, adjusting for age, sex and depressive symptoms). Neuroticism moderated this association such that only high neuroticism individuals showed the predicted pattern of high complaint-high amyloid-beta association. CONCLUSION: Evidence for association between subjective cognition and brain amyloid-beta deposition in healthy older adults is demonstrable but measure-specific. Neuroticism may moderate the MFQ-amyloid-beta association such that it is observed in the context of higher trait neuroticism. Subjective cognitive complaints and neuroticism may reflect a common susceptibility toward psychological distress and negative affect, which are in turn risk factors for cognitive decline in aging and incident Alzheimer disease.
