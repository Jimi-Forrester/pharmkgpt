39086110|t|Therapeutic effects of tetrahedral framework nucleic acids and tFNAs-miR22 on retinal ischemia/reperfusion injury.
39086110|a|Retinal ischemia/reperfusion injury (RI/R) is a common pathological process in ophthalmic diseases, which can cause severe visual impairment. The mechanisms underlying RI/R damage and repair are still unclear. Scholars are actively exploring effective intervention strategies to restore impaired visual function. With the development of nucleic acid nanomaterials, tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) have shown promising therapeutic potential in various fields such as stem cells, biosensors, and tumour treatment due to their excellent biological properties. Besides, miRNA-22-3p (miR-22), as an important regulatory factor in neural tissue, has been proven to have positive effects in various neurodegenerative diseases. By stably constructing a complex of tetrahedral framework nucleic acids miR22 (tFNAs-miR22), we observed that tFNAs-miR22 had a positive effect on the repair of RI/R injury in retinal neural tissue. Previous studies have shown that tFNAs can effectively deliver miR-22 into damaged retinal neurons, subsequently exerting neuroprotective effects. Interestingly, we found that there was a certain synergistic effect between tFNAs and miR-22. tFNAs-miR22 can selectively activated the ERK1/2 signalling pathway to reduce neuronal apoptosis, accelerate cell proliferation, and restore synaptic functional activity. In this study, we established a simple yet effective small molecule drug for RI/R treatment which may become a promising neuroprotectant for treating this type of vision impairment disease in the future.
