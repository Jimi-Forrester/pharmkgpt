32270490|t|Mortality and complications after emergency laparotomy in patients above 80 years.
32270490|a|Emergency laparotomy (EL) is a high-risk procedure. However, available evidence regarding outcome after emergency surgery in very old patients is limited. The aim of this observational study was to investigate outcome following EL in patients >=80 years of age. METHODS: This single-center retrospective study was undertaken at Haukeland University Hospital, Norway. Demographic data, pre-operative risk assessment, surgical procedures, intrahospital logistics, complications, mortality, and discharge data were collected from the medical records. Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, 1-year mortality, post-operative complications, and level of care at discharge. RESULTS: One hundred and six patients aged 80-96 years underwent EL between 2015 and 2016. Of these, 58% had cardiopulmonary disease, and 16% lived in a nursing home before surgery. Resection of colon was performed in 26 cases, adhesiolysis was performed in 24, and resection of small intestine in 18. Within 30 days, 28 patients died (26%), 15 during the first post-operative week. For 82% of the patients, at least one complication occurred, and medical complications were far more frequent than surgical. Post-operatively, pulmonary morbidity was found in 51 patients (48%) and delirium in 42 (40%). The number of intrahospital deaths was 25 (24%). Among the 81survivors, 53 were discharged to a nursing home (65%). One-year mortality was 47% (50/106). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality after EL in octo- and nonagenarians is very high. Medical complications are more common than surgical, and functional decline is frequent. Future studies should focus on the effect of a care bundle including geriatric intervention in these patients.
