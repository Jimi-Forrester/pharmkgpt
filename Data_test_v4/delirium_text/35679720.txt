35679720|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disease that causes memory and learning impairments as well as dementia. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress supplement that can improve inflammation and oxidative stress associated with AD. This study investigated the effects of drug delivery of COQ10 by exosomes derived from adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs-Exo) on cognition, memory, and neuronal proliferation in a rat model of Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced AD. Since the establishment of the AD model, the rats have received intraperitoneal injections of CoQ10, Exo, or CoQ10-loaded ADSCs-Exo (Exo+ CoQ10). The passive avoidance test and the Morris water maze (MWM) were used to assess memory and cognition changes. Cell density was determined using histological methods. The expression of BDNF was measured using an ELISA kit. SOX2 expression was determined using immunohistochemistry. According to the results of the MWM and passive avoidance task, Exo+CoQ10 significantly improved STZ-induced memory impairment compared to CoQ10 and Exo groups alone. Furthermore, BDNF expression increased in the STZ-induced rats after Exo+ CoQ10, when compared to the CoQ10 and Exo groups. In addition, Exo+CoQ10 had the highest cell density and SOX2 gene expression, when compared to the CoQ10 and Exo groups. According to the findings of this study, Exo+ COQ10 enhanced cognition and memory deficiency in Alzheimer's disease by boosting BDNF and SOX2 levels in the hippocampus. Hence, the use of exosomes derived from adipose-derived stem cells as the carrier of CoQ10 may increase the therapeutic effect of CoQ10, which can possibly be due to the regenerative properties of the exosomes.
