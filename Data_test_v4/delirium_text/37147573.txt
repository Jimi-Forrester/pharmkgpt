37147573|a|BACKGROUND: TDP-43 (43-kD transactive response DNA-binding protein) is a DNA-/RNA-binding protein that plays an important role in several nervous system diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Whether it plays an important role in glioma patients is unknown. METHODS: Datasets were downloaded from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) website ( http://www.cgga.org.cn/ ). Cox survival analysis was performed to determine the relationship between TARDBP gene expression and the overall survival of glioma patients. GO analyses were performed to determine the biological functions of the TARDBP gene. Finally, we used PRS type, age, grade, IDH mutation status, 1p/19q codeletion status, and expression value of the TARDBP gene to construct a prediction model. With this model, we can predict patients' 1-, 2-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates. RESULTS: The TARDBP gene plays an important role in glioma patients. The expression of the TARDBP gene has a significant correlation with glioma patient survival. We also constructed an ideal prediction model. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the TARDBP gene and the protein it encodes play important roles in glioma patients. The expression of the TARDBP gene has a significant correlation with the overall survival of glioma patients.
