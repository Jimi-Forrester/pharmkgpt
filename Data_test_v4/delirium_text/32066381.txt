32066381|a|BACKGROUND: There has been much discussion recently about the occurrence of neuropsychological complications during the perioperative period. Diabetes is known to be one of the metabolic risk factors. Although the number of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) has been increasing, the pathophysiology of postoperative neuropsychological dysfunction in DM patients is still unclear. Recently, a deficiency of neurotransmitters, such as monoamines, was reported to be associated with mental disorders. Therefore, we investigated the effects of surgical stress on behavioral activity and hippocampal noradrenaline (NA) level in type 2 diabetes mellitus model (T2DM) mice. METHODS: Eighty-four 6-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups (non-diabetes, non-diabetes with surgery, T2DM, and T2DM with surgery groups). T2DM mice were established by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks. At 14 weeks of age, fifteen mice in each group underwent a series of behavioral tests including an open field (OF) test, a novel object recognition (NOR) test and a light-dark (LD) test. In the surgery groups, open abdominal surgery with manipulation of the intestine was performed 24 h before the behavioral tests as a surgical stress. Hippocampal noradrenaline (NA) concentration was examined in six mice in each group by high-performance liquid chromatography. The data were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U test, and p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: The T2DM group showed significantly increased explorative activity in the NOR test (P = 0.0016) and significantly increased frequency of transition in the LD test (P = 0.043) compared with those in the non-diabetic group before surgery. In T2DM mice, surgical stress resulted in decreased total distance in the OF test, decreased explorative activity in the NOR test, and decreased frequency of transition in the LD test (OF: P = 0.015, NOR: P = 0.009, LD: P = 0.007) and decreased hippocampal NA (P = 0.015), but such differences were not observed in the non-diabetic mice. CONCLUSIONS: Mice with T2DM induced by feeding an HFD showed increased behavioral activities, and surgical stress in T2DM mice caused postoperative hypoactivity and reduction of the hippocampal NA level.
