33066174|t|Delirium Superimposed on Dementia in Perioperative Period and Intensive Care.
33066174|a|Delirium is a life-threatening condition, the causes of which are still not fully understood. It may develop in patients with pre-existing dementia. Delirium superimposed on dementia (DSD) can go completely unnoticed with routine examination. It may happen in the perioperative period and in the critical care setting, especially in the ageing population. Difficulties in diagnosing and lack of specific pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment make DSD a seriously growing problem. Patient-oriented, multidirectional preventive measures should be applied to reduce the risk of DSD. For this reason, anesthesiologists and intensive care specialists should be aware of this interesting condition in their everyday clinical practice.
