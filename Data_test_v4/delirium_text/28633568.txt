28633568|a|Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 have been shown to be the main components of the amyloid plaques found in the extracellular environment of neurons in Alzheimer's disease. beta-Casein, a milk protein, has been shown to display a remarkable chaperone ability in preventing the aggregation of proteins. In this study, the ability of beta-casein to suppress the amyloid fibril formation of Abeta1-42 has been examined through in vitro studies and molecular docking simulation. The results demonstrate the inhibitory effect of beta-casein on fibril formation in Abeta1-42, in a concentration dependent manner, suggesting that the chaperone binds to the Abeta1-42 and prevents amyloid fibril formation. Molecular docking results show that the inhibitory effect of the beta-casein may be due to binding of the chaperone with the aggregation-prone region of the Abeta1-42 mainly via hydrophobic interactions. beta-Casein probably binds to the CHC and C-terminal domain of the Abeta1-42, and stabilizes proteins by inhibiting the conversion of monomeric Abeta1-42 into fibrils. Thus our data suggests that the hydrophobic interactions between beta-casein and Abeta1-42 play an important role in the burial of the hydrophobic part of the Abeta1-42. This means that beta-casein maybe considered for use in preventing amyloid fibril formation in degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer.
