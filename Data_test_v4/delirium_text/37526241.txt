Despite their extensive impact, statistics show that AIDs is associated with a higher risk of ND. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are critical in several illnesses and disorders, especially AID and ND. Therefore, the present study focused on understanding the underlying causes of the pathophysiology of diseases such as AID and ND through in silico-based research. In order to determine how circRNAs are related to various disease pathways, this study examined the gene expression data sets for Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and atrial fibrillation (AF). Our study identified and analyzed two circRNAs, their respective host genes (DHTKD1 and RAN) and their related miRNAs, which could serve as potential markers for treating disorders like myotonic dystrophy type 1, spinocerebellar ataxia and fragile X syndrome. Further, the circRNA-derived peptide was identified and analysed with the molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) followed by a principal component (PC) based free energy landscape (FEL) profile. The computational results obtained here provide a basis for the development of therapeutics against AD, RA and AF. Moreover, further functional studies are needed to validate their role in disease aetiology and to provide a detailed understanding of their association with AID and ND.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
