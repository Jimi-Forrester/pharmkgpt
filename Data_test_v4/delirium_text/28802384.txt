28802384|t|Retrospective study of intranasal dexmedetomidine as a prophylactic against emergence delirium in pediatric patients undergoing ear tube surgery.
28802384|a|OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the effect of intranasal dexmedetomidine on emergence delirium (ED) in pediatric patients who underwent ear tube surgeries. Due to the brief nature of the surgery and low levels of pain experienced, an IV is rarely needed, limiting the medications available to anesthesiologists to manage postoperative delirium that may arise during recovery from inhalational anesthesia. Intravenous dexmedetomidine is an alpha-2 agonist anesthetic that is used in pediatric patients for the management of ED in various surgical procedures. However, intranasal medication has not been evaluated specifically in ear tube surgeries for ED prevention. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients at Nemours Children's Hospital who had undergone ear tube insertion or removal surgery between 2013 and 2015, controlling for confounding variables such as age, surgery duration, and anesthesiologist. We used the post anesthesia emergence delirium (PAED) tool, an instrument created to assess ED in the clinical setting. We analyzed the data for significant differences in PAED score and time in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) between patients treated with intranasal dexmedetomidine and the control group that did not receive the medication. RESULTS: We found no significant difference between the PAED scores of those patients treated with intranasal dexmedetomidine prior to ear tube surgeries and those who did not receive the medication, and no difference in the duration of PACU stay. CONCLUSION: These results conflict with other research on intranasal dexmedetomidine and its potential to prevent ED in pediatric patients. This information should prompt further prospective investigation into the most efficacious use of dexmedetomidine for ED prevention, both in terms of timing and dosage required.
