33241066|t|Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment in Older Persons With HIV.
33241066|a|With increased longevity related to the advent of antiretroviral therapy, there are increasing proportions of older persons with HIV (PWH). Prior studies have demonstrated increased prevalence of geriatric syndromes in older PWH and recommended the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) in this population. However, there is currently no peer-reviewed literature that outlines how to perform the CGA in PWH in the clinical setting. In this article, we offer a review on how to perform the CGA in PWH, outline domains of the CGA and their importance in PWH, and describe screening tools for each domain focusing on tools that have been validated in PWH, are easy to administer, and/or are already commonly used in the field of geriatrics.
