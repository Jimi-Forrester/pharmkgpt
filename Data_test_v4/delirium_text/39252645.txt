39252645|t|Visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease: spotlight on central cholinergic dysfunction.
39252645|a|Visual hallucinations are a common non-motor feature of Parkinson's disease and have been associated with accelerated cognitive decline, increased mortality and early institutionalisation. Despite their prevalence and negative impact on patient outcomes, the repertoire of treatments aimed at addressing this troubling symptom is limited. Over the last two decades, significant contributions have been made in uncovering the pathological and functional mechanisms of visual hallucinations, bringing us closer to the development of a comprehensive neurobiological framework. Convergent evidence now suggests that degeneration within the central cholinergic system may play a significant role in the genesis and progression of visual hallucinations. Here, we outline how cholinergic dysfunction may serve as a potential unifying neurobiological substrate underlying the multifactorial and dynamic nature of visual hallucinations. Drawing upon previous theoretical models, we explore the impact that alterations in cholinergic neurotransmission has on the core cognitive processes pertinent to abnormal perceptual experiences. We conclude by highlighting that a deeper understanding of cholinergic neurobiology and individual pathophysiology may help to improve established and emerging treatment strategies for the management of visual hallucinations and psychotic symptoms in Parkinson's disease.
