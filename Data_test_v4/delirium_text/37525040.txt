37525040|t|Screening of Spirulina Components for Anti-Parkinson's and Anti-Alzheimer's Activity by in Silico Methods and Docking Studies.
37525040|a|Spirulina platensis was first isolated from Lake Texcoco by Aztecs in the sixteenth century. In 2012, spirulina was considered to be safe dietary supplement by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Spirulina is a cyanophytic microalgae that is often considered as single cell protein. It contains many essential amino acids, proteins, fatty acids, antioxidant pigments, carotenoids, and cyanogenic pigments, that is, phycocyanobilins and phycocyanins (Eriksen, Appl Microbiol Biotechnol, 80(1):1-4, 2008). Components of spirulina are investigated for many health benefits and for pharmaceutical uses (Karkos et al., Spirulina in clinical practice: evidence-based human applications). Spirulina has been found to have a role in growth, immunity (Wu et al., Arch Toxicol, 90(8):1817-40, 2016), antioxidant (Wu et al., Arch Toxicol, 90(8):1817-40, 2016), antiviral (Ayehunie et al., J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol, 18(1):7-12, 1998), antitoxicologic, anti-cancerogenic (Hirahashi et al., Int Immunopharmacol, 2(4):423-34, 2002), antidiabetic (Layam and Reddy, Diabetol Croat, 35(2):29-33, 2006), and neuroprotective properties. In this study, we focused on spirulina components in anti-Parkinson's and anti-Alzheimer's activity. Four potential targets, two for each activity, that is, structure of parkinE3 ligase (PDB ID:4I1H) and structure of BACE bound to 5-(3-(5-chloropyridin-3-yl)phenyl)-5-cyclopropyl-2-imino-3-methylimidazolidin-4one (PDBI D:4DJx) for anti-Parkinson's activity and structure of human MAO B in complex with selective inhibitor safinamide (PDB ID:2V5Z) and crystal structure of human BACE-1 in complex with CNP520(PDB ID:6EQM) for anti-Alzheimer's activity, have been selected. The in silico results and scoring of virtual screening, that is, molecular docking, were compared with commonly used marketed drugs such as levodopa for Parkinson's disease (PD) and rivastigmine (Rosler et al., BMJ, 318(7184):633-40, 1999) for Alzheimer's disease.
