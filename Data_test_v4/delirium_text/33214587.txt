33214587|t|One step acid activation of bentonite derived adsorbent for the effective remediation of the new generation of industrial pesticides.
33214587|a|Herein, the facile one step acid activation of bentonite derived functionalized adsorbent (AB) for the effective remediation of both ionic and non-ionic secondary pesticides, ametryn and metolachlor has been attempted. The surface characteristics of AB were examined by the nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier Transforms Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy. The adsorptive behavior was evaluated with respect to the effect of contact time, initial concentrations and solution pH. The equilibrium data were fitted to the Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models, while the adsorption kinetic was analyzed using the pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order kinetic equations. Thermodynamic parameters including the standard enthalpy change (DeltaH ), standard entropy change (DeltaS ), and Gibbs free energy change (DeltaG ) were established. Thermodynamic analysis illustrated that the adsorption process was feasible and exothermic in nature, while the characterization findings verified the alteration of FTIR bands, and a high specific surface area of 464.92 m2/g, with a series of pores distributed over the surface. Equilibrium data was best confronted to the pseudo-second order kinetic model, while the adsorptive removal of ametryn and metolachlor onto AB was satisfactory described by the Langmuir isotherm model, with the monolayer adsorption capacities for ametryn and metolachlor of 2.032 and 0.208 mmole/g respectively. The findings outlined the potential of the newly develop AB for the on-site treatment of pesticide polluted water.
