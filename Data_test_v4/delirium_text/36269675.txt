In this study, we aim to investigate the presentations, diagnostic approaches, treatments and prognosis. We present one case of proton pump inhibitors-induced motor hallucination underwent drug withdrawal and recovery subsequently. Delirium Rating Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Scale examinations showed transient delirium and anxiety. Proton pump inhibitors-induced psychiatric symptoms are benign and affect patients' prognosis. No standard treatment exists, and the strategies contain discontinuing proton pump inhibitors and/or antipsychotics drugs. Overall prognosis is usually good and recurrence seems to be rare.
