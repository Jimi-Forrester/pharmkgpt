Low back and leg pain caused by LDH is the main factor leading to functional disability, which has caused a serious burden to patients and society. Osteoking can delay the progression of osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, and even has a significant effect on the prevention of deep vein thrombosis after fracture surgery. In recent years, it has been gradually used in the treatment of LDH and has received significant results. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to predict the mechanism of Osteoking in the treatment of LDH through network pharmacology and verify it by molecular docking method. METHODS: The TCMSP database was used to collect the relevant active components and targets of Osteoking, while the GeneCards, OMIM and DisGeNET databases were utilized to collect the relevant disease targets of LDH. The Venny 2.1.0 software was employed to obtain the intersecting gene targets of Osteoking and LDH. PPI network construction and core target selection were performed using Cytoscape 3.9.0 software. The Metascape database was used for GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of the relevant targets. Finally, molecular docking was conducted using AutoDock software. RESULTS: The study identified 116 potential targets and 26 core targets for the treatment of LDH with Osteoking. Pathways in cancer, Alzheimer's disease, microRNAs in cancer and the IL-17 signalling pathway were among the main involved signalling pathways. Molecular docking results demonstrated that the key targets AKT1, IL-6, ALB, TNF and IL-1beta exhibited relatively stable binding activities with the main active components of Osteoking. CONCLUSIONS: Osteoking can alleviate the symptoms of lumbar disc herniation through the modulation of multiple targets and signalling pathways.
