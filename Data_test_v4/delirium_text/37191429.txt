37191429|t|Age-Related Hormones Changes and Its Impact on Health Status and Lifespan.
37191429|a|The increase in life expectancy is accompanied with an increased consultation of age-related pathologies including endocrine disorders. Two main areas are focusing the attention of medical and social research in older population: the diagnosis and care of this heterogeneous population, and the interventional measures potentially useful to mitigate age-related functional declines and to increase health and quality of lifespan. Thus, better understanding the physiopathology of aging and establishing accurate diagnostic and personalized approaches are a priority and currently an unmet need of the medical community. The endocrine system plays a major role in survival and lifespan through regulating vital processes such as energy consumption and optimizing the stress response among others. The aim of this paper is to review the physiological evolution of the main hormonal functions in aging and its clinical translation to improve our approach to the aging patient.
