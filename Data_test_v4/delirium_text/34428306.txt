34428306|a|Irisin is a novel hormone-like myokine that plays an important role in central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as cerebral ischaemia and Alzheimer's disease. However, irisin is rarely investigated in multiple sclerosis (MS), a typical inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS, and in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a typical model of MS. We determined the levels of irisin in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid in patients with MS. The expression and histological distribution of irisin were determined in EAE. Serum irisin levels in patients with MS and in EAE mice were increased, and the levels of FNDC5/irisin mRNA were decreased in the spinal cord and brain regardless of the onset, peak or chronic phase of EAE. Immunofluorescence staining showed co-localization of irisin and neurones. The levels of irisin fluctuated with disease progression in MS and EAE. Irisin may be involved in the pathological process of MS/EAE.
