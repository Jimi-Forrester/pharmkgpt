34687207|a|BACKGROUND: The increasing colorectal cancer (CRC) survivor population highlights the need for dietary recommendations in order to enhance health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and alleviate symptoms of fatigue, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), and gastrointestinal problems. OBJECTIVES: Because of the therapeutic potential of dietary fiber on the gut, we aim to assess longitudinal associations of postdiagnostic dietary fiber, fruit, and vegetable intake, a major source of dietary fiber, with HRQoL, fatigue, CIPN, and gastrointestinal symptoms in CRC survivors from 6 wk to 24 mo posttreatment. METHODS: In a prospective cohort among stage I-III CRC survivors (n = 459), 5 repeated study measurements between diagnosis and 24 mo posttreatment were executed. Dietary fiber intake and fruit and vegetable intake were measured by 7-d dietary records. HRQoL, fatigue, CIPN, and gastrointestinal symptoms were measured by validated questionnaires. We applied confounder-adjusted linear mixed models to analyze longitudinal associations from 6 wk until 24 mo posttreatment and used hybrid models to disentangle the overall association into intraindividual changes and interindividual differences over time. RESULTS: Higher dietary fiber intake and fruit and vegetable intake were longitudinally associated with statistically significant better physical functioning and less fatigue. Intraindividual analyses showed that an increase of 10 g/d in dietary fiber within individuals over time was associated with better physical functioning (beta: 2.3; 95% CI: 0.1, 4.4), role functioning (ability to perform daily activities; 5.9; 1.5, 10.3), and less fatigue (-4.1; -7.7, -0.5). An average increase in fruit and vegetable intake of 100 g/d between individuals over time was predominantly associated with less fatigue (-2.2; -4.2, -0.3). No associations were found with CIPN and gastrointestinal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that increasing dietary fiber, fruit, and vegetable intake is related to better physical and role functioning and less fatigue in the first 2 y after the end of treatment for CRC.
