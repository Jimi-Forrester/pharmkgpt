35800646|a|Diagnostic reasoning is the thought process used to arrive at a diagnosis based on symptoms, examination findings, and laboratory values. Diagnosis is categorized as nonanalytic reasoning (intuition) and analytic reasoning (analysis). Rehabilitation nutrition involves the diagnosis of nutritional disorders, sarcopenia, and excess or deficient nutrient intake. There is usually only one correct answer for the presence or absence of these. On the other hand, there may be no single correct answer for the causes of anorexia, weight loss, or sarcopenia, and analytical reasoning is required. In this case, diagnostic reasoning involves hypotheses. Simply using nutritional supplements without performing diagnostic reasoning about these causes is like prescribing antipyretic analgesics to a patient with a headache without diagnosing the cause of the headache. To maximize function and quality of life in rehabilitation nutrition, it is necessary to suspect the common causes of anorexia, weight loss, and sarcopenia in all cases.
