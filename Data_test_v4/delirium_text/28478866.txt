28478866|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) destroys brain function, especially in the hippocampus, and is a social problem worldwide. A major pathogenesis of AD is related to the accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, resulting in neuronal cell death in the brain. Here, we isolated four saponins (1-4) and elucidated their structures from 1D and 2D NMR and HRFABMS spectral data. The structures of 1 and 2 were determined as new saponins which have cochalic acid as the aglycon, and 3 was determined as a new saponin with oleanolic acid as the aglycon. Compound 4 was confirmed as the known saponin chikusetsusaponin V (=ginsenoside R0). Isolated saponins (1-4) and six previously reported saponins (5-10) were tested for their inhibitory effects of Abeta aggregation and their protective effects on SH-SY5Y cells against Abeta-associated toxicity. As the results, compounds 3 and 4 showed inhibitory effect of Abeta aggregation and compounds 5-8 exerted the protective effects on SH-SY5Y cells against Abeta-associated toxicity.
