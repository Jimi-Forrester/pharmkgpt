30988767|t|Delirium after primary percutaneous coronary intervention in aged individuals with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: A retrospective study.
30988767|a|The present prospective study aimed to investigate the incidence and risk factors of delirium after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in older adults with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). A total of 111 patients (age, >=65 years) with acute STEMI following primary PCI were included in the present study. Neurocognitive testing was performed using the Mini-mental State Examination on the first day of hospitalization. Post-operative delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit within the first four post-operative days. A total of 32 patients (28.8%) developed delirium after primary PCI. The independent predictors of delirium were older age [odds ratio (OR)=1.192, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.07-1.328, P=0.001], living alone (OR=4.827, 95% CI=1.315-17.725, P=0.018), history of alcohol abuse (OR=3.875, 95% CI=1.168-12.857, P=0.026), longer duration of primary PCI (OR=1.152, 95% CI=1.077-1.232, P<0.001) and post-operative pain (current pain; OR=7.663, 95% CI=1.432-41.02, P=0.017). Compared to the patients without delirium, the participants who developed delirium had longer hospital stays and a higher rate of re-admission within 30 days after discharge. The mortality within one year after discharge (one-year mortality) was similar between patients with and without delirium. In conclusion, older patients (age, >=65 years) with acute STEMI are at a relatively high risk of delirium following primary PCI. Higher age (>=65 years), living alone, history of alcohol dependence, longer length of primary PCI (>50 min) and post-operative pain (current pain) were determined to be risk factors for delirium after primary PCI in the present cohort.
