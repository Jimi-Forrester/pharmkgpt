38238354|a|Gene therapy presents an innovative approach to the treatment of previously incurable diseases. The advancement of research in the field of nanotechnology has the potential to overcome the current limitations and challenges of conventional therapy methods, and therefore to unlocking the full potential of dendrimers for use in the gene therapy of neurodegenerative disorders. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses a significant challenge when delivering therapeutic agents to the central nervous system. In this study, we investigated the biophysical properties of dendrimers and their complexes with siRNA directed against the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene to identify an appropriate nanocarrier capable of safely delivering the cargo across the BBB. Our study yielded valuable insights into the complexation process, stability over time, the mechanisms of interaction, the influence of dendrimers on the oligonucleotide's spatial structure, and the potential cytotoxic effects on human cerebral microvascular endothelium cells. Based on our findings, we identified that the dendrimer G3Si PEG6000 was an optimal candidate for further research, potentially serving as a nanocarrier capable of safely delivering therapeutic agents across the BBB for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.
