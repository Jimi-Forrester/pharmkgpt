35423339|a|Recent studies have shown that inhibition of the hSIRT2 enzyme provides favorable effects in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Prenylated xanthone phytochemicals including alpha-mangostin, beta-mangostin and gamma-mangostin obtained from Garcinia mangostana, a well-established tropical plant, have been shown experimentally to inhibit sirtuin enzymatic activity. However, the molecular mechanism of this sirtuin inhibition has not been reported. Using comprehensive integrated computational techniques, we provide molecular and timewise dynamical insights into the structural alterations capable of facilitating therapeutically beneficial effects of these phytochemicals at the catalytic core of the hSIRT2 enzyme. Findings revealed the enhanced conformational stability and compactness of the hSIRT2 catalytic core upon binding of gamma-mangostin relative to the apoenzyme and better than alpha-mangostin and beta-mangostin. Although thermodynamic calculations revealed favorable binding of all the phytochemicals to the hSIRT2 enzyme, the presence of only hydroxy functional groups on gamma-mangostin facilitated the occurrence of additional hydrogen bonds involving Pro115, Phe119, Asn168 and His187 which are absent in alpha-mangostin- and beta-mangostin-bound systems. Per-residue energy contributions showed that van der Waals and more importantly electrostatic interactions are involved in catalytic core stability with Phe96, Tyr104 and Phe235 notably contributing pi-pi stacking, pi-pi T shaped and pi-sigma interactions. Cumulatively, our study revealed the structural alterations leading to inhibition of hSIRT2 catalysis and findings from this study could be significantly important for the future design and development of sirtuin inhibitors in the management of Alzheimer's disease.
