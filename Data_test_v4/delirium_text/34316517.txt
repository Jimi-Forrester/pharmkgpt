34316517|t|Effectiveness of Companion Robot Care for Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
34316517|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Dementia and central nervous system degeneration are common problems in aging societies with regard to the number of people affected and total medical expenses. Socially assistive robotic technology has gradually matured; currently, most scholars believe it can be used as companions in long-term care facilities and to work as caregivers alongside staff to improve the social interaction and mental state of older adults and patients with dementia. Therefore, this study measured the effect of the duration of exposure to socially assistive robots in older adults with dementia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Seven databases were searched up to February 2019 through the consultation of appropriate Internet sites and the use of criteria lists recommended by relevant experts. Randomized controlled trials comparing socially assistive robot use with a control group in older adults with dementia and using at least one of the primary outcomes of agitation, depression, and quality of life were included. RESULTS: Thirteen randomized controlled trials were identified from 873 articles, 7 of which were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled effect estimate from 3 trials with 214 participants revealed that the pet-type robot improved patients' agitation level, with a standardized mean difference of -0.37 (95% CI: -0.64 to -0.10, p < .01) and no heterogeneity (I 2 = 0%). The results also revealed that length of each session and pet-type robot exposure time per week were associated with reduced depression levels (beta = -0.06, Q = 21.213, df = 1, p < .001 and beta = -0.019, Q = 7.532, df = 1, p < .01, respectively). However, the results for quality of life were nonsignificant. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Pet-type robot systems seem to be a potential activity in long-term care facilities for dementia care. Further research is warranted to establish a comprehensive intervention plan related to the use of pet-type robots.
