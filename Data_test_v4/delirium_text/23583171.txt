23583171|t|Preserving personhood of individuals with advanced dementia: lessons from family caregivers.
23583171|a|This article reports on a phenomenological study of 15 family caregivers who admitted their spouse or parent with probable Alzheimer's disease to long-term care. The caregivers were attuned to the needs, desires, moods and concerns of their family members with dementia; thus, they were attuned to personhood. Caregivers also reported observations of care by nurses and nursing staff. Observations were of individualized care and actions that promoted personhood and impoverished care delivered with minimal or no communication. These family caregivers' perspectives can inform the care of individuals with advanced dementia by nurses and nursing staff.
