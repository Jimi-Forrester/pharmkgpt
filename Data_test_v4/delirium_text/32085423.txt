32085423|t|New Hybrid Pyrazole and Imidazopyrazole Antinflammatory Agents Able to Reduce ROS Production in Different Biological Targets.
32085423|a|Several anti-inflammatory agents based on pyrazole and imidazopyrazole scaffolds and a large library of substituted catechol PDE4D inhibitors were reported by us in the recent past. To obtain new molecules potentially able to act on different targets involved in inflammation onset we designed and synthesized a series of hybrid compounds by linking pyrazole and imidazo-pyrazole scaffolds to differently decorated catechol moieties through an acylhydrazone chain. Some compounds showed antioxidant activity, inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation in neutrophils, and a good inhibition of phosphodiesterases type 4D and, particularly, type 4B, the isoform most involved in inflammation. In addition, most compounds inhibited ROS production also in platelets, confirming their ability to exert an antiinflammatory response by two independent mechanism. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) analyses evidenced that both heterocyclic scaffolds (pyrazole and imidazopyrazole) and the substituted catechol moiety were determinant for the pharmacodynamic properties, even if hybrid molecules bearing to the pyrazole series were more active than the imidazopyrazole ones. In addition, the pivotal role of the catechol substituents has been analyzed. In conclusion the hybridization approach gave a new serie of multitarget antiinflammatory compounds, characterized by a strong antioxidant activity in different biological targets.
