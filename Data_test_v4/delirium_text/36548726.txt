36548726|t|Effects of Various Marine Toxins on the Mouse Intestine Organoid Model.
36548726|a|Because of their trace existence, exquisite structure and unique role, highly toxic marine biotoxins have always led to the development of natural product identification, structure and function research, chemistry and biosynthesis, and there are still many deficiencies in the injury and protection of highly toxic organisms, toxin biosynthesis, rapid detection, poisoning and diagnosis and treatment. In this study, a mouse intestine organoid (MIO) model was constructed to explore the effects of the marine toxins okadaic acid (OA) and conotoxin (CgTx) on MIO. The results showed that the cell mortality caused by the two toxins at middle and high concentrations was significantly higher than the cell mortality of the control group, the ATPase activity in each group exposed to OA was significantly lower than the ATPase activity of the control group, all the CgTx groups were significantly higher than that of the control group, and the number of apoptotic cells was not significantly higher than the number of apoptotic cells of the control group. Through RNA-Seq differential genes, Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analysis, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) experimental results, it was demonstrated that OA reduced cell metabolism and energy production by affecting cell transcription in MIO. Ultimately, cell death resulted. In contrast, CgTx upregulated the intracellular hormone metabolism pathway by affecting the nuclear receptor pathway of MIO, which resulted in cell death and the generation of energy in large amounts.
