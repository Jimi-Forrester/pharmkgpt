36292395|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive movement disorder caused by the death of dopamine-producing cells in the midbrain. PD is the most prevalent movement disorder of the central nervous system and affects more than 6.3 million people in the world. The changes in the motor functions of patients are not easy to be clearly and on-time observed by the clinicians and to make the most well-informed decisions for the treatment. The aim of this paper is the monitoring PD by designing, developing, and evaluating a prototype mobile App using a pressure pen, which collects quantitative and objective information about PD patients, thus allowing clinicians to understand better and make assumptions about the severity and the stage of Parkinson's disease. This study presents a dynamic spiral test that can only be performed with tablet and pen pressure. Furthermore, the handwriting samples by PD patients and healthy controls individuals are collected by a computerized system, and the measurements of Spiral Deviation, Total Time, and Pen Pressure are processed. The results showed an accurate evaluation of the stage of Parkinson's disease. Thus, the clinician may use the proposed PD telemonitoring system as a screening test, storing the history of all the patient's measurements.
