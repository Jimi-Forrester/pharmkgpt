26051601|t|6-Phenoxy-2-phenylbenzoxazoles, novel inhibitors of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE).
26051601|a|Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is known to be involved in the transportation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides and causes the accumulation of Abeta in the brain. Moreover, recent studies suggest that the interactions between RAGE and Abeta peptides may be the culprit behind Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inhibitors of the RAGE-Abeta interactions would not only prevent the accumulation of toxic Abeta in the brain, and but also block the progress of AD, therefore, have the potential to provide a 'disease-modifying therapy'. In this study, we have developed a series of 6-phenoxy-2-phenylbenzoxazole analogs as novel inhibitors of RAGE. Among these derivatives, we found several effective inhibitors that block the RAGE-Abeta interactions without causing significant cellular toxicity. Further testing showed that compound 48 suppressed Abeta induced toxicity in mouse hippocampal neuronal cells and reduced Abeta levels in the brains of a transgenic mouse model of AD after oral administration.
