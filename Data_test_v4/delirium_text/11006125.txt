11006125|t|Neuroendocrine-specific protein C, a marker of neuronal differentiation, is reduced in brain of patients with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.
11006125|a|Neuroendocrine-specific protein C (NSP-C) is found in neural and neuroendocrine cells and associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Its expression was found to correlate with the degree of neuronal differentiation. As the neuropathological findings in Down syndrome (DS) includes deficits of differentiation, and we detected a downregulated sequence with 100% homology with NSP-C homolog mRNA in temporal cortex of patients with DS as well as Alzheimer's disease (AD) using differential display-polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR), we decided to examine the protein levels of NSP-C in temporal, frontal cortex and cerebellum of DS and AD. To normalize NSP-C versus neuronal density, we also determined neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels and calculated the ratios. NSP-C was significantly reduced in DS (temporal and frontal cortex) and AD (frontal cortex) compared to controls. The significant decrease of NSP-C in DS was even more pronounced when related to NSE levels. Impaired differentiation in DS brain may well be due to absolutely and relatively decreased NSP-C levels in temporal and frontal cortex. As NSP-C was also reduced in AD frontal cortex, NSP-C deficits in these disorders may be reflecting neurodegenerative changes rather than a primary and specific finding of DS or AD pathogenesis.
