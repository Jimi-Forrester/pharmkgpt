33643380|t|Coupling of Co-expression Network Analysis and Machine Learning Validation Unearthed Potential Key Genes Involved in Rheumatoid Arthritis.
33643380|a|Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an incurable disease that afflicts 0.5-1.0% of the global population though it is less threatening at its early stage. Therefore, improved diagnostic efficiency and prognostic outcome are critical for confronting RA. Although machine learning is considered a promising technique in clinical research, its potential in verifying the biological significance of gene was not fully exploited. The performance of a machine learning model depends greatly on the features used for model training; therefore, the effectiveness of prediction might reflect the quality of input features. In the present study, we used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) in conjunction with differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis to select the key genes that were highly associated with RA phenotypes based on multiple microarray datasets of RA blood samples, after which they were used as features in machine learning model validation. A total of six machine learning models were used to validate the biological significance of the key genes based on gene expression, among which five models achieved good performances [area under curve (AUC) >0.85], suggesting that our currently identified key genes are biologically significant and highly representative of genes involved in RA. Combined with other biological interpretations including Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, as well as inference of immune cell composition, our current study might shed a light on the in-depth study of RA diagnosis and prognosis.
