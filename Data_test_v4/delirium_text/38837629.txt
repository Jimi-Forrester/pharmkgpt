38837629|a|Research criteria for the diagnosis of prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) include three clinical subtypes: mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB), delirium-onset prodromal DLB, and psychiatric-onset prodromal DLB. Late-onset psychiatric manifestations are at a higher risk of developing dementia, but its relation to prodromal DLB remains unclear. In addition to the risk of severe antipsychotic hypersensitivity reactions, accurate discrimination from non-DLB cases is important due to the potential differences in management and prognosis. This article aims to review a rapidly evolving psychiatric topic and outline clinical pictures of psychiatric-onset prodromal DLB, including the proposed biomarker findings of MCI-LB: polysomnography-confirmed rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, cardiac [123I]metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy, and striatal dopamine transporter imaging. We first reviewed clinical pictures of patients with autopsy-confirmed DLB. Regarding clinical reports, we focused on the patients who predominantly presented with psychiatric manifestations and subsequently developed DLB. Thereafter, we reviewed clinical studies regarding the diagnostic applications of the proposed biomarkers to patients with late-onset psychiatric disorders. Clinical presentations were mainly late-onset depression and psychosis; however, other clinical manifestations were also reported. Psychotropic medications before a DLB diagnosis may cause extrapyramidal signs, and potentially influences the proposed biomarker findings. These risks complicate clinical manifestation interpretation during the management of psychiatric symptoms. Longitudinal follow-up studies with standardised evaluations until conversion to DLB are needed to investigate the temporal trajectories of core features and proposed biomarker findings. In patients with late-onset psychiatric disorders, identification of patients with psychiatric-onset prodromal DLB provides the opportunity to better understanding the distinct prognostic subgroup that is at great risk of incident dementia. Advances in the establishment of direct biomarkers for the detection of pathological alpha-synuclein may encourage reorganising the phenotypic variability of prodromal DLB.
