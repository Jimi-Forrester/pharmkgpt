36768558|t|Lipid Biomarkers and Atherosclerosis-Old and New in Cardiovascular Risk in Childhood.
36768558|a|Lipids are a complex group of molecules in the body, essential as structural, functional and metabolic components. When disbalanced, they are regarded as a cardiovascular risk factor, traditionally in cholesterol level evaluation. However, due to their complex nature, much research is still needed for a comprehensive understanding of their role in atherosclerosis, especially in the young. Several new lipid biomarkers are emerging, some already researched to a point, such as lipoproteins and apolipoproteins. Other lipid molecules are also being increasingly researched, including oxidized forms due to oxidative inflammation in atherosclerosis, and sphingolipids. For many, even those less new, the atherogenic potential is not clear and no clinical recommendations are in place to aid the clinician in using them in everyday clinical practice. Moreover, lipids' involvement in atherogenesis in children has yet to be elucidated. This review summarizes the current knowledge on lipids as biomarkers of cardiovascular risk in the paediatric population.
