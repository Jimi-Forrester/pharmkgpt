18578579|t|Successful aging in a 70-year-old man with down syndrome: a case study.
18578579|a|The authors present a case study of a 70-year-old man with Down syndrome ("Mr. C.") who they followed for 16 years and who does not exhibit declines in cognitive or functional capacities indicative of dementia, despite having well-documented, complete trisomy 21. The authors describe the age-associated changes that occurred over 16 years as well as provide detailed information regarding Mr. C.'s health and genetic status. To further emphasize Mr. C.'s successful aging, the authors compared his longitudinal performance profile with that of 2 peers of comparable level of intellectual functioning: 1 similar-aged man with clinical Alzheimer's disease and a younger man who was healthy. The authors present potential explanations for the phenotypic variability observed in individuals with Down syndrome.
