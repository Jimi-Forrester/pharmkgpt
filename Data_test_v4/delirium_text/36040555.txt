36040555|a|Numerous studies have investigated the risk factors of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, AD-risk factors related miRNAs were rarely reported. In this study, AD-risk factor related miRNAs of 105 Chinese individuals (45 AD patients and 60 cognitively normal controls) were investigated. The results showed that Hsa-miR-185-5p, Hsa-miR-20a-5p, and Hsa-miR-497-5p were related to AD and education, Hsa-miR-185-5p, Hsa-miR-181c-5p, Hsa-miR-664a-3p, Hsa-miR-27a-3p, Hsa-miR-451a, and Hsa-miR-320a were related to AD and depression. Target prediction of above miRNAs showed that these miRNAs were involved in the generation and clearance of amyloid-beta (Abeta), important molecules related to cognition, and disease-activated microglia response to AD. It is worth noting that Hsa-miR-185-5p was related to both education and depression, whose decreased expression pattern in AD patients was alleviated by education and enhanced by depression, and participates in Abeta generation and accumulation. Our results indicated that certain education and depression factors can contribute to AD progression by modulating miRNA expression, implying that preventive interventions might alter AD progression in Chinese patients.
