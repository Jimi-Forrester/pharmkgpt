38871852|a|The amyloid cascade hypothesis assumes that the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is driven by a self-perpetuating cycle, in which beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation leads to Tau pathology and neuronal damages. A particular mutation (A673T) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) was identified among Icelandic population. It provides a protective effect against Alzheimer- and age-related cognitive decline. This APP mutation leads to the reduced production of Abeta with A2T (position in peptide sequence) change (Abetaice). In addition, Abetaice has the capacity to form protective heterodimers in association with wild-type Abeta. Despite the emerging interest in Abetaice during the last decade, the impact of Abetaice on events associated with the amyloid cascade has never been reported. First, the effects of Abetaice were evaluated in vitro by electrophysiology on hippocampal slices and by studying synapse morphology in cortical neurons. We showed that Abetaice protects against endogenous Abeta-mediated synaptotoxicity. Second, as several studies have outlined that a single intracerebral administration of Abeta can worsen Abeta deposition and cognitive functions several months after the inoculation, we evaluated in vivo the long-term effects of a single inoculation of Abetaice or Abeta-wild-type (Abetawt) in the hippocampus of transgenic mice (APPswe/PS1dE9) over-expressing Abeta1-42 peptide. Interestingly, we found that the single intra-hippocampal inoculation of Abetaice to mice rescued synaptic density and spatial memory losses four months post-inoculation, compared with Abetawt inoculation. Although Abeta load was not modulated by Abetaice infusion, the amount of Tau-positive neuritic plaques was significantly reduced. Finally, a lower phagocytosis by microglia of post-synaptic compounds was detected in Abetaice-inoculated animals, which can partly explain the increased density of synapses in the Abetaice animals. Thus, a single event as Abetaice inoculation can improve the fate of AD-associated pathology and phenotype in mice several months after the event. These results open unexpected fields to develop innovative therapeutic strategies against AD.
