36079709|t|The Brain's Microvascular Response to High Glycemia and to the Inhibition of Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Is Sexually Dimorphic.
36079709|a|Biological sex and a high glycemic diet (HGD) contribute to dementia, yet little is known about the operative molecular mechanisms. Our goal was to understand the differences between males and females in the multi-genomic response of the hippocampal microvasculature to the HGD, and whether there was vasculoprotection via the inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEHI). Adult wild type mice fed high or low glycemic diets for 12 weeks, with or without an sEHI inhibitor (t-AUCB), had hippocampal microvessels isolated by laser-capture microdissection. Differential gene expression was determined by microarray and integrated multi-omic bioinformatic analyses. The HGD induced opposite effects in males and females: the HGD-upregulated genes were involved in neurodegeneration or neuroinflammation in males, whereas in females they downregulated the same pathways, favoring neuroprotection. In males, the HGD was associated with a greater number of clinical diseases than in females, the sEHI downregulated genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases to a greater extent with the HGD and compared to females. In females, the sEHI downregulated genes involved in endothelial cell functions to a greater extent with the LGD and compared to males. Our work has potentially important implications for sex-specific therapeutic targets for vascular dementia and cardiovascular diseases in males and females.
