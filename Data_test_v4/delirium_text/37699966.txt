37699966|a|Abnormal cognitive ageing, including dementia, poses serious challenges to health and social systems in ageing populations. As such, characterizing factors associated with abnormal cognitive ageing and developing needed preventive measures are of great importance. The epsilon4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE4) is a well-known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. APOE4 carriers are also at elevated risk of cardiovascular diseases which are associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment. On the other hand, APOE4 is known to be associated with reduced risk of multiple common types of cancer-a major age-related disease and leading cause of mortality. We conducted the first-ever study of APOE4's opposing effects on cognitive decline and mortality using competing risk models considering two types of death-death with high-amounts versus low-amounts of autopsy-assessed Alzheimer's neuropathology. We observed that APOE4 was associated with decreased mortality risk in people who died with low amounts of Alzheimer's-type neuropathology, but APOE4 was associated with increased mortality risk in people who died with high amounts of Alzheimer's-type neuropathology, a major risk factor of cognitive impairment. Possible preventive measures of abnormal cognitive ageing are also discussed.
