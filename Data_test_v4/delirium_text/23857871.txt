23857871|a|INTRODUCTION: Urinary incontinence (UI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are common in the elderly population and have increased rapidly in recent decades. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of UI and determine the neuropsychological characteristics of patients with AD and UI. METHODS: A total of 464 patients with probable AD were recruited, and the prevalence and type of UI were evaluated. Neuropsychological evaluation was assessed using the Mini-Mental Status Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating, Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes, Global Deterioration Scale, Barthel Activities of Daily Living and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. RESULTS: The prevalence of UI in patients with AD was 24.8% (men 29.6%, women 23.0%). The two most common types of UI were urge incontinence (44.3%) and functional incontinence (25.3%). UI in patients with Alzheimer's disease was statistically significantly associated with Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.21-2.01) and Barthel Activities of Daily Living (OR 1.34, 95%CI 1.22-1.47) after adjustment for different covariates. DISCUSSION: UI commonly occurred in patients with AD. The Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes and Barthel Activities of Daily Living could be potential predictors for UI in patients with AD.
