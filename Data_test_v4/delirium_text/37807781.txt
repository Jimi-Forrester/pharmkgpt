37807781|a|Different investigations lead to the urgent need to generate validated clinical protocols as a tool for medical doctors to orientate patients under risk for a preventive approach to control Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, there is consensus that the summation of risk factors for the disease can be modified according to lifestyle, thus controlling at least 40% of cases. Another fraction of cases derives from candidate genes and epigenetic components as a relevant factor in AD pathogenesis. At this point, it appears to be of critical relevance the search for molecular biomarkers that may provide information on probable pathological events and alert about early detectable risks to prevent symptomatic events of the disease. These precocious detection markers will then allow early interventions of non-symptomatic subjects at risk. Here, we summarize the status and potential avenues of prevention and highlight the usefulness of biological and reliable markers for AD.
