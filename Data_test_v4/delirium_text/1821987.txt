1821987|a|Material of this study consists of data collected during treatment of HIV infected patients admitted to AIDS Clinic in Warsaw. This unit, as the first in Poland, hospitalized seropositive patients with various infectious problems. Psychiatric complication of HIV infection (which needed psychotropic medication) was already observed in the first patient, who died with AIDS diagnosis (in February, 1987). In this study data concerning patients in AIDS Clinic during 1990 are presented. In this time 89 HIV seropositive patients (11 of these were women) were admitted to the clinic. Fifty two patients (10 of them were women) were IV drug abusers. Other 33 patients were homosexual (among them 4 IV drug abusers). Eight patients were out of high risk groups for HIV infection. Twelve of 89 patients were newly AIDS diagnosed. Three of them were IV drug abusers. Nine of AIDS patients (one a drug abuser) died in 1990. In six of 12 patients with AIDS diagnosis (50%) neuropsychiatric disorders were stated: depressive syndromes (n = 2), dementia syndromes with severe neurological symptoms (n = 2), delirium syndromes (n = 2). Other 3 person were IV drug abusers. In this study all above mentioned cases and their treatment are described. Our data suggest that HIV seropositive patients with psychiatric disorders need very careful diagnosis and an individual therapeutic intervention.
