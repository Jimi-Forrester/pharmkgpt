31107281|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To give an update on recent findings concerning the use of PET for differential diagnosis in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders manifesting on a behavioural level. RECENT FINDINGS: Although accurate differential diagnosis of dementia can be achieved by imaging disease-specific patterns of cerebral glucose metabolism with [F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([F]FDG)-PET, the diagnostic impact of [F]FDG-PET in primary psychiatric disorders is limited. Amyloid-beta PET provides an incremental value beyond [F]FDG-PET in the differential diagnosis of dementia and was proposed as a biomarker defining the so-called Alzheimer continuum. Recently developed tau-specific tracers might also aid in the diagnostic process (biological definition of Alzheimer's disease together with amyloid-beta). Surpassing the diagnostic accuracy of other techniques, such as MRI, [F]FDG-PET has also gained widespread clinical use for diagnosis and follow-up of paraneoplastic and autoimmune disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) as an important differential diagnosis for rapid progressive dementia and subacute onset of psychiatric syndromes. SUMMARY: Molecular neuroimaging with PET is an established method for the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative and autoimmune CNS disorders manifesting on a behavioural level with significant therapeutic and prognostic impact. Future prospective studies are needed to define the value of tau imaging for diagnosis and prognosis in neurodegenerative disorders.
