12168685|a|Several neurodegenerative disorders are associated with oxidative stress that is manifested by lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and other markers. Included in these disorders in which oxidative stress is thought to play an important role in their pathogenesis are Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), tardive dyskinesia, Huntington's disease (HD), and multiple sclerosis. This review presents some of the chemistry of vitamin E as an antioxidant and summarizes studies in which vitamin E has been employed in these disorders and models thereof.
