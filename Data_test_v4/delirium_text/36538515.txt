36538515|t|Hemodynamic impact of early mobilization in critical patients receiving vasoactive drugs: A prospective cohort study.
36538515|a|BACKGROUND: Vasoactive drugs are one of the most common patient-related barriers to early mobilization. Little is known about the hemodynamic effects of early mobilization on patients receiving vasoactive drugs. This study aims to observe and describe the impact of mobilization on the vital signs of critical patients receiving vasoactive drugs as well as the occurrence of adverse events. METHODS: This is a cohort study performed in an Intensive Care Unit with patients receiving vasoactive drugs. All patients, either mobilized or non-mobilized, had their clinical data such as vital signs [heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and oxygen saturation], type and dosage of the vasoactive drug, and respiratory support collected at rest. For mobilized patients, the vital signs were also collected after mobilization, and so was the highest level of mobility achieved and the occurrence of adverse events. The criteria involved in the decision of mobilizing the patients were registered. RESULTS: 53 patients were included in this study and 222 physiotherapy sessions were monitored. In most of the sessions (n = 150, 67.6%), patients were mobilized despite the use of vasoactive drugs. There was a statistically significant increase in heart rate and respiratory rate after mobilization when compared to rest (p<0.05). Only two (1.3%) out of 150 mobilizations presented an adverse event. Most of the time, non-mobilizations were justified by the existence of a clinical contraindication (n = 61, 84.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The alterations observed in the vital signs of mobilized patients may have reflected physiological adjustments of patients' cardiovascular and respiratory systems to the increase in physical demand imposed by the early mobilization. The adverse events were rare, not serious, and reversed through actions such as a minimal increase of the vasoactive drug dosage.
