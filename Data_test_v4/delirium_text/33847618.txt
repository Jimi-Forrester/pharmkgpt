33847618|t|Schizophrenia hospitalization in the US 2005-2014: Examination of trends in demographics, length of stay, and cost.
33847618|a|ABSTRACT: Primarily we aimed to examine the crude and standardized schizophrenia hospitalization trend from 2005 to 2014. We hypothesized that there will be a statistically significant linear trend in hospitalization rates for schizophrenia from 2005 to 2014. Secondarily we also examined trends in hospitalization by race/ethnicity, age, gender, as well as trends in hospitalization Length of Stay (LOS) and inflation adjusted cost.In this observational study, we used Nationwide Inpatient Sample data and International Classification of Diseases, Eleventh Revisions codes for Schizophrenia, which revealed 6,122,284 cases for this study. Outcomes included crude and standardized hospitalization rates, race/ethnicity, age, cost, and LOS. The analysis included descriptive statistics, indirect standardization, Rao-Scott Chi-Square test, t-test, and adjusted linear regression trend.Hospitalizations were most prevalent for individuals ages 45-64 (38.8%), African Americans were overrepresented (25.8% of hospitalizations), and the gender distribution was nearly equivalent. Mean LOS was 9.08 days (95% confidence interval 8.71-9.45). Medicare was the primary payer for most hospitalizations (55.4%), with most of the costs ranging from $10,000-$49,999 (57.1%). The crude hospitalization rates ranged from 790-1142/100,000 admissions, while the US 2010 census standardized rates were 380-552/100,000 from 2005-2014. Linear regression trend analysis showed no significant difference in trend for race/ethnicity, age, nor gender (P > .001). The hospitalizations' overall rates increased while LOS significantly decreased, while hospitalization costs and Charlson's co-morbidity index increased (P < .001).From 2005-2014, the overall US hospitalization rates significantly increased. Over this period, observed disparities in hospitalizations for middle-aged and African Americans were unchanged, and LOS has gone down while costs have gone up. Further studies addressing the important disparities in race/ethnicity and age and reducing costs of acute hospitalization are needed.
