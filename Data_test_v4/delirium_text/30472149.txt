30472149|a|Since the metabolic disorder may be the high risk that contribute to the progress of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Overtaken of High-fat, high-glucose or high-cholesterol diet may hasten the incidence of AD in later life, due to the metabolic dysfunction. But the metabolism of lipid in brain and the exact effect of lipid to brain or to the AD's pathological remain controversial. Here we summarize correlates of lipid metabolism and AD to provide more foundation for the daily nursing of AD sensitive patients.
