32599000|t|Prophylactic effect of physical exercise on Abeta1-40-induced depressive-like behavior and gut dysfunction in mice.
32599000|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease that is highly comorbid with depression. Gut dysfunction has been proposed as a possible risk factor for both clinical conditions. In the present study, we investigated the ability of treadmill exercise for 4 weeks (5 days/week, 40 min/day) to counteract amyloid beta1-40 peptide (Abeta1-40)-induced depressive-like behavior, alterations in morphological parameters of the duodenum, and the abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla. Abeta1-40 administration (400 pmol/mouse, i.c.v.) increased immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST) and reduced time spent sniffing in the female urine sniffing test (FUST), indicating behavioral despair and impairment in reward-seeking behavior. These behavioral alterations, indicative of depressive-like behavior, were accompanied by reduced villus width in the duodenum. Moreover, photomicrographs obtained by transmission electron microscopy revealed abnormal epithelial microvilli in the duodenum from sedentary Abeta1-40-exposed mice, characterized by shorter microvilli and heterogeneity in the length of these structures that exhibit a disordered packing. Regarding the ultrastructure of Paneth cells, Abeta1-40 administration caused a reduction in the secretory granule diameter, as well as an enlarged peripheral halo. These animals also presented reduced Firmicutes and increased Bacteroidetes abundance, and increased Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio. Most of the alterations observed in Abeta1-40-exposed mice were prevented by the practice of physical exercise. Altogether the results provide evidence of the prophylactic effect of physical exercise on Abeta1-40-induced depressive-like behavior and gut dysfunction in mice, suggesting that physical exercise could be useful for preventing depression associated with AD.
