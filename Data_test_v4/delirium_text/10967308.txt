10967308|a|Administration of nerve growth factor (NGF) by intracerebroventricular infusion or transplantation of NGF-secreting cells to the basal forebrain improves spatial memory in aged animals. Using the adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector system, basal forebrain neurons were transduced to produce NGF ectopically for long intervals (at least 9 months). Rats received intraseptal injections of either the control vector, pTR-UF4, or the pTR-NGFmyc at 3 months of age, prior to testing their performance in the Morris water task. An age-related decrease in the acquisition of the hidden platform location was found at 12 months of age in the pTR-UF4 control group, but not in the pTR-NGFmyc group. Further, when compared to 3 month old untreated animals, the control group, but not the pTR-NGFmyc group, was impaired at 12 months of age. Concomitant to preventing age-related memory deficits, the NGF gene transfer increased cholinergic neuron size by 34% in the medial septum. This approach may therefore represent a viable therapy for age-related dementia involving dysfunction in cholinergic activity and memory, such as Alzheimer's disease.
