34476070|a|Phagocytosis by glial cells is essential to regulate brain function during health and disease. Therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have primarily focused on targeting antibodies to amyloid beta (Abeta) or inhibitng enzymes that make it, and while removal of Abeta by phagocytosis is protective early in AD it remains poorly understood. Impaired phagocytic function of glial cells during later stages of AD likely contributes to worsened disease outcome, but the underlying mechanisms of how this occurs remain unknown. We have developed a human Abeta1-42 analogue (AbetapH) that exhibits green fluorescence upon internalization into the acidic organelles of cells but is non-fluorescent at physiological pH. This allowed us to image, for the first time, glial uptake of AbetapH in real time in live animals. We find that microglia phagocytose more AbetapH than astrocytes in culture, in brain slices and in vivo. AbetapH can be used to investigate the phagocytic mechanisms responsible for removing Abeta from the extracellular space, and thus could become a useful tool to study Abeta clearance at different stages of AD.
