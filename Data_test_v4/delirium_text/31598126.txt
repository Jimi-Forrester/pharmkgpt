31598126|t|Recognition of Famous and Unfamiliar Faces among Patients Suffering from Amnesia Mild Cognitive Impairment (AMCI) and Alzheimer's Disease.
31598126|a|Objective: Memory assessment for the early diagnosis of cortical dementia is a complicated process which depends on important factors such as facial recognition and naming. These factors could be considered to carry a predictive power to detect neurodegenerative disorders. The present study aimed to study and compare naming or recognizing famous faces with the recognition of newly learned faces among patients with Amnesia Mild Cognitive Impairment (AMCI) and Alzheimer's disease. Method : To collect data, 60 AMCI patients, 62 patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and 63 cognitively healthy individuals were assessed using Wechsler Memory Scale-III Faces test (WMS-III faces) and Famous Faces test. Results: The results of one-way ANOVA indicated that the patients suffering from AMCI and Alzheimer's disease scored significantly worse than the control group on naming (p < 0.001), recognition (p < 0.001) section of the Famous Faces test, and immediate or delayed recognition on the WMS-III Faces test (p < 0.001). Also, the obtained results showed that the patients groups received lower scores on WMS-III Faces compared to the Famous Faces test. Conclusion: The results of this study suggested that the unfamiliar and Famous Faces tests allow the quantification of patients' face recognition and name recall abilities which, in turn, makes it possible to make more accurate predictions about cases of dementia. These tests can be used for clinical and research purposes to screen those who may be prone to dementia and need further neuropsychological assessment.
