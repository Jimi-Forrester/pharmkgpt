37662610|a|Background: Neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), comprise a major cause of health-related disabilities in human. However, biomarkers towards pathogenesis or novel targets are still limited. Objective: To identify the causality between plasma proteins and the risk of AD and other eight common neurological diseases using a Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Methods: Exposure data were obtained from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 2,994 plasma proteins in 3,301 healthy adults, and outcome datasets included GWAS summary statistics of nine neurological disorders. Inverse variance-weighted MR method as the primary analysis was used to estimate causal effects. Results: Higher genetically proxied plasma myeloid cell surface antigen CD33 level was found to be associated with increased risk of AD (odds ratio [OR] 1.079, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.047-1.112, p = 8.39x10-7). We also discovered the causality between genetically proxied elevated prolactin and higher risk of epilepsy (OR = 1.068, 95% CI = 1.034-1.102; p = 5.46x10-5). Negative associations were identified between cyclin-dependent kinase 8 and ischemic stroke (OR = 0.927, 95% CI = 0.896-0.959, p = 9.32x10-6), between neuralized E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase 1 and migraine (OR = 0.914, 95% CI = 0.878-0.952, p = 1.48x10-5), and between Fc receptor-like protein 4 and multiple sclerosis (MS) (OR = 0.929, 95% CI = 0.897-0.963, p = 4.27x10-5). Conclusion: The findings identified MR-level protein-disease associations for AD, epilepsy, ischemic stroke, migraine, and MS.
