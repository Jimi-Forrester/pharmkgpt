32438615|t|Phosphodiesterase 4B: Master Regulator of Brain Signaling.
32438615|a|Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are the only superfamily of enzymes that have the ability to break down cyclic nucleotides and, as such, they have a pivotal role in neurological disease and brain development. PDEs have a modular structure that allows targeting of individual isoforms to discrete brain locations and it is often the location of a PDE that shapes its cellular function. Many of the eleven different families of PDEs have been associated with specific diseases. However, we evaluate the evidence, which suggests the activity from a sub-family of the PDE4 family, namely PDE4B, underpins a range of important functions in the brain that positions the PDE4B enzymes as a therapeutic target for a diverse collection of indications, such as, schizophrenia, neuroinflammation, and cognitive function.
