38726394|a|Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are formed in the final step of the nonenzymatic Maillard reaction, which can contribute to various health problems such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, and chronic inflammation. Bioactive compounds with antiglycation properties have the potential to inhibit AGE-related diseases. This study investigated the antiglycation potential of pistachio green hull (PGH) and pomegranate peel (PP) extracts, which are polyphenol-rich agro-residues, against fluorescent AGE formation and compared the results with pyridoxine (vitamin B6), metformin, and EDTA (as usual chemical antiglycation agents). The results showed that PGH and PP effectively inhibited the formation of AGEs in bovine serum albumin-glucose (BSA-Glu) and BSA-fructose (BSA-Fru) with antiglycation activities ranging from 92% to 97%. PP extract (with an IC50 of 94 mg ml-1) had a greater antiglycation ability than PGH extract (with an IC50 of 142 mg ml-1). Also, results indicated that the antiglycation activities of the extracts were comparable to that of pyridoxine, and higher than metformin and EDTA. These findings suggest that the two studied extracts can be used for sustainable production of high-added-value food products with a positive effect on consumers' health.
