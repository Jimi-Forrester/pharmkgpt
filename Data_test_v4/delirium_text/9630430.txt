9630430|t|ATP in cellular calcium-overload by trivalent metal ions.
9630430|a|Extracellular Ca2+-influx induced by trivalent metal ions (Fe3+, Al3+, Cr3+, In3+, Ga3+, and La3+) in Ehrlich carcinoma cells is enhanced by ATP. This action seems to be related to the high coordination capacity of the ATP ligand that inhibits the polymerization of the solvated cations taking place at physiological pH, and consequently permits their biological activity. A general relationship between induced lipid peroxidation and increased calcium uptake was not found. These results emphasize the ATP role in the toxicity of trivalent metals, and its possible involvement, via cellular calcium overload, in a neurodegenerative process, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, in whose etiology the implication of aluminum and iron has been suggested.
