27089818|a|Glaucoma is a disease where retinal ganglion cells (RGC) are specifically affected though a number of evidences endorse the hypothesis that glaucoma is a neuro-degenerative disorder of the central nervous system and suggest a possible connection between glaucomatous damage and cerebrovascular alterations. The mechanisms underlying RGC loss are not yet fully known but alterations of the autophagy machinery have been recently proposed as a potential contributing factor as for Alzheimer's disease. Here we review the current literature on new strategies for neuroprotection in glaucoma, focusing on pharmacologic strategies to minimize RGC damage.
