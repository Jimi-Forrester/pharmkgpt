33110884|t|Falls and SGLT-2 inhibitors in geriatric patients-A case report.
33110884|a|With this case report, we want to assess the synergistic effect of both a diuretic and an SGLT-2 inhibitor on the fall event of a patient who is 65 years old and has a history of repeated falls before. After we modified the medications appropriately, she has never experienced a fall event again. So as we know, older adults do not take fall events as a pathological condition instead of a normal physiological aging process. So primary-care physicians should question the fall history of an older patient before starting a drug such as SGLT-2 inhibitors, which is known as an agent that has side effects including falls, dehydration, etc.
