35673778|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate odour measurements after endoscopic repair of cerebrospinal fluid fistulas. METHOD: Demographic characteristics, cerebrospinal fluid leak location, surgical procedure, aetiology and smell test results were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients were included. The mean age was 43.52 years. The aetiology was spontaneous in 13 patients (48.1 per cent) and traumatic in 14 patients (51.9 per cent). The skull base defect was at the cribriform plate in 15 patients (55.6 per cent), the frontal sinus posterior wall in 4 patients (14.8 per cent), the sphenoid sinus posterior wall in 4 patients (14.8 per cent), around the anterior ethmoid artery in 2 patients (7.4 per cent), at the ethmoid roof in 1 patient (3.7 per cent) and at the sphenoid sinus posterolateral wall in 1 patient (3.7 per cent). After the comparison of pre-operative and post-operative values in identification, discrimination and threshold categories, a statistically significant difference was seen only in the threshold category (p = 0.014). CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that endoscopic repair of cerebrospinal fluid leak is safe in terms of olfactory functions.
