36841790|t|Efficiency of probiotics in elderly patients undergoing orthopedic surgery for postoperative cognitive dysfunction: a study protocol for a multicenter, randomized controlled trial.
36841790|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) refers to a neurological dysfunction after a major surgery and anesthesia. It is common in elderly patients and is characterized by impairment in consciousness, orientation, thinking, memory, and executive function after surgical anesthesia. However, at present, there is no definite preventive or treatable strategy for it. Previous animal experiments showed that giving probiotics to mice before operation can prevent POCD, but there is a lack of clinical evidence. This study aims to intervene with the intestinal flora imbalance using probiotics during the perioperative period to reduce the incidence of POCD in elderly patients after orthopedic surgery and to provide new ideas and methods for the clinical prevention and treatment of POCD. METHODS: A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial will be performed to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in elderly patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. Participants (n = 220) will receive probiotics (Peifeikang, Live Combined Bifidobacterium, 210 mg per capsule, twice a day, four capsules each time, which contains Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus faecalis no less than 1.0 x 107 CFU viable bacteria respectively) or placebo from 1 day before surgery to 6 days after surgery. Neuropsychological tests will be performed 1 day before surgery and 1 week and 1 month after surgery. The main outcome of this study is the incidence of POCD 7 days after surgery. Our secondary objective is to assess the incidence of POCD 1 month after surgery; the cognitive status will be determined based on a telephone interview and will be evaluated via TICS-m; postoperative delirium will be assessed 7 days after surgery using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). DISCUSSION: Discovering the correlation between the intestinal microbiota and POCD is an important breakthrough. Based on the key role of the intestinal microbiota in other cognitive disorders, we hope that probiotics can reduce its incidence in elderly orthopedic patients.
