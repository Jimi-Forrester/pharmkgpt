31905204|a|OBJECTIVE: There exist conflicting data regarding the accuracy of ICU nurses accurately assessing patient sleep using validated questionnaires. Using the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RSQ), we hypothesize that patient factors might influence nursing perception of their sleep. METHODS: Patients in the ICU who met the inclusion criteria were asked to complete the sleep questionnaire, as were their nurses and intraclass correlation analysis was done. RESULTS: 38 paired patient-nurse surveys were included for analysis. The mean difference in total average score of the RSQ was not significantly different between patients and nurses. There was fair intraclass correlation by patient age, black race, and admission for respiratory illnesses. A good intraclass correlation existed for non-blacks and admission for non-respiratory reasons. Most striking was the intraclass correlation by sex, with poor intraclass correlation for women compared to an excellent correlation for men. CONCLUSION: The results of our study confirm that patients in our ICU have poor sleep with a fair intraclass correlation. When examined by patient related factor, the greatest divergence between patient and nursing perception of sleep in the ICU using the RCSQ was patient female sex. More research is needed in this area to better understand the divergence and improve sleep in the ICU.
