37233631|t|Postoperative Hyperuricemia-A Risk Factor in Elective Cardiosurgical Patients.
37233631|a|Hyperuricemia is a well-known cardiovascular risk factor. The aim of our study was to investigate the connection between postoperative hyperuricemia and poor outcomes after elective cardiac surgery compared to patients without postoperative hyperuricemia. In this retrospective study, a total of 227 patients after elective cardiac surgery were divided into two groups: 42 patients with postoperative hyperuricemia (mean age 65.14 +- 8.9 years) and a second group of 185 patients without it (mean age 62.67 +- 7.45 years). The time spent on mechanical ventilation (hours) and in the intensive care unit (days) were taken as the primary outcome measures while the secondary measure comprised postoperative complications. The preoperative patient characteristics were similar. Most of the patients were men. The EuroSCORE value of assessing the risk was not different between the groups nor the comorbidities. Among the most common comorbidities was hypertension, seen in 66% of all patients (69% in patients with postoperative hyperuricemia and 63.7% in those without it). A group of patients with postoperative hyperuricemia had a prolonged time of treatment in the intensive care unit (p = 0.03), as well as a prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation (p < 0.01) and a significantly higher incidence of the following postoperative complications: circulatory instability and/or low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) (chi2 = 4486, p < 0.01), renal failure and/or continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF's) (chi2 = 10,241, p < 0.001), and mortality (chi2 = 5.22, p < 0.01). Compared to patients without postoperative hyperuricemia, elective cardiac patients with postoperative hyperuricemia have prolonged postoperative treatment in intensive care units, extended durations of mechanically assisted ventilation, and a higher incidence of postoperative circulatory instability, renal failure, and death.
