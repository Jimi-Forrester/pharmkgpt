39466458|t|Heterologous expressing melittin in a probiotic yeast to evaluate its function for promoting NSC-34 regeneration.
39466458|a|Melittin is a bioactive peptide and the predominant component in bee venom (BV), studied for its many medical properties, such as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritis, nerve damage reduction, and muscle cell regeneration. Melittin is primarily obtained through natural extraction and chemical synthesis; however, both methods have limitations and cannot be used for mass production. This study established a heterologous melittin expression system in the probiotic yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus. This yeast was selected for its advantages in stress tolerance and high secreted protein yields, simplifying purification. A > 95% high-purity melittin (MET) and its precursor promelittin (ProMET) were successfully produced and purified at 1.68 mug/mL and 3.33 mug/mL concentrations and verified through HPLC and mass spectrum. The functional test of the NSC-34 cell regeneration revealed that MET achieved the best activity compared to ProMET and the natural-extracted BV groups. Growth-related gene expressions were evaluated, including microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), microtubule-associated protein Tau (MAPT), growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), and acetylcholine esterase (AChE). The results indicated that treating MET increased MAP2, GAP-43, and VAChT expressions, in which cholinergic signaling is related to neurological functions. A heterologously expressed melittin in a probiotic yeast and its potential for promoting NSC-34 regeneration described here facilitate commercial and therapeutic use. KEY POINTS:   MET and its precursor ProMET were successfully hetero-expressed in K. marxianus    > 95% high-purity MET and ProMET were purified at 1.68 mug/mL and 3.33 mug/mL   MET has no cytotoxicity toward NSC-34 and significantly promotes NSC-34 growth.
