2916711|t|Survival experience of aged hip fracture patients.
2916711|a|Hip fracture has long been considered a major threat to survival in aged populations. This report describes the survival experience of 814 aged, community dwelling hip fracture patients treated in seven Baltimore hospitals between 1984 and 1986: 4.3 per cent died during hospitalization; 8.2, 12.6, and 17.4 per cent died within three, six, and 12 months after fracture, respectively. The mortality rate for the entire population approaches expected mortality approximately six months post-fracture, but varies by age and sex. The most important factors predicting mortality are presence of serious concomitant illness and marked delirium (in the absence of dementia) at the time of hospital admission. The authors suggest that medical factors that may contribute to patient disorientation be investigated and treated, when possible, in an effort to improve the survival status of hip fracture patients.
