29977502|t|Reduction of bilateral dislocation of TMJ and Rendu Osler Weber syndrome: case report and physiopathological model.
29977502|a|Temporomandibular joint dislocation (TMJ) is an infrequent clinical situation, representing 3% of all the human body's dislocations. The etiological factors reported are associated to alterations typical of the joint or of the muscular-ligament apparatus, or to clinical conditions that may cause dislocation. We present the case of a 46-year-old patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with bilateral dislocation of the TMJ. There are several potential causes (antipsychotics, intubation, etc.) although the deposit of manganese in the basal ganglia that produce extrapyramidal symptoms could be the most consistent cause.
