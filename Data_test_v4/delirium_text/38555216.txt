38555216|t|The Influence of Audiovisual Distraction on Pain Reduction During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Under Monitored Anesthesia Care: A Prospective Randomized Trial.
38555216|a|OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of an audiovisual distraction system on the dose of remifentanil for perioperative sedation during transcatheter aortic valve implantation under monitored anesthesia care. DESIGN: Single-center prospective randomized nonblinded study. SETTING: Tertiary referral academic hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety patients who underwent transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation between July 2019 and July 2021. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to use either a novel audiovisual distraction system during the intervention (n = 45) or standard care without an audiovisual distraction system (n = 45). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Standardized questionnaires were given to each patient at admission and before and after the intervention to assess their levels of anxiety. Primary endpoints were the average and peak infusion rates of remifentanil. All patients were considered for the final analysis according to an intention-to-treat design. No relevant differences in pre- and postinterventional anxiety status were observed between the groups. Similarly, there were no significant differences in reported pain scores (p = 0.364). The average infusion rate (p = 0.028) and peak infusion rate (p = 0.025) of remifentanil were lower in the group with an audiovisual distraction system. CONCLUSIONS: Audiovisual distraction is a useful adjunct to reduce the dose of remifentanil under monitored anesthesia care during transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Larger studies are needed to evaluate potential positive effects on patient satisfaction, incidence of delirium, and possible economic benefits.
