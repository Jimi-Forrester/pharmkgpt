28714019|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of senile dementia, which often develops in elderly or presenile individuals. As one of the pathological features of AD, amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) causes energy dysmetabolism, thereby inducing cellular damage and apoptosis. Salidroside is the main active component of the traditional Chinese medicine Rhodiola. Previous studies have demonstrated that salidroside exerts a regulatory role in energy metabolism. However, the role and the mechanism of action of salidroside in AD remain unclear. Therefore, the present study used Abeta1-40 to induce damage in PC12 cells, thereby establishing a cell model of AD. In addition, salidroside treatment was performed to investigate the protective effect of salidroside and the underlying mechanisms. Abeta1-40-induced neuronal toxicity reduced cell viability and caused cellular damage. As a result, the expression level of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) decreased, the synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+; an energy metabolism-associated coenzyme) became insufficient, and the NAD+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydride ratio was reduced. Administration of salidroside alleviated Abeta-induced cell damage and increased the expression level of the key protein NAMPT and the synthesis of NAD+. The results of the present study demonstrate that salidroside exerts a protective effect on Abeta1-40-damaged PC12 cells. The underlying mechanism may be associated with the regulation of energy metabolism that relies predominantly on the NAMPT signaling pathway.
