38228001|a|Nanoplastics, widely existing in the environment and organisms, have been proven to cross the blood-brain barrier, increasing the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, current studies mainly focus on the neurotoxicity of nanoplastics themselves, neglecting their synergistic effects with other biomolecules and the resulting neurotoxicity. Amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), which triggers neurotoxicity through its self-aggregation, is the paramount pathogenic protein in AD. Here, employing polystyrene nanoparticles (PS) as a model for nanoplastics, we reveal that 100 pM PS nanoparticles significantly accelerate the nucleation rate of two Abeta subtypes (Abeta40 and Abeta42) at low concentrations, promoting the formation of more Abeta oligomers and leading to evident neurotoxicity. The hydrophobic surface of PS facilitates the interaction of hydrophobic fragments between Abeta monomers, responsible for the augmented neurotoxicity. This work provides consequential insights into the modulatory impact of low-dose PS on Abeta aggregation and the ensuing neurotoxicity, presenting a valuable foundation for future research on the intricate interplay between environmental toxins and brain diseases.
