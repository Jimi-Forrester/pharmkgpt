37360959|t|Substance Use Disorders in the Geriatric Population: a Review and Synthesis of the Literature of a Growing Problem in a Growing Population.
37360959|a|Purpose of review: Substance use disorders are becoming increasingly prevalent in the geriatric population, necessitating an updated understanding of the existing literature. This review aims to describe the epidemiology, special considerations, and management of substance use disorders in older adults. Recent findings: PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and PsychINFO databases were searched from their inception through June 2022 using the following keywords: "substance use disorder," "substance abuse," "abuse," "illicit substances," "illicit drugs," "addiction," "geriatric," "elderly," "older adults," "alcohol," "marijuana," "cannabis," "cocaine," "heroin," "opioid," and "benzodiazepine." Our findings suggest an increasing trend in substance use in older adults despite medical and psychiatric consequences when using such substances. The majority of older patients admitted to substance abuse treatment programs were not referred by healthcare providers, suggesting room for improvement in the screening and discussion of substance use disorders. Our review also suggests that there should be careful consideration of COVID-19 and racial disparities when screening, diagnosing, and treating substance use disorders in the older population. Summary: This review provides updated information on epidemiology, special considerations, and management of substance use disorders in older adults. As substance use disorders become more prevalent in older adults, primary care physicians must be prepared to recognize and diagnose substance use disorders as well as collaborate with and refer patients to geriatric medicine, geriatric psychiatry, and addiction medicine.
