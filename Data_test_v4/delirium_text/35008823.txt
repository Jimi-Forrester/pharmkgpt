35008823|t|Initiation and Prevention of Biological Damage by Radiation-Generated Protein Radicals.
35008823|a|Ionizing radiations cause chemical damage to proteins. In aerobic aqueous solutions, the damage is commonly mediated by the hydroxyl free radicals generated from water, resulting in formation of protein radicals. Protein damage is especially significant in biological systems, because proteins are the most abundant targets of the radiation-generated radicals, the hydroxyl radical-protein reaction is fast, and the damage usually results in loss of their biological function. Under physiological conditions, proteins are initially oxidized to carbon-centered radicals, which can propagate the damage to other molecules. The most effective endogenous antioxidants, ascorbate, GSH, and urate, are unable to prevent all of the damage under the common condition of oxidative stress. In a promising development, recent work demonstrates the potential of polyphenols, their metabolites, and other aromatic compounds to repair protein radicals by the fast formation of less damaging radical adducts, thus potentially preventing the formation of a cascade of new reactive species.
