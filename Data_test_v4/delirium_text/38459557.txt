38459557|a|INTRODUCTION: Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the Huntingtin gene (HTT). Immune activation is abundant in the striatum of HD patients. Detection of active microglia at presymptomatic stages suggests that microgliosis is a key early driver of neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. Recent studies showed that deletion of Tyrobp, a microglial protein, ameliorates neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease amyloidopathy and tauopathy mouse models while decreasing components of the complement subnetwork. OBJECTIVE: While TYROBP/DAP12-mediated microglial activation is detrimental for some diseases such as peripheral nerve injury, it is beneficial for other diseases. We sought to determine whether the TYROBP network is implicated in HD and whether Tyrobp deletion impacts HD striatal function and transcriptomics. METHODS: To test the hypothesis that Tyrobp deficiency would be beneficial in an HD model, we placed the Q175 HD mouse model on a Tyrobp-null background. We characterized these mice with a combination of behavioral testing, immunohistochemistry, transcriptomic and proteomic profiling. Further, we evaluated the gene signature in isolated Q175 striatal microglia, with and without Tyrobp. RESULTS: Comprehensive analysis of publicly available human HD transcriptomic data revealed that the TYROBP network is overactivated in the HD putamen. The Q175 mice showed morphologic microglial activation, reduced levels of post-synaptic density-95 protein and motor deficits at 6 and 9 months of age, all of which were ameliorated on the Tyrobp-null background. Gene expression analysis revealed that lack of Tyrobp in the Q175 model does not prevent the decrease in the expression of striatal neuronal genes but reduces pro-inflammatory pathways that are specifically active in HD human brain, including genes identified as detrimental in neurodegenerative diseases, e.g. C1q and members of the Ccr5 signaling pathway. Integration of transcriptomic and proteomic data revealed that astrogliosis and complement system pathway were reduced after Tyrobp deletion, which was further validated by immunofluorescence analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide molecular and functional support demonstrating that Tyrobp deletion prevents many of the abnormalities in the HD Q175 mouse model, suggesting that the Tyrobp pathway is a potential therapeutic candidate for Huntington's disease.
