37795124|t|Nurses' Perceptions of Intensive Care Unit Orientation Patient Education Pamphlet.
37795124|a|Background: Critical illness is a stressful time for patients and their support networks. Although patient-directed educational material to improve the understanding of critical illness exists, both patients and staff members are often unaware of these resources or how to find them. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the impact of the implementation of the American Thoracic Society's (ATS) "Managing the Intensive Care Unity (ICU) Experience: A Proactive Guide for Patients and Families", an ICU orientation pamphlet, on nurses' perceptions of the availability and effectiveness of patient and family educational resources. Methods: In a safety-net urban institution, we surveyed medical ICU (MICU) nurses in February 2021 regarding their perceptions of the availability of patient and family educational materials and the time and quality of communication with families of critically ill patients. We then introduced the MICU nurses to the ATS ICU orientation pamphlet to complement patient and family education. Quick response (QR) codes were created, linking to the online versions of the ICU pamphlet, and made available in waiting rooms. Printed copies of the pamphlet were provided to families in the ICU introductory packet upon patient MICU admission. We informed nurses regarding the pamphlet content, website, and QR codes. A postintervention survey was administered 11 months after the initial survey. Changes between pre and postintervention responses were analyzed for significant differences. Debriefing sessions with the MICU nurses were conducted, and subsequent discussions identified opportunities to improve the available educational resources. Results: At baseline, 28 of 67 (42%) MICU nurses responded to the survey. Although all nurses provided verbal education to patients and families, only 18% reported knowing about and using additional resources to supplement this education. The postintervention survey was completed by 39% of nurses; 39% of them reported using additional materials to supplement patient and family education. Reported awareness of the ATS ICU pamphlet increased from 4% before implementation to 23% after implementation (P = 0.04). MICU nurses offered suggestions to improve the pamphlet, which thematically fell into three categories: 1) opportunities to alter the ICU pamphlet, 2) opportunities to provide the pamphlet in varied formats, and 3) opportunities to add additional education topics. Conclusions: Informing nurses about the ICU pamphlet improved the acceptance and use of the materials, but it was still not accepted by many nurses. Barriers to ICU nurses using patient education resources should be explored to facilitate quality materials reaching patients and complementing patient communication. QR codes may have offered a way to disseminate educational materials to patients and families in a manner not previously considered. The process of evaluating the ICU pamphlet for our institution led to a broader discussion of additional needs for patient and family educational materials for our patient population. We encourage institutions to evaluate the sufficiency of their patient and family educational materials for similar local benefits.
