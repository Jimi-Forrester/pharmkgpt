19283396|a|Trans-activation-responsive DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a component of pathological inclusions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and several forms of sporadic and familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration. This has suggested defining a new class of diseases known as TDP-43 proteinopathies. However, it has been reported more recently that TDP-43 positive inclusions occur in other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Parkinsonism dementia complex of Guam. Here we report the occurrence of TDP-43 inclusions in one other neurodegenerative disorder: familial British dementia. Using a variety of antibodies against phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated TDP-43 epitopes, we found intense accumulation occurred in the form of dystrophic neurites, neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions and was also occasionally associated with neurofibrillary tangles. Double immunostaining revealed that TDP-43 and tau aggregates were rarely directly colocalized, but co-existed in the same neurons as separate inclusions. Double staining with ubiquitin showed a direct colocalization with TDP-43. The phosphorylation-dependent TDP-43 antibodies proved superior to phosphorylation-independent antibodies in revealing pathological inclusions since the former did not stain non-phosphorylated TDP-43 in normal nuclei. Our results support the concept that TDP-43 pathology is not narrowly restricted, but is involved in the etiology of many neurodegenerative disorders.
