21889954|a|The aspartyl protease BACE1 is the rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis of amyloid beta, which accumulation in the human brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). BACE1 has been proposed as a surrogate marker of AD; however, very few BACE1 immunoassays have been reported. In the present study we have screened ten BACE1 antibodies by Western blot and several antibody pairs to develop a new BACE1 sandwich ELISA procedure. We identified one pair that showed little background and good reproducibility. Several dilution buffers and sample denaturation methods were tried to partially unfold BACE1 before capture. We found that dilution in PBS followed by 10 min incubation at 50 C critically improves the performance of the assay. Finally, we successfully measured BACE1 levels in a few human brain and platelet lysates as well as in plasma and AD CSF. We anticipate that this assay will lay the ground to accurately measure BACE1 levels in human tissues, which could facilitate the molecular diagnosis of AD in the near future.
