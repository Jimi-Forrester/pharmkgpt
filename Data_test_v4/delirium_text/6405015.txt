6405015|a|The levels of neurotensin and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in normal post mortem human amygdala have been compared with those in cases of schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease and depression. Amongst various factors which can influence post mortem human brain biochemistry (including age, sex, post mortem delay, time of death, disease status and severity), sex difference appeared to be responsible for the most extensive variation. The levels of both peptides were nearly doubled in males compared with females and this increase was significant in the case of neurotensin. There was also a positive correlation between neurotensin and TRH levels. Although levels of neurotensin and TRH tended to be lower in the disease groups these trends did not reach significance.
