35712884|t|Day service use and improved Serial 7 and Verbal fluency scores in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
35712884|a|BACKGROUND: Day services (DS) are provided as part of the Japanese public nursing care system. Recent studies have suggested a possible relationship between DS use and limited progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study examined in detail the relationship between improvements in cognitive function and DS use in people with AD. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS-R) scores of 208 patients with AD at five memory clinics over a 6-month period. The patients were divided into a group that started using DS (n = 132) and a group that did not (n = 76) during the study period. We then compared each participant's total and item scores on the HDS-R between the first clinic visit and 6 months later also compared scores between DS users and non-users. RESULTS: DS non-users were younger, predominantly male, had longer school education, and better total HDS-R score at the first visit. After 6 months, DS users showed significantly improved total HDS-R score and individual Serial 7 and Verbal fluency scores. Immediate memory scores were comparable between the first visit and after 6 months. Among the DS users, more frequent participation in DS was significantly associated with improved total HDS-R score. CONCLUSIONS: DS use was significantly associated with improved HDS-R scores, especially for the Serial 7 and Verbal fluency tasks, and there was no deterioration in Immediate memory score. These results suggest the usefulness of DS participation as a non-pharmacological therapy.
