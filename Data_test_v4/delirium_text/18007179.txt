18007179|a|Treatment of neurons with okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase-2A inhibitor, has been used to induce tau phosphorylation and neuronal death, and to create a research model of Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is the precursor protein of the beta-amyloid peptide that accumulates in extracellular plaques in Alzheimer's disease. Several studies have shown that mint-1 (munc18-interacting protein 1) and mint-2 bind to the YENPTY motif in the cytoplasmic domain of APP and inhibit processing of APP to beta-amyloid peptide. Here, we report that, upon neurodegeneration with okadaic acid, mint-1 and mint-2 levels were reduced by proteolytic cleavage, and that these changes were followed by increases in APP levels. We also show that the mint-1 and mint-2 cleavage and APP overexpression were prevented by calpain inhibitor-I and inhibitor-II. These results indicate that mint cleavage might play a role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.
