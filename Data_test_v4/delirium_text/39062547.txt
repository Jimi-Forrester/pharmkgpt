39062547|t|Targeting Microglia in Alzheimer's Disease: Pathogenesis and Potential Therapeutic Strategies.
39062547|a|Microglia, as resident macrophages in the central nervous system, play a multifunctional role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Their clustering around amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits is a core pathological feature of AD. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) have revealed dynamic changes in microglial phenotypes over time and across different brain regions during aging and AD progression. As AD advances, microglia primarily exhibit impaired phagocytosis of Abeta and tau, along with the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that damage synapses and neurons. Targeting microglia has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach for AD. Treatment strategies involving microglia can be broadly categorized into two aspects: (1) enhancing microglial function: This involves augmenting their phagocytic ability against Abeta and cellular debris and (2) mitigating neuroinflammation: Strategies include inhibiting TNF-alpha signaling to reduce the neuroinflammatory response triggered by microglia. Clinical trials exploring microglia-related approaches for AD treatment have garnered attention. Additionally, natural products show promise in enhancing beneficial effects and suppressing inflammatory responses. Clarifying microglial dynamics, understanding their roles, and exploring novel therapeutic approaches will advance our fight against AD.
