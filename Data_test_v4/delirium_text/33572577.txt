33572577|a|Cancer development involves both genetic and epigenetic alterations. Aberrant epigenetic modifications are reversible, allowing excellent opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Nowadays, several epigenetic drugs are used worldwide to treat, e.g., myelodysplastic syndromes and leukemias. However, overcoming resistance and widening the therapeutic profiles are the most important challenges faced by traditional epigenetic drugs. Recently, novel approaches to epigenetic therapies have been proposed. Next-generation epigenetic drugs, with longer half-life and better bioavailability, are being developed and tested. Since epigenetic phenomena are interdependent, treatment modalities include co-administration of two different epigenetic drugs. In order to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy, epigenetic drugs are administered prior to chemotherapy, or both epigenetic drug and chemotherapy are used together to achieve synergistic effects and maximize treatment efficacy. The combinations of epigenetic drug with immunotherapy are being tested, because they have proved to enhance antitumor immune responses. The next approach involves targeting the metabolic causes of epigenetic changes, i.e., enzymes which, when mutated, produce oncometabolites. Finally, epigenome editing makes it possible to modify individual chromatin marks at a defined region with unprecedented specificity and efficiency. This review summarizes the above attempts in fulfilling the promise of epigenetic drugs in the effective cancer treatment.
