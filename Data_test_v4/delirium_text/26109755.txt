26109755|a|CONTEXT: Eryngium planum, Geum urbanum and Cnicus benedictus plants are an endemic botanical from the Romanian used in folk medicine. OBJECTIVE: The extracts from three Romanian medicinal plants were investigated for their possible neuroprotective potential. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Within this study, in vitro neuroprotective activity of the extracts of E. planum, G. urbanum, and C. benedictus plants were investigated via inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and tyrosinase (TYR). Total content of phenolics, flavonoids, and proanthocyanidins, high-performance liquid chromatography profile of the main phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity were also determined. RESULTS: Among the tested extracts, the best inhibition of AChE (88.76 +- 5.2%) and TYR (88.5 +- 5.2%) was caused by C. benedictus ethanol (EtOH) extract. The G. urbanum extracts exerted remarkable scavenging effect against 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (IC50, 7.8 +- 0.5 mug/mL aqueous extract, and IC50, 1.3 +- 0.1 mug/mL EtOH extract, respectively) and reducing power, whereas the EtOH extract of C. benedictus showed high scavenging activity (IC50, 0.609 +- 0.04 mg/mL), also. CONCLUSION: According to our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates in vitro neuroprotective effects of E. planum, G. urbanum and C. benedictus.
