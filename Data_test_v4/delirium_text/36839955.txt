36839955|t|Polymeric Systems for the Controlled Release of Flavonoids.
36839955|a|Flavonoids are natural compounds that are attracting great interest in the biomedical field thanks to the wide spectrum of their biological properties. Their employment as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic drugs, as well as for many other pharmacological applications, is extensively investigated. One of the most successful ways to increase their therapeutic efficacy is to encapsulate them into a polymeric matrix in order to control their concentration in the physiological fluids for a prolonged time. The aim of this article is to provide an updated overview of scientific literature on the polymeric systems developed so far for the controlled release of flavonoids. The different classes of flavonoids are described together with the polymers most commonly employed for drug delivery applications. Representative drug delivery systems are discussed, highlighting the most common techniques for their preparation. The flavonoids investigated for polymer system encapsulation are then presented with their main source of extraction and biological properties. Relevant literature on their employment in this context is reviewed in relationship to the targeted pharmacological and biomedical applications.
