38507698|a|OBJECTIVES: The clinical characteristics and early outcomes of surgical repair in octogenarians with acute type A aortic dissection were compared with those in nonoctogenarians. METHODS: All patients who underwent emergency surgical repair for acute type A aortic dissection in our institution between 2003 and 2022 were included in this study. The patients were divided into an octogenarian group and a nonoctogenarian group. The patients in the two groups were propensity-score matched at a ratio of 1:1. Before matching, the baseline characteristics were compared between two groups. The major complication and 30-day mortality rates were compared in the matched population. RESULTS: A total of 495 patients were screened, and 471 were included in the analysis, with 48 in the octogenarian group and 423 in the nonoctogenarian group. Before matching, DeBakey type II dissection was significantly more prevalent in the octogenarians (42% vs 14% in the octogenarians and nonoctogenarians, respectively, P < 0.001). Additionally, intramural haematomas (39.6% vs 14.4%, P < 0.001) were more prevalent in the octogenarians. However, severe aortic regurgitation (4.2% vs 15.4%, P = 0.046) and root enlargement (0% vs 13.7%, P = 0.009) were less prevalent in the octogenarians. After matching (36 pairs), the incidence of postoperative delirium was higher in the octogenarians (56% vs 25%, P = 0.027). However, there were no significant differences in 30-day and in-hospital mortality rates, intensive care unit stay, or major complications, including stroke, paraplegia, respiratory complications, mediastinitis and haemodialysis. CONCLUSIONS: The octogenarians with acute type A aortic dissection had higher incidences of DeBakey type II dissection and intramural haematomas and lower incidences of severe aortic regurgitation and aortic root enlargement than the nonoctogenarians. Being an octogenarian was not associated with an increased risk of early major complications or mortality after surgery for acute type A aortic dissection.
