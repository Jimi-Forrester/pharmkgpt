35160048|t|New Recovery Strategies in Motor and Cognitive Functions, before, during and after Home-Confinement COVID-19, for Healthy Adults and Patients with Neurodegenerative Diseases: Review.
35160048|a|Distancing and confinement at home during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has led to worsening of motor and cognitive functions, both for healthy adults and for patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The decrease in physical activity, the cessation of the intervention of the recovery and the social distance imposed by the lockdown, has had a negative impact on the physical and mental health, quality of life, daily activities, as well as on the behavioral attitudes of the diet. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the impact of decreasing physical activity and the affected emotional status in healthy adults and patients with neurodegenerative diseases in conditions imposed by the stay at home mandate of COVID-19, along with new interventions, such as telemedicine and telerehabilitation. These interventions include online surveys carried out in multi-languages, semi-structured interviews, intervention smartphones and interventions through online platforms, for instance: Google, WhatsApp, Twitter, ResearchGate, Facebook and LinkedIn. For this study, we selected original papers that were intensively processed using characteristics co-related with physical activity, mental wellbeing, sleep quality, good eating behavior and healthy lifestyle. By searching the last two years of literature, our review presents and demonstrates the benefit of online technological interventions in lockdown, which promote physical exercise patterns and rehabilitation techniques, for healthy adults and patients with neurodegenerative diseases, and the need to develop new strategic directions and governmental measures, designed procedures and health services, which are expected to improve the quality of life, the progress of physical and cognitive functions, mental health and wellbeing for all.
