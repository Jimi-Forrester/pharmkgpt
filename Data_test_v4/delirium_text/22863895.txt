22863895|t|Factors related to postoperative delirium in patients with lower limb ischaemia: a prospective cohort study.
22863895|a|OBJECTIVES: To preoperatively determine candidates at definitive risk of postoperative delirium (POD), we identified relevant factors in patients with arteriosclerosis obliterans who underwent bypass surgery. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 299 patients (age >= 60 years) who underwent bypasses in 1995-2006 were enrolled. Cognitive impairment was assessed by the Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale, the Confusion Assessment Method was also used, and severity was graded as Grade I-III (mild to severe) based on the Delirium Rating Scale. All patients were followed for 3 years. RESULTS: POD occurred in 88 patients (29%), with a median age of 75 (10) years (IQR). Onset was 2 (1) days postoperatively, and a duration of 2 (2) days was observed. POD was hyperactive in 89% and was Grade I, II, and III in 11%, 68%, and 21% respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified the following risk factors for POD: age >= 72 years (<0.0001), end-stage renal failure (0.001), multiple occlusive lesions (<0.0001), cognitive impairment (0.003), and critical limb ischaemia (0.034). The 3-year survival rate was similar when comparing POD and non-POD patients (84% vs. 88%, NS). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified 5 risk factors for POD in patients undergoing bypasses for limb ischaemia. Long-term outcomes were similar when comparing the patients who experienced POD with those who did not.
