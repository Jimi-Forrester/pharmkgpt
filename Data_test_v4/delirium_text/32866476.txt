32866476|t|State-dependent sequential allostery exhibited by chaperonin TRiC/CCT revealed by network analysis of Cryo-EM maps.
32866476|a|The eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC/CCT plays a major role in assisting the folding of many proteins through an ATP-driven allosteric cycle. Recent structures elucidated by cryo-electron microscopy provide a broad view of the conformations visited at various stages of the chaperonin cycle, including a sequential activation of its subunits in response to nucleotide binding. But we lack a thorough mechanistic understanding of the structure-based dynamics and communication properties that underlie the TRiC/CCT machinery. In this study, we present a computational methodology based on elastic network models adapted to cryo-EM density maps to gain a deeper understanding of the structure-encoded allosteric dynamics of this hexadecameric machine. We have analysed several structures of the chaperonin resolved in different states toward mapping its conformational landscape. Our study indicates that the overall architecture intrinsically favours cooperative movements that comply with the structural variabilities observed in experiments. Furthermore, the individual subunits CCT1-CCT8 exhibit state-dependent sequential events at different states of the allosteric cycle. For example, in the ATP-bound state, subunits CCT5 and CCT4 selectively initiate the lid closure motions favoured by the overall architecture; whereas in the apo form of the heteromer, the subunit CCT7 exhibits the highest predisposition to structural change. The changes then propagate through parallel fluxes of allosteric signals to neighbours on both rings. The predicted state-dependent mechanisms of sequential activation provide new insights into TRiC/CCT intra- and inter-ring signal transduction events.
