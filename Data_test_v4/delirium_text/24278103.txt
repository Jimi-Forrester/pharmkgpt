24278103|a|OBJECTIVE: Many studies have shown that magnetic fields (MF) inhibit tumor growth and influence the function of immune system. However, the effect of MF on mechanism of immunological function in tumor-bearing mice is still unclear. METHODS: In this study, tumor-bearing mice were prepared by subcutaneously inoculating Balb/c mice with hepatocarcinoma cell line H22. The mice were then exposed to a low frequency MF (0.4 T, 7.5 Hz) for 30 days. Survival rate, tumor growth and the innate and adaptive immune parameters were measured. RESULTS: MF treatment could prolong survival time (n = 28, p<0.05) and inhibit tumor growth (n = 9, p<0.01) in tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, this MF suppressed tumor-induced production of cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6), granulocyte colony- stimulating factor (G-CSF) and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) (n = 9-10, p<0.05 or 0.01). Furthermore, MF exposure was associated with activation of macrophages and dendritic cells, enhanced profiles of CD4(+) T and CD8(+) T lymphocytes, the balance of Th17/Treg and reduced inhibitory function of Treg cells (n = 9-10, p<0.05 or 0.01) in the mice model. CONCLUSION: The inhibitory effect of MF on tumor growth was related to the improvement of immune function in the tumor-bearing mice.
