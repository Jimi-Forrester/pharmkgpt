11598638|a|This review covers the observations that erythrocyte spectrin has a E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymatic activity that allows it to transfer ubiquitin to a target site in the alpha-spectrin repeats 20/21. The position of this ubiquitination site suggests that ubiquitination may regulate alpha beta spectrin heterodimer nucleation, spectrin-4.1-actin ternary complex formation, and adducin stimulated spectrin-actin attachment in the mature erythrocyte. In sickle cells, which contain altered redox status (high GSSG/GSH ratio), ubiquitin attachment to the E2 and target sites in alpha-spectrin is greatly diminished. We propose that this attenuated ubiquitination of spectrin may be due to glutathiolation of the E2 active site cysteine leading to diminished ubiquitin-spectrin adduct and conjugate formation. Furthermore we propose that lack of ubiquitin-spectrin complex formation leads to dysregulation of the membrane skeleton in mature SS erythrocytes and may diminish spectrin turnover in SS erythropoietic cells via the ubiquitin proteasome machinery. In hippocampal neurons, spectrin is the major ubiquitinated protein and a component of the cytoplasmic ubiquitinated inclusions observed in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The two primary neuronal spectrin isoforms: alpha SpI Sigma*/beta SpI Sigma 2 and alpha SpII Sigma 1/beta SpII Sigma 1 are both ubiquitinated. Future work will resolve whether neuronal spectrins also contain E2-ubiquitin conjugating activity and the molecular basis for formation of ubiquitinated inclusions in neurological disorders.
