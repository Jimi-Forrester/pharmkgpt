25642432|a|OBJECTIVE: The prominent histopathological feature of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the presence of intracellular inclusions in degenerating neurons and their axons. The appearance and localization of these pathological structures depend on an aggregated protein that forms their scaffold. We investigated if gamma-synuclein, an aggregation-prone protein highly expressed in healthy motor neurons, and predominantly localized in their axons and synaptic terminals is involved in ALS pathology. METHODS: Immunostaining of histological sections and sequential protein extraction from postmortem neural samples followed by immunoblotting. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical screening revealed a subset of sporadic (9 of 31) and familial (8 of 23) ALS cases with a novel type of pathology characterized by the accumulation of gamma-synuclein in distinct profiles within the dorsolateral column. Sequential fractionation of proteins from the spinal cord tissues revealed detergent-insoluble gamma-synuclein species specifically in the dorsolateral corticospinal tracts of a ALS patient with gamma-synuclein-positive profiles in this region. These profiles are negative for protein markers commonly found in pathological inclusions in the spinal cord of ALS patients and most probably represent degenerated axons of upper motor neurons that have lost their neurofilaments. A subset of these profiles was found in association with phagocytic cells positive for Mac-2/Galectin-3. A smaller subset of studied ALS cases (4 of 54) contained large cytoplasmic inclusions in the cell body of remaining spinal motor neurons. INTERPRETATION: Our observations suggest that pathological aggregation of gamma-synuclein might contribute to the pathogenesis of ALS.
