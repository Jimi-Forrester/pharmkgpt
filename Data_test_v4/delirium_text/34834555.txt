34834555|t|Sleep Dysfunction in COVID-19 Patients: Prevalence, Risk Factors, Mechanisms, and Management.
34834555|a|During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to establish the prevalence of sleep dysfunction and psychological distress, identify predisposing and protective factors, and explore effective management strategies remains an important priority. Evidence to date suggests that a considerable proportion of COVID-19 patients experience significant sleep disturbances (estimated to afflict up to 50-75%) as well as psychological distress such as depression, anxiety, and traumatic stress. Duration of hospitalization, pre-existing mental health concerns, lower absolute lymphocyte count, and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio have been all associated with a greater risk of sleep dysfunction in infected and hospitalized patients. Furthermore, in this review, we discuss the link between sleep deprivation, susceptibility to viral infections, and psychosocial wellbeing in relevance to COVID-19 and summarize the existing evidence regarding the presence and role of sleep apnea in infected individuals. Finally, we highlight the importance of suitable interventions in order to prevent and manage sleep dysfunction and avoid long-term physical and psychological implications. Future research should aim to provide high-quality information including in high risk, underserved, or difficult to reach populations and on the long-term consequences and effectiveness of applied interventions.
