31011557|a|Male sex is more prone to cerebrovascular disorders, yet the exact role of androgens in cerebral ischemia remains unclear. Here we reviewed current understanding of testosterone (TES) neuroprotective activity against ischemic stroke and mechanisms underlying these effects in aging. TES may exert a neuroprotective effect in aging through pathways including inhibition of oxidant molecules production, enhancing the enzymatic antioxidant capacity of the brain and modulation of apoptotic cell death. Given this, a better understanding of the neuroprotective roles of TES may propose an effective therapeutic strategy to improve the quality of life and decrease androgen-related cerebrovascular problems in the aging men.
