37801487|a|OBJECTIVE: Few studies have comprehensively examined how health and disease risk influence Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers. The present study examined the association of 14 protein-based health indicators with plasma and neuroimaging biomarkers of AD and neurodegeneration. METHODS: In 706 cognitively normal adults, we examined whether 14 protein-based health indices (i.e., SomaSignal Tests [SSTs]) were associated with concurrently measured plasma-based biomarkers of AD pathology (Abeta42/40 , pTau-181), neuronal injury (neurofilament light chain [NfL]), and reactive astrogliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), brain volume, and cortical Abeta and tau. In a separate cohort (n = 11,285) we examined whether protein-based health indicators associated with neurodegeneration also predict 25-year dementia risk. RESULTS: Greater protein-based risk for cardiovascular disease, heart failure mortality, and kidney disease was associated with lower Abeta42/40 and higher pTau-181, NfL, and GFAP levels, even in individuals without cardiovascular or kidney disease. Proteomic indicators of body fat percentage, lean body mass, and visceral fat were associated with pTau-181, NfL, and GFAP, whereas resting energy rate was negatively associated with NfL and GFAP. Together, these health indicators predicted 12%, 31%, 50%, and 33% of plasma Abeta42/40 , pTau-181, NfL, and GFAP levels, respectively. Only protein-based measures of cardiovascular risk were associated with reduced regional brain volumes; these measures predicted 25-year dementia risk, even among those without clinically defined cardiovascular disease. INTERPRETATION: Subclinical peripheral health may influence AD and neurodegenerative disease processes and relevant biomarker levels, particularly NfL. Cardiovascular health, even in the absence of clinically defined disease, plays a central role in brain aging and dementia. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
