34742016|t|Therapeutic potential of quinazoline derivatives for Alzheimer's disease: A comprehensive review.
34742016|a|Quinazolines are considered as a promising class of bioactive heterocyclic compounds with broad properties. Particularly, the quinazoline scaffold has an impressive role in the design and synthesis of new CNS-active drugs. The drug-like properties and pharmacological characteristics of quinazoline could lead to different drugs with various targets. Among CNS disorders, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with memory loss, cognitive decline and language dysfunction. AD is a complex and multifactorial disease therefore, the need for finding multi-target drugs against this devastative disease is urgent. A literature survey revealed that quinazoline derivatives have diverse therapeutic potential for AD as modulators/inhibitors of beta-amyloid, tau protein, cholinesterases, monoamine oxidases, and phosphodiesterases as well as other protective effects. Thus, we describe here the most relevant and recent studies about anti-AD agents with quinazoline structure which can further aid the development and discovery of new anti-AD agents.
