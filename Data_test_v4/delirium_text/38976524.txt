38976524|t|Incidence of Adverse Events Using Flumazenil in Patients With Iatrogenic Benzodiazepine Delirium: A Retrospective Study.
38976524|a|BACKGROUND: Flumazenil is a competitive benzodiazepine (BZD) antagonist most used for treating delirium in BZD overdoses. Since its introduction, many have expressed concerns about its safety secondary to the risk of inducing BZD withdrawal and refractory seizures. STUDY QUESTION: What is the incidence of adverse drug events after the administration of flumazenil in patients with suspected iatrogenic BZD delirium? STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from a single center from 2010 to 2013. Patients experiencing delirium after receiving BZDs in the hospital were included if they had a bedside toxicology consult and were administered flumazenil. Patients were excluded if they were given BZDs for ethanol withdrawal or if they did not have mental status documentation before and after flumazenil administration. Descriptive statistics were calculated. MEASURES AND OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was the incidence of adverse drug events after flumazenil administration. The secondary outcome was the efficacy of flumazenil determined by the patient's mental status. RESULTS: A total of 501 patient records were reviewed, and 206 patients were included in the final analysis. Of those patients, 172 (83.5%) experienced an objective improvement in their mental status within 1 hour after flumazenil administration. A total of 5 patients experienced adverse events (2.4%), 95% confidence interval (0.78, 5.54). Of these, 3 patients experienced minor agitation or restlessness without pharmacologic intervention. Two patients experienced moderate agitation or restlessness that resolved with haloperidol or physostigmine administration. No patients had a reported seizure, 95% confidence interval (0.0, 1.77). CONCLUSIONS: Flumazenil seems to be a safe and effective intervention for the reversal of delirium secondary to iatrogenic BZD administration.
