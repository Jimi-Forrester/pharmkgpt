23279783|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Beta-amyloid (Abeta)-mediated inflammation contributes to the progression and chronicity of Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the exact mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG) could inhibit Abeta-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo and to explore the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Abeta(1-42)  was injected to bilateral hippocampus of mice to make the AD models in vivo. The levels of mRNA and protein of inflammatory cytokines were measured by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The viability of SH-SY5Y and HT-22 cells was determined by MTT. NF-kappaB p65 translocation was analyzed by Western blotting and immunostaining. Phosphorylation of ERK, p38, and JNK was tested by Western blotting. RESULTS: DG suppressed Abeta(1-42) -induced activation of microglia and inflammation in vitro and in vivo. The media from Abeta(1-42) -activated microglia decreased the viability of SH-SY5Y and HT-22 cells, but it was rescued when pretreated with DG. DG could inhibit the activation of MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways and attenuate the memory deficits in Abeta(1-42) -induced AD mice. CONCLUSIONS: DG protects Abeta(1-42) -induced AD models in vitro and in vivo through reducing activation of microglia and inflammation, which may be involved in MAPK and NF-kappaB pathways.
