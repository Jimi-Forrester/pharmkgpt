18803653|t|CSF levels of beta-amyloid 1-42, tau and phosphorylated tau protein in CADASIL.
18803653|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) can be considered a useful model of pure subcortical vascular dementia (SVD) because it occurs in young adults, unlikely to have concomitant age- and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related pathology. In patients with CADASIL we evaluated the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta42), total tau protein (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau protein (p-tau), which are well-accepted biomarkers of AD. METHODS: The CSF Abeta42, t-tau and p-tau levels were determined with Innotest beta-amyloid 1-42, Innotest hTAU-Ag and Innotest Phospho-tau 181p sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay, in 10 CADASIL patients and 17 healthy age-matched subjects. A case-control statistical analysis was carried out. RESULTS: CSF Abeta42 levels were significantly lower in CADASIL patients than in controls, whereas CSF t-tau and p-tau levels did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern found in CADASIL patients is similar to that reported in those with sporadic SVD, suggesting that decreased CSF Abeta42 might be related to the subcortical vascular lesions in the white matter.
