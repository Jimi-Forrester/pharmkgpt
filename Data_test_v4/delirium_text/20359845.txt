Preoperative anxiety, emergence delirium, and postoperative behavior changes are all manifestations of psychological distress in children undergoing surgery. Preoperative anxiety is most prominent during anaesthesia induction. Emergence delirium is frequent and somewhat independent of pain levels. Postoperative behavior changes most often include separation anxiety, tantrums, fear of strangers, eating problems, nightmares, night terrors and bedwetting. These difficulties tend to resolve themselves with time but can last up to one year in some children. The major risk factors for postoperative behavior problems are young age, prior negative experience with hospitals or medical care, certain kinds of hospitalization, postoperative pain, parental anxiety, and certain personality traits of the child. Currently, tools exist for quantifying anxiety (m-YPAS) and postoperative behavior (PHBQ). It is possible to identify those children who are at risk for postoperative complications during the preanaesthesia consultation by paying close attention to children under six years with higher levels of emotionality and impulsivity and poorer socialization skills with anxious parents. Suggested strategies for reducing child distress include preoperative preparation, premedication, parental presence during anaesthesia induction, and interventions affecting the child's environment, such as hypnosis. There are numerous ways to provide preoperative preparation (information, modeling, role playing, encouraging effective coping) and their effectiveness is proven in the preoperative setting but not during anaesthesia induction or in the operating room. Midazolam has been shown to be an effective preoperative sedative for reducing anxiety. Parental presence during induction has been shown to effectively reduce preoperative anxiety in children in certain contexts (when the parent is calm and the child is anxious). It is worthwhile if it is integrated into a family-centered anxiety management program and remains one of several options offered to families. Overall, taking into account the child's psychological needs should be considered an essential part of paediatric anaesthesia. Tools and techniques are available for assessing and managing the perioperative distress experienced by children.
