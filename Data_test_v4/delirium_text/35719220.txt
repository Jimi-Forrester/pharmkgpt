35719220|a|Children treated in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) are at risk of distress and pain. This study investigated if aromatherapy massage can reduce children's distress and improve comfort. This observational before-after study was performed in a 22-bed PICU in Cape Town, South Africa. The aromatherapy massage consisted of soft massaging using the "M-technique" and a 1% blend of essential oils of Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), German Chamomile (Matricatia recutita) and Neroli (Citrus aurantium) mixed with a grapeseed carrier oil. All present children were eligible, except those who had recently returned, were asleep or deemed unstable. The primary outcome was distress measured with the COMFORT-Behavior scale (COMFORT-B). Secondary outcomes were heart rate, oxygen saturation (SatO2), the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)-Anxiety and pain assessed by the NRS-Pain scale. Outcomes variables were evaluated with Wilcoxon signed-rank test and multiple regression analysis. The intervention was applied to 111 children, fifty-one of whom (45.9%) were younger than three years old. The group median COMFORT-B score before intervention was 15 (IQR 12-19), versus 10 (IQR 6-14) after intervention. Heart rate and NRS-Anxiety were significantly lower after the intervention (P < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that interrupted massages were less effective than the uninterrupted massages. Parental presence did not influence the outcome variables. We did not find a significant change on the NRS-Pain scale or for SatO2. Aromatherapy massage appears beneficial in reducing distress, as measured by the COMFORT-B scale, heart rate and the NRS-Anxiety scale, in critically ill children. Thus, the potential of aromatherapy in clinical practice deserves further consideration.
