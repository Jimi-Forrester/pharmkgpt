31934842|t|Chitinases: Therapeutic Scaffolds for Allergy and Inflammation.
31934842|a|BACKGROUND: Chitinases are the evolutionary conserved glycosidic enzymes that are characterized by their ability to cleave the naturally abundant polysaccharide chitin. The potential role of chitinases has been identified in the manifestation of various allergies and inflammatory diseases. In recent years, chitinases inhibitors are emerging as an alluring area of interest for the researchers and scientists and there is a dire need for the development of potential and safe chitinase antagonists for the prophylaxis and treatment of several diseases. OBJECTIVE: The present review expedites the role of chitinases and their inhibitors in inflammation and related disorders. METHODS: At first, an exhaustive survey of literature and various patents available related to chitinases were carried out. Useful information on chitinases and their inhibitor was gathered from the authentic scientific databases namely SCOPUS, EMBASE, PUBMED, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBSCO, WEB OF SCIENCE, etc. This information was further analyzed and compiled up to prepare the framework of the review article. The search strategy was conducted by using queries with key terms " chitin", "chitinase", "chitotrisidase", "acidic mammalian chitinase", "chitinase inhibitors", "asthma" and "chitinases associated inflammatory disorders", etc. The patents were searched using the key terms "chitinases and uses thereof", "chitinase inhibitors", "chitin-chitinase associated pathological disorders" etc. from www.google.com/patents, www.freepatentsonline.com, and www.scopus.com. RESULTS: The present review provides a vision for apprehending human chitinases and their participation in several diseases. The patents available also signify the extended role and effectiveness of chitinase inhibitors in the prevention and treatment of various diseases viz. asthma, acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, dental diseases, neurologic diseases, metabolic diseases, liver diseases, polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis, and cancer. In this regard, extensive pre-clinical and clinical investigations are required to develop some novel, potent and selective drug molecules for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases, allergies and cancers in the foreseeable future. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, chitinases can be used as potential biomarkers in prognosis and diagnosis of several inflammatory diseases and allergies and the design of novel chitinase inhibitors may act as key and rational scaffolds in designing some novel therapeutic agents in the treatment of variety of inflammatory diseases.
