35484241|t|Bioactive human Alzheimer brain soluble Abeta: pathophysiology and therapeutic opportunities.
35484241|a|The accumulation of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) plays an early role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The precise mechanism of how Abeta accumulation leads to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment remains unclear but is likely due to small soluble oligomers of Abeta (oAbeta). Most studies have used chemical synthetic or cell-secreted Abeta oligomers to study their pathogenic mechanisms, but the Abeta derived from human AD brain tissue is less well characterized. Here we review updated knowledge on the extraction and characterization of bioactive human AD brain oAbeta and the mechanisms by which they cause hippocampal synaptic dysfunction. Human AD brain-derived oAbeta can impair hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and enhance long-term depression (LTD). Many studies suggest that oAbeta may directly disrupt neuronal NMDA receptors, AMPA receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). oAbeta also impairs astrocytic synaptic functions, including glutamate uptake, D-serine release, and NMDA receptor function. We also discuss oAbeta-induced neuronal hyperexcitation. These results may suggest a multi-target approach for the treatment of AD, including both oAbeta neutralization and reversal of glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity.
