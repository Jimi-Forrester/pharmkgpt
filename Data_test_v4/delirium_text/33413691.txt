33413691|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) as senile plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and hyperphosphorylated tau (hp-tau) as neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. The AD-related pathology has been reported in several non-human animals, and most animals develop only the Abeta or tau pathology. We herein describe the Abeta and hp-tau pathology in the brains of aged pinniped species (seal, sea lion, and walrus). Molecular analyses revealed that the sequence of pinniped Abeta was identical to that of human Abeta. Histopathological examinations detected argyrophilic plaques composed of Abeta associated with dystrophic neurites in the cerebral cortex of aged pinnipeds. Astrogliosis and microglial infiltration were identified around Abeta plaques. Abeta deposits were observed in the blood vessel walls of the meninges and cerebrum. Pinniped tau protein was physiologically subjected to alternative splicing at exons 2, 3, and 10, and presented as five isoforms: two 3-repeat tau isoforms (1N3R, 2N3R) and three 4-repeat tau isoforms (0N4R, 1N4R, 2N4R); 0N3R tau isoform was absent. Histopathological examinations revealed argyrophilic fibrillar aggregates composed of hp-tau in the neuronal somata and neurites of aged pinniped brains. Few hp-tau aggregates were found in oligodendrocytes and microglia. Biochemically, hp-tau of the 3-repeat and 4-repeat isoforms was detected in brain sarkosyl-insoluble fractions. Abeta and hp-tau both predominantly accumulated in the neocortex, particularly the frontal cortex. Furthermore, the activation of GSK-3beta was detected within cells containing hp-tau aggregates, and activated GSK-3beta was strongly expressed in cases with severe hp-tau pathologies. The present results suggest that, in association with Abeta deposition, the activation of GSK-3beta contributes to hp-tau accumulation in pinniped brains. Here, we report that pinniped species naturally accumulate Abeta and tau with aging, similar to the human AD pathology.
