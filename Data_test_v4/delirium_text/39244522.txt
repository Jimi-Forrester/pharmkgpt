39244522|a|As the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its impact on healthcare systems increase, developing tools for accurate diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression is a priority. Recent technological advancements have allowed for the development of blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) to aid in the diagnosis of AD, but many questions remain regarding the clinical implementation of these BBMs. This review outlines the historical timeline of AD BBM development. It highlights key breakthroughs that have transformed the perspective of AD BBMs from theoretically ideal but unattainable markers, to clinically valid and reliable BBMs with potential for implementation in healthcare settings. Technological advancements like single-molecule detection and mass spectrometry methods have significantly improved assay sensitivity and accuracy. High-throughput, fully automated platforms have potential for clinical use. Despite these advancements, however, significant work is needed before AD BBMs can be implemented in widespread clinical practice. Cutpoints must be established, the influence of chronic conditions and medications on BBM levels must be better understood, and guidelines must be created for healthcare providers related to interpreting and communicating information obtained from AD BBMs. Additionally, the development of BBMs for synaptic dysfunction, inflammation, and cerebrovascular disease may provide better precision medicine approaches to treating AD and related dementia. Future research and collaboration between scientists and physicians are essential to addressing these challenges and further advancing AD BBMs, with the goal of integration in clinical practice.
