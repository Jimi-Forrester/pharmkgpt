36420045|a|OBJECTIVE:  The primary objective of this study was to determine if the addition of procalcitonin to the existing systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) scoring systems could improve the predictability of in-hospital sepsis-related mortality. Secondarily, we sought to determine if the addition of procalcitonin could predict the likelihood of ICU admission and discharge home. DESIGN: This is a retrospective, single-center, observational study that looked at data from January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2019. Patients were stratified into four groups: SIRS-positive + procalcitonin >2 ng/mL (pSIRS+), SIRS-positive + procalcitonin <=2 ng/mL (pSIRS-), qSOFA-positive + procalcitonin >2 ng/mL (pqSOFA+), and qSOFA-positive + procalcitonin <=2 ng/mL (pqSOFA-). SETTING: The study was conducted at a community hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada. PATIENTS: Patients were included in the study if they were >18 years of age and had hospital admission diagnosis of sepsis with at least one value of procalcitonin level. INTERVENTIONS: After patients which met the inclusion criteria, patients were divided into subgroups of SIRS, SIRS + procalcitonin > 2 ng/mL, qSOFA, qSOFA + procalcitonin >2 ng/mL. Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and secondary outcomes were ICU admission, length of stay, and discharge to home. RESULTS:  933 patients were included in the study with an overall mortality rate of 21.22%, an overall ICU admission rate of 56.15%, and an overall discharge home rate of 29.58%. In those identified with a sepsis-related diagnosis code, pSIRS+ predicted an in-hospital mortality rate of 31.89% compared to pSIRS- 16.15% (P < 0.0001). In regards to qSOFA, the addition of procalcitonin added no statistically significant difference in predicting in-hospital mortality. pSIRS+ patients were found to have an ICU admission rate of 76.16% and a discharge home rate of 19.20% compared to pSIRS- who had 47.40% and 34.90%, respectively (P < 0.0001). Like in our primary outcome, our data for qSOFA was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS:  Procalcitonin added utility to the SIRS scoring system in predicting sepsis-related in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, and discharge home. Procalcitonin did not add statistically significant benefit to the qSOFA scoring system in predicting sepsis-related in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, and discharge home.
