34827450|t|Capturing Neuroplastic Changes after iTBS in Patients with Post-Stroke Aphasia: A Pilot fMRI Study.
34827450|a|Intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) is a high-efficiency transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm that has been applied to post-stroke aphasia (PSA). However, its efficacy mechanisms have not been clarified. This study aimed to explore the immediate effects of iTBS of the primary motor cortex (M1) of the affected hemisphere, on the functional activities and connectivity of the brains of PSA patients. A total of 16 patients with aphasia after stroke received iTBS with 800 pulses for 300 s. All patients underwent motor, language, and cognitive assessments and resting-state functional MRI scans immediately before and after the iTBS intervention. Regional, seed-based connectivity, and graph-based measures were used to test the immediate functional effects of the iTBS intervention, including the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), degree centrality (DC), and functional connectivity (FC) of the left M1 area throughout the whole brain. The results showed that after one session of iTBS intervention, the fALFF, DC, and FC values changed significantly in the patients' brains. Specifically, the DC values were significantly higher in the right middle frontal gyrus and parts of the left parietal lobe (p < 0.05), while fALFF values were significantly lower in the right medial frontal lobe and parts of the left intracalcarine cortex (p < 0.05), and the strength of the functional connectivity between the left M1 area and the left superior frontal gyrus was reduced (p < 0.05). Our findings provided preliminary evidences that the iTBS on the ipsilesional M1 could induce neural activity and functional connectivity changes in the motor, language, and other brain regions in patients with PSA, which may promote neuroplasticity and functional recovery.
