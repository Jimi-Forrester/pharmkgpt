33790627|t|Butorphanol versus Propofol in Patients Undergoing Noninvasive Ventilation: A Prospective Observational Study.
33790627|a|BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to explore sedation management in agitated patients who suffered from acute respiratory failure (ARF) and were treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We divided 118 patients undergoing NIV treatment with butorphanol or propofol into two groups: group B (n = 57, butorphanol was initiated at the rate of 0.12 microg/kg/min as a continuous intravenous infusion and then titrated by 0.06 microg/kg/min every half an hour, group P (n = 61, propofol was initiated at the rate of 5 microg/kg/min as a continuous intravenous infusion and then titrated by 1.5 microg/kg/min every half an hour). Score of Sedation Agitation Scale (SAS) in the two groups was maintained between 3 and 4. Medications including sedative, analgesic, and antipsychotic, NIV intolerance score, SAS score, visual analog scale (VAS), medication use and adverse events were recorded repeatedly. RESULTS: Patients receiving butorphanol required significantly less total amount of fentanyl than patients receiving propofol during NIV to maintain the target VAS [0 (0-0) microg vs 150 (50-200) microg, P< 0.005]. Hemodynamic stability during NIV showed it was better kept in patients treated with butorphanol. CONCLUSION: Butorphanol not only decreased the requirements of fentanyl but also enhanced hemodynamic stability in agitated patients suffering from ARF receiving NIV.
