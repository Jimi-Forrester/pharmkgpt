38352136|a|Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the use of serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the differential diagnosis between AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: From September 2021 to October 2022, we collected venous blood from patients and healthy individuals who visited our hospital's Neurology Department, and we isolated serum to detect NfL and GFAP using direct chemiluminescence. The results were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: Pairwise comparisons among the three groups showed that compared with the health checkup (HC) group, serum NfL and GFAP were increased in both AD and MCI (PNfL < 0.05, PGFAP < 0.01). There were significant differences in GFAP between MCI and AD groups, and the level in AD group was higher (p < 0.01), while there was no difference in NfL. Both serum NfL and serum GFAP levels can independently diagnose AD (p < 0.01). The ROC curve showed that GFAP had a higher diagnostic efficacy, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.928. The cut-off values of the two serum markers for the diagnosis of AD were NfL > 40.09 pg./mL and GFAP >31.40 pg./mL. Sensitivity and specificity for NfL in the diagnosis of AD were 59.6 and 76.2%, respectively, and for GFAP, they were 90.4 and 82.1%, respectively. The combined diagnosis of GFAP and NfL improved the diagnostic efficiency (AUC = 0.931, sensitivity = 78.8%, specificity = 92.3%). The cut-off value of GFAP for the differential diagnosis of MCI and AD was 46.05 pg./mL. Conclusion: Both serum NfL and serum GFAP can be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD. Serum GFAP has better diagnostic efficacy and can distinguish AD from MCI. A combined diagnosis can improve diagnostic specificity.
