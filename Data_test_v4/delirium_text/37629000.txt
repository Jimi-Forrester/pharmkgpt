37629000|t|Bridging the Gap between Gut Microbiota and Alzheimer's Disease: A Metaproteomic Approach for Biomarker Discovery in Transgenic Mice.
37629000|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressively debilitating form of dementia that affects millions of individuals worldwide. Although a vast amount of research has investigated the complex interplay between gut microbiota and neurodegeneration, the metaproteomic effects of microbiota on AD pathogenesis remain largely uncharted territory. This study aims to reveal the role of gut microbiota in AD pathogenesis, particularly regarding changes in the proteome and molecular pathways that are intricately linked to disease progression. We operated state-of-the-art Nano-Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS) to compare the metaproteomic shifts of 3-month-old transgenic (3M-ALZ) and control (3M-ALM, Alzheimer's Littermate) mice, depicting the early onset of AD with those of 12-month-old ALZ and ALM mice displaying the late stage of AD. Combined with computational analysis, the outcomes of the gut-brain axis-focused inquiry furnish priceless knowledge regarding the intersection of gut microbiota and AD. Accordingly, our data indicate that the microbiota, proteome, and molecular changes in the intestine arise long before the manifestation of disease symptoms. Moreover, disparities exist between the normal-aged flora and the gut microbiota of late-stage AD mice, underscoring that the identified vital phyla, proteins, and pathways hold immense potential as markers for the early and late stages of AD. Our research endeavors to offer a comprehensive inquiry into the intricate interplay between gut microbiota and Alzheimer's Disease utilizing metaproteomic approaches, which have not been widely adopted in this domain. This highlights the exigency for further scientific exploration to elucidate the underlying mechanisms that govern this complex and multifaceted linkage.
