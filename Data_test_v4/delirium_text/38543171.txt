38543171|a|An increasing body of research has demonstrated the significant role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the pathogenesis of stroke. They can actively contribute to the disease's progression either by directly participating in its pathogenesis or by acting as mediators through competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanisms. Concurrently, epigenetics plays a pivotal role in the pathological mechanisms underlying stroke. Epigenetic factors serve as valuable markers for disease progression, diagnostic biomarkers, and novel therapeutic targets. One of the most prevalent epigenetic modifications is 5-methylcytosine (m5C). However, the specific profiles of 5-methylcytosine in lncRNAs associated with stroke remain to be solved. Within the scope of this research, we performed a thorough transcriptome-wide analysis of m5C methylation within lncRNAs by methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq), within a mouse stroke model induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Our findings reveal substantial disparities in both the quantity and distribution of m5C within the mouse stroke model compared to normal mice. This suggests a potential linkage between stroke and lncRNA m5C modifications, offering valuable insights into the mechanisms of stroke pathogenesis and the development of new drug targets.
