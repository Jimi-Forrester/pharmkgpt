39585065|t|Utilization of Single-Pulse Transcranial-Evoked Potentials in Neurological and Psychiatric Clinical Practice: A Narrative Review.
39585065|a|Background: The utility of single-pulse TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation)-evoked EEG (electroencephalograph) potentials (TEPs) has been extensively studied in the past three decades. TEPs have been shown to provide insights into features of cortical excitability and connectivity, reflecting mechanisms of excitatory/inhibitory balance, in various neurological and psychiatric conditions. In the present study, we sought to review and summarize the most studied neurological and psychiatric clinical indications utilizing single-pulse TEP and describe its promise as an informative novel tool for the evaluation of brain physiology. Methods: A thorough search of PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar for original research utilizing single-pulse TMS-EEG and the measurement of TEP was conducted. Our review focused on the indications and outcomes most clinically relevant, commonly studied, and well-supported scientifically. Results: We included a total of 55 publications and summarized them by clinical application. We categorized these publications into seven sub-sections: healthy aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), disorders of consciousness (DOCs), stroke rehabilitation and recovery, major depressive disorder (MDD), Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as prediction and monitoring of treatment response. Conclusions: TEP is a useful measurement of mechanisms underlying neuronal networks. It may be utilized in several clinical applications. Its most prominent uses include monitoring of consciousness levels in DOCs, monitoring and prediction of treatment response in MDD, and diagnosis of AD. Additional applications including the monitoring of stroke rehabilitation and recovery, as well as a diagnostic aid for PD, have also shown encouraging results but require further evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
