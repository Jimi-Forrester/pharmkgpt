36203072|t|Cerebral Small Vessel Disease: A Bibliometric Analysis.
36203072|a|Cerebral small vessel disease is a common neurological disease, and its incidence is increasing year by year worldwide. In recent years, research on cerebral small vessel disease has gained more and more attention. Our research aims to visualize publications to identify the hotspots and frontiers of cerebral small vessel disease research, and to provide reference and guidance for further research. Publications related to cerebral small vessel disease were searched from the Web of Science Core Collection and screened according to inclusion criteria. CiteSpace 5.8.R3 was used to evaluate and visualize results, including generating web maps and analyzing annual publications, countries, institutions, bibliographic and co-cited references, and keywords; in this article, we use CiteSpace and VOSviewer for the 2012 Cerebral small vessel disease and bibliometric analysis from January 1, 2022 to April 30, 2022. A total of 3037 papers related to cerebral small vessel disease were retrieved, and the number of published papers showed a steady upward trend. Among them, Neuroimaging standards for research into small vessel disease and its contribution to ageing and neurodegeneration, the most symbolic references in the field of cerebral small vessel disease have been cited a total of 438 times. Stroke is the most active journal (227 articles) and USA publishes up to 800 articles. Harvard Med SchUniv Edinburgh (133 papers) and Charidimou (85 papers) are the institutions and authors who have made the most contributions in this field, respectively. Among the keywords, most of them are related to the pathogenesis of cerebral small vessel disease. After 2018, gut-brain axis and cortex are the keywords with the strongest number of cited outbreaks. There is increasing evidence that cerebral small vessel disease is a research frontier and may remain a research hotspot in the future.
