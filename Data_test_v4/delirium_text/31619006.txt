31619006|t|Kynurenines and the Endocannabinoid System in Schizophrenia: Common Points and Potential Interactions.
31619006|a|Schizophrenia, which affects around 1% of the world's population, has been described as a complex set of symptoms triggered by multiple factors. However, the exact background mechanisms remain to be explored, whereas therapeutic agents with excellent effectivity and safety profiles have yet to be developed. Kynurenines and the endocannabinoid system (ECS) play significant roles in both the development and manifestation of schizophrenia, which have been extensively studied and reviewed previously. Accordingly, kynurenines and the ECS share multiple features and mechanisms in schizophrenia, which have yet to be reviewed. Thus, the present study focuses on the main common points and potential interactions between kynurenines and the ECS in schizophrenia, which include (i) the regulation of glutamatergic/dopaminergic/gamma-aminobutyric acidergic neurotransmission, (ii) their presence in astrocytes, and (iii) their role in inflammatory mechanisms. Additionally, promising pharmaceutical approaches involving the kynurenine pathway and the ECS will be reviewed herein.
