36777903|t|Pulmonary embolism presenting as delirium: an acute confusional state in an elderly patient-a case report.
36777903|a|Background: Large numbers of elderly patients are admitted to hospitals in acute confusional states. In many, the underlying causes are easily found; in some, correct diagnosis is difficult. Pulmonary embolism (PE), the most serious clinical presentation of venous thromboembolism, is often misdiagnosed because of its non-specific features including delirium. Case presentation: A 73-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital in a confused state with no obvious risk factors of PE. D-dimer levels were elevated and contrast-enhanced high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest confirmed the diagnosis of PE. She was treated with enoxaparin and discharged on dabigatran. Her symptoms had resolved at the time of discharge, and she has been stable for over three month's follow-up visit. Conclusion: PE should be regarded as a differential in elderly patients with an acute confusional state despite the absence of obvious risk factors. Investigating for and treating when confirmed may save a life.
