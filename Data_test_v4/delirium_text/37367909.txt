37367909|a|The monoterpene 1,8-Cineol is a natural plant-based therapeutic agent that is commonly applied to treat different inflammatory diseases due to its mucolytic, anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties. It has become increasingly clear in the recent years that 1,8-Cineol spreads almost everywhere in the human body after its oral administration, from the gut to the blood to the brain. Its anti-microbial potential and even its anti-viral effects have been observed to include numerous bacteria and fungi species. Many recent studies help to better understand the cellular and molecular immunological consequences of 1,8-Cineol treatment in inflammatory diseases and further provide information concerning the mechanistic modes of action in the regulation of distinct inflammatory biosynthetic pathways. This review aims to present a holistic and understandable overview of the different aspects of 1,8-Cineol in infections and inflammation.
