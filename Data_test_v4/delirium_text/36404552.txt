36404552|a|Possin and Rosen provide a robust commentary exploring the challenges of using caregivers as cognitive testers. Informants have an important and often overlooked role in diagnosing cognitive impairment. O'Caoimh et al. show they can support cognitive screening in advance of clinic, suggesting new research avenues including the potential for home-monitoring. Although concerns testing may engender bias, introduce practice effects, and impact patient autonomy are valid and require examination, these should be viewed in light of patient preference, clinical need, and the broader ethics of assessing dementia. The importance of distinguishing concerns over accuracy and ethical appropriateness is also discussed.
