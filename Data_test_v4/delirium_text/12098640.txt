12098640|t|Association of monoamine oxidase A gene polymorphism with Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body variant.
12098640|a|The association between (GT)n dinucleotide repeats in monoamine oxidase gene loci, monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and B (MAOB), and Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Lewy body variant (LBV) of AD were determined. MAOA-GT polymorphisms were significantly associated with pure AD and LBV. MAOA-GT allele 113 was excessively represented in pure AD and LBV compared with controls. Furthermore, the frequency of females homozygous for MAOA-GT allele 113 was higher in pure AD and LBV than controls by 2.79- and 2.77-fold, respectively. In contrast, there was no association between MAOA-GT or MAOB-GT polymorphisms and PD. These results suggest that polymorphisms within the MAOA gene may have implication in AD pathology shared by pure AD and LBV.
