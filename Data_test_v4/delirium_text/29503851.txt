29503851|t|An efficient preparation of labelling precursor of [11C]L-deprenyl-D2 and automated radiosynthesis.
29503851|a|BACKGROUND: The synthesis of [11C]L-deprenyl-D2 for imaging of astrocytosis with positron emission tomography (PET) in neurodegenerative diseases has been previously reported. [11C]L-deprenyl-D2 radiosynthesis requires a precursor, L-nordeprenyl-D2, which has been previously synthesized from L-amphetamine as starting material with low overall yields. Here, we present an efficient synthesis of L-nordeprenyl-D2 organic precursor as free base and automated radiosynthesis of [11C]L-deprenyl-D2 for PET imaging of astrocytosis. The L-nordeprenyl-D2 precursor was synthesized from the easily commercial available and cheap reagent L-phenylalanine in five steps. Next, N-alkylation of L-nordeprenyl-D2 free base with [11C]MeOTf was optimized using the automated commercial platform GE TRACERlab  FX C Pro. RESULTS: A simple and efficient synthesis of L-nordeprenyl-D2 precursor of [11C]L-deprenyl-D2 as free base has been developed in five synthetic steps with an overall yield of 33%. The precursor as free base has been stable for 9 months stored at low temperature (-20  C). The labelled product was obtained with 44 +- 13% (n = 12) (end of synthesis, decay corrected) radiochemical yield from [11C]MeI after 35 min synthesis time. The radiochemical purity was over 99% in all cases and specific activity was (170 +- 116) GBq/mumol. CONCLUSIONS: A high-yield synthesis of [11C]L-deprenyl-D2 has been achieved with high purity and specific activity. L-nordeprenyl-D2 precursor as free amine was applicable for automated production in a commercial synthesis module for preclinical and clinical application.
