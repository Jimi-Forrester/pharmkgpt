35031512|a|Dementia, in particular, is a defining feature of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Because of the combination of motor and cognitive impairments, Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) has a greater impact on affected people than Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) and others. If one family member develops dementia, the other members will suffer greatly in terms of social and occupational functioning. Currently, no relevant treatment is available based on an examination of the absolute pathophysiology of dementia. As a result, our objective of current review encouraged to look for dementia pharmacotherapy based on their pathogenesis. We systematically searched electronic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and ESCI for information on the pathophysiology of demetia, as well as their treatment with allopathic and herbal medications. By modulating intermediate proteins, oxidative stress, viral protein corona, and MMP9 are etiological factors that cause dementia. The pathophysiology of ADD was described by two hypotheses: the amyloid cascade hypothesis and the tau and tangle hypothesis. ADD is caused by an increase in amyloid-beta (Abeta) and neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebrum. The viral protein corona (VPC) is more contagious and helps to form amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebrum. Thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) inside the BBB encourages Abeta to become more engaged. PDD is caused by decreased or absent dopamine secretion from nerve cells in the substantia nigra, as well as PRKN gene deletion/duplication mutations, and shift in the PRKN-PACRG organisation, all of which are linked to ageing. This article discussed the pathophysiology of dementia, as well as a list of herbal medications that can easily cross the BBB and have a therapeutic effect on dementia.
