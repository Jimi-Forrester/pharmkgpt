24645917|t|Nurses' knowledge and practices in cases of acute and chronic confusion: a questionnaire survey.
24645917|a|PURPOSE: This study aimed to describe nurses' knowledge and practices toward patients with acute or chronic confusion. DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used, and 249 nurses engaged in clinical practice fulfilled an online self-report questionnaire. FINDINGS: Tools for diagnosing acute confusion/delirium are never used by 57.80% of the nurses. Between 80% and 81% of nursing interventions involve managing patients' physical environment and between 62% and 71% deal with managing communication. Theoretical training in the use of tools for assessing and intervening in cases of confusion was significantly associated with nurses' knowledge and practices. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: These results suggest the need for increased investment in nurses' training.
