35351090|t|Walking orientation randomness metric (WORM) score: pilot study of a novel gait parameter to assess walking stability and discriminate fallers from non-fallers using wearable sensors.
35351090|a|BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal disorders can contribute to injurious falls and incur significant societal and healthcare burdens. Identification of fallers from non-fallers through wearable-based gait analysis can facilitate timely intervention to assist mobility and prevent falls whilst improving care and attention for high fall-risk patients. In this study, we use wearable sensor-based gait analysis to introduce a novel variable to assess walking stability in fallers and non-fallers - the Walking Orientation Randomness Metric. The WORM score quantifies the stability, or 'figure-of-eight' motion of a subject's trunk during walking as an indicator of a falls-predictive (pathological) gait. METHODS: WORM is calculated as the 'figure-of-eight' oscillation mapped out in the transverse-plane by the upper body's centre-point during a walking bout. A sample of patients presenting to the Prince of Wales Hospital (Sydney, Australia) with a primary diagnosis of "falls for investigation" and age-matched healthy controls (non-fallers) from the community were recruited. Participants were fitted at the sternal angle with the wearable accelerometer, MetaMotionC (Mbientlab Inc., USA) and walked unobserved (at self-selected pace) for 5-50 m along an obstacle-free, carpeted hospital corridor. RESULTS: Participants comprised of 16 fallers (mean age: 70 + 17) and 16 non-fallers (mean age: 70 + 9) based on a recent fall(s) history. The (median) WORM score was 17-fold higher (p < 0.001) in fallers (3.64 cm) compared to non-fallers (0.21 cm). ROC curve analyses demonstrate WORM can discriminate fallers from non-fallers (AUC = 0.97). Diagnostic analyses (cut-off > 0.51 cm) show high sensitivity (88%) and specificity (94%). CONCLUSION: In this pilot study we have introduced the WORM score, demonstrating its discriminative performance in a preliminary sample size of 16 fallers. WORM is a novel gait metric assessing walking stability as measured by truncal way during ambulation and shows promise for objective and clinical evaluation of fallers.
