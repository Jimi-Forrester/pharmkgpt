39596443|a|Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by mitochondria dysfunction, accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques, and hyperphosphorylated tau tangles in the brain leading to memory loss and cognitive deficits. There is currently no cure for this condition, but the potential of stem cells for the therapy of neurodegenerative pathologies is actively being researched. This review discusses preclinical and clinical studies that have used mouse models and human patients to investigate the use of novel types of stem cell treatment approaches. The findings provide valuable insights into the applications of stem cell-based therapies and include the use of neural, glial, mesenchymal, embryonic, and induced pluripotent stem cells. We cover current studies on stem cell replacement therapy where cells can functionally integrate into neural networks, replace damaged neurons, and strengthen impaired synaptic circuits in the brain. We address the paracrine action of stem cells acting via secreted factors to induce neuroregeneration and modify inflammatory responses. We focus on the neuroprotective functions of exosomes as well as their neurogenic and synaptogenic effects. We look into the shuttling of mitochondria through tunneling nanotubes that enables the transfer of healthy mitochondria by restoring the normal functioning of damaged cells, improving their metabolism, and reducing the level of apoptosis.
