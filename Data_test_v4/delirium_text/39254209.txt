39254209|a|INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation algorithms make it possible to study detailed medial temporal lobe (MTL) substructures as hippocampal subfields and amygdala subnuclei, offering opportunities to develop biomarkers for preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: We identified the MTL substructures significantly associated with tau-positron emission tomography (PET) signal in 581 non-demented individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-3). We confirmed our results in our UCLouvain cohort including 110 non-demented individuals by comparing volumes between individuals with different visual Braak's stages and clinical diagnosis. RESULTS: Four amygdala subnuclei (cortical, central, medial, and accessory basal) were associated with tau in amyloid beta-positive (Abeta+) clinically normal (CN) individuals, while the global amygdala and hippocampal volumes were not. Using UCLouvain data, we observed that both Braak I-II and Abeta+ CN individuals had smaller volumes in these subnuclei, while no significant difference was observed in the global structure volumes or other subfields. CONCLUSION: Measuring specific amygdala subnuclei, early atrophy may serve as a marker of temporal tauopathy in preclinical AD, identifying individuals at risk of progression. HIGHLIGHTS: Amygdala atrophy is not homogeneous in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau pathology is associated with atrophy of specific amygdala subnuclei, specifically, the central, medial, cortical, and accessory basal subnuclei. Hippocampal and amygdala volume is not associated with tau in preclinical AD. Hippocampus and CA1-3 volume is reduced in preclinical AD, regardless of tau.
