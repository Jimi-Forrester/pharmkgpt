31459084|a|The overexpression of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) and its aggregation is the hallmark of Parkinson's disease. The alpha-syn aggregation results in the formation of Lewy bodies that causes neuronal cell death. Therefore, the small molecules that can protect neuronal cells from alpha-syn toxicity or inhibit the aggregation of alpha-syn could emerge as anti-Parkinson agents. Herein, a library of methoxy-stilbenes was screened for their ability to restore the cell growth from alpha-syn toxicity, using a yeast strain that stably expresses two copies of a chromosomally integrated human alpha-syn gene. Tetramethoxy-stilbene 4s, a nonantioxidant, was the most capable of restoring cell growth. It also rescues the more toxic cells that bear three copies of wild-type or A53T-mutant alpha-syn, from cell growth block. Its EC50 values for growth restoration of the 2-copy wild-type and the 3-copy mutant alpha-syn strains are 0.95 and 0.35 muM, respectively. Stilbene 4s mitigates mitochondrial membrane potential loss, negates ROS production, and prevents nuclear DNA-fragmentation, all hallmarks of apoptosis. However, 4s does not rescue cells from the death-inducing effects of Bax and betaA4, which suggest that 4s specifically inhibits alpha-syn-mediated toxicity in the yeast. Our results signify that simultaneous use of multiple yeast-cell-based screens can facilitate revelation of compounds that may have the potential for further investigation as anti-Parkinson's agents.
