38441778|t|Management of Scleritis in Older Adults.
38441778|a|Scleritis, an inflammatory disease of the eye affecting scleral tissue, presents unique challenges in the older adult population. Unlike their younger counterparts, older individuals manifest a distinct spectrum of the disease with different underlying etiologies, co-morbidities, altered immune function, and an increased risk of systemic side effects from medication choices. Addressing these complexities necessitates a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach. Treatment of choice will depend on any underlying cause but generally involves non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, systemic or local corticosteroids, and potentially disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Utilization of these therapeutic agents in older adults warrants careful consideration because of their potential side-effect profiles. This article critically examines the specific concerns for the use of these drugs in older patients and reviews the existing literature on their use in this specific cohort.
