29749529|t|alpha-synuclein induces apoptosis of astrocytes by causing dysfunction of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi compartment.
29749529|a|Although previous work has demonstrated that the overexpression of wild-type or mutant alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) can induce cell death via a number of different mechanisms, including oxidative stress, dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system, mitochondrial damage and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, research interest has primarily focused on neurons. However, there is accumulating evidence that suggests that astrocytes may be involved in the earliest changes, as well as the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD), though the role of alpha-syn in astrocytes has not been widely studied. In the present study, it was revealed that the mutant alpha-syn (A53T and A30P) in astrocytes triggered ER stress via the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha signaling pathway. Astrocyte apoptosis was induced through a CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein-mediated pathway. In addition, Golgi fragmentation was observed in the process. On the other hand, it was also demonstrated, in a primary neuronal-astroglial co-culture system, that the overexpression of alpha-syn significantly decreased the levels of glia-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and partly inhibited neurite outgrowth. Although direct evidence is currently lacking, it was proposed that dysfunction of the ER-Golgi compartment in astrocytes overexpressing alpha-syn may lead to a decline of GDNF levels, which in turn would suppress neurite outgrowth. Taken together, the results of the present study offer further insights into the pathogenesis of PD from the perspective of astrocytes, which may provide novel strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of PD in the future.
