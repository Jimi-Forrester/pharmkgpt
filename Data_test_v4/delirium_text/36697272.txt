36697272|t|Effect of a repeated verbal reminder of orientation on emergence agitation after general anaesthesia for minimally invasive abdominal surgery: a randomised controlled trial.
36697272|a|BACKGROUND: An orientation strategy providing repeated verbal reminders of time, place, and person has been widely used for the non-pharmacological management of delirium. We hypothesised that using this strategy could reduce emergence agitation and improve recovery profiles. METHODS: This prospective observer-blinded RCT included male and female patients aged 18-70 yr undergoing minimally invasive abdominal surgery. During emergence from general anaesthesia, subjects in the orientation group (n=57) were provided a repeated reminder, including orientation: '(Patient's name), you are now recovering from general anaesthesia after surgery at Seoul National University Hospital, open your eyes!' via noise-cancelling headphones, whereas those in the control group (n=57) only heard their name: '(Patient's name), open your eyes!'. The primary outcome was the incidence of emergence agitation (Riker sedation agitation scale [SAS] >=5). The incidence of dangerous agitation (SAS=7), maximal SAS score in the operating room, and recovery profile until 24 h postoperatively were evaluated as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The incidence of emergence agitation in the operating room was significantly lower in the orientation group than in the control group (16/57 [28.1%] vs 38/57 [66.7%]; relative risk [95% confidence interval], 0.5 [0.3-0.7]; P<0.001). The incidence of dangerous agitation (0 [0.0%] vs 10 [17.5%], P=0.001) and the median maximal SAS score (4 [4-5] vs 5 [4-6], P<0.001) were also lower in the orientation group. Secondary outcomes, other than agitation-related variables, were comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated verbal stimulation of orientation may serve as a simple and easily applicable strategy to reduce emergence agitation after general anaesthesia.
