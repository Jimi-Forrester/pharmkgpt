38361699|t|Randomized Clinical Trials in Cerebrovascular Neurosurgery From 2018 to 2022.
38361699|a|There has been an exponential increase in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on cerebrovascular disease within neurosurgery. The goal of this study was to review, outline the scope, and summarize all phase 2b and phase 3 RCTs impacting cerebrovascular neurosurgery practice since 2018. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases for relevant RCTs published between January 1, 2018, and July 1, 2022. We searched for studies related to eight major cerebrovascular disorders relevant to neurosurgery, including acute ischemic stroke, cerebral aneurysms and subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hematomas, cerebral venous thrombosis, arteriovenous malformations, Moyamoya disease and extracranial-intracranial bypass, and carotid and intracranial atherosclerosis. We limited our search to phase 2b or 3 RCTs related to cerebrovascular disorders published during the study period. The titles and abstracts of all relevant studies meeting our search criteria were included. Pediatric studies, stroke studies related to rehabilitation or cardiovascular disease, study protocols without published results, prospective cohort studies, registry studies, cluster randomized trials, and nonrandomized pivotal trials were excluded.  From an initial total of 2,797 records retrieved from the database searches, 1,641 records were screened after duplicates and studies outside of our time period were removed. After screening, 511 available reports within our time period of interest were assessed for eligibility. Pediatric studies, stroke studies related to rehabilitation or cardiovascular disease, study protocols without published results, prospective cohort studies, registry studies, cluster randomized trials, and nonrandomized pivotal trials were excluded. We found 80 unique phase 2b or 3 RCTs that fit our criteria, with 165 topic-relevant articles published within the study period.  Numerous RCTs in cerebrovascular neurosurgery have been published since 2018. Ischemic stroke, including mechanical thrombectomy and thrombolysis, accounted for a majority of publications, but there were large trials in intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage, aneurysms, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebral venous thrombosis, among others. This review helps define the scope of the large RCTs published in the last four years to guide future research and clinical care.
