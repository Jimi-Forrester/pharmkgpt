38248837|t|Optimizing MS-Based Multi-Omics: Comparative Analysis of Protein, Metabolite, and Lipid Extraction Techniques.
38248837|a|Multi-omics integrates diverse types of biological information from genomic, proteomic, and metabolomics experiments to achieve a comprehensive understanding of complex cellular mechanisms. However, this approach is also challenging due to technical issues such as limited sample quantities, the complexity of data pre-processing, and reproducibility concerns. Furthermore, existing studies have primarily focused on technical performance assessment and the presentation of modified protocols through quantitative comparisons of the identified protein counts. Nevertheless, the specific differences in these comparisons have been minimally investigated. Here, findings obtained from various omics approaches were profiled using various extraction methods (methanol extraction, the Folch method, and Matyash methods for metabolites and lipids) and two digestion methods (filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) and suspension traps (S-Trap)) for resuspended proteins. FASP was found to be more effective for the identification of membrane-related proteins, whereas S-Trap excelled in isolating nuclear-related and RNA-processing proteins. Thus, FASP may be suitable for investigating the immune response and bacterial infection pathways, whereas S-Trap may be more effective for studies focused on the mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, regarding the choice of extraction method, the single-phase method identified organic compounds and compounds related to fatty acids, whereas the two-phase extraction method identified more hydrophilic compounds such as nucleotides. Lipids with strong hydrophobicity, such as ChE and TG, were identified in the two-phase extraction results. These findings highlight that significant differences among small molecules are primarily identified due to the varying polarities of extraction solvents. These results, obtained by considering variables such as human error and batch effects in the sample preparation step, offer comprehensive and detailed results not previously provided by existing studies, thereby aiding in the selection of the most suitable pre-processing approach.
