32384432|a|Uncertainty remains about the association of hypertension with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in less-developed areas.This is a cross-sectional survey conducted in Xinjiang, a less-developed region in China between April and October 2019. We used multi-stage stratified sampling method to obtain study population aged >=45 years, and we analyzed complete data for 3282 subjects. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to assess cognitive function. MCI is defined as an MMSE score < 17 for illiterate subjects, <20 for subjects with 1 to 6 years of education, and <24 for subjects with >=7 years of education.The prevalence of MCI was significantly higher in hypertensive subjects than in non-hypertensive subjects (22.1% vs 16.1%, P < .001) and higher in hypertensives with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) than in those with controlled BP (27.5% vs 20.7%, P = .01). Hypertensive subjects had significantly lower each item score and total score of MMSE, compared to non-hypertensive subjects. Significant negative correlations were observed between systolic and diastolic BP with MMSE scores (P for all <.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hypertension was the significant risk factor for the presence of MCI (OR = 1.62, 95%CI: 1.34, 2.35, P < .001), independent of such factors as gender, age, education attainment, and dyslipidemia.The prevalence of MCI is higher in hypertensive population, and hypertension is an independent risk factor for MCI in less-developed region, suggesting that hypertensives should be screened for MCI to provide improved diagnoses and optimal therapeutics for cognitive decline prevention, specially in settings with approximate conditions.
