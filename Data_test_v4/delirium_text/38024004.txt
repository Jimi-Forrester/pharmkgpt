38024004|t|The Effects of Opioid Dependency Use on Postoperative Spinal Surgery Outcomes: A Review of the Available Literature.
38024004|a|There is a lack of evidence to support the effectiveness of long-term opioid therapy in patients with chronic, noncancer pain. Despite these findings, opioids continue to be the most commonly prescribed drug to treat chronic back pain and many patients undergoing spinal surgery have trialed opioids before surgery for conservative pain management. Unfortunately, preoperative opioid use has been shown repeatedly in the literature to negatively affect spinal surgery outcomes. In this review article, we identify and summarize the main postoperative associations with preoperative opioid use that have been found in previously published studies by searching on PubMed, Google Scholar, Medline, and ScienceDirect; using keywords: Opioid dependency, postoperative, spinal surgery, specifically (1) increased postoperative chronic opioid use (24 studies); (2) decreased return to work (RTW) rates (8 studies); (3) increased length of hospital stay (LOS) (9 studies); and (4) increased healthcare costs (8 studies). The conclusions from these studies highlight the importance of recognizing patients on opioids preoperatively to effectively risk stratify and identify those who will benefit most from multidisciplinary counseling and guidance.
