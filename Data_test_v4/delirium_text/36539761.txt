This conversion comprises two reactions catalyzed by two distinct inositol dehydrogenases, IolG and IolW. The IolW-mediated reaction requires the intracellular regeneration of NADPH, and there appears to be a limit to the endogenous supply of NADPH, which may be one of the rate-determining factors for the conversion of inositol. The primary mechanism of NADPH regeneration in this bacterium remains unclear. RESULTS: The gdh gene of B. subtilis encodes a sporulation-specific glucose dehydrogenase that can use NADP+ as a cofactor. When gdh was modified to be constitutively expressed, the intracellular NADPH level was elevated, increasing the conversion of inositol. In addition, the bacterial luciferase derived from Photorhabdus luminescens became more luminescent in cells in liquid culture and colonies on culture plates. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the luminescence of luciferase was representative of intracellular NADPH levels. Luciferase can therefore be employed to screen for mutations in genes involved in NADPH regeneration in B. subtilis, and artificial manipulation to enhance NADPH regeneration can promote the production of substances such as scyllo-inositol.
