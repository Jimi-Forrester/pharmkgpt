9555127|a|The attention in genetic research is shifting from the determination' of (rare) monogenic disorders to identification of genetic risk factors for important diseases at adult age. Mapping of all man's 80,000-100,000 genes will also provide more insight into the gene polymorphisms and mutations that are associated with various types of cancer, certain cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer dementia. Apart from new diagnostic possibilities, the DNA techniques create new prospects for the study of the pathogenesis of diseases and the devising of new strategies for treatment. Examples are familial hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, breast cancer and colorectal carcinoma.
