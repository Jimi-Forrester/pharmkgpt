36678518|t|Chemical and Biological Investigations of Allium scorodoprasum L. Flower Extracts.
36678518|a|This study was designed to investigate the impact of different extraction solvent systems on the chemical composition and biological activities of Allium scorodoprasum L. (Amaryllidaceae)-the medicinal plant that was traditionally used as a remedy in the medieval period in the Balkans. Targeted chemical analysis of nine different extracts was performed by UHPLC(-)HESI-QqQ-MS/MS. Antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of the extracts were investigated on sixteen clinical isolates of bacteria, yeasts and dermatomycetes, all isolated from infected human skin and corneal formations. Cytotoxicity and wound-healing properties were tested on human immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT cell line). Antioxidant activity was assessed by six different assays, while beneficial potential against certain neurodegenerative diseases and type 2 diabetes was determined in selected enzyme inhibition assays coupled with molecular modeling. The results showed that the obtained extracts were rich in phenolic compounds, especially flavonoid glycosides such as rutin and kaempferol 3-O-glucoside. All of the extracts showed antimicrobial, wound-healing, antioxidant and anti-enzymatic properties. This study is the first of its kind, linking the medieval medicinal use of wild-growing flowers of A. scorodoprasum with contemporary in vitro scientific approaches.
