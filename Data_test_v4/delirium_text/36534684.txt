36534684|t|Mitochondrial DNA haplogroup analysis in Saudi Arab patients with multiple sclerosis.
36534684|a|Previous studies have suggested that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants are associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), a complex neurodegenerative immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system. Since mtDNA is maternally inherited without recombination, specific mtDNA variants defining genetic background are associated with the susceptibility to human diseases. To assess the contribution of mtDNA haplogroups to the predisposition of MS in an Arab population, we analysed sequencing data of mitochondrial genomes from 47 native Saudi Arab individuals including 23 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and 24 healthy controls. All patients and controls could be classified into ten haplogroups. The European-specific haplogroup U was more prevalent in patients than in the controls (26.1% vs. 4.2%), whereas haplogroup T was only present in patients and haplogroups HV and N were only found in controls. Haplogroup U was significantly association with increased risk of MS (odds ratio = 6.26, p<0.05), although the association did not maintain significance after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Haplotype U was more prevalent in patients with younger age of onset (p = 0.006), but there was no relationship between haplotype U and disease severity, disease duration or EDSS and age-matched carriers and non-carriers of haplogroup U (p>0.05). Definition site of haplogroup U include the variant m.12308A>G in MT-TL2 gene which was found to affect highly conserved position within the variable arm of tRNALeu(CUN) and thus may impact mitochondrial protein synthesis, and two other variants namely m.11467A>G in MT-ND4 gene and m.12372G>A in MT-ND5 gene which were previously linked with mitochondrial function. Despite the small number of subjects, which may limit the statistical power of the study, our results showed for the first time a possible contribution of haplogroup U to the predisposition to MS in an Arab population. These findings warrant further validation in a large cohort to distinguish a genuine effect specific to MS from a chance finding due to small sampling.
