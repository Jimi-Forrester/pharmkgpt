37882640|t|A case of prazosin in treatment of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.
37882640|a|Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by dream-enactment behaviors that emerge during a loss of REM sleep atonia. Untreated RBD carries risks for physical injury from falls or other traumatic events during dream enactment as well as risk of injury to the bed partner. Currently, melatonin and clonazepam are the mainstay pharmacological therapies for RBD. However, therapeutic response to these medications is variable. While older adults are most vulnerable to RBD, they are also particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of benzodiazepines, including increased risk of falls, cognitive impairment, and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Prazosin is a centrally active alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist often prescribed for trauma nightmares characterized by REM sleep without atonia in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder. We report a case of successful RBD management with prazosin in a patient in whom high dose melatonin was ineffective. Although there was no observable reduction of dream-enactment behaviors with high dose melatonin, the possibility of a synergistic effect of prazosin combined with melatonin cannot be ruled out. This case report supports further evaluation of prazosin as a potential therapeutic for RBD.
