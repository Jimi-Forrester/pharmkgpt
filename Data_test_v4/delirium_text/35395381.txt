35395381|t|Pharmacological activities and pharmacokinetics of liquiritin: A review.
35395381|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Liquiritin is a flavonoid derived from Radix et Rhizoma Glycyrrhizae, which is a widely used traditional Chinese medicine with the effects of invigorating spleen qi, clearing heat, resolving toxins, and dispelling phlegm to stop coughs. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this review,the pharmacokinetics and pharmacological activities of liquiritin have been summarized. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The information on liquiritin up to 2021 was collected from PubMed, Web of Science, Springer Link, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. The key words were "liquiritin", "nerve", "tumor", "cardiac", etc. RESULTS: The absorption mechanism of liquiritin conforms to the passive diffusion and first-order kinetics while with low bioavailability. Liquiritin can penetrate the blood-brain-barrier. Besides, liquiritin displays numerous pharmacological effects including anti-Alzheimer's disease, antidepressant, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, cardiovascular protection, antitussive, hepatoprotection, and skin protective effects. In addition, the novel preparations, new pharmacological effects,and cdusafty of liquiritin are also discussed in this review. CONCLUSION: This review provides a comprehensive state of knowledge on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacological activities of liquiritin, and makes a forecast for its research directions and applications in clinic.
