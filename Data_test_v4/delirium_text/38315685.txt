38315685|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive and memory impairments and neuropathological abnormalities. AD has no cure, inadequate treatment options, and a limited understanding of possible prevention measures. Previous studies have demonstrated that AD model mice that received a diet high in the essential nutrient choline had reduced amyloidosis, cholinergic deficits, and gliosis, and increased neurogenesis. In this study, we investigated the lifelong effects of perinatal choline supplementation on behavior, cognitive function, and amyloidosis in AppNL-G-F AD model mice. Pregnant and lactating mice were given a diet containing either 1.1 g/kg (control) or 5 g/kg (supplemented) of choline chloride until weaning and subsequently, all offspring received the control diet throughout their life. At 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age, animals were behaviorally tested in the Open Field Test, Elevated Plus Maze, Barnes Maze, and in a contextual fear conditioning paradigm. Immunohistochemical analysis of Abeta42 was also conducted on the brains of these mice. AppNL-G-F mice displayed hippocampal-dependent spatial learning deficits starting at 3-months-old that persisted until 12-months-old. These spatial learning deficits were fully prevented by perinatal choline supplementation at young ages (3 and 6 months) but not in older mice (12 months). AppNL-G-F mice also had impaired fearful learning and memory at 9- and 12-months-old that were diminished by choline supplementation. Perinatal choline supplementation reduced Abeta42 deposition in the amygdala, cortex, and hippocampus of AppNL-G-F mice. Together, these results demonstrate that perinatal choline supplementation is capable of preventing cognitive deficits and dampening amyloidosis in AppNL-G-F mice and suggest that ensuring adequate choline consumption during early life may be a valuable method to prevent or reduce AD dementia and neuropathology.
