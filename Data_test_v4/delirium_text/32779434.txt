32779434|t|Age Associated Changes in Transcription of Adiponectin, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 Genes in Pancreas of Rats.
32779434|a|OBJECTIVE: Adiponectin has a crucial role in the function, proliferation and viability of beta-cell via action of two receptors: AdipoR1 and AdipoR2. Nevertheless, age related change of Adiponectin system genes in pancreas is unclear or controversial. This study sought to investigate the effects of aging process on serum Adiponectin levels, Adiponectin and its receptor expression in the rat pancreas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, insulin resistance markers including serum insulin and glucose concentrations, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), glucose induced insulin secretion (GIIS), serum Adiponectin levels, pancreatic expression of Adiponectin and its receptors were studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats at the age of 2, 5, 10, 18, 52 and 72 weeks of age. RESULTS: We found that aging triggered signs of insulin resistance characteristics in rats at 72 age weeks including marked insulin reduction, hyperglycemia and increased HOMA-IR. Circulating Adiponectin as well as pancreatic expression of Adiponectin and AdipoR1 was gradually decreased with age, while the opposite expression pattern of AdipoR2 was observed in the old rats. CONCLUSION: Because Adiponectin and Adiponectin signaling have crucial role in beta-cell function and viability, we concluded that reduction of Adiponectin signaling may be involved in aging induced beta-cell dysfunction. As a result, manipulation of Adiponectin signaling may be a beneficial approach for improvement of beta-cell function in the old people.
