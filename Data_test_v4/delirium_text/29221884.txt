29221884|a|INTRODUCTION: Giant cell arteritis is a large-vessels vasculitis, which treatment consists in a slowly-tappered steroid-therapy. Immunosuppressive agents are sometimes used in case of steroid-dependance. We have conducted an observationnal retrospective study including patients treated with tocilizumab for a giant cell arteritis or an aortitis in the internal medicine department at the Nimes University Hospital. RESULTS: Eleven patients were included between 2011 and 2016, who had been treated only with prednisone. Tocilizumab was used because of steroid-dependance for nine patients, delirium under steroids for one patient and unefficiency of steroids for an other patient. Infusions of tocilizumab, administred monthly at 8mg/kg, led to clinical and biological remission for all patients. Consequently, prednisone was tappered under 10mg/d for ten patients after six months of treatment with tocilizumab. Eight cases of non-severe infection were reported; also two cases of dyslipidemia, one case of prurit and one case of moderate neutropenia. Two relapses were observed after the end of treatment, in patients treated with less than twelve infusions. CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab could be efficient and well-tolerated in steroid-dependent giant cell arteritis and aortitis. The modalities of its use remain to be precised.
