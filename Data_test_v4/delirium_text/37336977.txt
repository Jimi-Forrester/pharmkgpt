37336977|t|Comparison of automated quantification of amyloid deposition between PMOD and Heuron.
37336977|a|Several programs are widely used for clinical and research purposes to automatically quantify the degree of amyloid deposition in the brain using positron emission tomography (PET) images. Given that very few studies have investigated the use of Heuron, a PET image quantification software approved for clinical use, this study aimed to compare amyloid deposition values quantified from 18F-flutemetamol PET images using PMOD and Heuron. Amyloid PET data obtained from 408 patients were analysed using each quantitative program; moreover, the standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) of target areas were obtained by dividing the standardized uptake value (SUV) of the target region by the SUV of cerebellar grey matter as a reference. Compared with PMOD, Heuron yielded significantly higher SUVRs for all target areas (paired sample t-test, p < 0.001), except for the PC/PCC (p = 0.986). However, the Bland-Altman plot analysis indicated that the two quantitative methods may be used interchangeably. Moreover, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed no significant between-method difference in the performance of the SUVRs in evaluating the visual positivity of amyloid deposits (p = 0.948). In conclusion, Heuron and PMOD have comparable performance in quantifying the degree of amyloid deposits in PET images.
