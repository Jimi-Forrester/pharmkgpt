38534224|t|Bimetallic Coordination Polymers: Synthesis and Applications in Biosensing and Biomedicine.
38534224|a|Bimetallic coordination polymers (CPs) have two different metal ions as connecting nodes in their polymer structure. The synthesis methods of bimetallic CPs are mainly categorized into the one-pot method and post-synthesis modifications according to various needs. Compared with monometallic CPs, bimetallic CPs have synergistic effects and excellent properties, such as higher gas adsorption rate, more efficient catalytic properties, stronger luminescent properties, and more stable loading platforms, which have been widely applied in the fields of gas adsorption, catalysis, energy storage as well as conversion, and biosensing. In recent years, the study of bimetallic CPs synergized with cancer drugs and functional nanomaterials for the therapy of cancer has increasingly attracted the attention of scientists. This review presents the research progress of bimetallic CPs in biosensing and biomedicine in the last five years and provides a perspective for their future development.
