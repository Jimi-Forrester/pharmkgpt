34368490|t|Delirium awareness day: a portuguese perspective.
34368490|a|Delirium is a syndrome characterized by impairment of awareness and inattention, that represents a change from the patient's baseline cognitive functioning. It is triggered by an underlying medical condition, reaching a prevalence of 24.7% in geriatric wards. However, undiagnosed delirium remains a reality among inpatient individuals, with an estimated frequency of 24.1%. The inappropriate knowledge of diagnostic criteria and standard screening tools was pointed out as a relevant contributing factor to this paradigm. Liaison Psychiatry Services guarantee psychiatric approach and treatment to patients attending general hospitals. Considering that older adult patient care requires a well-trained and skilled team, the Centro Hospitalar e Universitario de Coimbra has a Geriatric Psychiatry Liaison Service, where delirium is one of the prevailing clinical conditions assessed by this team. The International Delirium Awareness Day is going to be worldwide celebrated on the 11th of March. Given that delirium has been consistently associated with the economic burden and adverse outcomes this symbolic day works as a huge opportunity to raise insight into the preventive strategies that could be implemented among healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers. Within the Portuguese National Health System there is a need to build a set of systematic epidemiological data about delirium prevalence and incidence in the different settings and it would be essential the employment of a multicomponent intervention package delivered by a multidisciplinary team trained and competent in delirium prevention into routine care.
