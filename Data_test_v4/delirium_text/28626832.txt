28626832|t|Fragment Binding to beta-Secretase 1 without Catalytic Aspartate Interactions Identified via Orthogonal Screening Approaches.
28626832|a|An approach to identify beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) fragment binders that do not interact with the catalytic aspartate dyad is presented. A ThermoFluor (thermal shift) and a fluorescence resonance energy transfer enzymatic screen on the soluble domain of BACE1, together with a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) screen on the soluble domain of BACE1 and a mutant of one catalytic Asp (D32N), were run in parallel. Fragments that were active in at least two of these assays were further confirmed using one-dimensional NMR (WaterLOGSY) and SPR binding competition studies with peptidic inhibitor OM99-2. Protein-observed NMR (two-dimensional 15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence spectroscopy) and crystallographic studies with the soluble domain of BACE1 identified a unique and novel binding mode for compound 12, a fragment that still occupies the active site while not making any interactions with catalytic Asps. This novel approach of combining orthogonal fragment screening techniques, for both wild-type and mutant enzymes, as well as binding competition studies could be generalized to other targets to overcome undesired interaction motifs and as a hit-generation approach in highly constrained intellectual property space.
