29271163|a|The present study is to explore the material basis and mechanism of Erzhi Wan the prevented Alzheimer's disease by using network pharmacology. The key target of Alzheimer's disease was docked with the Erzhi Wan compounds, and the drugs-target combined with target-signal pathway network model was established by Cytoscape 3.2.1 software. Thirty compounds have a strong interaction with key target of Alzheimer's disease and three key pathways related with Wnt, MAPK and PI3K-Akt-mTOR. There are 5 ingredients such as quercetin,geraniol,beta-sitosterol,nerol,eriodictyol that could be verified from literature.This result initially revealed the material basis for Erzhi Wan for Alzheimer's disease and the mechanism in terms of three signaling pathways. The network pharmacology method found that the active ingredients of Erzhi Wan for Alzheimer's disease may be quercetin,geraniol,beta-sitosterol,nerol,and eriodictyol, and the mechanism may be related to three signal pathways including Wnt, MAPK, and PI3K-Akt-mTOR.
