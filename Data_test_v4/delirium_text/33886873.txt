METHODS: Baseline data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging were analyzed. This nationwide survey interviewed 9,412 adults aged at least 50 years. Self-reported medical diagnosis of AD and exposure variables (sociodemographic, clinical, behavioral, and health-related) were assessed by face-to-face questionnaire-based interview. Multivariate analyses accounted for possible confounding factors, and values were reported in prevalence ratio (PR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). RESULTS: Participants with AD have important demographic differences compared with older non-AD participants such as low education level and retirement. Clinically, these patients reported more medical appointments, falls, and higher frequency and duration of hospitalizations compared with non-AD participants. These characteristics may be related to worse physical and mental health observed in this population. Indeed, two out of five older adults with AD in Brazil reported always feeling lonely, while two out of three said they felt depressed or sad much of the time. Adjusted analyses showed that patients with AD were 95% (95%CI 1.08 - 3.50) more likely to be hospitalized in a year compared with non-AD older adults. People with AD in Brazil were more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes (PR = 1.83 [95%CI 1.08 - 3.12]), depression (PR = 3.07% [95%CI 1.63 - 5.79]), Parkinson's disease (PR = 17.63 [95%CI 6.99 - 44.51]), and stroke (PR = 3.55 [95%CI 1.90 - 6.67]) compared with non-AD participants. CONCLUSION: Older adults with AD in Brazil reported impaired physical and mental health compared with the non-AD population.
