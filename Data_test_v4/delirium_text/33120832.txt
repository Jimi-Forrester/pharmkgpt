33120832|t|Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio as a predictive index for delirium in critically ill patients: A retrospective observational study.
33120832|a|Delirium is a neuropsychiatric syndrome commonly encountered in critically ill patients, and systemic inflammation has been strongly implicated to underlie its pathophysiology. This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) for delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU).In this retrospective observational study, we analyzed the clinical and laboratory data of 319 ICU patients from October 2016 to December 2017. Using the Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing technique, a PLR knot was detected at a value of approximately 100. Logistic regression was used to investigate the association between the PLR and delirium.Of the 319 patients included in this study, 29 (9.1%) were diagnosed with delirium. In the delirium group, the duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly longer than that in the no-delirium group (40.2 +- 65.5 vs. 19.9 +- 26.5 hours, respectively; P < .001). A multiple logistic regression analysis showed that PLR > 100 (odds ratio [OR]: 1.003, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.001-1.005), age (OR: 2.76, 95% CI: 1.110-6.861), and the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to the inspired oxygen fraction (OR: 0.996, 95% CI: 0.992-0.999) were independent predictors of delirium.In our study, a high PLR value on ICU admission was associated with a higher incidence of delirium. Owing to easy calculability, the PLR could be a useful delirium predictive index in ICUs, thereby enabling early interventions to be implemented.
