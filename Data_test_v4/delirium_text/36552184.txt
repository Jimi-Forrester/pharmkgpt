36552184|t|Sleep and Neuroimmunomodulation for Maintenance of Optimum Brain Function: Role of Noradrenaline.
36552184|a|Immune function and sleep are two normal physiological processes to protect the living organism from falling sick. There is hardly any disease in which they remain unaffected, though the quantum of effect may differ. Therefore, we propose the existence of a strong correlation between sleep (quality or quantity) and immune response. This may be supported by the fact that sleep loss modulates many of the immunological molecules, which includes interferons; however, not much is known about their mechanism of action. Sleep is divided into rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) and non-REMS. For practical reasons, experimental studies have been conducted mostly by inducing loss of REMS. It has been shown that withdrawal of noradrenaline (NA) is a necessity for generation of REMS. Moreover, NA level increases in the brain upon REMS loss and the elevated NA is responsible for many of the sleep loss-associated symptoms. In this review, we describe how sleep (and its disturbance/loss) modulates the immune system by modulating the NA level in the brain or vice versa to maintain immune functions, physiological homeostasis, and normal healthy living. The increased levels of NA during REMS loss may cause neuroinflammation possibly by glial activation (as NA is a key modulator of microglia). Therefore, maintaining sleep hygiene plays a crucial role for a normal healthy living.
