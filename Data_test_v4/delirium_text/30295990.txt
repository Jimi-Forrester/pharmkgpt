30295990|t|Fluorescence Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease with a Flat Ensemble Formed between a Quinoline-Malononitrile AIEgen and Thin-Layer Molybdenum Disulfide.
30295990|a|The sensitive imaging of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is important for the timely detection of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although clinically the diagnosis of AD relies on the use of radiolabeled imaging reagents, herein we report the simple construction of a "flat ensemble" formed between a quinoline-malononitrile AIEgen (EDS) and thin-layer molybdenum disulfide (2D MoS2 ) for the sensitive detection of Abeta by means of fluorescence-based techniques. Self-assembly between EDS and 2D MoS2 in aqueous buffer solution produces the flat ensemble, and the subsequent interaction of the material ensemble with oligomeric and aggregated Abeta peptides leads to up to 19-fold enhanced fluorescence of EDS. The ensemble is also applicable for staining Abeta aggregates in vivo.
