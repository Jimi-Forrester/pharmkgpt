3803403|t|[Correlations between characteristics of the hallucinations in delirium tremens and psychological variables].
3803403|a|In 83 alcoholics admitted to the University of Wurzburg mental hospital with delirium tremens, the relationship was studied between hallucinations occurring in the delirium and psychological variables in the post-delirium state. Psychological tests were used and resulted in 13 variables of cognitive achievement and 12 variables of emotion and motivation. The alcoholics were tested on the 4th day and in the 4th week after completing therapy. Alcoholics suffering from hallucinations in the delirium differed from those not suffering from hallucinations, but the differences were not significant. However, there were only a few alcoholics who were not suffering from hallucinations. On the other hand, there were statistically significant correlations between the nature of the hallucinations and personality traits. Patients suffering from "polymorphic" hallucinations differed from those suffering from "monomorphic" hallucinations in having lower cognitive deficits but increased anxiety. The latter subjects suffered more from inhibition; the former regained more of their cognitive abilities during the recovery period. The few significant correlations between the variables of sense modality of the hallucinations and psychological characteristics were interpreted as resulting from the differences between "polymorphic" and "monomorphic" hallucinations.
