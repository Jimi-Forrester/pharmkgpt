36291661|t|The Role of Clusterin Transporter in the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease at the Blood-Brain Barrier Interface: A Systematic Review.
36291661|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered a chronic and debilitating neurological illness that is increasingly impacting older-age populations. Some proteins, including clusterin (CLU or apolipoprotein J) transporter, can be linked to AD, causing oxidative stress. Therefore, its activity can affect various functions involving complement system inactivation, lipid transport, chaperone activity, neuronal transmission, and cellular survival pathways. This transporter is known to bind to the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, which is the major pathogenic factor of AD. On the other hand, this transporter is also active at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a barrier that prevents harmful substances from entering and exiting the brain. Therefore, in this review, we discuss and emphasize the role of the CLU transporter and CLU-linked molecular mechanisms at the BBB interface in the pathogenesis of AD.
