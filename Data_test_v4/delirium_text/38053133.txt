38053133|a|BACKGROUND: An increasing number of adults are over the age of 65, and there is concern about the increasing prevalence of age-associated cognitive decline and poor mental health status in older adults in the United States. Several nutrients are known to have important biological roles in brain health and neurological function, but many individuals fall short of recommended intake levels. The objective of this study was to examine the association between nutrient intake and cognitive function. We also explored whether nutrient intake was associated with depression. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014 and included participants >= 60 years of age who had reliable day 1 dietary recall data and either valid cognitive function data (n = 2713) or valid depression score data (n = 2943). The sample was stratified by gender, and cognitive functioning test (CFT) composite z-scores were analyzed by quartiles. Depression status was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). RESULTS: Higher intake and adequacy of a number of different nutrients from food were associated with higher cognitive function in both males and females. Nutrients that showed the most consistent associations with cognitive function across intake and adequacy analyses for food in both males and females were vitamin A, vitamin E, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, folate, magnesium, potassium, zinc, vitamin K, and lutein and zeaxanthin (p < 0.05 for all). These associations were positive with increasing intake and adequacy being associated with higher CFT composite z-scores. Analysis of nutrient intake and depression yielded results that differed by gender. In females, the nutrients that showed consistent inverse associations with depression scores across both intake and adequacy analyses for food were vitamin A, vitamin C, magnesium, vitamin K, potassium, and dietary fiber (p < 0.05 for all). In males, no significant associations between nutrient intake from food and depression scores were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that older adults with sufficient intakes of certain essential nutrients have higher cognitive function. Future studies are needed to confirm whether a well-balanced diet and/or dietary supplements which emphasize these nutrients are effective for prevention of age-related declines in cognitive function and mood.
