35357593|a|The development of highly facile synthetic procedures for the expedient synthesis of complex natural molecules is always in demand. As this aspect, the Diels-Alder reaction (DAR) has a versatile approach to the synthesis of complex natural compounds and highly regio-/stereoselcetive heterocyclic scaffolds. Additionally, alpha-pyrone and terpenoquinone are two versatile key intermediates that are prevalent in various bioactive natural compounds for instance, (+-)-crinine, (+-)-joubertinamine, (+-)-pancratistatin, (-)-cyclozonarone, and 8-ephipuupehedione, etc. Hence, the current review summarizes the Diels-Alder reaction application of alpha-pyrone and terpenoquinone to the constructive synthesis of various natural products over the past two decades (2001-2021). Equally, it serves as a stencil for the invention and development of new synthetic strategies for high-complex molecular structured natural and heterocyclic molecules.
