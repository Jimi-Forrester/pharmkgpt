36867655|t|Suspected Nonfatal Cocaine-Involved Overdoses Overall and With Co-involvement of Opioids.
36867655|a|CONTEXT: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a syndrome definition for detection of suspected nonfatal cocaine-involved overdoses. The definition can be used to monitor trends and detect anomalies in emergency department (ED) syndromic surveillance data at the national, state, and local levels. OBJECTIVE: This study describes the development of the nonfatal, unintentional/undetermined intent cocaine-involved overdose (UUCOD) definition and analysis of trends over time. DESIGN/SETTING: CDC developed the UUCOD definition to query ED data in CDC's National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP). Data between 2018 and 2021 were analyzed from 29 states sharing data access in the Drug Overdose Surveillance and Epidemiology (DOSE) System via NSSP. Using Joinpoint regression, trends were analyzed for UUCOD overall, by sex and age group, and for UUCOD co-involving opioids. MEASURES: Time trends between 2018 and 2021 were analyzed by examining average monthly percentage change. Individual trend segments and trend inflection points were analyzed by examining monthly percentage change. RESULTS: During 2018-2021, a total of 27 240 UUCOD visits were identified by the syndrome definition. Analyses identified different patterns in trends for males and females, with largely similar trends for persons aged 15 to 44 years and 45 years or older. Analyses also identified seasonal patterns with increases in spring/summer months in UUCOD overall and UUCOD co-involving opioids and declines for both in fall/winter months. CONCLUSION: This UUCOD syndrome definition will be useful for ongoing monitoring of suspected nonfatal overdoses involving cocaine and co-involving cocaine and opioids. Ongoing assessment of cocaine-involved overdose trends might identify anomalies requiring further investigation and inform deployment of resources.
