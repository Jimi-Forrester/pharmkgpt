10767730|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine whether delirium has specific clinical subtypes. METHOD: One hundred and eighty-three elderly subjects meeting DSM-IIIR criteria for delirium were evaluated using a 19-item symptom check-list assessing different dimensions of delirium symptomatology. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted in order to examine which symptoms clustered. RESULTS: Factor analysis confirmed the existence of two different clusters of symptoms: first, symptoms of hyperalert/hyperactive features (agitation, hyper-reactivity, aggressiveness, hallucinations, delusions); and second, symptoms of hypoalert/hypoactive features (decreased reactivity, motor and speech retardation, facial inexpressiveness). CONCLUSION: This preliminary study seems to support the evidence of hypoactive and hyperactive subtypes of delirium, even though their aetiology and prognostic values need to be further examined.
