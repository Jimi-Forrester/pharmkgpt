37002649|a|PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive dysfunction. Quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is an antioxidant enzyme that plays an important role in controlling cellular redox state, whose expression is altered in the brain tissues of AD patients. In addition to its traditional antioxidant effects, NQO1 also acts as a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in posttranscriptional regulation. Whether the RNA-binding activity of NQO1 influences AD pathology has not been investigated yet. METHODS: The RNA-binding functions of NQO1 in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were investigated using siRNA knockdown followed by total RNA sequencing. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to explore the impact of NQO1 on the transcription and alternative splicing of apoptotic genes. RESULTS: NQO1 knockdown led to a significant increase in cellular apoptosis. Genes involved in certain apoptosis pathways, such as positive regulation of apoptotic processes and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, were under global transcriptional and alternative splicing regulation. NQO1 regulated the transcription of apoptotic genes Cryab, Lgmn, Ngf, Apoe, Brd7, and Stat3, as well as the alternative splicing of apoptotic genes BIN1, Picalm, and Fyn. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that NQO1 participates in the pathology of AD by regulating the expression and alternative splicing of the genes involved in apoptosis. These results extend our understanding of NQO1 in apoptotic pathways at the posttranscriptional level in AD.
