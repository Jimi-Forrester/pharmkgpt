28031898|a|The changes in the brain signaling systems play an important role in etiology and pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MS), being a possible cause of these diseases. Therefore, their restoration at the early stages of T2DM and MS can be regarded as a promising way to treat and prevent these diseases and their complications. The data on the functional state of the brain signaling systems regulated by insulin, IGF-1, leptin, dopamine, serotonin, melanocortins and glucagon-like peptide-1, in T2DM and MS, are analyzed. The pharmacological approaches to restoration of these systems and improvement of insulin sensitivity, energy expenditure, lipid metabolism, and to prevent diabetic complications are discussed.
