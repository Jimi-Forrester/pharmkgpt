34435032|t|1-year outcomes for lung transplantation recipients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
34435032|a|Advanced hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis are absolute contraindications to lung transplantation. [ 1] However, whether fatty liver disease with mild-moderate fibrosis contributes to increased adverse outcomes post-lung transplantation remains unknown.  We present a retrospective analysis of patients transplanted at Brigham and Women's Hospital between 2015 and 2017 to identify whether patients with mild-moderate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) experience increased short-term complications compared to patients with normal liver architecture. Patients with advanced (F3-F4) fibrosis and/or cirrhosis were considered non-suitable transplant candidates, a priori. This study was powered for a difference in index hospital-free days within the first 30 days of 25% (alpha=0.05, beta=0.8). Secondary outcomes included index intensive care unit (ICU)-free days within the first 10 days post-transplant, perioperative blood product transfusion, incidence of index hospitalisation arrhythmias and delirium, need for insulin on discharge post-transplant, tacrolimus dose required to maintain a trough of 8-12 ng mL-1 at index hospital discharge, and 1-year post-transplant incidence of insulin-dependent diabetes, acute kidney injury, acute cellular rejection, unplanned hospital readmissions and infection.  150 patients underwent lung transplantation between 2015 and 2017 and were included in the analysis; of these patients 40 (27%) had evidence of NAFLD. Median index hospital-free days for patients with NAFLD were non-inferior to those without (16 days, IQR 10.5-19.5 versus 12 days, IQR 0-18.0, p=0.03). Regarding secondary outcomes, both index hospitalisation and 1-year outcomes were non-inferior between patients with NAFLD and those with normal liver architecture.  This study demonstrates that mild-moderate severity NAFLD may not be a contraindication to lung transplantation.
