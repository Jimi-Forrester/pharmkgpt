31146117|a|In August 2018, Weiner and colleagues raised a red flag concerning certain errors in the tables and figures of our article, "Amyloid pathology fingerprint differentiates post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. NeuroImage Clinical 2018 Jun 5;19:716-726". We have addressed this in detail in our published "Corrigendum to 'Amyloid pathology fingerprint differentiates post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury' NeuroImage: Clinical. 19 (2018) 716-726". However, recently Prof. Weiner and colleagues have raised a new issue in indicating that they could not 'replicate our results, despite accurately emulating our methods. We have prepared this letter in response to their recent letter.
