26513486|a|Zinc ions and modified amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) play a critical role in the pathological aggregation of endogenous Abeta in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Zinc-induced Abeta oligomerization is mediated by the metal-binding domain (MBD) which includes N-terminal residues 1-16 (Abeta1-16). Earlier, it has been shown that Abeta1-16 as well as some of its naturally occurring variants undergoes zinc-induced homodimerization via the interface in which zinc ion is coordinated by Glu11 and His14 of the interacting subunits. In this study using surface plasmon resonance technique, we have found that in the presence of zinc ions Abeta1-16 forms heterodimers with MBDs of two Abeta species linked to AD: Abeta containing isoAsp7 (isoAbeta) and Abeta containing phosphorylated Ser8 (pS8-Abeta). The heterodimers appear to possess the same interface as the homodimers. Simulation of 200 ns molecular dynamic trajectories in two constructed models of dimers ([Abeta1-16/Zn/Abeta1-16] and [isoAbeta1-16/Zn/Abeta1-16]), has shown that conformational flexibility of the N-terminal fragments of the dimer subunits is controlled by the structure of corresponding sites 6-8. The data suggest that isoAbeta and pS8-Abeta can be involved in the AD pathogenesis by means of their zinc-dependent interactions with endogenous Abeta resulting in the formation of heterodimeric seeds for amyloid aggregation.
