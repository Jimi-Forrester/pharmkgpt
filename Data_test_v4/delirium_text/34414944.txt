Furthermore, acquiring healthy subject databases from domestic studies on homocysteine is not trivial. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the causality between serum homocysteine levels and health status and lifestyle factors, particularly with a focus on low serum homocysteine levels. Additionally, we discussed a systematic methodical platform for data collection and statistical analysis, using the descriptive analysis of the chi-square test, t test, multivariate analysis of variance, and logistic regression.This study was a cross-sectional analysis of 5864 subjects (i.e., clients of a health examination clinic) in Taipei, Taiwan during a general health check-up in 2017. The patients' personal information and associated links were excluded. A sample group was selected as per the health criteria defined for this research whose data were processed using SPSS for descriptive statistical analysis using chi-square test, t test, multivariate analysis of variance, and logistic regression analysis.Those working for >12 hours/day had a higher homocysteine level than those working for <12 hours/day (P < .001). The average serum homocysteine level was 7.9 and 8.6 mol/L for people with poor sleep quality and good sleep quality, respectively (P = .003). The homocysteine value of people known to have cancer was analyzed using the logistic regression analysis, revealing a Deltaodds value of 0.898. The percentage of subjects with a homocysteine value of <=6.3 mumol/L, who perceived their health status as "not very good" or "very bad," was higher than those with a higher homocysteine level. The number of subjects who perceived their health as poor was higher than expected.The results suggest that the homocysteine level could be an effective health management indicator. We conclude that normal homocysteine level should not be <=6.3 mumol/L. Moreover, homocysteine should not be considered as harmful and its fluctuations from the normal range could be utilized to infer a person's physical status for health management.
