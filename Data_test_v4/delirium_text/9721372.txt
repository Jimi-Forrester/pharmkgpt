9721372|a|The paper presents the study of risk factors and factors-protectors of the development of dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT). 40 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 40 patients, with senile DAT and 80 healthy individuals of the same sex, age and education level were examined. The pairs were formed: the patient-normal. The main risk factor in DAT group was family predisposition to dementia. AD risk factors may be the exposure to radioactive materials or chronic psychotraumatic situations during life. Senile DAT risk factors may be traumas of head without lack of consciousness. Acute and frequent psychotraumatic situations as well as some somatic diseases (and related drug therapy) were factors-protectors in the whole DAT group. Groups of patients with AD and senile DAT differed by both risk factors and factors-protectors, confirming DAT heterogeneity. Hypothetic biologic basis of the data obtained is described.
