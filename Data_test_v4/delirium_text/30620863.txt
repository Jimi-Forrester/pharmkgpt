30620863|t|[Role of Departments of Psychiatry in University Hospitals as a Developer, Provider, and Educator of Innovative Clinical Psychiatry].
30620863|a|The roles of university hospital psychiatric departments are: 1) the development and pro- vision of advanced psychiatric treatments unique to university hospitals, 2) the provision of psychiatric intervention models for patients with physical diseases, and 3)the provision of real- world environments for young psychiatrists to learn the principles and experience the practice of such innovative care. As for 1), our facility offers a hospitalization for examination program, which uses near-infrared spectroscopy as a biomarker useful for the auxiliary diagnosis of psy- chiatric disease and selection of the treatment method. University psychiatric departments also play a major role in neuropsychiatry, such as through the use of Epilepsy Monitoring Units (EMU) to differentiate between epilepsy and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). Additionally, hospitalizations for examination programs are being implemented for psychosocial and employment support for psychiatric patients, and the diagnosis and evaluation of develop- mental disorders. With regard to 2), our facility has a psychiatric liaison-consultation team. In addition to providing consultation for all departments on delirium, anxiety, and depression, they are actively committed to various transplant treatments. There is also a strong cooperative relationship between the critical care center and psychiatric department. Of the patients hospi- talized for physical conditions and emergencies, over ten percent require psychiatric support, and without the psychiatric department, many patients with severe physical diseases cannot be treated. As such, the medical fees for psychiatric departments in universities and general hospitals should be evaluated appropriately. We would like to propose an "Advanced Psychiat- ric Treatment Development Management Center" (tentative name) to manage the following cycle : a) every university psychiatric department will develop and offer model projects utiliz- ing their respective expertise and specialties ; b) after collecting information on best practices, they will establish evidence through multicenter research, Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) data, and others ; c) they will progress to advanced medical treatments and insurance coverage ; and d) they will continue to improve quality. Finally, I emphasize the role of univer- sity psychiatric departments as the center of education where young psychiatrists learn the principles and experience the practice of such an advanced care model, which will innovate and reform future mental health care.
