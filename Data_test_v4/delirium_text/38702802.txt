38702802|a|BACKGROUND: The locus coeruleus (LC) and the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) are altered in early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Little is known about LC and NBM alteration in limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The aim of the present study is to investigate in vivo LC and NBM integrity in patients with suspected-LATE, early-amnestic AD and FTD in comparison with controls. METHODS: Seventy-two participants (23 early amnestic-AD patients, 17 suspected-LATE, 17 FTD patients, defined by a clinical-biological diagnosis reinforced by amyloid and tau PET imaging, and 15 controls) underwent neuropsychological assessment and 3T brain MRI. We analyzed the locus coeruleus signal intensity (LC-I) and the NBM volume as well as their relation with cognition and with medial temporal/cortical atrophy. RESULTS: We found significantly lower LC-I and NBM volume in amnestic-AD and suspected-LATE in comparison with controls. In FTD, we also observed lower NBM volume but a slightly less marked alteration of the LC-I, independently of the temporal or frontal phenotype. NBM volume was correlated with the global cognitive efficiency in AD patients. Strong correlations were found between NBM volume and that of medial temporal structures, particularly the amygdala in both AD and FTD patients. CONCLUSIONS: The alteration of LC and NBM in amnestic-AD, presumed-LATE and FTD suggests a common vulnerability of these structures to different proteinopathies. Targeting the noradrenergic and cholinergic systems could be effective therapeutic strategies in LATE and FTD.
