26956224|a|The primary goals of the present study were to develop and validate the Rappel Indice 24 (RI-24), a shorter version of the original Rappel Indice, which includes 48 items (RI-48), and to identify the specific brain regions that were correlated with scores on the RI-24. Using these clinical scales, the present study evaluated 91 elderly Korean participants who were classified into 3 groups: normal control (NC; n = 34), patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 29), and patients with Alzheimer disease (AD; n = 28). Of the 91 participants, 77 also underwent magnetic resonance imaging scans. The RI-24 delayed cued recall (DCR) scores significantly differed among the NC, MCI, and AD groups. A receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the RI-24 was very sensitive (89%) and specific (91%) for the detection of AD. Furthermore, although the time needed to administer the RI-24 was half that needed for the RI-48, the 24-item version showed a high correlation (r= .85 for the DCR score) with the 48-item version. In terms of brain morphological characteristics, voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed a significant positive correlation between DCR score and gray matter volume in the parahippocampal gyrus (r= .468), which plays a role in cued recall. Taken together, the present findings indicate that the RI-24 is a sensitive and reliable test for the detection of memory impairments in patients with MCI and AD despite its brief administration time.
