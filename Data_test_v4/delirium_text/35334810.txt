35334810|t|The Role of Diet and Interventions on Multiple Sclerosis: A Review.
35334810|a|Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation and neurodegeneration. The most prominent clinical features include visual loss and sensorimotor symptoms and mainly affects those of young age. Some of the factors affecting its pathogenesis are genetic and/or environmental including viruses, smoking, obesity, and nutrition. Current research provides evidence that diet may influence MS onset, course, and quality of life of the patients. In this review, we address the role of nutrition on MS pathogenesis as well as dietary interventions that show promising beneficial results with respect to MS activity and progression. Investigation with large prospective clinical studies is required in order to thoroughly evaluate the role of diet in MS.
