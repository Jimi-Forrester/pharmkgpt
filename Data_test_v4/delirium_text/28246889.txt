28246889|t|An evaluation of the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications in older people with cognitive impairment living in Northern Sweden using the EU(7)-PIM list.
28246889|a|PURPOSE: As people get older, their sensitivity to drugs and adverse drug reactions can increase due to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes. Older people with dementia are a particularly vulnerable group of people. They are at an increased risk of being prescribed potentially inappropriate medications, which may lead to harmful consequences. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications among older patients with cognitive impairment. METHODS: Medical records for patients aged >=65 years admitted to two hospitals in Northern Sweden were reviewed. Potentially inappropriate medications were identified using the EU(7)-PIM list as an identification tool. RESULTS: Of 428 patients included in the study, 40.9% had one or more potentially inappropriate medication prescribed. The most commonly represented potentially inappropriate medication classes were hypnotics and sedatives, cardiovascular drugs and laxatives. The most commonly involved potentially inappropriate medications were zopiclone, digoxin and sodium picosulfate. There was an association seen between having a higher number of medications prescribed and having one or more potentially inappropriate medication. CONCLUSION: Potentially inappropriate medications are prevalent among older people with cognitive impairment living in Northern Sweden. It is important to continuously evaluate the need for potentially inappropriate medications in this patient group, in order to prevent adverse drug reactions, especially among those who have a higher number of medications prescribed.
