26634066|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder. Increasing evidence implicates diabetes mellitus (DM) as a risk factor for AD. Green tea (GT) has several beneficial effects attributed to its anti-oxidant phenolic compounds. Adipose tissue is a rich source of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs). This study was designed to evaluate and compare the possible therapeutic effect of green tea extract (GTE) and ADSCs on AD complicating induced DM in male rat. METHODS: 31 adult male albino rats were divided into 5 groups. Group I (Control), Group II received GTE, 50 mg/kg daily orally for 4 weeks, Group III received a single intraperitoneal injection of Streptozotocin (STZ), 50 mg/kg, Group IV: received STZ followed by GTE and Group V: received STZ followed by human ADSCs (hADSCs) intravenously. RESULTS: Multiple acidophilic masses, deformed neurons, Congo red +ve masses and Caspase 3 +ve neurons were seen in group III, became few in group IV and occasional in group V. Multiple Prussian blue +ve cells were detected in group V. Some CD44 +ve cells were noticed in group III, became multiple in groups IV and V. The mean area of neurons exhibiting acidophilic cytoplasm, mean area of amyloid plaques and mean area % of Caspase 3 +ve cells indicated a significant increase in group III. The mean area % of CD44 +ve cells recorded a significant increase in group IV. CONCLUSIONS: hADSCs exerted a more marked therapeutic effect on the neurodegenerative changes complicating DM and corresponding to AD.
