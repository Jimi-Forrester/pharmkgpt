9122315|a|The authors retrospectively reviewed the charts of all patients (N = 903) seen by the Psychiatric Consultation Service from January 1, 1989 through December 31, 1991. A total of 74 patients had a diagnosis of organic mental disorders (delirium, dementia, or both). Of these, 32 patients were evaluated for competency (Study group), while the remaining 42 were evaluated for reasons other than competency (Comparison group). Patients in the Study group were more likely to be African American and less likely to be prescribed psychotropic drugs than the Comparison group. The majority of patients with organic mental disorder (87.5%) evaluated for competency were judged to be incompetent.
