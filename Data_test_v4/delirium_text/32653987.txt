32653987|a|After the introduction of the glymphatic system hypothesis, an increasing number of studies on cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial fluid dynamics within the brain have been investigated and reported. A series of diseases are known which develop due to abnormality of the glymphatic system including Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, or other disorders. These diseases or disorders share the characteristics of the glymphatic system dysfunction or other mechanisms related to the interstitial fluid dynamics. In this review article, we propose "Central Nervous System (CNS) Interstitial Fluidopathy" as a new concept encompassing diseases whose pathologies are majorly associated with abnormal interstitial fluid dynamics. Categorizing these diseases or disorders as "CNS interstitial fluidopathies," will promote the understanding of their mechanisms and the development of potential imaging methods for the evaluation of the disease as well as clinical methods for disease treatment or prevention. In other words, having a viewpoint of the dynamics of interstitial fluid appears relevant for understanding CNS diseases or disorders, and it would be possible to develop novel common treatment methods or medications for "CNS interstitial fluidopathies."
