36600621|t|Amyloids and Amyloid-like Protein Aggregates in Food System: Challenges and New Perspectives.
36600621|a|Protein aggregation or amyloid formation has generally been recognized as an outcome of protein misfolding before or during the onset of certain disease conditions such as Alzheimer's, Cataracts, Huntington's, Cystic fibrosis, Diabetes type II, etc. On the other hand, several organisms have evolved mechanisms to sequester their protein in amyloid-like conformation, and these aggregates play a crucial role in their biochemical functioning. In principle, under certain conditions, all the proteins have this property to form amyloid-like aggregates, which can be toxic or non-toxic. Recent evidence suggests that several amyloids or amyloid-like protein aggregates are derived from various food products, particularly those rich in protein. Many of them are reported to be toxic, raising serious health concerns regarding consuming these amyloid-forming food products. On the other hand, ageing significantly impacts gastrointestinal health, predisposing the senior population to be more susceptible to protein aggregation-related issues. The outcome will be determined by the interaction between food-derived protein aggregates and gastrointestinal proteases, pH change, gut microbiota, and intestinal epithelium integrity. The current review outlines the recent development in this area and a new perspective for designing safe protein-rich diets for healthy nutrition.
