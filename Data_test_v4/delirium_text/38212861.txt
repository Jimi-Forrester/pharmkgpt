38212861|a|BACKGROUND: APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas APOE2 confers protection. However, effects of APOE on neurodegeneration in cognitively intact individuals, and how these associations evolve with cognitive decline, are unclear. Furthermore, few studies have evaluated whether effects of APOE on neurodegenerative changes are modified by other AD key risk factors including age and sex. METHODS: Participants included older adults (57% women; 77 +- 7 years) from the Rancho Bernardo Study of Health Aging and the University of California San Diego Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, including 192 cognitively normal (CN) individuals and 33 with mild cognitive impairment. Participants underwent diffusion MRI, and multicompartment restriction spectrum imaging (RSI) metrics were computed in white matter, gray matter, and subcortical regions of interest. Participants were classified as APOE4 carriers, APOE2 carriers, and APOE3 homozygotes. Analysis of covariance among CN (adjusting for age, sex, and scanner) assessed differences in brain microstructure by APOE, as well as interactions between APOE and sex. Analyses across all participants examined interactions between APOE4 and cognitive status. Linear regressions assessed APOE by age interactions. RESULTS: Among CN, APOE4 carriers showed lower entorhinal cortex neurite density than non-carriers, whereas APOE2 carriers showed lower cingulum neurite density than non-carriers. Differences in entorhinal microstructure by APOE4 and in entorhinal and cingulum microstructure by APOE2 were present for women only. Age correlated with lower entorhinal restricted isotropic diffusion among APOE4 non-carriers, whereas age correlated with lower putamen restricted isotropic diffusion among APOE4 carriers. Differences in microstructure between cognitively normal and impaired participants were stronger for APOE4-carriers in medial temporal regions, thalamus, and global gray matter, but stronger for non-carriers in caudate. CONCLUSIONS: The entorhinal cortex may be an early target of neurodegenerative changes associated with APOE4 in presymptomatic individuals, whereas APOE2 may support beneficial white matter and entorhinal microstructure, with potential sex differences that warrant further investigation. APOE modifies microstructural patterns associated with aging and cognitive impairment, which may advance the development of biomarkers to distinguish microstructural changes characteristic of normal brain aging, APOE-dependent pathways, and non-AD etiologies.
