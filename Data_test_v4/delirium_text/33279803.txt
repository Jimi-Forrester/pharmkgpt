33279803|a|A variety of pathogenic microorganisms can promote the occurrence and development of malignant tumors by colonizing in the body. It has been shown that Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) can be colonized for a long time in upper gastrointestinal tumors and is closely related to the occurrence and development of esophageal cancer in previous studies of our team. Because the esophagus and trachea are closely adjacent and P. gingivalis can instantly enter and colonize in cells, we speculate that P. gingivalis may be colonized in lung cancer cells through oral or blood, promoting the malignant progression of lung cancer. In this study, we investigated P. gingivalis infection in lung carcinoma tissues and adjacent lung tissues, and found that the colonization rate of P. gingivalis in carcinoma tissues was significantly higher than that in adjacent lung tissues. Therefore, we propose that the microenvironment of cancer cells is more conducive to the survival of P. gingivalis. Then, we analyzed the correlation between P. gingivalis infection and clinicopathological features and survival prognosis of patients with lung cancer. It was found that P. gingivalis infection was closely related to smoking, drinking, lymph node metastasis and clinical stage. Moreover, the survival rate and median survival time of patients with P. gingivalis infection were significantly shortened. Therefore, we put forward the view that long term smoking and drinking will cause a bad oral environment, increasing the risk of P. gingivalis infection, then P. gingivalis infection will promote the malignant progression of lung cancer.
