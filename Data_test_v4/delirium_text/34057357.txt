34057357|a|Delirium is a common serious complication in dementia that is associated with poor prognosis and a high burden on caregivers and healthcare professionals. Appropriate care is therefore important at an early stage for patients with delirium superimposed on dementiaTo gain insight into the care of six patients with delirium superimposed on dementia, 19 semi-structured interviews were conducted focused on the experiences of caregivers and professionals. The interviews revealed four themes that appeared to play a role: 1. experiences with and views on behavioral problems of these patients, 2. recognition and diagnosis of delirium in dementia, 3. views on good care and 4. organizational aspects. Knowledge gaps about delirium in dementia, as well as ethical considerations, play an important role in organizing timely and adequate care for patients with delirium superimposed on dementia.
