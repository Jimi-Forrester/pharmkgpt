38035269|a|Purpose: We explored the interaction of optical coherence tomography (OCT) parameters and white matter hyperintensities with cognitive measures in our older adult cohort. Methods: This observational study enrolled participants who underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, structural 3-T brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), visual acuity examination, and OCT imaging. Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) markers were read on MR images; lacune, cerebral microbleeds (CMB), white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS), were defined according to the STRIVE standards. Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thicknesses (mum) were measured on the OCT tool. Results: Older adults with cognitive impairment (CI) showed lower RNFL (p = 0.001), GCIPL (p = 0.009) thicknesses, and lower hippocampal volume (p = 0.004) when compared to non-cognitively impaired (NCI). RNFL (p = 0.006) and GCIPL thicknesses (p = 0.032) correlated with MoCA scores. GCIPL thickness (p = 0.037), total WMH (p = 0.003), PWMH (p = 0.041), and DWMH (p = 0.001) correlated with hippocampal volume in our older adults after adjusting for covariates. With hippocampal volume as the outcome, a significant interaction (p < 0.05) between GCIPL and PWMH and total WMH was observed in our older adults. Conclusion: Both GCIPL thinning and higher WMH burden (especially PWMH) are associated with hippocampal volume and older adults with both pathologies are more susceptible to subclinical cognitive decline.
