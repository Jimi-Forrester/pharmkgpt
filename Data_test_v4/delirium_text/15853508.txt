15853508|a|Patients with Alzheimer's disease may suffer from noncognitive symptoms as well as cognitive symptoms, which the condition is better known for. Behavioral and psychiatric symptoms are common in patients with Alzheimer's disease and may cause great distress to them and their carers. Symptoms include agitation, aggression, wandering, shouting, depression, apathy and sleep disturbance. The safe and effective management of behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer's disease is one of the greatest challenges clinicians face. Traditionally, pharmacological interventions have been the mainstay of treatment but there is growing evidence for the effectiveness of a wide range of nonpharmacological measures. In this review, the evidence and appropriateness of both types of intervention for behavioral and psychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease are discussed.
