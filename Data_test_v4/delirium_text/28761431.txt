28761431|t|Synaptosomal-associated protein 25 may be an intervention target for improving sensory and locomotor functions after spinal cord contusion.
28761431|a|Synaptosomal-associated protein 25 kDa (SNAP-25) is localized on the synapse and participates in exocytosis and neurotransmitter release. Decreased expression of SNAP-25 is associated with Alzheimer's disease and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. However, the expression of SNAP-25 in spinal cord contusion injury is still unclear. We hypothesized that SNAP-25 is associated with sensory and locomotor functions after spinal cord injury. We established rat models of spinal cord contusion injury to detect gene changes with a gene array. A decreased level of SNAP-25 was detected by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction and western blot assay at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days post injury. SNAP-25 was localized in the cytoplasm of neurons of the anterior and posterior horns, which are involved in locomotor and sensory functions. Our data suggest that reduced levels of SNAP-25 are associated with sensory and locomotor functions in rats with spinal cord contusion injury.
