27567853|t|Zinc-Mediated Binding of Nucleic Acids to Amyloid-beta Aggregates: Role of Histidine Residues.
27567853|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Besides extracellular Abeta, intraneuronal Abeta (iAbeta) has been suggested to contribute to AD onset and development. Based on reported in vitro Abeta-DNA interactions and nuclear localization of iAbeta, the interference of iAbeta with the normal DNA expression has recently been proposed as a plausible pathway by which Abeta can exert neurotoxicity. Employing the sedimentation assay, thioflavin T fluorescence, and dynamic light scattering we have studied effects of zinc ions on binding of RNA and single- and double-stranded DNA molecules to Abeta42 aggregates. It has been found that zinc ions significantly enhance the binding of RNA and DNA molecules to pre-formed beta-sheet rich Abeta42 aggregates. Another type of Abeta42 aggregates, the zinc-induced amorphous aggregates, was demonstrated to also bind all types of nucleic acids tested. To evaluate the role of the Abeta metal-binding domain's histidine residues in Abeta-nucleic acid interactions mediated by zinc, Abeta16 mutants with substitutions H6R and H6A-H13A and rat Abeta16 lacking histidine residue 13 were used. The zinc-induced interaction of Abeta16 with DNA was shown to critically depend on histidine residues 6 and 13. However, the inclusion of H6R mutation in Abeta42 peptide did not affect DNA binding to Abeta42 aggregates. Since oxidative and/or nitrosative stresses implicated in AD pathogenesis are known to release zinc ions from metallothioneins in cytoplasm and cell nuclei, our findings suggest that intracellular zinc can be an important player in iAbeta-nucleic acid interactions.
