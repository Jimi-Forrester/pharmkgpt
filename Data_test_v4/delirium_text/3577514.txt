3577514|t|[Features of vitamin C metabolism and the functional status of the liver in alcoholism and alcoholic delirium in the stage of detoxification therapy].
3577514|a|The metabolism of vitamin C and the function of the liver were investigated in 106 patients suffering from alcoholism (34 with clinical stage 1, 53 with clinical stage 2, and 19 with alcoholic delirium). The levels of ascorbic acid (AA) were reduced while those of dehydroascorbic (DAA) and diketogulonic acids (DKGA) were elevated. Red blood cells presented an increase in both AA and DAA and a decrease in DKGA concentrations. AA excretion with the urine was diminished. Considerable liver dysfunction was ascertained. Intensity of the normalization of AA metabolism coincided in time with the normalization of liver enzyme levels (ALT, AsT, CE). Degree of changes in AA metabolism in alcoholism may to a certain degree depend on the severity of liver dysfunction.
