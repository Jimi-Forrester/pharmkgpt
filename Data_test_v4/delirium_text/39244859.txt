39244859|t|The association of frailty with morbidity and mortality following major mucosal head and neck surgery.
39244859|a|OBJECTIVES: Frailty refers to a state of reduced physiological reserve and functional decline. We sought to analyse whether frailty, assessed using the 5-item modified frailty index (5mFI), was associated with increased morbidity and mortality following major mucosal head and neck surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients undergoing major mucosal head and neck surgical resection over a 2-year period. Potential confounding variables were controlled by way of multivariable regression analysis. RESULTS: There were 310 patients included with 77 (24.8 %) classified as frail. Most patients were male (219/310, 70.7 %), had a history of smoking (246/310, 79.4 %) and 151 patients (48.7 %) were older than 65 at time of surgery. Most surgeries related to oral cavity or oropharyngeal subsites (227/310, 73.2 %) and 150 patients (48.4 %) underwent microvascular free tissue reconstruction. On multivariable analysis, frail patients were more likely to suffer adverse outcomes such as a return to theatre (OR 3.47, 95 % CI 1.82-6.62, p < 0.001), a Clavien-Dindo grade IV complication (OR 6.23, 95 % CI 2.55-15.20, p < 0.001) or medical complications, such as respiratory complications (OR 2.61, 95 % CI 1.45-4.69; p = 0.001) or delirium (OR 5.05, 95 % CI 2.46-10.33; p < 0.001). Additionally, hospital length of stay was increased among frail patients (ss 16.46 days, 95 % CI 9.85-23.07 days; p < 0.001). Neither 90-day nor 1-year post-operative mortality was increased in frail patients. CONCLUSION: Frailty assessed using the 5mFI was associated with greater post-operative morbidity, but not mortality following major mucosal head and neck surgery.
