METHODS: This is a longitudinal cohort study of 318 cognitively normal individuals with data on fasting lipid levels at midlife (mean age 54 years). Presence of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau pathologies 20 years later (mean age 73 years) were detected by quantifying Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers in CSF. In a subset (n = 134), Abeta (18F-flutemetamol) PET was also performed. RESULTS: CSF Abeta42 and Abeta PET revealed Abeta pathology in approximately 20% of the cognitively healthy population and CSF Abeta42/phosphorylated tau (p-tau) ratio indicated both Abeta and tau pathology in 16%. Higher levels of triglycerides in midlife were independently associated with abnormal CSF Abeta42 (odds ratio [OR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.75, p = 0.029) and abnormal Abeta42/p-tau ratio (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.10-1.93; p = 0.009) adjusting for age, sex, APOE epsilon4, education, and multiple vascular risk factors. Triglycerides were also associated with abnormal Abeta PET in multivariable regression models, but the association was attenuated in the fully adjusted model. Increased levels of medium and large low-density lipoprotein subfractions were significantly associated with abnormal Abeta PET and large high-density lipoprotein particles were associated with decreased risk of abnormal Abeta PET. CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of triglycerides at midlife predict brain Abeta and tau pathology 20 years later in cognitively healthy individuals. Certain lipoprotein subfractions may also be risk factors for Abeta pathology. These findings further support an involvement of lipids in the very early stages of AD development.
