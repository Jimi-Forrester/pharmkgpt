37239615|t|Factors Affecting Delirium in ICU Patients.
37239615|a|This study examined delirium severity using a delirium screening tool and analyzed the predictors, including pain, acuity, level of consciousness, fall risk, and pain score, to increase understanding of delirium and present foundational data for developing nursing interventions for delirium prevention. This was a retrospective study of 165 patients admitted to three intensive care units (ICUs). the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC) was used as a research tool to screen for delirium and measure the degree of delirium. The incidence of delirium in patients was 53.3%, and the average delirium score in the delirium group was 2.40 +- 0.56. Nu-DESC scores were significantly correlated with ICU days, ventilator days, restraint applications, the number of catheters inserted, sedative medication use, the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS III), the Morse Fall Scale (MFS), the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, pain scores, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Stepwise multiple linear regression showed that the number of restraint applications, GCS score, ICU days, and BUN levels were factors influencing delirium. Based on the findings, ICU nurses should use delirium screening tools to ensure accurate delirium screening and work to reduce the incidence and degree of delirium by observing factors affecting delirium in patients.
