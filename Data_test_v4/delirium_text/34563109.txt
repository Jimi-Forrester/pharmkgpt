34563109|t|Admission white blood cell count predicts post-discharge mortality in patients with acute aortic dissection: data from the MIMIC-III database.
34563109|a|BACKGROUND: Inflammation underlies both the pathogenesis and prognosis in patients with acute aortic dissection (AAD). This study aimed to assess the association of ICU admission of white blood cell count (WBCc) with post-discharge mortality in these patients. METHODS: Clinical data were extracted from the MIMIC-III V1.4 database. After adjusted to covariables, Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival curve were performed to determine the relationship between WBCc on admission and post-discharge mortality (30-day, 90-day, 1-year and 5-year) in AAD patients. Subgroup analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used to test the performance of WBCc in predicting mortality in AAD patients. RESULTS: A total of 325 eligible patients were divided into 2 groups: normal-WBCc group (<= 11 k/uL) and high-WBCc group (> 11 K/uL). In univariate Cox regression analysis, high WBCc was significant risk predictor of 30-day, 90-day, 1-year and 5-year mortality [hazard ratio (HR), 95% CI, P 2.58 1.36-4.91 0.004; 3.16 1.76-5.70 0.000; 2.74 1.57-4.79 0.000; 2.10 1.23-3.54 0.006]. After adjusting for age and other risks, high WBCc remained a significant predictor of 30-day, 90-day and 1-year mortality in AAD patients (HR, 95% CI, P 1.994 1.058-3.76 0.033; 2.118 1.175-3.819 0.013; 2.37 1.343-4.181 0.003). The area under ROC curve of WBCc for predicting 30-day, 90-day, 1-year and 5-year mortality were 0.69, 0.70, 0.66 and 0.61, respectively. The results from subgroups analysis showed that there was no interaction in most strata and patients who were younger than 69 years of age or had history of respiratory disease with an elevated WBCc had an excess risk of 30-day mortality (HR, 95% CI, P 3.18 1.41-7.14 0.005; 3.84 1.05-14.13 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Higher than normal WBCc on admission may predict post-discharge mortality in patients with AAD.
