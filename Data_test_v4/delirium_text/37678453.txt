37678453|a|Emergence delirium or postoperative agitation is the name given to the state of altered consciousness that occurs after surgery and especially affects pediatric patients. Its incidence is not negligible, reaching 80% of cases in certain studies. It is frequently confused with other clinical entities, for which reason a scale has been validated to facilitate its diagnosis. Risk factors include age under 5 years, the presence of pain after surgery and especially intense preoperative anxiety. Pediatric emergence delirium presents as an adverse event after surgery and influences patient safety by significantly increasing patient comorbidity. It is essential to recognize the entity, as well as its risk factors, in order to apply effective preventive measures to reduce its incidence and intensity when it occurs.
