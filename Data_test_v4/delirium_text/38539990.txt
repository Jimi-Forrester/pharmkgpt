38539990|t|Impact of a Dexmedetomidine Intravenous Infusion in Septic Dogs: Preliminary Study.
38539990|a|The purpose of this study was to determine if a continuous rate infusion (CRI) of dexmedetomidine decreases vasopressor requirements in septic dogs undergoing surgery. Vital parameters, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, vasopressor requirement, and 28-day mortality were recorded. Dogs were randomly divided into two groups: a dexmedetomidine (DEX) (1 mcg/kg/h) group and a control group (NaCl), which received an equivalent CRI of NaCl. Dogs were premedicated with fentanyl 5 mcg/kg IV, induced with propofol, and maintained with sevoflurane and a variable rate fentanyl infusion. DEX or NaCl infusions were started 10 min prior to induction. Fluid-responsive hypotensive patients received repeated Ringer's lactate boluses (2 mL/kg) until stable or they were no longer fluid-responsive. Patients that remained hypotensive following fluid boluses received norepinephrine at a starting dose of 0.05 mcg/kg/min, with increases of 0.05 mcg/kg/min. Rescue adrenaline boluses were administered (0.001 mg/kg) if normotension was not achieved within 30 min of starting norepinephrine. The NaCl group received a significantly higher dose of norepinephrine (0.8, 0.4-2 mcg/kg/min) than the DEX group (0.12, 0-0.86 mcg/kg/min). Mortality was statistically lower in the DEX group (1/10) vs. the NaCl group (5/6). Results of this study suggest that a 1 mcg/kg/h CRI of dexmedetomidine decreases the demand for intraoperative vasopressors and may improve survival in septic dogs.
