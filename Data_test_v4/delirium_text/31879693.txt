31879693|a|For several years, research from around the world has suggested that the neuroactive steroid (3alpha,5alpha)-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one (allopregnanolone) may have therapeutic potential for treatment of various stress-related diseases including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, alcohol use disorders (AUDs), as well as neurological and psychiatric conditions that are worsened in the presence of stress, such as multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, and seizure disorders. In this review, we make the argument that the pleiotropic actions of allopregnanolone account for its ability to promote recovery in such a wide variety of illnesses. Likewise, the allopregnanolone precursors, pregnenolone and progesterone, share many actions of allopregnanolone. Of course, pregnenolone and progesterone lack direct effects on GABAA receptors, but these compounds are converted to allopregnanolone in vivo. This review presents a theoretical framework for understanding how endogenous neurosteroids that regulate 1) gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors, 2) corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and 3) pro-inflammatory signaling in the innate immune system and brain could play a key role in both the prevention and treatment of stress-related disease. We further discuss cautions and limitations of allopregnanolone or precursor therapy as well as the need for more clinical studies.
