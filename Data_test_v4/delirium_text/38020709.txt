38020709|a|To date, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have discovered 35 susceptible loci of leprosy; however, the cumulative effects of these loci can only partially explain the overall risk of leprosy, and the causal variants and genes within these loci remain unknown. Here, we conducted out new GWASs in two independent cohorts of 5007 cases and 4579 controls and then a meta-analysis in these newly generated and multiple previously published (2277 cases and 3159 controls) datasets were performed. Three novel and 15 previously reported risk loci were identified from these datasets, increasing the known leprosy risk loci of explained genetic heritability from 23.0 to 38.5%. A comprehensive fine-mapping analysis was conducted, and 19 causal variants and 14 causal genes were identified. Specifically, manual checking of epigenomic information from the Epimap database revealed that the causal variants were mainly located within the immune-relevant or immune-specific regulatory elements. Furthermore, by using gene-set, tissue, and cell-type enrichment analyses, we highlighted the key roles of immune-related tissues and cells and implicated the PD-1 signaling pathways in the pathogenetic mechanism of leprosy. Collectively, our study identified candidate causal variants and elucidated the potential regulatory and coding mechanisms for genes associated with leprosy.
