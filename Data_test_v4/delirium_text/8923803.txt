8923803|t|Novel anticholinesterase and antiamnesic activities of dehydroevodiamine, a constituent of Evodia rutaecarpa.
8923803|a|To find a new compound with antiamnesic activity, we screened 29 natural products for their abilities to inhibit acetylcholinesterase and reverse scopolamine-induced amnesia. Among the plants tested Evodia rutaecarpa Bentham showed a strong inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase in vitro and an anti-amnesic effect in vivo. By sequential fractionation of E. rutaecarpa, the active component was finally identified as dehydroevodiamine hydrochloride (DHED). DHED inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity in a dose-dependent and non-competitive manner. The IC50 value of DHED is 37.8 microM. A single administration of DHED to rats (6.25 mg/kg) significantly reversed the scopolamine-induced memory impairment in a passive avoidance test. The antiamnesic effect of DHED was more potent than that of tacrine which is the only drug for Alzheimer's disease approved by FDA. This potent antiamnesic effect of DHED was thought to be due to the combined effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibition and the known cerebral blood flow enhancement. These results indicate that DHED has novel anti-cholinesterase and antiamnesic activities and might have therapeutic potential in various disorders including Alzheimer's disease.
