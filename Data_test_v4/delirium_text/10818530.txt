10818530|a|Cholinesterase inhibitors used to treat Alzheimer's disease according to the principle of cholinergic replacement therapy have proved to be less beneficial than expected. The present study was designed to investigate the cerebrovascular response to physostigmine and tacrine in the experimental model of lesioning of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM), a model involving a cholinergic deficit. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured by the [14C]iodoantipyrine tissue sampling technique in conscious rats infused with i.v. physostigmine (0.2 mg/kg/h), tacrine (8 mg/kg/h), or saline, 3-5 weeks after unilateral lesion of the NBM with ibotenic acid. Physostigmine and tacrine dose-dependently increased blood flow in most cortical and subcortical regions compared to the control group. However, physostigmine caused smaller blood flow increases in several areas, mostly cortical, of the lesioned compared to the intact hemisphere. The converse was observed with tacrine. A facilitated circulatory response appeared in cortical areas deafferented from the NBM, especially in the frontal cortex. These results provide evidence for distinct NBM-dependent components of the cortical cerebrovascular effects of physostigmine and tacrine. They suggest the involvement of different cellular postsynaptic targets of the NBM. The physostigmine-type effects could involve direct projects onto an inhibitory cortical interneuron supersensitized by deafferentation. This arrangement may explain why physostigmine and perhaps other cholinergic agonists are unable to specifically compensate for a deficit in NBM functioning. The tacrine-type effects presumably involve projections to the microvasculature, including perivascular astrocytes. The neurovascular junction would be sensitized by deafferentation from the NBM. Our data suggest that the regulatory mechanisms of blood flow originating in the NBM might constitute a target of neurodegenerative processes of Alzheimer's disease.
