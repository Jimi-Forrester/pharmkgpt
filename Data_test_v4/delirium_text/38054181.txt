38054181|t|The Effect of Intranasal Dexmedetomidine on Emergence Delirium Prevention in Pediatric Ambulatory Dental Rehabilitation Under General Anesthesia: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
38054181|a|Purpose: Sevoflurane is the preferred anesthetic agent for induction and maintenance of ambulatory surgery due to its property of fast onset and recovery. However, it has been recognized as one of the major contributors of emergence delirium. The aim of this study was to evaluate the preventive effect of intranasal dexmedetomidine on the occurrence of emergence delirium in pediatric patients under general anesthesia with sevoflurane. Patients and Methods: Ninety pediatric patients undergoing dental rehabilitation under sevoflurane anesthesia were enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into three groups (n=30 each in the 2 mug/kg dexmedetomidine, 1 mug/kg dexmedetomidine, and control with saline groups). The same volume (0.02mL/kg) of the mixed solution was dropped into the nasal cavity of the children 30 minutes before surgery. We used the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scale (PAED) to assess the level and incidence of delirium in the post-anesthesia care unit. Results: Compared with the control group, prophylactic use of different dosages of intranasal dexmedetomidine significantly reduces the incidence of ED and severe ED in PACU (P<0.001). Intranasal administration of 2 mug/kg dexmedetomidine was associated with a better acceptance of mask induction and a better tolerance of separation with parents. Conclusion: Both 2 mug/kg and 1 mug/kg intranasal dexmedetomidine can achieve ED preventive effects in PACU in dental rehabilitation under general anesthesia. A dosage of 2 mug/kg is more effective in preventing severe ED and providing better mask acceptance.
