32225124|a|BACKGROUND Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum, DDP) resistance is identified as the primary obstacle during lung cancer treatment, while DDP resistance is exist extensively. This report was to investigate the roles of propofol in lung cancer cells tolerance to DDP and the potential mechanisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS A549 and A549/DDP cells were treated with DDP for 48 hours, and cell proliferation suppression rate was detected by MTT (thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide) assay and half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of DDP to lung cancer cells was calculated. Besides, cell proliferation and apoptosis were determined by MTT assay and flow cytometry assay respectively in propofol-treated A549/DDP and A549 cells. Furthermore, we performed MTT assay to determine the influence of propofol on the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to DDP. RESULTS The results demonstrated that the IC50 of DDP to A549 cells was lower than that in A549/DDP cells. Propofol dramatically inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis of A549/DDP and A549 cells. In addition, propofol significantly improved the anti-proliferative impact of DDP in A549/DDP and A549 cells, and the value of IC50 for DDP in the A549/DDP and A549 cells were decreased after propofol treatment compare to the control group. Moreover, propofol inhibited the Wnt/ss-catenin pathway in a dose-dependent manner in both A549/DDP and A549 cells. CONCLUSIONS Our report indicated that propofol could control lung cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis, and stimulated the suppression function of DDP on lung cancer cell multiplication via the Wnt/ss-catenin signaling pathway, and also provided a new treatment for DDP tolerance to cure lung cancer in clinical.
