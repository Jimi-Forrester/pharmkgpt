34064687|t|Berberine Improves Cognitive Impairment by Simultaneously Impacting Cerebral Blood Flow and beta-Amyloid Accumulation in an APP/tau/PS1 Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
34064687|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is accompanied by beta-amyloid (Abeta), neurofibrillary tangles, and neuron cell death, and is one of the most commonly occurring diseases among the elderly. The pathology of AD is complex, involving Abeta overproduction and accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuronal loss. In addition, chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is ubiquitous in the AD patients and plans a pivotal role in triggering and exacerbating the pathophysiological progress of AD. The goal of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective properties of berberine (BBR) and the underlying mechanism. During the study, BBR was administrated to treat the triple-transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (3xTg AD). To thoroughly evaluate the effects of the BBR administration, multiple manners were utilized, for instance, 3D arterial spin labeling technique, Morris water maze assay, immunofluorescence staining, TUNEL assay, laser speckle contrast imaging, western blotting, etc. The results showed that BBR ameliorated cognitive deficits in 3xTg AD mice, reduced the Abeta accumulation, inhibited the apoptosis of neurons, promoted the formation of microvessels in the mouse brain by enhancing brain CD31, VEGF, N-cadherin, Ang-1. The new vessels promoted by BBR were observed to have a complete structure and perfect function, which in turn promoted the recovery of cerebral blood flow (CBF). In general, berberine is effective to 3xTg AD mice, has a neuroprotective effect, and is a candidate drug for the multi-target prevention and treatment of AD.
