30755648|a|Aluminum (Al), which is omnipresent in human life, is a potent neurotoxin. Here, we have tested the potential for Egg White Hydrolysate (EWH) to protect against changes in cognitive function in rats exposed to both high and low levels of Al. Indeed, EWH has been previously shown to improve the negative effects induced by chronic exposure to heavy metals. Male Wistar rats received orally: Group 1) Low aluminum level (AlCl3 at a dose of 8.3 mg/kg b.w. during 60 days) with or without EWH treatment (1 g/kg/day); Group 2) High aluminum level (AlCl3 at a dose of 100 mg/kg b.w. during 42 days) with or without EWH treatment (1 g/kg/day). After 60 or 42 days of exposure, rats exposed to Al and EWH did not show memory or cognitive dysfunction as was observed in Al-treated animals. Indeed, co-treatment with EWH prevented catalepsy, hippocampal oxidative stress, cholinergic dysfunction and increased number of activated microglia and COX-2-positive cells induced by Al exposure. Altogether, since hippocampal inflammation and oxidative damage were partially prevented by EWH, our results suggest that it could be used as a protective agent against the detrimental effects of long term exposure to Al.
