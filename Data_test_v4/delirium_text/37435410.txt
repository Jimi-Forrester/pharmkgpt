37435410|a|Introduction: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) infection has recently gained worldwide interest due to limited treatment options and high morbidity and mortality rates. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) infection in older adult patients. Material and Methods: This retrospective, single-center study included 132 patients with healthcare-associated CRKP infection (case group) and 150 patients with healthcare-associated carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae (CSKP) infection (control group), aged > 65 years. Results: In the CRKP and CSKP groups, 79 (59.8%) and 80 (53.3%) patients were males, and the mean ages were 77.8 +- 7.8 and 76.6 +- 7.7 years, respectively. Diabetes mellitus (DM), malignancy, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), surgical intervention, invasive mechanical ventilation, central venous catheter insertion, parenteral nutrition, hospitalization in the previous 6 months, antibiotic use in the previous 3 months, and exposure to cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and carbapenems were significantly more common in the CRKP than the CSKP group (all p < 0.05). The multivariate logistic regression analysis identified malignancy, CVDs, DM, invasive mechanical ventilation, hospitalization in the previous 6 months, ICU admission, and exposure to cephalosporins, quinolones, and carbapenems as independent risk factors for CRKP infection in older adult patients. Conclusion: DM, malignancy, CVDs, ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and exposure to ceftriaxone, fluoroquinolones, and carbapenems were independent risk factors for CRKP infection in older adult patients. The identification of risk factors for CRKP infection can help to prevent and treat CRKP infection.
