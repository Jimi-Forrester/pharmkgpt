37506291|a|INTRODUCTION: To examine the extent to which positron emission tomography (PET)-, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-, and plasma-related amyloid-beta/tau/neurodegeneration (A/T/N) biomarkers are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology at autopsy. METHODS: A total of 100 participants who respectively underwent antemortem biomarker measurements and postmortem neuropathology were included in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We examined the associations of PET-, CSF-, and plasma-related A/T/N biomarkers in combinations or alone with AD neuropathological changes (ADNC). RESULTS: PET- and CSF-related A/T/N biomarkers in combination showed high concordance with the ADNC stage and alone showed high accuracy in discriminating autopsy-confirmed AD. However, the plasma-related A/T/N biomarkers alone showed better discriminative performance only when combined with apolipoprotein E (APO)E epsilon4 genotype. DISCUSSION: This study supports that PET- and CSF-related A/T/N profiles can be used to predict accurately the stages of AD neuropathology. For diagnostic settings, PET-, CSF-, and plasma-related A/T/N biomarkers are all useful diagnostic tools to detect the presence of AD neuropathology. HIGHLIGHTS: PET- and CSF-related A/T/N biomarkers in combination can accurately predict the specific stages of AD neuropathology. PET- and CSF-related A/T/N biomarkers alone may serve as a precise diagnostic tool for detecting AD neuropathology at autopsy. Plasma-related A/T/N biomarkers may need combined risk factors when used as a diagnostic tool. Abeta PET and CSF p-tau181/Abeta42 were most consistent with Abeta pathology, while tau PET and CSF p-tau181/Abeta42 were most consistent with tau pathology.
