35420796|t|Optical Nanosensor for Intracellular and Intracranial Detection of Amyloid-Beta.
35420796|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition occurs in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the early detection of Abeta is a persistent challenge. Herein, we engineered a near-infrared optical nanosensor capable of detecting Abeta intracellularly in live cells and intracranially in vivo. The sensor is composed of single-walled carbon nanotubes functionalized with Abeta wherein Abeta-Abeta interactions drive the response. We found that the Abeta nanosensors selectively responded to Abeta via solvatochromic modulation of the near-infrared emission of the nanotube. The sensor tracked Abeta accumulation in live cells and, upon intracranial administration in a genetic model of AD, signaled distinct responses in aged mice. This technology enables the interrogation of molecular mechanisms underlying Abeta neurotoxicity in the development of AD in living systems.
