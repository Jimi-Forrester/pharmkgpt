33628219|t|Role of BDNF-mTORC1 Signaling Pathway in Female Depression.
33628219|a|Depression is a common psychological and mental disorder, characterized by low mood, slow thinking and low will, and even suicidal tendencies in severe cases. It imposes a huge mental and economic burden on patients and their families, and its prevention and treatment have become an urgent public health problem. It is worth noting that there is a significant gender difference in the incidence of depression. Studies have shown that females are far more likely to suffer from depression than males, confirming a close relationship between estrogen and the onset of depression. Moreover, recent studies suggest that the brain-derived neurotrophic factor- (BDNF-) mammalian target of rapamycin complex-1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway is a crucial target pathway for improving depression and mediates the rapid antidepressant-like effects of various antidepressants. However, it is not clear whether the BDNF-mTORC1 signaling pathway mediates the regulation of female depression and how to regulate female depression. Hence, we focused on the modulation of estrogen-BDNF-mTORC1 signaling in depression and its possible mechanisms in recent years.
