24820013|a|It has been commonly believed that a decrease in cerebral blood flow (CBF), which routinely occurs in Alzheimer's disease (AD), results from the death of critical intracerebral neurons that no longer require the maintenance of an adequate blood supply. This belief is presently being challenged by the idea that it is not neuronal death that causes a decrease in CBF, but actually a decrease in the CBF which leads to the death of neurons seen in AD. In association with dead neurons located within the AD brain are varying numbers of deteriorating neurons. Increasing the CBF to still viable but deteriorating neurons in AD is believed to delay and even improve the clinical manifestations of AD. This increase in CBF has proven effective in treating a group of patients with AD. The increase in CBF was accomplished surgically by placing an intact pedicled omentum directly on the AD brain. While surgery is not a long-term answer in the treatment of AD, the surgical procedure should be evaluated by a carefully controlled study while awaiting the future development of a pharmaceutical method to control the disease.
