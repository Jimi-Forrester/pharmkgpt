16443488|t|Neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease.
16443488|a|In 1907, Alois Alzheimer described the presence of plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in a demented patient. Currently, Alzheimer's disease is known to be the most common cause of dementia in elderly patients. In this article, we summarize the most important neuropathologic features of Alzheimer's disease, including amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal loss, synaptic depletion, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, Hirano bodies, and granulovacuolar degeneration. We also review the history and application of Alzheimer's disease diagnostic criteria.
