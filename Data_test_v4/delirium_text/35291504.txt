35291504|a|Introduction: Frailty and socioeconomic position (SEP) are well-established determinants of health. However, we know less about the contributions of frailty and SEP in older adults, especially in acute settings. We set out to answer how frailty and SEP might influence health outcomes in older people, comparing a population sample and patients managed by a speciality acute frailty service. Methods: We used the Delirium and Population Health Informatics Cohort, a population sample of 1510 individuals aged >=70 years from the London Borough of Camden and 1750 acute frailty patients. SEP was determined using the Index of Multiple Deprivation. Linear and Cox proportional hazard regression models were conducted to assess SEP on frailty, readmission, and mortality outcomes. Results: In the population sample, SEP was significantly associated with frailty and mortality with successive increases in rate of death for each IMD quintile (HR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.49, P < 0.005). Increasing SEP, age, and admission status among hospitalized individuals were associated with greater frailty. For individuals seen by the speciality frailty service, SEP was not associated with frailty, mortality, or readmission. Discussion: When older people experience acute illness severe enough to require secondary care, particularly specialist services, this overcomes any prior advantages conferred by a higher SEP.
