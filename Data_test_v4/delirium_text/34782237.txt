34782237|t|Incidence, risk factors, and consequences of emergence delirium after elective brain tumor resection.
34782237|a|BACKGROUND: Emergence delirium (ED) is a common phenomenon occurring in the recovery period. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence, risk factors, and consequences of ED in adults after elective brain tumor resection. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of a prospective cohort performed in a tertiary university hospital. Adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) immediately after elective brain tumor resection were consecutively enrolled. Level of consciousness was assessed using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and ED was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU. Risk factors for ED were determined by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 659 patients met the inclusion criteria, of which 41 patients with coma were excluded. Among the remaining 618 patients, 131 (21.2%) developed ED. Independent risk factors for ED were: age, education level, use of anticholinergic and mannitol, Glasgow Coma Score and arterial partial pressure of oxygen postoperatively, postoperative pain, malignant tumor, and frontal approach craniotomy. ED was associated with increased postoperative delirium, longer length of hospital stay, and higher hospitalization costs. There was no significant difference in the neurological function deficits (modified Rankin Scale score) between ED and non-ED groups. CONCLUSIONS: ED has a high incidence and is associated with poor outcomes in adults after elective brain tumor resection. Early screening and prevention for ED should be established in perioperative management of this population.
