36536885|t|AZGP1 Up-Regulation is a Potential Target for Andrographolide Reversing Radioresistance of Colorectal Cancer.
36536885|a|Background: Radiation resistance is a challenge that limits the therapeutic benefit of colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment, but the mechanism underlying CRC radiation resistance remains unclear. Andrographolide shows a broad-spectrum anti-tumor effect in various malignancies, including CRC, its effect and how it functions in CRC initiation, and radiation have not been established. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of CRC radiation resistance and the potential mechanisms of andrographolide on CRC radiation. Methods: Two acquired radioresistant cell lines were established and high throughput sequencing was employed to screen out the differentially expressed genes. The expression of AZGP1, which was upregulated in the acquired radioresistant tissues, was verified by microarray data recomputing. The common targets of andrographolide, CRC initiation, and radiation resistance were obtained, and the corresponding functional enrichment and pathway analysis were performed. The interaction between AZGP1 and andrographolide was investigated using molecular docking. Results: AZGP1 was upregulated in both the radioresistant cell model and microarray data. Moreover, AZGP1 was upregulated in cancerous colorectal tissue and displayed a tendency toward elevated expression in patients with an unfavorable prognosis. AZGP1 was identified as the common target of andrographolide, colorectal cancer initiation, and radiotherapy resistance. Ultimately, the protein structure of AZGP1 proved to be closely intertwined with the crystal texture of andrographolide. Conclusion: AZGP1 is recognized as a crucial factor for both CRC initiation and radioresistance. Andrographolide may affect the radioresistance of CRC via the targeting of AZGP1. Thus, the combination of andrographolide and AZGP1 intervention might be a promising strategy for improving the treatment benefit of CRC radiotherapy.
