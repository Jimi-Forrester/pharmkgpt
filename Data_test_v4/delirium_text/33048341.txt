33048341|t|Spatially resolved mass spectrometry analysis of amyloid plaque-associated lipids.
33048341|a|Over the last 10 years, considerable technical advances in mass spectrometry (MS)-based bioanalysis have enabled the investigation of lipid signatures in neuropathological structures. In Alzheimer s Disease (AD) research, it is now well accepted that lipid dysregulation plays a key role in AD pathogenesis and progression. This review summarizes current MS-based strategies, notably MALDI and ToF-SIMS imaging as well as laser capture microdissection combined with LC-ESI-MS. It also presents recent advances to assess lipid alterations associated with Amyloid-beta plaques, one of the hallmarks of AD. Collectively, these methodologies offer new opportunities for the study of lipids, thus pushing forward our understanding of their role in such a complex and still untreatable disease as AD.
