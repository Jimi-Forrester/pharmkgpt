38307424|t|Psychedelics for Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementia: Unveiling Therapeutic Possibilities and Pathways.
38307424|a|Psychedelics have traditionally been used for spiritual and recreational purposes, but recent developments in psychotherapy have highlighted their potential as therapeutic agents. These compounds, which act as potent 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) agonists, have been recognized for their ability to enhance neural plasticity through the activation of the serotoninergic and glutamatergic systems. However, the implications of these findings for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, particularly dementia, have not been fully explored. In recent years, studies have revealed the modulatory and beneficial effects of psychedelics in the context of dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related dementia, which lacks a definitive cure. Psychedelics such as N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and Psilocybin have shown potential in mitigating the effects of this debilitating disease. These compounds not only target neurotransmitter imbalances but also act at the molecular level to modulate signalling pathways in AD, including the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signalling pathway and the subsequent activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and other autophagy regulators. Therefore, the controlled and dose-dependent administration of psychedelics represents a novel therapeutic intervention worth exploring and considering for the development of drugs for the treatment of AD-related dementia. In the present review article, we critically examined the literature that sheds light on the therapeutic possibilities and pathways of psychedelics for Alzheimer's disease-related dementia. While this emerging field of research holds great promise, further studies are necessary to elucidate the long-term safety, efficacy, and optimal treatment protocols. Ultimately, the integration of psychedelics into the current treatment paradigm may provide a transformative approach for addressing the unmet needs of individuals living with ADRD and their caregivers.
