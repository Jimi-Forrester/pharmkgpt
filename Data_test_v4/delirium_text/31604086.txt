31604086|t|Evaluation of Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis for the Detection of Rod-Shaped Particles and Protein Aggregates.
31604086|a|Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) is an important technique for measuring hydrodynamic size of globular biological particles including liposomes and viruses. Less attention has been paid to NTA of rod-like particles, despite their considerable interest. For example, amyloid fibrils and protofibrils are protein aggregates with rod-like morphology, diameters of 2-15 nm, and lengths from 50 nm to 1 mum, and linked to diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. We used NTA to measure the concentration and hydrodynamic size of gold nanorods (10 nm diameter, 35-250 nm length) and myosin (2 nm diameter, 160 nm length), as models of rod-like particles. Measured hydrodynamic diameters of gold nanorods were consistent with theoretical calculations, as long as particle concentration and solution conditions were controlled. Myosin monomers were invisible by NTA, but a small population of aggregates was detected. We combined NTA results with other light scattering data to gain insight into number and size distribution of protein solutions containing both monomer and aggregates. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of NTA and its limitations by characterizing aggregates of alpha-synuclein. Of note is the use of NTA to detect a change in morphology from compact to elongated by analyzing the ratio of hydrodynamic size to intensity.
