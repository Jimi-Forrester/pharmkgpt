37240351|t|CNS-Related Effects Caused by Vanadium at Realistic Exposure Levels in Humans: A Comprehensive Overview Supplemented with Selected Animal Studies.
37240351|a|Neurodegenerative disorders, which are currently incurable diseases of the nervous system, are a constantly growing social concern. They are progressive and lead to gradual degeneration and/or death of nerve cells, resulting in cognitive deterioration or impaired motor functions. New therapies that would ensure better treatment results and contribute to a significant slowdown in the progression of neurodegenerative syndromes are constantly being sought. Vanadium (V), which is an element with a wide range of impacts on the mammalian organism, is at the forefront among the different metals studied for their potential therapeutic use. On the other hand, it is a well-known environmental and occupational pollutant and can exert adverse effects on human health. As a strong pro-oxidant, it can generate oxidative stress involved in neurodegeneration. Although the detrimental effects of vanadium on the CNS are relatively well recognized, the role of this metal in the pathophysiology of various neurological disorders, at realistic exposure levels in humans, is not yet well characterized. Hence, the main goal of this review is to summarize data on the neurological side effects/neurobehavioral alterations in humans, in relation to vanadium exposure, with the focus on the levels of this metal in biological fluids/brain tissues of subjects with some neurodegenerative syndromes. Data collected in the present review indicate that vanadium cannot be excluded as a factor playing a pivotal role in the etiopathogenesis of neurodegenerative illnesses, and point to the need for additional extensive epidemiological studies that will provide more evidence supporting the relationship between vanadium exposure and neurodegeneration in humans. Simultaneously, the reviewed data, clearly showing the environmental impact of vanadium on health, suggest that more attention should be paid to chronic diseases related to vanadium and to the assessment of the dose-response relationship.
