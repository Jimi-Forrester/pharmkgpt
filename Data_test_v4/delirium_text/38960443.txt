38960443|a|OBJECTIVE: To address the gap in timely diagnosis of dementia due to limited screening tools, we investigated the validity and reliability of the Hellocog, computerized neuropsychological test based on tablets for screening dementia. The higher the probability score on the Hellocog, the higher the likelihood of dementia. METHODS: This study included 100 patients with dementia and 100 individuals with normal cognition who were aged 60 years or older and free of other major psychiatric, neurological, or medical conditions. They administered the Hellocog on a tablet under the supervision of a neuropsychologist. To determine test-retest reliability, 20 took the Hellocog again after 4 weeks. Diagnostic performance was assessed using the receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: The Hellocog showed adequate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.69) and good test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.86, p<0.001). Participants with dementia scored higher on the Hellocog than those with normal cognition (p<0.001), confirming its high criterion validity. Strong correlations with the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score and the total score of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (CERAD-TS) highlight the concurrent validity of the Hellocog. The area under the ROC curve for dementia of the Hellocog was excellent (0.971) and comparable to that of the MMSE and CERAD-TS. The sensitivity and specificity for dementia were 0.945 and 0.872%, respectively, which were slightly better than those of the MMSE and CERAD-TS. CONCLUSION: Hellocog stands out as a valid and reliable tool for self-administered dementia screening, with promise for improving early detection of dementia.
