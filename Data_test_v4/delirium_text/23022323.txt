23022323|a|For over a decade, it has been known that amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides of Alzheimer's disease bind to the nicotinic alpha7 acetylcholine receptor (AChR) with picomolar affinity, and that snake alpha-neurotoxins competitively inhibit this binding. Here we propose a model of the binding mechanism of Abeta peptides to alpha7-AChR at atomic level. The binding mechanism is based on sequence and structure similarities of Abeta residues with functional residues of snake alpha-neurotoxins (ATX) in complex with AChR. The binding mechanism involves residue (Abeta)K28 (similar to (ATX)R32) which forms cation/pi interactions in the acetylcholine binding site, and residues (Abeta)G29-(Abeta)I32 [GAII] (similar to (ATX)G33-(ATX)I36 [GTII]) which form an intermolecular beta-sheet with residues (alpha7)F189-(alpha7)E191 of AChR. Through these interactions, we propose that the AChR serves as a chaperone for Abeta conformational changes from alpha- to beta-hairpin. The interactions which block channel opening provide fundamental insight into Abeta neurotoxicity and cognition impairment, that could contribute to pathogenic processes in Alzheimer's disease, thus paving the way for structure based therapies.
