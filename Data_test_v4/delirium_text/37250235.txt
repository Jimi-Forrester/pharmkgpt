37250235|t|A prospective observational single center study evaluating emergence agitation in the early postoperative period in adult patients undergoing elective craniotomies under general anesthesia.
37250235|a|Background and Aims: Emergence agitation is a significant clinical issue during recovery from general anesthesia. Patients after intracranial operations are even more vulnerable to the stress resulting from emergence agitation. Due to the limited data available in neurosurgical patients, we evaluated the incidence, risk factors, and complications of emergence agitation. Material and Methods: 317 consenting eligible patients undergoing elective craniotomies were recruited. The preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)) and pain score were recorded. Bispectral Index (BIS) guided balanced general anesthesia was administered and reversed. Immediate postoperatively, the GCS and the pain score were noted. The patients were observed for 24 hours following extubation. The levels of agitation and sedation were evaluated by the Riker's Agitation-Sedation Scale. Emergence Agitation was defined as Riker's Agitation score of 5 to 7. Results: In our subset of the patient population, the incidence was 5.4%, mildly agitated in the first 24 hours and none required sedative medication as therapy. The sole risk factor identified was prolonged surgery beyond 4 hours. None of the patients in the agitated group had any complications. Conclusion: Early objective assessment of risk factors in the preoperative period with objective validated tests and shorter duration of surgery maybe the way forward in patients at high risk for emergence agitation, to reduce the incidence and mitigate the undesirable consequences.
