38915139|t|Factors Influencing Objective and Subjective Prospective Memory Measures in Traumatic Brain Injury.
38915139|a|OBJECTIVE: To accurately assess prospective memory (PM) functioning in patients who sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is important to use both subjective (questionnaires) and objective (tests) measures. However, which factors have the most significant effect on each PM measure remains unknown. This observational study aims to verify whether TBI severity or psychological status has the most influence on patients' objective and subjective PM measures. METHOD: Fifteen healthy control (HC) participants (n = 15), 19 patients with a mild TBI (n = 19) and 30 patients with a moderate-to-severe TBI (n = 30) were recruited during the post-acute phase. For almost every participant, a relative was also recruited (n = 62). The Test ecologique de memoire prospective (TEMP), an objective computerized PM measure consisting of naturalistic stimuli, was administered to all participants along with anxiety (BAI) and depression inventories (BDI). Participants and their relatives also completed a questionnaire, the comprehensive assessment of PM (CAPM), a subjective PM measure assessing everyday failures. RESULTS: Results on the objective PM measure were predicted by TBI severity, while psychological symptoms (BAI and BDI) predicted scores on the subjective PM measure. In addition, relatives in the moderate-to-severe TBI group reported more PM failures on the subjective measure and their perception was significantly correlated with results on the objective PM measure, which was not the case for the other two groups of relatives. CONCLUSIONS: Objective PM measures are related to TBI severity and appear more robust against the influence of psychological factors than subjective PM measures.
