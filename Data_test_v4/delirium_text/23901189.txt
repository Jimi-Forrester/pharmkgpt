23901189|a|INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflamatory disease, which affects the (Central Nervous System) and leads to the destruction of myelin and atrophy of the axons. Genetic factors, in addition to environmental ones, seem to play a role in MS. Numerous studies have reported mitochondrial defects including a reduction in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) complex function related to the reduction of mitochondrial genes expression in the cortex tissue of patients with MS have been reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study aimed to assess COX5B and COX2 genes expression in MS patients and compare it with normal subjects. We determine expression levels of genes COX5B and COX2, and also gene reference ss-actine using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. Data were obtained and obtained and standardized with the gene reference and were analyzed using independent sample t-test with SPSS and Excel programs. RESULT AND DISCUSSION: The resultshowed COX5B gene expression reduced significant in MS patients compared to normal subjects (P < -0.05) whereas, there was no significant difference in the COX2 gene expression between normal subjects and patients. Thus, it can be claimed that down-regulation of mitochondrial electron transport chain genes supported the hypothesis that hypoxia-like tissue injury in MS may be due to mitochondrial genes, different expression impairment.
