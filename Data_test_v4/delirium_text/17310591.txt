17310591|a|From 1995 to 2005 the number of patients with delirium tremens increased 1.57 times in the Czech Republic. Greater increase took place among women (almost twice in 2005 compared with 1995). These data are related to the increasing per capita alcohol consumption till 2003, and they show that effective prevention (e.g. higher taxation of alcohol), early intervention and appropriate treatment of alcohol dependence are important.
