29287876|a|BACKGROUND: Emergence agitation (EA) is a common complication in children during recovery from sevoflurane anesthesia with an high incidence. The main objective of this study was to compare the effects of preoperative visiting operation room (PVOR) to administration of propofol at the end of anesthesia on EA in preschool children under sevoflurane anesthesia. METHODS: Sixty-nine preschool children aged from 3 to 6 years scheduled for tonsillectomy under sevoflurane anesthesia were randomly allocated to one of the three groups to receive either PVOR (Group PV), routine preoperative visit (Group RV) or routine preoperative visit plus propofol (Group RP), 23 patients were included in each group. General anesthesia was induced and maintained with sevoflurane. Parental separation status score, mask acceptance score, Aono's four point score and pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium (PAED) score and incidence of EA were recorded. PAED score >10 were regarded as EA. Recovery profile and adverse events were also recorded. RESULT: Parental separation status score and mask acceptance score in group PV was significantly lower than that in group RV and group RP (P < 0.05); Aono's four point score, PAED score and incidence of EA in group PV and group RP was significantly lower than that in group RV (P < 0.05); Time to extubation and time to interaction in group PV and group RV was significantly shorter than that in group RP (P < 0.05); POV and rescue by fentanyl in group PV and group RP was significantly lower than that in group RV(P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: PVOR can effectively reduce the incidence of EA as well as administration of propofol without additional medical expenses and other adverse effects.
