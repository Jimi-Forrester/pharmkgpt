38521789|a|The complex biological mechanisms underlying human brain aging remain incompletely understood. This study investigated the genetic architecture of three brain age gaps (BAG) derived from gray matter volume (GM-BAG), white matter microstructure (WM-BAG), and functional connectivity (FC-BAG). We identified sixteen genomic loci that reached genome-wide significance (P-value < 5x10-8). A gene-drug-disease network highlighted genes linked to GM-BAG for treating neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders and WM-BAG genes for cancer therapy. GM-BAG displayed the most pronounced heritability enrichment in genetic variants within conserved regions. Oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, but not neurons, exhibited notable heritability enrichment in WM and FC-BAG, respectively. Mendelian randomization identified potential causal effects of several chronic diseases on brain aging, such as type 2 diabetes on GM-BAG and AD on WM-BAG. Our results provide insights into the genetics of human brain aging, with clinical implications for potential lifestyle and therapeutic interventions.
