36369597|t|Approaches to Mitigate Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Sensorineural Hearing Loss.
36369597|a|Mitochondria are highly dynamic multifaceted organelles with various functions including cellular energy metabolism, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, calcium homeostasis, and apoptosis. Because of these diverse functions, mitochondria are key regulators of cell survival and death, and their dysfunction is implicated in numerous diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Huntington's Disease. One of the most common neurodegenerative disorders is sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). SNHL primarily originates from the degenerative changes in the cochlea, which is the auditory portion of the inner ear. Many cochlear cells contain an abundance of mitochondria and are metabolically highly active, rendering them susceptible to mitochondrial dysfunction. Indeed, the causal role of mitochondrial dysfunction in SNHL progression is well established, and therefore, targeted for treatment. In this review, we aim to compile the emerging findings in the literature indicating the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the progression of sensorineural hearing loss and highlight potential therapeutics targeting mitochondrial dysfunction for hearing loss treatment.
