36522755|t|Association of shift work with incident dementia: a community-based cohort study.
36522755|a|BACKGROUND: Some observational studies had found that shift work would increase risks of metabolic disorders, cancers, and cardiovascular diseases, but there was no homogeneous evidence of such an association between shift work and incident dementia. This study aimed to investigate whether shift work would increase the risk of dementia in a general population. METHODS: One hundred seventy thousand seven hundred twenty-two employed participants without cognitive impairment or dementia at baseline recruited between 2006 and 2010 were selected from the UK Biobank cohort study. Follow-up occurred through June 2021. Shift work status at baseline was self-reported by participants and they were categorized as non-shift workers or shift workers. Among shift workers, participants were further categorized as night shift workers or shift but non-night shift workers. The primary outcome was all-cause dementia in a time-to-event analysis, and the secondary outcomes were subtypes of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and other types of dementia. RESULTS: In total, 716 dementia cases were observed among 170,722 participants over a median follow-up period of 12.4 years. Shift workers had an increased risk of all-cause dementia as compared with non-shift workers after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio [HR], 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.58); however, among shift workers, night shift work was not associated with the risk of dementia (HR, 1.04, 95% CI, 0.73-1.47). We found no significant interaction between shift work and genetic predisposition to dementia on the primary outcome (P for interaction = 0.77). CONCLUSIONS: Shift work at baseline was associated with an increased risk of all-cause dementia. Among shift workers, there was no significant association between night shift work and the risk of dementia. The increased incidence of dementia in shift workers did not differ between participants in different genetic risk strata for dementia.
