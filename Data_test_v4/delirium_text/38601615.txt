38601615|a|Background: The association between dietary vitamin B1 intake and cognitive performance in the noninstitutionalized older adult population of the United States remains unclear. Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the association between vitamin B1 intake and cognitive performance in older adults in the United States. Methods: Vitamin B1 intake was assessed through two 24-h dietary recalls. Weighted logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between vitamin B1 intake and three cognitive scores (immediate recall test [IRT], animal fluency test [AFT], and digit symbol substitution test [DSST]). Cognitive performance was measured by these three tests, and individuals scoring below the lowest quartile were categorized as cognitive impairment. Sensitivity analysis, including dose-response curves, subgroup analyses, interaction effects, per 1 SD, and quartiles, were performed to ensure the accuracy of the conclusion. Results: A total of 2896 participants over the age of 60 were included in this study. In the adjusted final model, the association between vitamin B1 intake and low cognitive performance in old age was statistically significant, with the following odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs): IRT, 0.75 (0.57, 0.97), P = 0.018; AFT, 0.68 (0.50, 0.92), P = 0.007; DSST, 0.71 (0.54, 0.92), P = 0.005. Subgroup analyses showed that this association was statistically significant among males, white, low-education, and no memory impairment. The results of the sensitivity analyses confirmed the association between VB1 and cognitive function in old age and the absence of interactions in the final calibrated model. Conclusion: Dietary vitamin B1 intake is negatively associated with cognitive performance in older adults.
