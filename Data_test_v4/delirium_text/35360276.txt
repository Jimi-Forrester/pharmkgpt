35360276|a|Background: Hearing loss and mild behavioral impairment (MBI), both non-cognitive markers of dementia, can be early warning signs of incident cognitive decline. Objective: We investigated the relationship between these markers and reported the influence of sex, using non-dementia participants (n = 219; 107 females) from the Canadian Comprehensive Assessment of Neurodegeneration and Dementia (COMPASS-ND). Methods: Hearing was assessed with the 10-item Hearing Handicap for the Elderly-Screening (HHIE-S) questionnaire, a speech-in-noise test, screening audiometry, and hearing aid use. MBI symptoms were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). Multivariable linear regressions examined the association between hearing and MBI symptom severity and multiple logistic regressions examined the association between hearing and MBI domains. Results: HHIE-S score was significantly associated with greater global MBI symptom burden, and symptoms in the apathy and affective dysregulation domains. Objective measures of audiometric hearing loss and speech-in-noise testing as well as hearing aid use were not associated with global MBI symptom severity or the presence of MBI domain-specific symptoms. Males were older, had more audiometric and speech-in-noise hearing loss, higher rates of hearing-aid use, and showed more MBI symptoms than females, especially apathy. Conclusion: The HHIE-S, a subjective self-report measure that captures emotional and social aspects of hearing disability, was associated with informant-reported global MBI symptom burden, and more specifically the domains of affective dysregulation and apathy. These domains can be potential drivers of depression and social isolation. Hearing and behavior change can be assessed with non-invasive measures, adding value to a comprehensive dementia risk assessment.
