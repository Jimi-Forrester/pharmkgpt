29494807|a|INTRODUCTION: Neuroinflammation is now considered to be of pathophysiologic significance in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions. Nonetheless, there is no consensus as to what inflammatory mechanisms need to be combated (or facilitated), how therapies for them should be applied, or when they might be efficacious. METHODS: This article seeks to put forward cornerstone facts about neuroinflammation, with suggestions for future directions. RESULTS: Multiple scientific points about neuroinflammation still remain unaddressed. The main issue, however, is political. An expert body is needed that can sort through the myriad findings and provide consensus advice to agencies that fund basic and clinical research. DISCUSSION: Consortium approaches have shown immense value in other Alzheimer's disease research areas and are badly needed in neuroinflammation research. Lacking a consensus, neuroinflammation is just a very large number of isolated articles clamoring for attention.
