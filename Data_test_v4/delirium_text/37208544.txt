37208544|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The review aims to describe short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as metabolites of bacteria, their complex influence on whole-body metabolism, and alterations in the SCFA profile in obesity and after bariatric surgery (BS). RECENT FINDINGS: The fecal profile of SCFAs in obese patients differs from that of lean patients, as well as their gut microbiota composition. In obese patients, a lower diversity of bacteria is observed, as well as higher concentrations of SCFAs in stool samples. Obesity is now considered a global epidemic and bariatric surgery (BS) is an effective treatment for severe obesity. BS affects the structure and functioning of the digestive system, and also alters gut microbiota and the concentration of fecal SCFAs. Generally, after BS, SCFA levels are lower but levels of branched short-chain fatty acids (BSCFAs) are elevated, the effect of which is not fully understood. Moreover, changes in the profile of circulating SCFAs are little known and this is an area for further research. Obesity seems to be inherently associated with changes in the SCFA profile. It is necessary to better understand the impact of BS on microbiota and the metabolome in both feces and blood as only a small percentage of SCFAs are excreted. Further research may allow the development of a personalized therapeutic approach to the BS patient in terms of diet and prebiotic intervention.
