36680196|t|Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Elderly Patients with COVID-19: Potential of Melatonin Treatment.
36680196|a|Aging processes, including immunosenescence, inflammation, inflammasome formation, genomic instability, telomeric attrition, and altered autophagy, are involved in viral infections and they may contribute to increased pathophysiological responses to the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the elderly; this poses additional risks of accelerated aging, which could be found even after recovery. Aging is associated with oxidative damage. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infections may increase the production of reactive oxygen species and such infections will disturb the Ca++ balance via an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated unfolded protein response. Although vaccine development and anti-inflammation therapy lower the severity of COVID-19, the prevalence and mortality rates are still alarming in some countries worldwide. In this review, we describe the involvement of viral proteins in activating ER stress transducers and their downstream signals and in inducing inflammation and inflammasome formation. Furthermore, we propose the potential of melatonin as an ER stress modulator, owing to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunoregulatory effects in viral infections. Considering its strong safety profile, we suggest that additive melatonin supplementation in the elderly could be beneficial in treating COVID-19.
