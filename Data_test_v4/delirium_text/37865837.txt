37865837|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Vasculitis refers to heterogeneous clinicopathologic disorders that share the histopathology of inflammation of blood vessels. Unrecognized and therefore untreated, vasculitis of the nervous system or so called neurovasculitides, lead to pervasive injury and disability making these disorder of paramount importance to clinicians. RECENT FINDINGS: Headache is an important clue to vasculitic involvement of central nervous system (CNS) vessels. CNS vasculitis may be primary, in which only intracranial vessels are involved in the inflammatory process, or secondary to another known disorder with overlapping systemic involvement. A suspicion of vasculitis based on the history, clinical examination, or laboratory studies warrants prompt evaluation and treatment to forestall progression and avert cerebral ischemia or infarction. There has been remarkable progress in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of primary adult and pediatric CNS vasculitides predicated on achievements in primary systemic forms. SUMMARY: Vasculitis can be diagnosed with certainty after intensive evaluation that includes tissue confirmation whenever possible. Clinicians must choose from among the available immune modulating, suppressive, and targeted immunotherapies to induce and maintain remission status and prevent relapse, tempered by the recognition of anticipated medication side effects.
