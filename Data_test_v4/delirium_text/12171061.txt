12171061|a|The management of dementia patients encompasses pharmacologic, behavioral, and psychosocial intervention strategies. Before pharmacologic intervention is instituted, it is important that sources of excess disability and comorbidity be eliminated or reduced. Identification of comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions, such as depression and delirium, should be identified and appropriately treated. Providing caregivers with education, support, and practical advice is a critical component of the management of the demented patient. The current standard of care for pharmacologic management of the cognitive and functional disabilities of AD consists of the combination of a cholinesterase inhibitor and high-dose vitamin E. This standard is based on the results of large-scale, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Cholinesterase inhibitors are the only FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments for AD. Cholinesterase inhibitors have been shown to be effective in the treatment of the cognitive, behavioral, and functional deficits of AD. Large-scale placebo-controlled trials of tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine have demonstrated moderate benefits in patients with mild to moderate AD. Donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine are the first-line choices in the treatment of AD because of their lack of hepatotoxicity, ease of administration, few significant drug-drug interactions, and mild to moderate side effects. There are few contraindications to the use of cholinesterase inhibitors. Known hypersensitivity to a specific drug or its derivatives is the only true contraindication. Cautious administration of cholinesterase inhibitors is advised in patients who have a previous history of allergy or adverse reactions to prior cholinesterase inhibitors, severe liver disease, preexisting bradycardia, peptic ulcer disease, current alcoholism, asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia are the most common side effects of cholinesterase inhibitors. These gastrointestinal side effects can be minimized by gradual dose increases, administration with food, adequate hydration, and judicious use of an antiemetic. Vitamin E has been demonstrated to slow the progression of AD in several small and one large placebo-controlled trials. Because of its low cost and safety, it is recommended in addition to a cholinesterase inhibitor for the treatment of AD. There are no FDA-approved treatments for DLB and VaD. One small placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that rivastigmine may be effective in the treatment of DLB. More large-scale placebo-controlled trials are needed to confirm the results of this study. Treatment of VaD focuses on the control, identification, and management of cerebrovascular disease and vascular risk factors. Although there are no peer-reviewed reports on the efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors for VaD or mixed AD/VaD, early reports suggest that these agents may also be effective for mixed AD/VaD. The indications for the use of cholinesterase inhibitor drugs are eventually likely to broaden to include DLB, mixed AD/VaD, and AD in its more advanced stages.
