29134229|a|Epidemiological studies have shown that inflammation plays a critical role in the development and progression of various chronic diseases, including cancers, neurological diseases, hepatic fibrosis, diabetic retinopathy, and vascular diseases. Decursin and decursinol angelate (DA) are pyranocoumarin compounds obtained from the roots of Angelica gigas. Several studies have described the anti-inflammatory effects of decursin and DA. Decursin and DA have shown potential anti-inflammatory activity by modulating growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor, transcription factors such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, cellular enzymes including matrix metalloproteinases cyclooxygenase, and protein kinases such as extracellular receptor kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, and protein kinase C. These compounds have the ability to induce apoptosis by activating pro-apoptotic proteins and the caspase cascade, and reduced the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as B-cell lymphoma 2 and B-cell lymphoma-extra-large. Interaction with multiple molecular targets and cytotoxic effects, these two compounds are favorable candidates for treating various chronic inflammatory diseases such as cancers (prostate, breast, leukemia, cervical, and myeloma), rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic retinopathy, hepatic fibrosis, osteoclastogenesis, allergy, and Alzheimer's disease. We have summarized the preliminary studies regarding the biological effects of decursin and DA. In this review, we will also highlight the functions of coumarin compounds that can be translated to a clinical practice for the treatment and prevention of various inflammatory ailments.
