26827638|t|Abeta 1-40 enhances the proliferation of human diploid fibroblasts.
26827638|a|There is a vast literature on the role of beta amyloid (Abeta) peptides in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. However, there is a paucity of research on the potential physiological functions of these evolutionarily conserved products of the Abeta precursor protein. Based on previous studies in neuroblastoma cells, we hypothesized that Abeta may contribute to the proliferation of somatic cells. We present evidence supporting this hypothesis for the case of cultured human skin fibroblasts immortalized with the catalytic subunit of human telomerase (hTERT). Optimal concentrations ranged from 100 pM-10 nM, depending on the nature of the assay.
