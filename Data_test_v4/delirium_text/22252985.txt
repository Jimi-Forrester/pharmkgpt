22252985|a|Deposition of insoluble fibrillar aggregates of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Apart from forming fibrils, these peptides also exist as soluble aggregates. Fibrillar and a variety of nonfibrillar aggregates of Abeta have also been obtained in vitro. Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) has been widely used to dissolve Abeta and other amyloidogenic peptides. In this study, we show that the dissolution of Abeta40, 42, and 43 in HFIP followed by drying results in highly ordered aggregates. Although alpha-helical conformation is observed, it is not stable for prolonged periods. Drying after prolonged incubation of Abeta40, 42, and 43 peptides in HFIP leads to structural transition from alpha-helical to beta-conformation. The peptides form short fibrous aggregates that further assemble giving rise to highly ordered ring-like structures. Abeta16-22, a highly amyloidogenic peptide stretch from Abeta, also formed very similar rings when dissolved in HFIP and dried. HFIP could not induce alpha-helical conformation in Abeta16-22, and rings were obtained from freshly dissolved peptide. The rings formed by Abeta40, 42, 43, and Abeta16-22 are composed of the peptides in beta-conformation and cause enhancement in thioflavin T fluorescence, suggesting that the molecular architecture of these structures is amyloid-like. Our results clearly indicate that dissolution of Abeta40, 42 and 43 and the amyloidogenic fragment Abeta16-22 in HFIP results in the formation of annular amyloid-like structures.
