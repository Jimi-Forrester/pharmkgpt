38525317|a|Purpose: We aimed to identify the risk factors for postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) by evaluating the outcomes from preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) and intraoperative anesthetic interventions. Patients and Methods: Data used in the study were obtained from the Aged Patient Perioperative Longitudinal Evaluation-Multidisciplinary Trial (APPLE-MDT) cohort recruited from the Department of Orthopedics in Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University between March, 2019 and June, 2022. All patients accepted preoperative CGA by the multidisciplinary team using 13 common scales across 15 domains reflecting the multi-organ functions. The variables included demographic data, scales in CGA, comorbidities, laboratory tests and intraoperative anesthetic data. Cognitive function was assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale within 48 hours after admission and after surgery. Dropping of >=1 point between the preoperative and postoperative scale was defined as POCD. Results: We enrolled 119 patients. The median age was 80.00 years [IQR, 77.00, 82.00] and 68 patients (57.1%) were female. Forty-two patients (35.3%) developed POCD. Three cognitive domains including calculation (P = 0.046), recall (P = 0.047) and attention (P = 0.007) were significantly worsened after surgery. Univariate analysis showed that disability of instrumental activity of daily living, incidence rate of postoperative respiratory failure (PRF) >=4.2%, STOP-Bang scale score, Caprini risk scale score and Sufentanil for maintenance of anesthesia were different between the POCD and non-POCD patients. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, PRF >= 4.2% (odds ratio [OR] = 2.343; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.028-5.551; P = 0.046) and Sufentanil for maintenance of anesthesia (OR = 0.260; 95% CI: 0.057-0.859; P = 0.044) was independently associated with POCD as risk and protective factors, respectively. Conclusion: Our study suggests that POCD is frequent among older patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery, in which decline of calculation, recall and attention was predominant. Preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessments are important to identify the high-risk individuals of POCD.
