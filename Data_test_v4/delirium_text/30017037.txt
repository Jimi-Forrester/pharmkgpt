30017037|a|INTRODUCTION: Delirium is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome with severe consequences, especially for elderly patients with pre-existing cognitive impairment. METHODOLOGY: Descriptive study of one retrospective cohort, with the aim of comparing risk factors and mortality between surgical treatment and non-surgical treatment in a group of hospitalised patients with delirium. RESULTS: Of the 184 hospitalised patients with delirium analysed, 29.3% were for surgical causes and 70.7% for non-surgical causes. Just over half (50.5%) were women, and 50% of the patients were 74 years or less (interquartile range, 27 years), with statistical differences (P=.002). Prior cognitive impairment was observed in 42.9% of patients, with a greater proportion of non-surgical (50.8% vs 24.1%) with significant differences (P=.001). Anticholinergic medications were received by 89.7% of patients, and almost all of them (99.5%) received three or more medicines, with no significant differences. Half (50%) of the patients remained in hospital for 16.3 days or less (interquartile range, 23 days). Hospitalisation was significantly longer in the surgical group (P<.001). The hospital mortality was 14.7%, with no statistical differences between groups (P=.073). DISCUSSION: Although there were no significant differences in mortality between the groups, it was higher in the non-surgical (17.7% vs. 7.4%). Increased mortality was found in the older group (non-surgical) that also had significantly greater cognitive impairment, which coincides with that in the scientific literature.
