38959029|t|mHealth Apps for Dementia, Alzheimer Disease, and Other Neurocognitive Disorders: Systematic Search and Environmental Scan.
38959029|a|BACKGROUND: Lifestyle behaviors including exercise, sleep, diet, stress, mental stimulation, and social interaction significantly impact the likelihood of developing dementia. Mobile health (mHealth) apps have been valuable tools in addressing these lifestyle behaviors for general health and well-being, and there is growing recognition of their potential use for brain health and dementia prevention. Effective apps must be evidence-based and safeguard user data, addressing gaps in the current state of dementia-related mHealth apps. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the scope of available apps for dementia prevention and risk factors, highlighting gaps and suggesting a path forward for future development. METHODS: A systematic search of mobile app stores, peer-reviewed literature, dementia and Alzheimer association websites, and browser searches was conducted from October 19, 2022, to November 2, 2022. A total of 1044 mHealth apps were retrieved. After screening, 152 apps met the inclusion criteria and were coded by paired, independent reviewers using an extraction framework. The framework was adapted from the Silberg scale, other scoping reviews of mHealth apps for similar populations, and background research on modifiable dementia risk factors. Coded elements included evidence-based and expert credibility, app features, lifestyle elements of focus, and privacy and security. RESULTS: Of the 152 apps that met the final selection criteria, 88 (57.9%) addressed modifiable lifestyle behaviors associated with reducing dementia risk. However, many of these apps (59/152, 38.8%) only addressed one lifestyle behavior, with mental stimulation being the most frequently addressed. More than half (84/152, 55.2%) scored 2 points out of 9 on the Silberg scale, with a mean score of 2.4 (SD 1.0) points. Most of the 152 apps did not disclose essential information: 120 (78.9%) did not disclose expert consultation, 125 (82.2%) did not disclose evidence-based information, 146 (96.1%) did not disclose author credentials, and 134 (88.2%) did not disclose their information sources. In addition, 105 (69.2%) apps did not disclose adherence to data privacy and security practices. CONCLUSIONS: There is an opportunity for mHealth apps to support individuals in engaging in behaviors linked to reducing dementia risk. While there is a market for these products, there is a lack of dementia-related apps focused on multiple lifestyle behaviors. Gaps in the rigor of app development regarding evidence base, credibility, and adherence to data privacy and security standards must be addressed. Following established and validated guidelines will be necessary for dementia-related apps to be effective and advance successfully.
