29328965|t|Excited delirium syndrome after withdrawal from 10 days long recreationally used GHB.
29328965|a|We describe a case of a 51-year old man who used GHB only in the afternoon and evening during 10 consecutive days in a recreational way: 20 ml a day in 4 ml per 2-3 hrs. He developed an excited delirium syndrome at the second day after stopping. Apparently even after relatively short recreational use severe disruptive behavior can develop. This is a unique case in literature. References are provided.
