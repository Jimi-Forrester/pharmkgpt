37299525|a|The shift in modern dietary regimens to "Western style" and sedentary lifestyles are believed to be partly responsible for the increase in the global burden of cardiovascular diseases. Natural products have been used throughout human history as treatments for a plethora of pathological conditions. Taurine and, more recently, black pepper have gained attention for their beneficial health effects while remaining non-toxic even when ingested in excess. Taurine, black pepper, and the major terpene constituents found in black pepper (i.e., beta-caryophyllene; alpha-pinene; beta-pinene; alpha-humulene; limonene; and sabinene) that are present in PhytoCann BP  have been shown to have cardioprotective effects based on anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, anti-hypertensive and anti-atherosclerotic mechanisms. This comprehensive review of the literature focuses on determining whether the combination of taurine and black pepper extract is an effective natural treatment for reducing cardiovascular diseases risk factors (i.e., hypertension and hyperhomocysteinemia) and for driving anti-inflammatory, antioxidative and anti-atherosclerotic mechanisms to combat coronary artery disease, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and atherosclerotic disease.
