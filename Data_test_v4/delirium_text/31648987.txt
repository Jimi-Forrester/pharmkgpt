31648987|a|BACKGROUND: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a severe neuropsychiatric syndrome caused by various types of liver failure resulting in hyperammonemia-induced dysfunction of astrocytes. It is unclear whether autophagy, an important pro-survival pathway, is altered in the brains of ammonia-intoxicated animals as well as in HE patients. METHODS: Using primary rat astrocytes, a co-culture model of primary mouse astrocytes and neurons, an in vivo rat HE model, and post mortem brain samples of liver cirrhosis patients with HE we analyzed whether and how hyperammonemia modulates autophagy. FINDINGS: We show that autophagic flux is efficiently inhibited after administration of ammonia in astrocytes. This occurs in a fast, reversible, time-, dose-, and ROS-dependent manner and is mediated by ammonia-induced changes in intralysosomal pH. Autophagic flux is also strongly inhibited in the cerebral cortex of rats after acute ammonium intoxication corroborating our results using an in vivo rat HE model. Transglutaminase 2 (TGM2), a factor promoting autophagy, is upregulated in astrocytes of in vitro- and in vivo-HE models as well as in post mortem brain samples of liver cirrhosis patients with HE, but not in patients without HE. LC3, a commonly used autophagy marker, is significantly increased in the brain of HE patients. Ammonia also modulated autophagy moderately in neuronal cells. We show that taurine, known to ameliorate several parameters caused by hyperammonemia in patients suffering from liver failure, is highly potent in reducing ammonia-induced impairment of autophagic flux. This protective effect of taurine is apparently not linked to inhibition of mTOR signaling but rather to reducing ammonia-induced ROS formation. INTERPRETATION: Our data support a model in which autophagy aims to counteract ammonia-induced toxicity, yet, as acidification of lysosomes is impaired, possible protective effects thereof, are hampered. We propose that modulating autophagy in astrocytes and/or neurons, e.g. by taurine, represents a novel strategy to treat liver diseases associated with HE.
