36504237|a|BACKGROUND: Synaptic dysfunction and degeneration are central contributors to the pathogenesis and progression of parkinsonian disorders. Therefore, identification and validation of biomarkers reflecting pathological synaptic alterations are greatly needed and could be used in prognostic assessment and to monitor treatment effects. OBJECTIVE: To explore candidate biomarkers of synaptic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) and related disorders. METHODS: Mass spectrometry was used to quantify 15 synaptic proteins in two clinical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cohorts, including PD (n1  = 51, n2  = 101), corticobasal degeneration (CBD) (n1  = 11, n2  = 3), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (n1  = 22, n2  = 21), multiple system atrophy (MSA) (n1  = 31, n2  = 26), and healthy control (HC) (n1  = 48, n2  = 30) participants, as well as Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n2  = 23) patients in the second cohort. RESULTS: Across both cohorts, lower levels of the neuronal pentraxins (NPTX; 1, 2, and receptor) were found in PD, MSA, and PSP, compared with HC. In MSA and PSP, lower neurogranin, AP2B1, and complexin-2 levels compared with HC were observed. In AD, levels of 14-3-3 zeta/delta, beta- and gamma-synuclein were higher compared with the parkinsonian disorders. Lower pentraxin levels in PD correlated with Mini-Mental State Exam scores and specific cognitive deficits (NPTX2; rho = 0.25-0.32, P < 0.05) and reduced dopaminergic pre-synaptic integrity as measured by DaTSCAN (NPTX2; rho = 0.29, P = 0.023). Additionally, lower levels were associated with the progression of postural imbalance and gait difficulty symptoms (All NPTX; beta-estimate = -0.025 to -0.038, P < 0.05) and cognitive decline (NPTX2; beta-estimate = 0.32, P = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: These novel findings show different alterations of synaptic proteins in parkinsonian disorders compared with AD and HC. The neuronal pentraxins may serve as prognostic CSF biomarkers for both cognitive and motor symptom progression in PD.   2022 The Authors.
