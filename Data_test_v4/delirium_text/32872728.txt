32872728|t|Change in management and outcome of mechanical ventilation in Korea: a prospective observational study.
32872728|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: There are few studies describing contemporary status of mechanical ventilation in Korea. We investigated changes in management and outcome of mechanical ventilation in Korea. METHODS: International, prospective observational cohort studies have been conducted every 6 years since 1998. Korean intensive care units (ICUs) participated in 2010 and 2016 cohorts. We compared 2016 and 2010 Korean data. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-six patients from 18 ICUs and 275 patients from 12 ICUs enrolled in 2016 and 2010, respectively. In 2016 compared to 2010, use of non-invasive ventilation outside ICU increased (10.2% vs. 2.5%, p = 0.001). Pressure-control ventilation was the most common mode in both groups. Initial tidal volume (7.1 mL/kg vs. 7.4 mL/kg, p = 0.372) and positive end-expiratory pressure (6 cmH2O vs. 6 cmH2O, p = 0.141) were similar, but peak pressure (22 cmH2O vs. 24 cmH2O, p = 0.011) was lower in 2016. More patients received sedatives (70.7% vs. 57.0%, p = 0.002) and analgesics (86.5% vs. 51.1%, p < 0.001) in 2016. The awakening (48.4% vs. 31.0%, p = 0.002) was more frequently attempted in 2016. The accidental extubation rate decreased to one tenth of what it was in 2010 (1.1% vs. 10.2%, p < 0.001). The ICU mortality did not change (31.4% 35.6%, p = 0.343) but ICU length of stay showed a decreasing trend (9 days vs. 10 days, p = 0.054) in 2016. CONCLUSION: There were temporal changes in care of patients on mechanical ventilation including better control of pain and agitation, and active attempt of awakening.
