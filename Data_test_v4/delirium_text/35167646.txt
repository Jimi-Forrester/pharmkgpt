35167646|a|INTRODUCTION: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prevalent and underdiagnosed condition in chronic kidney disease (CKD), that shares common pathophysiological factors such as chronic inflammation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of MCI in CKD stages 1-5 using inflammatory markers and changes by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study in adult patients with pre-dialysis CKD. MCI was assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from medical records. The cytokines IL-4, IL-6, IL-17, TNF-alpha and hs-CRP were determined. Brain MRI was performed in a 1.5 Tesla device, without paramagnetic contrast. A descriptive analysis followed by a comparison of abnormal versus normal MoCA scores among all studied variables. A linear regression analysis was performed using MoCA as a dependent variable, adjusted for confounding factors. RESULTS: Of 111 invited patients, eighty completed the neuropsychological assessment and 56 underwent MRI, and were included in the study. Mean age was 56.3 +- 8.3 years and 51.8% (n = 29) had altered MoCA. When compared to the group with normal MoCA, the group with altered MoCA had higher levels of IL-6 and IL-17. There was no correlation between altered MoCA with eGFR or with MRI abnormalities. CONCLUSAO: MCI assessed by MoCA was prevalent in patients with pre-dialysis CKD, it was associated with inflammation and showed no correlation with MRI changes.
