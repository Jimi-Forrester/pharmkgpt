34770919|t|Enhanced Electrocatalytic Detection of Choline Based on CNTs and Metal Oxide Nanomaterials.
34770919|a|Choline is an officially established essential nutrient and precursor of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. It is employed as a cholinergic activity marker in the early diagnosis of brain disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Low levels of choline in diets and biological fluids, such as blood plasma, urine, cerebrospinal and amniotic fluid, could be an indication of neurological disorder, fatty liver disease, neural tube defects and hemorrhagic kidney necrosis. Meanwhile, it is known that choline metabolism involves oxidation, which frees its methyl groups for entrance into single-C metabolism occurring in three phases: choline oxidase, betaine synthesis and transfer of methyl groups to homocysteine. Electrocatalytic detection of choline is of physiological and pathological significance because choline is involved in the physiological processes in the mammalian central and peripheral nervous systems and thus requires a more reliable assay for its determination in biological, food and pharmaceutical samples. Despite the use of several methods for choline determination, the superior sensitivity, high selectivity and fast analysis response time of bioanalytical-based sensors invariably have a comparative advantage over conventional analytical techniques. This review focuses on the electrocatalytic activity of nanomaterials, specifically carbon nanotubes (CNTs), CNT nanocomposites and metal/metal oxide-modified electrodes, towards choline detection using electrochemical sensors (enzyme and non-enzyme based), and various electrochemical techniques. From the survey, the electrochemical performance of the choline sensors investigated, in terms of sensitivity, selectivity and stability, is ascribed to the presence of these nanomaterials.
