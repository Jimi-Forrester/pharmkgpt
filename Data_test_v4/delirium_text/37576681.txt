37576681|a|Exogenous factors can induce protein expression and modify the proteome which sustains for a certain period of time. The proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are high in valine plus glycine, which possess potent affinity to divalent cations such as calcium. Calcium buildup changes the protein expression profile by enabling the efficient synthesis of proteins rich in amino acids with calcium affinity. Subsequent formation of insoluble and stiff calcium oxalate and aggregates confers cellular stress and causes cell senescence. This scenario accounts for sequelae seen in some patients following recovery from COVID-19.
