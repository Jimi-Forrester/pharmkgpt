34237255|a|OBJECTIVES: Understanding disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) based on dementia subtypes and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is essential for optimal resource allocation. This study aimed to investigate disease burdens of various dementias and MCI in a representative South Korean population. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 6481 Korean older adults. METHODS: We estimated the disease-specific DALYs. RESULTS: DALYs due to MCI and all-cause dementia are estimated to increase from 1295 per 100,000 in 2016 to 9501 per 100,000 in 2065. In 2016, DALYs attributed to Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementia, and MCI accounted for 33% (423 per 100,000), 20% (316 per 100,000), and 24% (123 per 100,000), respectively, of the total DALYs due to MCI and all-cause dementia. In 2065, DALYs due to Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementia, and MCI will account for 38% (3654 per 100,000), 17% (1654 per 100,000), and 27% (2585 per 100,000) of total DALYs due to MCI and all-cause dementia, respectively. The years of life lived with disability (YLDs) due to MCI and all-cause dementia are estimated to rise from 479 per 100,000 in 2016 to 2807 per 100,000 in 2065. In 2016, YLDs due to Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementia, and MCI composed 37% (177 per 100,000), 18% (85 per 100,000), and 15% (70 per 100,000), respectively, of the total YLDs due to MCI and all-cause dementia. In 2065, YLDs due to Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementia, and MCI will account for 48% (1358 per 100,000), 15% (410 per 100,000), and 10% (290 per 100,000), respectively, of total YLDs due to MCI and all-cause dementia. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Considering the rapidly growing disease burden, resources should be allocated to continuously monitor and manage the MCI and dementia burden. Particular attention to Alzheimer's dementia is required considering its significant contribution to current and future disease burden, especially to YLD.
