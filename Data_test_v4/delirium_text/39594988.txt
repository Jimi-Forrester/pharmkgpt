39594988|t|Hippocampal Leptin Resistance and Cognitive Decline: Mechanisms, Therapeutic Strategies and Clinical Implications.
39594988|a|Background: Leptin, an adipokine essential for regulating energy balance, exerts important effects on brain function, notably within the hippocampus, a region integral to learning and memory. Leptin resistance, characterized by diminished responsiveness to elevated leptin levels, disrupts hippocampal function and exacerbates both obesity and cognitive impairments. Scope: This review critically examines how leptin resistance impairs hippocampal synaptic plasticity processes, specifically affecting long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which are crucial for cognitive performance. Findings: Recent research highlights that leptin resistance disrupts N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor dynamics and hippocampal structure, leading to deficits in spatial learning and memory. Additionally, high-fat diets (HFDs), which contribute to leptin resistance, further deteriorate hippocampal function. Potential therapeutic strategies, including leptin sensitizers, show promise in mitigating brain disorders associated with leptin resistance. Complementary interventions such as caloric restriction and physical exercise also enhance leptin sensitivity and offer potential benefits to alleviating cognitive impairments. Aims of the review: This review synthesizes recent findings on the molecular pathways underlying leptin resistance and its impact on synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus. By identifying potential therapeutic targets, this work aims to provide an integrated approach for addressing cognitive deficits in obesity, ultimately improving the quality of life for affected individuals.
