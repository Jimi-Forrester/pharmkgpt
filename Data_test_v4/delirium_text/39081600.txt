39081600|a|Objective: To systematically evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by meta-analysis, in order to provide evidence-based evidence for the application of acupuncture therapy in the clinical process of AD. Methods: From the establishment of the database to December 31, 2022, China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Network (CNKI), VIP database, WanFang Database, Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane Library Database were systematically searched. To collect published randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTS) of acupuncture in the treatment of cognitive impairment in AD. The subjects in the intervention group were given acupuncture alone or combined with other treatments the same as the control group; the control group received conventional Western medicine treatment. The main outcome indicators of the study were cognitive function assessment of subjects, including: Simple Mental State Examination Scale (MMSE), Assessment of daily Living Ability Scale (ADL), Alzheimer's Disease Cognitive Function Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog), TCM syndrome score (SDSD), Montreal Cognitive Test (MoCA), Secondary outcome indicators were the occurrence of adverse reactions. Literature screening, data extraction, and quality evaluation of the included literature were performed independently by two researchers, according to bias risk assessment tools recommended in the Cochrane manual. Data were analyzed by RevMan5.3 software. Dichotomous variables were represented by risk ratio (OR) and 95% CI, and continuity variables were represented by mean difference (MD) and 95% CI. For heterogeneity analysis, when P > 0.1 and I 2 <= 50%, fixed effect model was applied. When P <= 0.1 and I 2 > 50%, the random effects model is applied. Results: A total of 1,172 eligible subjects were included in 18 RCTS, including 595 in the intervention group and 577 in the control group. The results of meta-analysis are as follows: acupuncture intervention group improved MMSE [MD = 1.67, 95% CI (0.94, 2.41), P < 0.00001], ADL [MD = -1.18, 95% CI (-3.09, 0.72), P = 0.22], ADAS-Cog [MD = 3.31, 95% CI (5.84, 0.78), P = 0.01], SDSD [MD = 2.40, 95% CI (3.53, 1.26), P < 0.0001], MoCA [MD = 4.80, 95% CI (3.74, 5.86), P = 0.04] were better than the control group. No serious adverse reactions related to acupuncture were observed in the intervention group, and the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were lower than those in the control group, with statistical significance [OR = 0.17, 95% CI (0.04, 0.67), P = 0.01]. Conclusion: Existing data show that acupuncture therapy has certain advantages in improving cognitive dysfunction and improving self-care ability of patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, due to the small number of RCTS and cases evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture, and the possibility of measurement bias and selectivity bias in included studies, it is still unable to conduct high-intensity demonstration on its effectiveness. Further large-scale, high-quality randomized, double-blind controlled trials are needed to evaluate its efficacy.
