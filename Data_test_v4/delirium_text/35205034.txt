35205034|t|Retinoic Acid-Differentiated Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y Is an Accessible In Vitro Model to Study Native Human Acid-Sensing Ion Channels 1a (ASIC1a).
35205034|a|Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y is a prominent neurobiological tool used for studying neuropathophysiological processes. We investigated acid-sensing (ASIC) and transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) and ankyrin-1 (TRPA1) ion channels present in untreated and differentiated neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y to propose a new means for their study in neuronal-like cells. Using a quantitative real-time PCR and a whole-cell patch-clamp technique, ion channel expression profiles, functionality, and the pharmacological actions of their ligands were characterized. A low-level expression of ASIC1a and ASIC2 was detected in untreated cells. The treatment with 10 muM of retinoic acid (RA) for 6 days resulted in neuronal differentiation that was accompanied by a remarkable increase in ASIC1a expression, while ASIC2 expression remained almost unaltered. In response to acid stimuli, differentiated cells showed prominent ASIC-like currents. Detailed kinetic and pharmacological characterization suggests that homomeric ASIC1a is a dominant isoform among the present ASIC channels. RA-treatment also reduced the expression of TRPV1 and TRPA1, and minor electrophysiological responses to their agonists were found in untreated cells. Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y treated with RA can serve as a model system to study the effects of different ligands on native human ASIC1a in neuronal-like cells. This approach can improve the characterization of modulators for the development of new neuroprotective and analgesic drugs.
