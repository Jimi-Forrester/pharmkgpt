35485153|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and related risk factors of healthy side fracture after hip fracture surgery in the elderly, so as to provide basis for the prevention of re-fracture. METHODS: The data of 452 patients over 65 years old with femoral neck fracture or intertrochanteric fracture treated with hip arthroplasty or proximal femoral intramedullary nailing from June 2012 to June 2017 were analyzed, including 168 males and 284 females, the age ranged from 65 to 97(75.5+-7.5) years. There were 191 cases of femoral neck fracture and 261 cases of femoral intertrochanteric fracture. According to whether there was a fracture in the healthy hip after operation, the patients were divided into fracture group and no fracture group. The gender, age, body mass index, fracture type, initial treatment method, bone mineral density, bed time, medical compliance, postoperative short-term delirium, whether there were medical diseases before injury and Harris score of hip joint in the final follow-up were recorded. Univariate Logistic regression analysis was used to screen out the risk factors of healthy side fracture after operation, and then statistically significant risk factors were included in multi factor Logistic regression analysis to screen out the independent risk factors of healthy side fracture after operation of hip fracture in the elderly. RESULTS: Among them, 42 of the 452 patients had hip fractures on the healthy side with an incidence of 9.3%. The average interval between the two fractures was (2.9+-2.1) years. Univariate Logistic regression analysis showed that there were significant differences in age, bone mineral density, medical compliance, short-term postoperative deliriun, pre-injury complicated with medical diseases and Harris score of hip joint in the final follow-up (P<0.05). Multivariate Logistic analysis showed that age(OR=4.227), bone mineral density(OR=4.313), combined with medical diseases (OR=5.616) and low hip Harris score at the final follow-up (OR=3.891) were independent risk factors for healthy side fractures after hip fracture surgery in elderly(P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The age, bone mineral density, combined with medical diseases and low Harris score of hip joint in the final follow-up are the main risk factors of healthy side fracture after hip fracture in the elderly. It is necessary to strengthen the treatment of medical diseases, anti osteoporosis and improve hip joint function within 3 years after operation, so as to prevent the occurrence of healthy side hip fracture.
