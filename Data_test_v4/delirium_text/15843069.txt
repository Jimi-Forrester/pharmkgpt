15843069|t|Investigation of the effect of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) polymorphisms on the risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and quantitative measures of AD progression.
15843069|a|BDNF is a functional candidate gene for AD, owing to its role in neuronal development and survival. The Val66Met (G196A), along with another C270T polymorphism has been associated with AD, however, the effects seem to be inconsistent across studies. We examined the association of the G196A and C270T polymorphisms with sporadic late-onset AD (LOAD) in a large American White cohort of 995 AD cases and 671 controls and an American Black cohort of 64 AD cases and 45 controls. We also examined the association of these polymorphisms with quantitative measures of AD progression, including age at onset (AAO), disease duration and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. No significant difference in allele, genotype or estimated haplotype frequencies was observed between AD cases and controls within the American White and Black cohorts for the G196A and C270T polymorphisms. However, the frequency of the 196*A allele was significantly lower in American Black subjects compared to Whites. While MMSE scores were significantly lower in C270T/CT carriers compared to C270T/CC subjects only among American Blacks, no such effect was observed among American Whites. The BDNF polymorphisms did not affect AAO or disease duration measures in American Whites or Blacks. Our finding does not support any association between the BDNF/G196A or C270T polymorphism and the risk of sporadic LOAD among American Whites or Blacks. The significant effect of the C270T polymorphism observed on MMSE scores among American Blacks needs to be further explored in a larger cohort.
