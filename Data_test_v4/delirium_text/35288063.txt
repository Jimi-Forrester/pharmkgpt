35288063|t|Hospitalisation costs and health related quality of life in delirious patients: a scoping review.
35288063|a|INTRODUCTION: Delirium is a common condition of a global disturbance of cognition, triggered by underlying diseases. The objective of this study is to review the current evidence in the literature on direct healthcare costs and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) associated with delirium. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed and Embase for relevant studies published between January 1, 2010 and November 4, 2021. Studies for inclusion reported estimates on healthcare costs or HRQOL, adjusted for relevant confounding factors. RESULTS: Fourteen studies on healthcare costs and eleven studies on HRQOL were included. Delirium resulted in (adjusted) increased costs ranging from $1,532 to $22,269 depending on included cost categories, the country and the type of hospital department. Increased length of stay for delirious patients ranged from 2.5 days to 10.4 days and had the largest contribution to overall, direct incremental costs. Heterogeneity was observed in HRQOL outcomes. CONCLUSION: The analysis indicates that the presence of a delirium episode may lead to increased costs of hospitalisation. Changes in HRQOL due to delirium are not well demonstrated and more research is needed to determine the effect of delirium on HRQOL.
