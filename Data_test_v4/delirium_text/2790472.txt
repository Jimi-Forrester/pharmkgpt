2790472|t|Special properties of cholinesterases in the cerebral cortex of Alzheimer's disease.
2790472|a|Selective cholinesterase inhibitors such as BW284C51 and iso-OMPA showed that the plaques and tangles of Alzheimer's disease contain acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activity. In comparison to the cholinesterases of the normal brain, the plaque and tangle-bound cholinesterases in Alzheimer's disease display major shifts in optimum pH and inhibitor sensitivity.
