36621732|t|Tau-aggregation inhibitors derived from Streptomyces tendae MCCC 1A01534 protect HT22 cells against okadaic acid-induced damage.
36621732|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by tau aggregating into neurofibrillary tangles. Targeting tau aggregation is one of the most critical strategies for AD treatment and prevention. Herein, a high-throughput screening of tau-aggregation inhibitors was performed by thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assay and tauR3 peptides. According to bioactivity-guided isolation, homoprejadomycin (1) was obtained from the marine bacterium Streptomyces tendae MCCC 1A01534. Two new stable derivatives, 2 and 3, were yielded in a one-step reaction. By ThT assay, transmission electron microscopy, and circular dichroism, we demonstrated that the angucyclinones 2 and 3 inhibited tau aggregation and disaggregated tau fibrils. In the presence of 2, native tauR3 peptides maintained the disorder conformation, whereas the tauR3 aggregates reduced beta-sheet structures. And compound 2 was confirmed to inhibit the aggregation of full-length 2N4R tau protein. Furthermore, 2 with low cytotoxicity protected HT22 cells from okadaic acid-induced damage by suppressing tau aggregates. These results indicated that 2 was a promising lead structure with tau therapeutic potency for AD treatment.
