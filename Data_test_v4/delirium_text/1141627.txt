1141627|t|Behavioral disorders in the elderly.
1141627|a|Based on the study of 40 patients in a unit of a large geriatric center, as well as on long overall experience, the problems of aged men and women with various emotional disorders are discussed. Case abstracts are presented to illustrate chronic organic brain syndrome, delirium, hallucinatory behavior, paranoid ideation, depression, and reactions triggered by physical illness. The geriatrician should be fully aware of all the interlocking factors in the patient's adjustment to his condition. Only in this way can the geriatrician and staff choose the best relevant therapy.
