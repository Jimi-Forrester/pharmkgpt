33469285|t|Biomedical Potential of Plant-Based Selenium Nanoparticles: A Comprehensive Review on Therapeutic and Mechanistic Aspects.
33469285|a|Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) have advantages over other nanomaterials because of the promising role of selenium in the stabilization of the immune system and activation of the defense response. The use of SeNPs and their supplements not only have pharmacological significance but also boost and prepare the body's immune system to fight the pathogens. This review summarizes the recent progress in the biogenesis of plant-based SeNPs by using various plant species and the role of secondary metabolites on their biocompatible functioning. Phyto-synthesis of SeNPs results in the synthesis of nanomaterials of various, size, shape and biochemical nature and has advantages over other routine physical and chemical methods because of their biocompatibility, eco-friendly nature and in vivo actions. Unfortunately, the plant-based SeNPs failed to attain considerable attention in the pharmaceutical industry. However, a few studies were performed to explore the therapeutic potential of the SeNPs against various cancer cells, microbial pathogens, viral infections, hepatoprotective actions, diabetic management, and antioxidant approaches. Further, some of the selenium-based drug delivery systems are developed by engineering the SeNPs with the functional ligands to deliver drugs to the targeted sites. This review also provides up-to-date information on the mechanistic actions that the SeNPs adopt to achieve their designated tasks as it may help to develop precision medicine with customized treatment and healthcare for the ailing population.
