33782102|t|HIV-1 Tat and Morphine Differentially Disrupt Pyramidal Cell Structure and Function and Spatial Learning in Hippocampal Area CA1: Continuous versus Interrupted Morphine Exposure.
33782102|a|About half the people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have neurocognitive deficits that often include memory impairment and hippocampal deficits, which can be exacerbated by opioid abuse. To explore the effects of opioids and HIV on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron structure and function, we induced HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat) expression in transgenic mice for 14 d and co-administered time-release morphine or vehicle subcutaneous implants during the final 5 d (days 9-14) to establish steady-state morphine levels. Morphine was withheld from some ex vivo slices during recordings to begin to assess the initial pharmacokinetic consequences of opioid withdrawal. Tat expression reduced hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuronal excitability at lower stimulating currents. Pyramidal cell firing rates were unaffected by continuous morphine exposure. Behaviorally, exposure to Tat or high dosages of morphine impaired spatial memory Exposure to Tat and steady-state levels of morphine appeared to have largely independent effects on pyramidal neuron structure and function, a response that is distinct from other vulnerable brain regions such as the striatum. By contrast, acutely withholding morphine (from morphine-tolerant ex vivo slices) revealed unique and selective neuroadaptive shifts in CA1 pyramidal neuronal excitability and dendritic plasticity, including some interactions with Tat. Collectively, the results show that opioid-HIV interactions in hippocampal area CA1 are more nuanced than previously assumed, and appear to vary depending on the outcome assessed and on the pharmacokinetics of morphine exposure.
