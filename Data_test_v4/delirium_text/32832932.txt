32832932|t|Anesthetic management of a patient with Stiff-Person Syndrome and endometrial cancer for robotic surgery: A case report.
32832932|a|Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare disorder of the nervous system, characterized by muscle stiffness, rigidity, and painful spasms involving truncal and limb musculature that may severely limit mobility. Our case documents a 53-year-old patient with SPS and endometrial cancer who was positive for anti-GAD and paraneoplastic antibodies, who presented to our institution for robotic surgery. These patients are at high risk for prolonged hypotonia and mechanical ventilation. Our patient underwent general anesthesia without complications despite multiple comorbidities.
