38754070|t|Unveiling new thiazole-clubbed piperazine derivatives as multitarget anti-AD: Design, synthesis, and in silico studies.
38754070|a|New thiazole-clubbed piperazine derivatives were designed, synthesized, evaluated for their inhibitory capabilities against human acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase (hAChE and/or hBuChE) and beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation, and investigated for their metal chelating potential as multitarget agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Compounds 10, 19-21, and 24 showed the highest hAChE inhibitory activity at submicromolar concentrations, of which compound 10 was the most potent with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 0.151 muM. Compounds 10 and 20 showed the best hBuChE inhibitory activities (IC50 values of 0.135 and 0.103 muM, respectively), in addition to remarkable Abeta1-42 aggregation inhibitory activities and metal chelating capabilities. Both compounds were further evaluated against human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and PC12 neuronal cells, where they proved noncytotoxic at their active concentrations against hAChE or hBuChE. They also offered a significant neuroprotective effect against Abeta25-35-induced cytotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Compound 10 displayed acceptable physicochemical properties and could pass the blood-brain barrier. The molecular docking study revealed the good binding interactions of compound 10 with the key amino acids of both the catalytic active site and the peripheral anionic site of hAChE, explaining its significant potency.
