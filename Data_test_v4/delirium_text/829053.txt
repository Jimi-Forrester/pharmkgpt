829053|t|[Continuous EEG monitoring and clinical chemical findings in poisoning from Death cap (Amanita phalloides) (author's transl)].
829053|a|The changes in the EEG were put in relation to the clinical course and liver function tests in 3 cases of acute poisoning by Amanita phalloides. Within discrete disturbances of liver function, distinct paroxysmal changes and increased interspersion of epsilon waves in the EEG are already found on the second day after taking the fungi. The liver dystrophy developing in the later course, recognisable by Quick values below 2%, at first only produces a small increase in the EEG changes. On the 5th or 6th day, severe general changes in the EEG appear along with symptoms of confusion to delirium. At this time, no further deterioration of the laboratory findings were demonstrable, but on the contrary we already even found a distinct improvement in the liver function. With further continuous increase in the clotting factors, the EEG becomes increasing slower in the next 4 days and after surviving this stage, improves very quickly thereafter. Our findings show that in poisoning with Amanita phalloides, EEG changes may become manifest even before the appearance of psycho-pathological changes and do not correlate directly with the tangible technical liver function tests of the laboratory.
