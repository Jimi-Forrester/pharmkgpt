39445711|a|BACKGROUND: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a prevalent chronic neurological disorder, affects millions of individuals and is often resistant to anti-epileptic drugs. Increasing evidence has shown that acetylcholine (ACh) and cholinergic neurotransmission play a role in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Tropisetron, an antiemetic drug used for chemotherapy in clinic, has displayed potential in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, depression, and schizophrenia in animal models. However, as a partial agonist of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha7nAChRs), whether tropisetron possesses the therapeutic potential for TLE has not yet been determined. METHODS: In this study, tropisetron was intraperitoneally injected into pilocarpine-induced epileptic rats for 3 weeks. Alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-bgt), a specific alpha7nAChR antagonist, was applied to investigate the mechanism of tropisetron. Rats were assessed for spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) and cognitive function using video surveillance and Morris's water maze testing. Hippocampal impairment and synaptic structure were evaluated by Nissl staining, immunohistochemistry, and Golgi staining. Additionally, the levels of glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), ACh, alpha7nAChRs, neuroinflammatory cytokines, glucocorticoids and their receptors, as well as synapse-associated protein (F-actin, cofilin-1) were quantified. RESULTS: The results showed that tropisetron significantly reduced SRS, improved cognitive function, alleviated hippocampal sclerosis, and concurrently suppressed synaptic remodeling and the m6A modification of cofilin-1 in TLE rats. Furthermore, tropisetron lowered glutamate levels without affecting GABA levels, reduced neuroinflammation, and increased ACh levels and alpha7nAChR expression in the hippocampi of TLE rats. The effects of tropisetron treatment were counteracted by alpha-bgt. CONCLUSION: In summary, these findings indicate that tropisetron exhibits an anti-epileptic effect and provides neuroprotection in TLE rats through the activation of alpha7nAChRs. The potential mechanism may involve the reduction of glutamate levels, enhancement of cholinergic transmission, and suppression of synaptic remodeling. Consequently, the present study not only highlights the potential of tropisetron as an anti-epileptic drug but also identifies alpha7nAChRs as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of TLE.
