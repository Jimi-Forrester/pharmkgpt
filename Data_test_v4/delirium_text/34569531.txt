34569531|a|INTRODUCTION: Frailty is a central geriatric syndrome characterized by a state of increased physiological vulnerability. As the key components of frailty are difficult to capture in their entirety, easily measurable and reliable surrogate parameters are desirable. Since frailty influences heart rate variability (HRV), HRV may be such a surrogate parameter. HRV is typically acquired by an ECG, which, however, may not be tolerated by all patients; in some, it may even trigger delirium. Therefore, we sought to measure HRV in a non-contact and unobtrusive way through photoplethysmography imaging (PPGI). Using our previously presented HRV estimation algorithm for PPGI, we investigated whether PPGI could reveal (1) HRV differences between frail and non-frail individuals and (2) the influences of early geriatric rehabilitation on HRV. METHODS: The study involved 10 frail geriatric inpatients undergoing early geriatric rehabilitation and 10 healthy community-dwelling older adults. All participants underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment. HRV measurements using a PPGI system and a reference ECG were made at the beginning and the end of the rehabilitation. HRV in terms of LF/HF ratio was analysed for both intra-individual changes during the geriatric rehabilitation and differences between frail geriatric patients and healthy community-dwelling individuals. RESULTS: Across all geriatric patients, the median LF/HF ratio obtained with PPGI was found to be reduced by 0.178 (24.8%) during early geriatric rehabilitation. The assessment at the end of the rehabilitation revealed a simultaneous improvement of the functional state. Moreover, frail geriatric patients had a higher LF/HF ratio than their community-dwelling counterparts. Both observations in PPGI-based HRV were confirmed by the reference. The capability of PPGI to track intra-individual HRV changes was also analysed; a Spearman correlation of rho = 1.0 between PPGI-based HRV and reference was achieved for 58.8% of the participants. CONCLUSION: Early geriatric rehabilitation improves the functional state, which is associated with an increased HRV. PPGI is capable of detecting HRV changes/trends in that age group. While the tracking of intra-individual HRV changes is also possible, its reliability needs improvement. Nevertheless, the capabilities demonstrated in our study and the non-contact measurement principle of PPGI emphasize its potential for application in geriatric medicine.
