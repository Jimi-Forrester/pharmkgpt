35275528|t|Sex and Gender Differences in Environmental Influences on Dementia Incidence in Germany, 2014-2019: An Observational Cohort Study Based on Health Claims Data.
35275528|a|BACKGROUND: There is an ongoing debate about whether environmental characteristics influence dementia risk like individual traits do, and whether these differ by sex and gender. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the influence of regional characteristics on the incidence of dementia and explores sex and gender differences using individual-level health information and regional characteristics. METHODS: Using a random sample of 250,000 people aged 70 + insured through Germany's largest German public health agency, we analyzed quarterly data about diagnoses and place of residence from 2014 to 2019. Using five-digit postal codes, we added data on various dimensions of regional characteristics offered by the INKAR database and the 2011 Census database. We used multilevel survival regressions to tease out regional incidence differences while accounting for spatial clustering. RESULTS: After adjusting for multi-morbidity and relocation-related selection bias, we saw that people living in regions with the highest tertile of income (HR = 0.87, p < 0.001), and who had the highest tertile of remaining life expectancy at age 60 (HR = 0.93, p = 0.012) had lower dementia risks. There was no gender difference in the regional income effect, but the effect of education (HR = 0.91, p = 0.015) was significant only for men and remaining life-expectancy was significant only for women (HR = 0.93, p = 0.026). CONCLUSION: Environmental characteristics related to wealth and health resources of a region influence the risk of dementia among the elderly in Germany. This effect is independent of the health profiles of the individuals and differs between the two genders. Health policies need to acknowledge these modifiable risk factors and consider how they affect men and women differently.
