33761566|t|Blunt Traumatic Aortic Injury: 10-Year Single-Center Experience.
33761566|a|OBJECTIVE:  In blunt trauma patients, injury of the thoracic aorta is the second most common cause of death after head injury. In recent years, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has largely replaced open repair as the primary treatment modality, and delayed repair of stable aortic injuries has been shown to improve mortality. In light of these major advancements, we present a 10-year institutional experience from a tertiary cardiovascular surgery center. METHODS:  Records of patients who underwent endovascular or open repair of the ascending, arch or descending thoracic aorta between January 2009 and December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients without blunt traumatic etiology were excluded. Perioperative data were retrospectively collected from patient charts. Long-term follow-up was performed via data from follow-up visits and phone calls. RESULTS:  A total of 1,667 patients underwent 1,740 thoracic aortic procedures (172 TEVAR and 1,568 open repair). There were 13 patients (12 males) with a diagnosis of blunt thoracic aortic injury. Mean patient age was 43.6 years (range, 16-80 years). Ten (77%) patients underwent TEVAR, two (15.4%) underwent open repair, and one (7.7%) was treated nonoperatively. Procedure-related stroke was observed in one (7.7%) case. Procedure-related paraplegia did not occur in any patients. Left subclavian artery origin was covered in seven patients. None developed arm ischemia. Hospital survivors were followed-up for an average of 60.2 months (range, 4-115 months) without any late mortality, endoleak, stent migration, arm ischemia, or reintervention. CONCLUSION:  Blunt thoracic aortic injury is a rare but highly fatal condition. TEVAR offers good early and midterm results. Left subclavian artery coverage can be performed without major complications.
