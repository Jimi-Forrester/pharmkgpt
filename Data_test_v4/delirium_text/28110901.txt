28110901|a|BACKGROUND: Gallstone ileus is a non-strangulated mechanical obstruction of the small bowel or colon as a result of the passage of gallstones through a biliary enteric fistula. It is a rare complication of cholelithiasis, affects patients over 65 years, and the disease occurs predominantly in females. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult due to the lack of specific signs and symptoms in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities. CLINICAL CASE: A 93-year-old female presenting with a one-week history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, electrolyte imbalance and community- acquired pneumonia pneumonia. During her prolonged hospital stay she presented an intestinal obstruction. The diagnosis of gallstone ileus was made by CT scan. Despite surgical treatment, she died due to late diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Gallstone ileus is a rare pathology, difficulty in diagnosis prolongs hospital stay, which directly influences mortality.
