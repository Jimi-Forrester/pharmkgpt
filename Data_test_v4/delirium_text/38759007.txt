38759007|t|Socio-Cognitive Determinants of Lifestyle Behavior in the Context of Dementia Risk Reduction: A Population-Based Study in the Netherlands.
38759007|a|Background: Unhealthy behavior increases the risk of dementia. Various socio-cognitive determinants influence whether individuals persist in or alter these unhealthy behaviors. Objective: This study identifies relevant determinants of behavior associated to dementia risk. Methods: 4,104 Dutch individuals (40-79 years) completed a screening questionnaire exploring lifestyle behaviors associated with dementia risk. Subsequently, 3,065 respondents who engaged in one or more unhealthy behaviors completed a follow-up questionnaire investigating socio-cognitive determinants of these behaviors. Cross-tables were used to assess the accuracy of participants' perceptions regarding their behavior compared to recommendations. Confidence Interval-Based Estimation of Relevance (CIBER) was used to identify the most relevant determinants of behavior based on visual inspection and interpretation. Results: Among the respondents, 91.3% reported at least one, while 65% reported two or more unhealthy lifestyle behaviors associated to dementia risk. Many of them were not aware they did not adhere to lifestyle recommendations. The most relevant determinants identified include attitudes (i.e., lacking a passion for cooking and finding pleasure in drinking alcohol or smoking), misperceptions on social comparisons (i.e., overestimating healthy diet intake and underestimating alcohol intake), and low perceived behavioral control (i.e., regarding changing physical inactivity, altering diet patterns, and smoking cessation). Conclusions: Individual-level interventions that encourage lifestyle change should focus on enhancing accurate perceptions of behaviors compared to recommendations, while strengthening perceived control towards behavior change. Given the high prevalence of dementia risk factors, combining interventions at both individual and environmental levels are likely to be the most effective strategy to reduce dementia on a population scale.
