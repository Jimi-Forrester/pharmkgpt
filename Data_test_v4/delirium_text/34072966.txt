34072966|t|Transferring Plasmon Effect on a Biological System: Expression of Biological Polymers in Chronic Rejection and Inflammatory Rat Model.
34072966|a|The plasmon-activated water (PAW) that reduces hydrogen bonds is made of deionized reverse osmosis water (ROW). However, compared with ROW, PAW has a significantly higher diffusion coefficient and electron transfer rate constant in electrochemical reactions. PAW has a boiling point of97  C and specific heat of0.94; the energy of PAW is also 1121 J/mol higher than ordinary water. The greater the force of hydrogen bonds between H2O, the larger the volume of the H2O cluster, and the easier it is to lose the original characteristics. The hydrogen bonding force of PAW is weak, so the volume of its cluster is small, and it exists in a state very close to a single H2O. PAW has a high permeability and diffusion rate, which can improve the needs of biological applications and meet the dependence of biological organisms on H2O when performing physiological functions. PAW can successfully remove free radicals, and efficiently reduce lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced monocytes to release nitric oxide. PAW can induce expression of the antioxidant gene Nrf2 in human gingival fibroblasts, lower amyloid burden in mice with Alzheimer's disease, and decrease metastasis in mice grafted with Lewis lung carcinoma cells. Because the transferring plasmon effect may improve the abnormality of physiological activity in a biological system, we aimed to evaluate the influence of PAW on orthotopic allograft transplantation (OAT)-induced vasculopathy in this study. Here, we demonstrated that daily intake of PAW lowered the progression of vasculopathy in OAT-recipient ACI/NKyo rats by inhibiting collagen accumulation, proliferation of smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, and T lymphocyte infiltration in the vessel wall. The results showed reduced T and B lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophage activation in the spleen of the OAT-recipient ACI/NKyo rats that were administered PAW. In contrast to the control group, the OAT-recipient ACI/NKyo rats that were administered PAW exhibited higher mobilization and levels of circulating endothelial progenitor cells associated with vessel repair. We use the transferring plasmon effect to adjust and maintain the biochemical properties of water, and to meet the biochemical demand of organisms. Therefore, this study highlights the therapeutic roles of PAW and provides more biomedical applicability for the transferring plasmon effect.
