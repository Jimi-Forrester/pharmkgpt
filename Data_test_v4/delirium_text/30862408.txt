30862408|t|Impact of androgen deprivation therapy on mood, cognition, and risk for AD.
30862408|a|Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer diagnosed in men. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is commonly prescribed, with some estimates indicating over 50% of men with prostate cancer receive ADT at some point in their treatment. Men on ADT are typically otherwise healthy, with good long-term survival. However, consequences of androgen deprivation can include side effects that may include changes in cognition or onset of dementia. This review will describe what is known about ADT and changes in cognitive function, the possible connection with Alzheimer's disease, how to discuss this with patients about to start ADT, and what patients can do to potentially mitigate cognitive changes.
