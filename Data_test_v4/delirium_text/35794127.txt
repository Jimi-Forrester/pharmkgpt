35794127|t|Irigenin, a novel lead from Iris confusa for management of Helicobacter pylori infection with selective COX-2 and HpIMPDH inhibitory potential.
35794127|a|The development of new natural drugs for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) management has recently received significant attention. Iris confusa (I. confusa) was long used for the treatment of bacterial infections and gastritis. This study aimed at evaluating its effect on management of H. pylori infection and exploring its bioactive metabolites. The inhibitory potential of the polar (PF), non-polar (NPF) fractions and the isolated compounds against H. pylori using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in addition to their cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2), and nitric oxide (NO) inhibitory activities were assessed. The most biologically active compound was tested for its selective H. pylori inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (HpIMPDH) inhibitory potential. Chromatographic purification of PF and NPF allowed isolation of tectoridin, orientin, irigenin, tectorigenin, isoarborinol and stigmasterol. The PF exhibited significant anti-H. pylori (MIC 62.50 microg/mL), COX-1, COX-2 (IC50 of 112.08 +- 0.60 and 47.90 +- 1.50 microg/mL respectively, selectivity index SI of 2.34), and NO (IC50 47.80 +- 0.89 microg/mL) inhibitory activities, while irigenin was the most potent isolated compound. Irigenin was found to have a promising activity against HpIMPDH enzyme (IC50 of 2.07 +- 1.90 muM) with low activity against human hIMPDH2 (IC50 > 10 muM) than clarithromycin, assuring its selectivity. Overall, I. confusa and its isolated compounds may serve as a potential source of plant-based drugs for H. pylori control. This study scientifically validated the claimed anti-bacterial activity of I. confusa and revealed irigenin potential as a novel lead exhibiting anti H. pylori activity in a first record.
