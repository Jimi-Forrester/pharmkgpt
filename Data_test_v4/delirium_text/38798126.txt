38798126|t|Beta amyloid PET scans for dementia diagnoses: Practice and research implications from CARE-IDEAS.
38798126|a|Beta amyloid PET scans are a minimally invasive biomarker that may inform Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. The Caregiver's Reactions and Experience (CARE) study, an IDEAS supplement, aimed to understand experiences of PET scan recipients and their care partners regarding motivations for scans, reporting and interpreting results, and impact of results. Patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia who agreed to join the CARE-IDEAS study and their care partners participated in a baseline survey and follow-up survey approximately 18 months later, supplemented by in-depth qualitative interviews with subsets of participants. Patients who received scans and volunteered for follow-up research were more likely to be male, better educated, and have higher income than the general population. Survey information was merged with Medicare data. This article integrates findings from several CARE-IDEAS publications and provides implications for practice and research. Although most participants accurately reported scan results, they were often confused about their meaning for prognosis. Some participants reported distress with results, but there were no significant changes in measured depression, burden, or economic strain over time. Many respondents desired more information about prognosis and supportive resources. Scan results were not differentially associated with changes in service use over time. Findings suggest a need for carefully designed and tested tools for clinicians to discuss risks and benefits of scans and their results, and resources to support patients and care partners in subsequent planning. Learning of scan results provides a point-of-contact that should be leveraged to facilitate shared decision-making and person-centered longitudinal AD care.
