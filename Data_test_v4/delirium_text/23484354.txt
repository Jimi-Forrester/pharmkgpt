23484354|t|[Palliative (symptomatic) care of (imminently) dying patients].
23484354|a|The updated Current Care Guideline focuses on medical symptom treatment when curative treatment is no longer possible. Palliative care should be available to all dying patients at all health care levels. Pain should be treated prophylactically. Opioids are effective in cancer pain and should be chosen for moderate or severe pain in line with the WHO pain ladder. Treatment options for symptoms which call for acute interventions, such as intracranial hypertension, and options for dyspnoea, delirium, gastro-intestinal symptoms, ascites, dehydration and end-of-life treatment of elderly and demented patients are described.
