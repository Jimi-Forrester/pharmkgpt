38016198|t|Multimodal spatiotemporal monitoring of basal stem cell-derived organoids reveals progression of olfactory dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.
38016198|a|Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is a highly prevalent symptom and an early sign of neurodegenerative diseases in humans. However, the roles of peripheral olfactory system in disease progression and the mechanisms behind neurodegeneration remain to be studied. Olfactory epithelium (OE) organoid is an ideal model to study pathophysiology in vitro, yet the reliance on 3D culture condition limits continual in situ monitoring of organoid development. Here, we combined impedance biosensors and live imaging for real-time spatiotemporal analysis of OE organoids morphological and physiological features during Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. The impedance measurements showed that organoids generated from basal stem cells of APP/PS1 transgenic mice had lower proliferation rate than that from wild-type mice. In concert with the biosensor measurements, live imaging enabled to visualize the spatial and temporal dynamics of organoid morphology. Abnormal protein aggregation and accumulation, including amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, was found in AD organoids and increased as disease progressed. This multimodal in situ bioelectrical measurement and imaging provide a new platform for investigating onset mechanisms of OD, which would shed new light on early diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative disease.
