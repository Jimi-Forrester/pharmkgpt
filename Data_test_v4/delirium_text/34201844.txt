34201844|t|The Impact of Obesity on Microglial Function: Immune, Metabolic and Endocrine Perspectives.
34201844|a|Increased life expectancy in combination with modern life style and high prevalence of obesity are important risk factors for development of neurodegenerative diseases. Neuroinflammation is a feature of neurodegenerative diseases, and microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain, are central players in it. The present review discusses the effects of obesity, chronic peripheral inflammation and obesity-associated metabolic and endocrine perturbations, including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and increased glucocorticoid levels, on microglial function.
