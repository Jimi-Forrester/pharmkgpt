22010592|t|Recognition and evaluation of delirium.
22010592|a|Delirium (acute confusional state) is one of the most common mental disorders encountered in patients with medical illness, particularly among those who are older. It is associated with many complex underlying medical conditions and can be hard to recognise. Systematic studies and clinical trials are difficult to perform in patients with cognitive impairment; recommendations for evaluating and treating delirium are based primarily upon clinical observation and expert opinion. Our knowledge of the clinical epidemiology of delirium has substantially increased in the last decade, providing a basic framework for understanding and managing the disorder.
