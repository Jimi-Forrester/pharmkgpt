29067312|a|INTRODUCTION: There are currently no effective treatments preventing conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease. Cilostazol is a selective type-3 phosphodiesterase inhibitor that ameliorates accumulation of amyloid-beta and has prevented cognitive decline in rodent models. Furthermore, cilostazol is known to suppress platelet aggregation, protect vascular endothelia, dilate vessels, and increase cerebral blood flow. Beneficial effects have also been shown in observational cohort studies, demonstrating the need for a prospective clinical trial. METHODS: The Cilostazol for prevention of COnversion from MCI to Dementia (COMCID) study is a double-blind, randomized phase II study of patients with MCI. Participants will receive cilostazol or placebo for 96 weeks. The primary objective is to evaluate whether cilostazol slows down cognitive decline measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination. Secondary objectives are assessing time to conversion from MCI to dementia and assessing incremental changes in several psychological assessment scales. DISCUSSION: The COMCID trial will identify the therapeutic potential of cilostazol. This trial, which is based on a drug repositioning strategy, may aid the development of a neurovascular treatment for neurocognitive disorders.
