31581209|a|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Previous studies from western countries have reported that active hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was associated with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment failure. We sought to examine this issue in an Asian cohort. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients with advanced fibrosis who were treated with DAAs at our hospital between January 2017 and June 2018. RESULTS: We treated 1021 HCV-infected patients during this period. A total of 976 of those patients were enrolled in a per-protocol analysis, including 556 (57.2%) who had genotype 1b infections, and 314 (32.3%) who had genotype 2 infections. The mean age of all 976 patients was 65.5 years, and 44.5% were male. 781 of the patients had no HCC, 172 had inactive HCC, and 23 had active HCC. Non-sustained virologic response (SVR) was noted in 10 (1.3%) patients without HCC, 5 (2.9%) patients with inactive HCC, and 4 (13.0%) patients with active HCC. After adjustment for confounders, active HCC (versus inactive HCC and non-HCC) was associated with non-SVR (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 24.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.4-136.9), P<0.001). Next, we excluded the 23 patients with active HCC from the multivariate analysis. After adjustment for confounders, inactive HCC (versus non-HCC) was not associated with non-SVR (AOR = 3.1 (95% CI = 0.94-9.95), P = 0.06). CONCLUSION: Active HCC was associated with non-SVR, while inactive HCC was not. We thus suggest the deferral of DAA treatment until after the complete radiological response of HCCs to treatment.
