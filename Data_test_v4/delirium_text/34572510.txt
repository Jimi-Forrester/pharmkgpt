34572510|t|Tandem Mass Spectrometry as Strategy for the Selective Identification and Quantification of the Amyloid Precursor Protein Tyr682 Residue Phosphorylation Status in Human Blood Mononuclear Cells.
34572510|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease without guidelines for early diagnosis or personalized treatment. Previous studies have highlighted a crucial role of increasing phosphorylation levels of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) Tyr682 residue in predicting neuronal deficits in AD patients. However, the lack of a method for the identification and quantification of Tyr682 phosphorylation levels prevents its potential clinical applications. Methods: Here we report a method to identify and quantify APP Tyr682 phosphorylation levels in blood mononuclear cells of AD patients by tandem mass spectrometry (tMS). Results: This method showed excellent sensitivity with detection and quantification limits set respectively at 0.035 and 0.082 ng injected for the phosphorylated peptide and at 0.02 and 0.215 ng injected for the non-phosphorylated peptide. The average levels of both peptides were quantified in transfected HELA cells (2.48 and 3.53 ng/mug of protein, respectively). Preliminary data on 3 AD patients showed quantifiable levels of phosphorylated peptide (0.10-0.15 ng/mug of protein) and below the LOQ level of non-phosphorylated peptide (0.13 ng/mug of protein). Conclusion: This method could allow the identification of patients with increased APP Tyr682 phosphorylation and allow early characterization of molecular changes prior to the appearance of clinical signs.
