37406001|a|BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a common zoonoses and is a major global public health threat. Most cases are mild, typically presenting as a non-specific acute febrile illness. However, leptospirosis can have life-threatening manifestations, including pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome, and acute kidney injury. In Colombia, notification and lab-confirmation of suspected human cases are mandatory. However, little is known about the demographic and clinical factors associated with severe leptospirosis, which could help to reduce clinical complications and mortality. Our aim was to identify risk factors associated with severe leptospirosis, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality in lab-confirmed cases in Colombia, 2015-2020. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed 201 lab-confirmed human leptospirosis cases by microagglutination test. We used a logistic regression to identify the demographic and clinical risk factors associated with severe leptospirosis, admission to ICU, and death. Most leptospirosis confirmed cases occurred in men (85.6%); the mean age was 36.7 years. We classified severe cases (43.3%) by clinical manifestations as renal (29.9%) and liver (27.4%) failure, multiple-organ failure (24.4%), septic shock (24.4%), Weil syndrome (18.4%), pulmonary hemorrhage (18.4%), and meningitis (2.5%), admitted to the ICU (30.3%), and fatal (8.5%). Clinical conditions associated with severe leptospirosis were dyspnea (OR: 5.54; 95% CI: 1.46 to 20.98), tachycardia (OR:9.69; 95% CI: 15.96 to 58.8), and rash (OR: 10.25; 95% CI: 25.01 to 42.08). CONCLUSIONS: We identified demographic characteristics and clinical symptoms associated with severe leptospirosis in Colombia. We hope these results can support clinicians in providing timely treatment to leptospirosis patients to avoid preventable medical complications or deaths.
