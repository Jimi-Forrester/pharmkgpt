31799825|a|Dementia frequently occurs in Down syndrome (DS) patients, and early intervention is important in its management. We have previously demonstrated a positive correlation of plasma beta-amyloid Abeta42 levels and negative correlations of Abeta40 and tau levels with dementia in DS. In this study, we examined more cases and constructed composite scores with both tau and amyloids to correlate with dementia in DS. Plasma Abeta42, Abeta40, and tau proteins were measured by an immunomagnetic reduction assay in DS patients. Data were randomly and repeatedly split into training and validating sets, and logistic regression was applied to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) for each biomarker. A total of 73 DS patients (among them, 23 had neurodegeneration) and 77 controls were recruited. In DS patients without dementia, plasma Abeta40 and tau levels were highly elevated, but Abeta42 levels were lower than those of the healthy controls. DS patients with dementia, compared with DS patients with no dementia, had a large decline in Abeta40 and tau but a rise in Abeta42. For biomarker scores correlating with dementia, Abeta40 revealed an AUC of 0.912; the composite score of Abeta40 x tau revealed an AUC of 0.953; and a combined composite score of 0.1 for Abeta40 x Tau +0.9 Tau x Abeta40/Abeta42 achieved the highest AUC of 0.965. Therefore, composite biomarker scores including both plasma tau and beta-amyloid levels correlate with dementia in DS better than using individual biomarker scores. The pattern of tau decline and Abeta42 rise in DS patients with dementia are also different from previous findings in Alzheimer's disease.
