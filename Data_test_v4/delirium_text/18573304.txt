18573304|a|One of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is the progressive accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the form of senile plaques, and Abeta insult to neuronal cells has been identified as one of the major causes of the onset of the disease. Curcumin, the major and most active antioxidant of Curcuma longa, protects neuronal cells against Abeta-induced toxicity. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the neuroprotective mechanisms by which curcumin acts against Abeta (25-35)-induced toxicity in PC12 cells. Following the exposure of PC12 cells to 10 microM Abeta (25-35) for 24h, significant increases in the level of antioxidant enzymes, and DNA damage were observed, and these increases were accompanied by a decrease in cell viability, and an increase in intracellular calcium levels and tau hyperphosphorylation. In addition, pretreatment of PC12 cells with 10 microg/ml curcumin for 1h significantly reversed the effect of Abeta, by decreasing the oxidative stress, and DNA damage induced by Abeta, as well as attenuating the elevation of intracellular calcium levels and tau hyperphosphorylation induced by Abeta. Taken together, these data indicate that curucmin protected PC12 cells against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity through the inhibition of oxidative damage, intracellular calcium influx, and tau hyperphosphorylation.
