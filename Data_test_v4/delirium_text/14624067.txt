14624067|a|BACKGROUND: beta-Amyloid peptide (Abeta), a neutrotoxic substance, has been implicated to a great degree in cell death during the course of AD. Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol mainly found in red wine, has been shown to be cardioprotective and chemoprotective. Since a moderate wine intake correlates with a lower risk for Alzheimer disease (AD), an additional neuroprotective effect has been postulated for resveratrol. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed at elucidating the possible neuroprotective effects of resveratrol against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. METHODS: The neuroprotective capacity against Abeta-related oxidative stress was studied in a cell culture model suitable for studying such potentially neuroprotective substances. RESULTS: Resveratrol maintains cell viability and exerts an anti-oxidative action by enhancing the intracellular free-radical scavenger glutathione. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that red wine may be neuroprotective through the actions of resveratrol.
