1259044|t|Consultation-liaison psychiatry: current responsibilities.
1259044|a|The authors describe their experiences as consultation-liaison psychiatrists in two general teaching hospitals. Current medical house staff members appear to be more aware of the importance of psychosocial issues in patient care than were interns and residents in the past. Consultation-liaison teaching may now focus on the application of this psychologic awareness to patient management, the correct use of psychotropic drugs, and the differentiation of delirium from functional psychoses.
