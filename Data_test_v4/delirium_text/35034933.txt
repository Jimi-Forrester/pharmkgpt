35034933|t|Factors in Avoidable Emergency Visits for Ambulatory Care-sensitive Conditions among Older Patients Receiving Home Care in Japan: A Retrospective Study.
35034933|a|Objective Older adults have many health conditions that do not require hospitalization, such as cognitive decline and progression of frailty, so it is necessary to prevent avoidable emergency visits for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions (ACSCs) in this population. We therefore examine Freund's classification of reasons for hospitalization owing to ACSCs to identify factors involved in elderly patients visiting emergency departments in Japan. Methods This retrospective case-control study included patients who received emergency transport for medical treatment at Yushoukai Home Care Clinic Shinagawa in Japan between January 1, 2016, and April 30, 2019. We examined patients' medical records and categorized the reasons for emergency visit by ambulance in accordance with Freund's categories (physician related level, medical causes, patient level, and social level). In addition, we classified and compared patients who lived at home (Group A) with those living in a care facility for older adults (Group B). Results A total of 365 patients visited the emergency department (298 in Group A and 67 in Group B). Among these, we determined that emergency visits were potentially avoidable in 135 patients from Group A and 28 from Group B. The patient and social level categories accounted for 81% of potentially avoidable emergency visits. Confirmed advanced care planning (ACP) was significantly associated with avoidable emergency visit by ambulance in multivariate analyses. Conclusion To prevent emergency visits for ACSCs among older people, ACP should be encouraged.
