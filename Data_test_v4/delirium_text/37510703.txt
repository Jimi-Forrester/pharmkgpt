37510703|t|Cognitive Performance in Asymptomatic Elderly People with Hepatitis C: The Role of Education.
37510703|a|BACKGROUND: Neurotropism of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be the source of subtle neuropsychological symptoms in non-cirrhotic patients. Age is a risk factor for cognitive impairment (CI). Thus, asymptomatic elderly people who carry HCV might be at a greater risk of CI. Education can influence test performance. OBJECTIVES: (1) To verify whether elderly people with HCV performed poorer than controls on cognitive tests. (2) To analyze how education affects performance. (3) To verify whether the extent of the effect of education on performance depends on the group (HCV vs. controls) and the type of cognitive test. METHODS: Asymptomatic HCV carriers older than 60 years (n = 41) were matched with 41 corresponding controls. All participants performed the following tests: Mini-Cog, Mini Mental State Examination, clock drawing test (CDT), and verbal fluency. RESULTS: (1) There were no significant differences in cognitive performance between the two groups. (2) Higher education was always associated with better performance. (3) There was a significant group difference in the slopes of the regression lines between years of education and CDT performance. No differences were found for the other three tests. CONCLUSION: Considering the scores on the CDT, the rate of improvement in performance when schooling increases is higher in HCV carriers.
