12119881|a|In recent years, the efficacy of symptomatic antidementive drugs in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been well documented. A prerequisite for maximally effect antidementive treatment is early diagnosis and a subsequent specific diagnostic clarification. A further essential is early initiation of treatment to delay progression of the disease and thus early loss of daily skills and independence ending in the need for intensive nursing care. Currently, cholinesterase inhibitors, the efficacy of which has been confirmed in placebo-controlled multicenter studies, are recommended for the treatment of mild to moderate AD. Further substances with proven efficacy are memantine, ginkgo biloba extract EGb761 and certain classical nootropics. To treat behavioral and other psychological disturbances, symptom-related substances such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and atypical neuroleptics should be employed. In addition to their positive effect on cognitive disturbances, cholinesterase inhibitors also have an appreciable impact on concomitant psychopathological symptoms.
