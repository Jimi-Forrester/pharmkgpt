33262911|t|Viral Infections of the Central Nervous System in Children: A Systematic Review.
33262911|a|Viral infections of the central nervous system such as meningitis, encephalitis or meningoencephalitis, are important causes of significant morbidities and mortality worldwide. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment will lead to better outcomes, but any delay may results in high fatality with serious neurologic sequelae among survivors. We conducted a systematic review of published literature on the clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and complications of viral infections of the central nervous system from 1980 to 2019 on four databases comprising of PubMed, PubMed Central, Google Scholar and Medline to give the current understanding for better patient management. This systematic review demonstrates the management approach of viral infections of the central nervous system in children from the point of clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and complications. Definitive treatment remained unknown; however, certain antiviral drugs were proved to be effective. Therefore, prevention through childhood vaccination is the best management option.
