30892166|t|Bioavailability and Pharmaco-therapeutic Potential of Luteolin in Overcoming Alzheimer's Disease.
30892166|a|Luteolin is a naturally occurring, yellow crystalline flavonoid found in numerous dietary supplements we frequently have in our meals. Studies in the last 2 decades have revealed its therapeutic potential to reduce the Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptoms in various in vitro and in vivo models. The anti-Alzheimer's potential of luteolin is attributed to its ability to suppress Abeta as well as tau aggregation or promote their disaggregation, down-regulate the expression of COX-2, NOS, MMP-9, TNF-alpha, interleukins and chemokines, reduce oxidative stress by scavenging ROS, modulate the activities of transcription factors CREB, cJun, Nrf-1, NF-kappaB, p38, p53, AP-1 and beta-catenine and inhibiting the activities of various protein kinases. In several systems, luteolin has been described as a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. In addition, we have also discussed about the bio-availability of the luteolin in the plasma. After being metabolized luteolin persists in plasma as glucuronides and sulphate-conjugates. Human clinical trials indicated no dose limiting toxicity when administered at a dose of 100 mg/day. Improvements in the formulations and drug delivery systems may further enhance the bioavailability and potency of luteolin. The current review describes in detail the data supporting these studies.
