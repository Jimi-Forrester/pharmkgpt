38672774|t|An Update on the Potential of Tangeretin in the Management of Neuroinflammation-Mediated Neurodegenerative Disorders.
38672774|a|Neuroinflammation is the major cause of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Currently available drugs present relatively low efficacy and are not capable of modifying the course of the disease or delaying its progression. Identifying well-tolerated and brain-penetrant agents of plant origin could fulfil the pressing need for novel treatment techniques for neuroinflammation. Attention has been drawn to a large family of flavonoids in citrus fruits, which may function as strong nutraceuticals in slowing down the development and progression of neuroinflammation. This review is aimed at elucidating and summarizing the effects of the flavonoid tangeretin (TAN) in the management of neuroinflammation-mediated neurodegenerative disorders. A literature survey was performed using various resources, including ScienceDirect, PubMed, Google Scholar, Springer, and Web of Science. The data revealed that TAN exhibited immense neuroprotective effects in addition to its anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonistic effects. The effects of TAN are mainly mediated through the inhibition of oxidative and inflammatory pathways via regulating multiple signaling pathways, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase, and CRE-dependent transcription. In conclusion, the citrus flavonoid TAN has the potential to prevent neuronal death mediated by neuroinflammatory pathways and can be developed as an auxiliary therapeutic agent in the management of neurodegenerative disorders.
