31124369|a|Neurodegeneration can be defined as a process in which neuronal structures and functions undergo changes leading to reduced neuronal survival and increased cell death in the central nervous system (CNS). Neuronal degeneration in specific regions of the CNS is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative disorders, and there is reliable proof that neural stem cells bring therapeutic benefits in treatment of neurological lesions. However, effective therapy with neural stem cells is associated with their biological properties. The assessment of immunological properties and comprehensive studies on the biology of glial restricted progenitors (GRP) are necessary prior to the application of these cells in humans. This study provides an in vitro characterization of the QSV40 glial human cell line, as well as murine and canine primary culture suspensions of GRPs and their mature, astrocytic forms using flow cytometry and immunohistochemical staining. Cytokines and chemokines released by GRPs were assessed by Multiplex ELISA. Some immunological differences observed among species suggest the necessity of reconsidering the pre-clinical model, and that careful testing of immunomodulatory strategies is required before cell transplantation into the CNS can be undertaken.
