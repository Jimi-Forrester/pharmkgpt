19567765|a|BACKGROUND: The phenomenology of delirium needs further elucidation using validated tools. OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to derive valid factors from the Delirium Rating Scale (DRS), Revised -98. METHOD: A factor analysis of the DRS-R-98 was performed among 161 medical-surgical patients. RESULTS: Scores ranged from 0 to 7 in 120 patients (74.53%; no delirium), 8 to 13 in 19 (11.80%; subclinical/prodromal delirium), and > or = 14 in 22 (13.66%; delirium). The DSM-IV-TR delirium incidence was 19.87%. The first two rotated factors explained 63.37% of the variance and may correspond to Cognition and Psychosis/Agitation factors. The dimension of motor retardation loaded with cognitive items. Motor agitation and retardation clustered with inattention, which is the cardinal symptom of delirium. CONCLUSION: The DRS-R-98 has good construct validity in this Latino population.
