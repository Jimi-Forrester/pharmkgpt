28917837|a|Memantine, an uncompetitive glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is widely used as a medication for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously reported that chronic treatment of AD with memantine reduces the amount of insoluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) and soluble Abeta oligomers in animal models of AD. The mechanisms by which memantine reduces Abeta levels in the brain were evaluated by determining the effect of memantine on Abeta aggregation using thioflavin T and transmission electron microscopy. Memantine inhibited the formation of Abeta(1-42) aggregates in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas amantadine, a structurally similar compound, did not affect Abeta aggregation at the same concentrations. Furthermore, memantine inhibited the formation of different types of Abeta aggregates, including Abetas carrying familial AD mutations, and disaggregated preformed Abeta(1-42) fibrils. These results suggest that the inhibition of Abeta aggregation and induction of Abeta disaggregation may be involved in the mechanisms by which memantine reduces Abeta deposition in the brain.
