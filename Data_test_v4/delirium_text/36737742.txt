36737742|t|Association of phase angle with sarcopenia in chronic musculoskeletal pain patients: a retrospective study.
36737742|a|BACKGROUND: In chronic musculoskeletal pain patients, detection of sarcopenia is of significant clinical interest. Phase angle, which can be measured through bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), can detect sarcopenia; however, the evidence in chronic musculoskeletal pain patients is limited. This study aimed to assess the relationship between phase angle and sarcopenia in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Our hypothesis was that phase angle would be a useful indicator to identify sarcopenia in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. METHODS: A total of 190 patients (51 men and 139 women) with chronic musculoskeletal pain were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study. Patient data of backgrounds, numeric rating scale score for pain, skeletal muscle index, and phase angle assessed using BIA were retrospectively reviewed. Sarcopenia was diagnosed using the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia criteria 2019. RESULTS: A total of 51 patients (26.7%), including 10 men (19.6%) and 41 women (29.5%), were diagnosed with sarcopenia. Phase angle, sarcopenia-related factors, age, and body mass index (BMI) differed significantly in patients with and without sarcopenia. On multiple logistic regression analysis, the prevalence of sarcopenia was significantly correlated with phase angle and BMI. The areas under the curve exhibited high accuracy in discriminating sarcopenia in men and moderate accuracy in both sexes and in women. CONCLUSIONS: Phase angle may be a valid discriminator of sarcopenia in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain.
