16175542|a|The folding of amyloid beta (1-40) peptide into beta-sheet-containing fibrils is thought to play a causative role in Alzheimer's disease. Because of its amphiphilic character, the peptide can interact with phospholipid membranes. Langmuir monolayers of negatively charged DPPS, DPPG, and DMPG, and also of zwitterionic DPPC and DMPC, have been used to study the influence of the peptide on the lipid packing and, vice versa, the influence of phospholipid monolayers on the peptide secondary structure by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction. The peptide adsorbs at the air/water (buffer) interface, and also inserts into uncompressed phospholipid monolayers. When adsorbed at the interface, the peptide adopts a beta-sheet conformation, with the long axis of these beta-sheets oriented almost parallel to the surface. If the lipid exhibits a condensed monolayer phase, then compression of the complex monolayer with the inserted peptide leads to the squeezing out of the peptide at higher surface pressures (above 30 mN m(-1)). The peptide desorbs completely from zwitterionic monolayers and negatively charged DPPG and DPPS monolayers on buffer, but remains adsorbed in the beta-sheet conformation at negatively charged monolayers on water. This can be explained in terms of electrostatic interactions with the lipid head groups. It also remains adsorbed at, or penetrating into, disordered anionic monolayers on buffer. Additionally, the peptide does not influence the condensed monolayer structure at physiological pH and modest ionic strength.
