33929683|t|Alzheimer's Disease and Epilepsy: A Perspective on the Opportunities for Overlapping Therapeutic Innovation.
33929683|a|Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with variants in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin (PSEN) 1 and 2. It is increasingly recognized that patients with AD experience undiagnosed focal seizures. These AD patients with reported seizures may have worsened disease trajectory. Seizures in epilepsy can also lead to cognitive deficits, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Epilepsy is roughly three times more common in individuals aged 65 and older. Due to the numerous available antiseizure drugs (ASDs), treatment of seizures has been proposed to reduce the burden of AD. More work is needed to establish the functional impact of seizures in AD to determine whether ASDs could be a rational therapeutic strategy. The efficacy of ASDs in aged animals is not routinely studied, despite the fact that the elderly represents the fastest growing demographic with epilepsy. This leaves a particular gap in understanding the discrete pathophysiological overlap between hyperexcitability and aging, and AD more specifically. Most of our preclinical knowledge of hyperexcitability in AD has come from mouse models that overexpress APP. While these studies have been invaluable, other drivers underlie AD, e.g. PSEN2. A diversity of animal models should be more frequently integrated into the study of hyperexcitability in AD, which could be particularly beneficial to identify novel therapies. Specifically, AD-associated risk genes, in particular PSENs, altogether represent underexplored contributors to hyperexcitability. This review assesses the available studies of ASDs administration in clinical AD populations and preclinical studies with AD-associated models and offers a perspective on the opportunities for further therapeutic innovation.
