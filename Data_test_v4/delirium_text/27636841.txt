27636841|t|Perlecan Domain V Inhibits Amyloid-beta Induced Activation of the alpha2beta1 Integrin-Mediated Neurotoxic Signaling Cascade.
27636841|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neuronal death, neurofibrillary tangles, and senile plaques. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is the major component of plaques and consists of two prominent isoforms, Abeta40 and Abeta42. As many risk factors for AD are vascular in origin and blood vessel defects in clearing Abeta from the brain are a potential key component of AD pathology, we have focused on the neuron-blood vessel interface, and in particular, the vascular basement membrane, which coats blood vessels and physically separates them from neurons. A prominent component of the vascular basement membrane is the extracellular matrix proteoglycan perlecan. Domain V (DV) is the C-terminal domain and is generated by perlecan proteolysis. DV interacts with the alpha2 integrin and Abeta is a ligand for both alpha2beta1 and alphavbeta1. Due to the known interaction of DV with alpha2beta1 and alpha2beta1's requirement for Abeta deposition and neurotoxicity, we hypothesized that DV and/or its C-terminal domain, LG3, might alter neurotoxic signaling pathways by directly blocking or otherwise interfering with alpha2beta1 binding by Abeta. Our study suggests that alpha2beta1 mediates Abeta-induced activation of c-Jun and caspase-3, key components of the neurotoxic pathway, in primary cortical and hippocampal neurons. We further demonstrate that DV and/or LG3 may therapeutically modulate these alpha2beta1 mediated neurotoxic effects suggesting that they or other alpha2beta1 integrin modulators could represent a novel approach to treat AD. Finally, our results suggest different neurotoxicity susceptibilities between cortical and hippocampal neurons to Abeta40 and Abeta42 as further underscored by differing neuroprotective potencies of LG3 in each cell type.
