38187779|a|Recent investigations of cell type changes in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) using single-cell profiling methods have focused on active lesional and peri-lesional brain tissue, and have implicated a number of peripheral and central nervous system cell types. However, an important question is the extent to which so-called "normal-appearing" non-lesional tissue in individuals with MS accumulate changes over the lifespan. Here, we compared post-mortem non-lesional brain tissue from donors with a pathological or clinical diagnosis of MS from the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohorts to age- and sex-matched brains from persons without MS (controls). We profiled three brain regions using single-nucleus RNA-seq: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and the pulvinar in thalamus (PULV), from 15 control individuals, 8 individuals with MS, and 5 individuals with other detrimental pathologies accompanied by demyelination, resulting in a total of 78 samples. We identified region- and cell type-specific differences in non-lesional samples from individuals diagnosed with MS and/or exhibiting secondary demyelination with other neurological conditions, as compared to control donors. These differences included lower proportions of oligodendrocytes with expression of myelination related genes MOBP, MBP, PLP1, as well as higher proportions of CRYAB+ oligodendrocytes in all three brain regions. Among microglial signatures, we identified subgroups that were higher in both demyelination (TMEM163+/ERC2+), as well as those that were specifically higher in MS donors (HIF1A+/SPP1+) and specifically in donors with secondary demyelination (SOCS6+/MYO1E+), in both white and grey matter. To validate our findings, we generated Visium spatial transcriptomics data on matched tissue from 13 donors, and recapitulated our observations of gene expression differences in oligodendrocytes and microglia. Finally, we show that some of the differences observed between control and MS donors in NAWM mirror those previously reported between control WM and active lesions in MS donors. Overall, our investigation sheds additional light on cell type- and disease-specific differences present even in non-lesional white and grey matter tissue, highlighting widespread cellular signatures that may be associated with downstream pathological changes.
