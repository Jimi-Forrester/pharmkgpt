36792460|t|The Association Between Enhanced Recovery After Cardiac Surgery-Guided Analgesics and Postoperative Delirium.
36792460|a|OBJECTIVES: Delirium is a common postoperative complication associated with death and long-term cognitive impairment. The authors studied the association between opioid-sparing anesthetics, incorporating Enhanced Recovery After Cardiac Surgery (ERACS)-guided analgesics and postoperative delirium. DESIGN: The authors performed a retrospective review of nonemergent coronary, valve, or ascending aorta surgery patients. SETTING: A tertiary academic medical institution. PARTICIPANTS: The study authors analyzed a dataset of elective adult cardiac surgical patients. All patients >=18 years undergoing elective cardiac surgery from November 2, 2017 until February 2, 2021 were eligible for inclusion. INTERVENTIONS: The ERACS-guided multimodal pain regimen included preoperative oral acetaminophen and gabapentin, and intraoperative intravenous lidocaine, ketamine, and dexmedetomidine. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Delirium was measured by bedside nurses using the Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive care unit (ICU). Delirium occurred in 220 of the 1,675 patients (13.7%). The use of any component of the multimodal pain regimen was not associated with delirium (odds ratio [OR]: 0.85 [95% CI: 0.63-1.16]). Individually, acetaminophen was associated with reduced odds of delirium (OR: 0.60 [95% CI: 0.37-0.95]). Gabapentin (OR: 1.36 [95% CI: 0.97-2.21]), lidocaine (OR: 0.86 [95% CI: 0.53-1.37]), ketamine (OR: 1.15 [95% CI: 0.72-1.83]), and dexmedetomidine (OR: 0.79 [95% CI: 0.46-1.31]) were not individually associated with postoperative delirium. Individual ERACS elements were associated with secondary outcomes of hospital length of stay, ICU duration, postoperative opioid administration, and postoperative intubation duration. CONCLUSIONS: The use of an opioid-sparing perioperative ERACS pain regimen was not associated with reduced postoperative delirium, opioid consumption, or additional poor outcomes. Individually, acetaminophen was associated with reduced delirium.
