30165919|a|Over the past two decades, caregiver stress has been the subject of scientific inquiry by investigators around the world representing a variety of disciplines. The knowledge base is extensive and growing, particularly as it relates to the phenomenology and correlates of caregiver stress. The six papers published here represent a snapshot of prevailing lines of inquiry and enhance our knowledge regarding: predictors of psychological distress for dementia family caregivers in Japan (Shikimoto et al., 2017) and for Indonesian and Burmese foreign domestic workers caring for frail older adults in Singapore (Ha et al., 2018); identification of a threshold number of behavioral symptoms in those with dementia associated with caregiver distress (Arthur et al., 2017); the influence of specific illness factors on caregiver stress, including comorbid diabetes in patients with Alzheimer's disease (Li et al., 2018) and a comparison of the effects of behavioral disturbances on caregiver burden across three types of dementia (Liu et al., 2017); and the application of data on caregiver stress to inform the development of a multi-component framework for preventing depression in caregivers of those with dementia (Ying et al., 2017).
