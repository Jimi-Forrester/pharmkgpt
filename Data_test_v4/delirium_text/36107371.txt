36107371|a|NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3) is an inflammasome associated with oral and general health. There is a bidirectional relationship between the oral cavity and systemic health. The primary reason for this situation is the similarity in pathways for chronic inflammatory diseases both in the oral cavity and systemically. Periodontal and periapical diseases are some of the most common inflammatory conditions in adults and are associated with bacterial infection and host inflammation. The pathogenesis of periodontal and periapical lesions is complex and multifactorial, and the host inflammatory response determines the progression and pattern of the diseases. Inflammasomes, innate immune system receptors and sensors, are the key components in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory conditions. They are reported to be responsible for the initiation of the inflammatory reaction, maturation of proinflammatory cytokines and pyroptosis. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multi-protein complex that contributes to immune responses during infection or injury. NLRP3 is implicated in several diseases such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. There have been many recent advances in our knowledge concerning the essential role of NLRP3 inflammasome in periodontal and periapical inflammation. Therefore, the NLRP3 inflammasome may be a promising target for anti-inflammatory therapies. This paper will provide an overview of the role of NLRP3 inflammasome on periodontal and endodontic diseases with their links between systemic conditions, and presents a future perspective for the treatment of these inflammatory conditions.
