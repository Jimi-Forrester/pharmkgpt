36225729|t|Computational model predicts protein binding sites of a luminescent ligand equipped with guanidiniocarbonyl-pyrrole groups.
36225729|a|The 14-3-3 protein family, one of the first discovered phosphoserine/phosphothreonine binding proteins, has attracted interest not only because of its important role in the cell regulatory processes but also due to its enormous number of interactions with other proteins. Here, we use a computational approach to predict the binding sites of the designed hybrid compound featuring aggregation-induced emission luminophores as a potential supramolecular ligand for 14-3-3zeta in the presence and absence of C-Raf peptides. Our results suggest that the area above and below the central pore of the dimeric 14-3-3zeta protein is the most probable binding site for the ligand. Moreover, we predict that the position of the ligand is sensitive to the presence of phosphorylated C-Raf peptides. With a series of experiments, we confirmed the computational prediction of two C 2 related, dominating binding sites on 14-3-3zeta that may bind to two of the supramolecular ligand molecules.
