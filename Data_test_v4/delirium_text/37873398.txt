37873398|t|Identification of a binding site for bupropion in Gloeobacter violaceus ligand-gated ion channel.
37873398|a|Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant and smoking cessation drug which causes adverse effects such as insomnia, irritability, and anxiety. Bupropion inhibits dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake transporters and eukaryotic cation-conducting pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs), such as nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) and serotonin type 3A (5-HT3A) receptors, at clinically relevant concentrations. However, the binding sites and binding mechanisms of bupropion are still elusive. To further understand the inhibition of pLGICs by bupropion, in this work, using a prokaryotic homologue of pLGICs as a model, we examined the inhibitory potency of bupropion in Gloeobacter violaceus ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), a proton-gated ion channel. Bupropion inhibited proton-induced currents in GLIC with an inhibitory potency of 14.9 +- 2.0 muM, comparable to clinically attainable concentrations previously shown to also modulate eukaryotic pLGICs. Using single amino acid substitutions in GLIC and two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings, we further determined a binding site for bupropion in the lower third of the first transmembrane segment M1 at residue T214. The sidechain of M1 T214 together with additional residues of M1 and also of M3 of the adjacent subunit have previously been shown to contribute to binding of other lipophilic molecules like allopregnanolone and pregnanolone. SIGNIFICANCE: GLIC, Gloeobacter ligand-gated ion channel, has been extensively used as a model to identify and understand binding sites and mechanisms for cholesterol, neurosteroids, and anesthetics interacting with neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, such as, GABA A receptors and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Recently, increasing evidence has revealed that another neurotransmitter-gated ion channel, the serotonin type 3A receptor, binds to an atypical antidepressant, bupropion, at clinically relevant concentrations. Our work here proposes a binding site for bupropion in GLIC and suggests a new approach to characterize binding mechanisms of bupropion in other neurotransmitter-gated ion channels.
