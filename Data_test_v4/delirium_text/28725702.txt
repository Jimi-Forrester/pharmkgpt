28725702|t|Defining a role for hemoglobin in Parkinson's disease.
28725702|a|Hemoglobin (Hb) has been shown to be expressed within dopaminergic neurons and to have a role in maintaining iron and mitochondrial homeostasis. In Parkinson's disease tissues, Hb has been localized to the mitochondrion. Though heme synthesis occurs within the mitochondria, the localization of Hb to this organelle has only recently been described. It is now important to understand whether Hb expression is protective or is a part of the neurodegenerative process. It is possible that the accumulation of neuronal or mitochondrial Hb is initially protective, but over many decades causes pathology. Studying Hb in neurons can give insight into the iron accumulation seen in the brain and the potential role of alpha-synuclein as a ferrireductase. In this review, we discuss the interactions of neuronal and mitochondrial Hb with other proteins and its possible role in pathways relevant to Parkinson's disease.
