12056875|t|Are acetylcholine-induced acetyl groups driving fuel cells in the systems of transducin, t and G proteins?
12056875|a|Life is completely dependent on a support of energy which is generated by the direct absorption of light or by the reduction of oxygen. Metabolized food yields ac(et)yl groups which are utilized in the reduction of oxygen with the assistance of many other compounds. Acetylcholine appears to be an important substance for the transportation of acetyl groups. Acetylcholine activates systems regulated by transducin, t and G proteins, probably Se enzymes, reacting by similar mechanisms in triggered reactions ending in nerve or muscle signals. These activations are performed by GTP (or ATP), probably resulting from the reactions of acetylcholine-induced acetyl groups. The inactivation-activation states of these systems are regulated by changes of GTP to cGMP to GMP which form a loop.Diminished support of energy to systems, because of impaired charge transfer to oxygen, may be responsible for many diseases. For example, there is a low level of acetylcholine in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
