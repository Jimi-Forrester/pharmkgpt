23076436|t|The association between small vessel infarcts and the activities of amyloid-beta peptide degrading proteases in apolipoprotein E4 allele carriers.
23076436|a|Small vessel (SV) and large vessel (LV) brain infarcts are distinct pathologies. Using a homebound elderly sample, the numbers of either infarct subtypes were similar between those apolipoprotein E4 allele (ApoE4) carriers (n = 80) and noncarriers (n = 243). We found that the higher the number of SV infarcts, but not LV infarcts, a participant had, the higher the activity of substrate V degradation in serum especially among ApoE4 carriers (beta = +0.154, SE = 0.031, P < .0001) after adjusting for the confounders. Since substrate V degradation could be mediated by insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) or/and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), but no relationship was found between SV infarcts and specific ACE activities, blood IDE may be a useful biomarker to distinguish the brain infarct subtypes. Insulin-degrading enzyme in blood may also imply an important biomarker and a pathological event in Alzheimer disease through SV infarcts in the presence of ApoE4.
