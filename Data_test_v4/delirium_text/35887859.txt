35887859|t|Functional and Morphological Changes in the Visual Pathway in Patients with Graves' Orbitopathy.
35887859|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to perform a functional and structural evaluation of the anterior visual pathway in patients with Graves' Orbitopathy (GO) using electrophysiological tests and OCT, as well as to identify potential parameters that could be useful in detecting early optic nerve damage. METHODS: 47 GO patients were enrolled in the study and divided into three groups, depending on their disease severity: Group 1 with mild GO, Group 2 with moderate-to-severe GO, and Group 3 with dysthyroid optic neuropathy (DON). Pattern visual evoked potential (PVEP), flash visual evoked potential (fVEP), pattern electroretinogram (pERG), and optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings were compared between the groups. RESULTS: In the DON Group (Group 3), N75, P100, and P2 latencies were significantly extended, whereas P100, P50, and N95 amplitudes were significantly reduced as compared to the non-DON group (Groups 1 and 2). Group 3 also had significantly thinner peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macular ganglion cell complex (GCC). In Group 2, as compared to Group 1, P100 amplitudes were significantly reduced for all check sizes, while P100 latency was elongated for the check size of 0.9 . Group 2 also had a significantly thinner average GCC and GCC in the superior quadrant. CONCLUSIONS: Electrophysiological examinations may be of use in diagnosis of DON. OCT findings and electrophysiological responses vary in patients with different GO severity. Including regular electrophysiological evaluation and OCT in the examination of patients with GO could be of benefit. However, more research is needed to establish the true significance of pVEP, fVEP, pERG, and OCT in monitoring patients with GO.
