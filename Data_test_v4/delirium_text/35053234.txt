35053234|t|Towards Mapping of the Human Brain N-Glycome with Standardized Graphitic Carbon Chromatography.
35053234|a|The brain N-glycome is known to be crucial for many biological functions, including its involvement in neuronal diseases. Although large structural studies of brain N-glycans were recently carried out, a comprehensive isomer-specific structural analysis has still not been achieved, as indicated by the recent discovery of novel structures with galactosylated bisecting GlcNAc. Here, we present a detailed, isomer-specific analysis of the human brain N-glycome based on standardized porous graphitic carbon (PGC)-LC-MS/MS. To achieve this goal, we biosynthesized glycans with substitutions typically occurring in the brain N-glycome and acquired their normalized retention times. Comparison of these values with the standardized retention times of neutral and desialylated N-glycan fractions of the human brain led to unambiguous isomer specific assignment of most major peaks. Profound differences in the glycan structures between naturally neutral and desialylated glycans were found. The neutral and sialylated N-glycans derive from diverging biosynthetic pathways and are biosynthetically finished end products, rather than just partially processed intermediates. The focus on structural glycomics defined the structure of human brain N-glycans, amongst these are HNK-1 containing glycans, a bisecting sialyl-lactose and structures with fucose and N-acetylgalactosamine on the same arm, the so-called LDNF epitope often associated with parasitic worms.
