33969245|a|Glufosinate ammonium (GLA) is widely used as a commercial herbicide in many countries. Neurotoxicity of GLA has been associated with serious neurological complications such as loss of consciousness, convulsions, and memory impairment. Late-onset memory impairment due to GLA-induced hippocampal lesions is the most distinct clinical feature in GLA poisoning. However, the lesion of the splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC) is a rare condition in GLA poisoning, so the clinical features are not well known. We report the case of a 57-year-old male patient who developed SCC damage after GLA poisoning. The patient had various late-onset neurotoxic symptoms, including prolonged overall cognitive dysfunction and psychosis-like symptoms. Emergency physicians should be aware that GLA-induced SCC lesions may be associated with various late-onset neurotoxic symptoms.
