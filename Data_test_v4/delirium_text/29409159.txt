29409159|a|BACKGROUND: Unlike other behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, hyperphagia is less recognized among patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The prevalence of hyperphagia varies among studies, but there has been no systematic review or meta-analysis. METHODS: An extensive search on the literature on hyperphagia in AD published between 1 January 1980 and 30 October 2017 was conducted. Data on the prevalence were retrieved. Meta-analysis with a random effect model was performed to determine the pooled estimate of prevalence. Meta-regression analysis was performed based on study characteristics, population demographics, or condition information. RESULTS: Results from 20 studies were extracted. Twenty-six reported cases of hyperphagia were identified. The mean age of onset was 70.7 +- 8.9 years, with a male predominance (68.4%). Hyperphagia occurred in all stages of AD. Only eight studies reported the prevalence of hyperphagia. Meta-analysis showed a pooled prevalence of hyperphagia of 18.6%. Publication bias may have been present. Meta-regression showed that ethnicity accounted for the variance among studies (coefficient: -1.247 (95% confidence interval: -1.978 to -0.516), R2 analogue: 0.77, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Hyperphagia occurs in all stages of AD. In this meta-analysis of eight published studies, the prevalence of hyperphagia was 18.6%. In view of the possible publication bias, a large-scale study on hyperphagia is recommended in the future.
