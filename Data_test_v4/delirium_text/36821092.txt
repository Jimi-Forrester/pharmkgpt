36821092|a|Cognitive deficits are the main outcome of neurological disorders whose occurrence has risen over the past three decades. Although there are some pharmacologic approaches approved for managing neurological disorders, it remains largely ineffective. Hence, exploring novel nature-based nutraceuticals is a pressing need to alleviate the results of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. Some triterpenoids and their derivates can be considered potential therapeutics against neurological disorders due to their neuroprotective and cognitive-improving effects. Betulin (B), betulinic acid (BA), and ursolic acid (UA) are pentacyclic triterpenoid compounds with a variety of biological activities, including antioxidative, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. This review focuses on the therapeutic efficacy and probable molecular mechanisms of triterpenoids in damage prevention to neurons and restoring cognition in neurodegenerative diseases. Considering few studies on this concept, the precise mechanisms that mediate the effect of these compounds in neurodegenerative disorders have remained unknown. The findings can provide sufficient information about the advantages of these compounds against neurodegenerative diseases.
