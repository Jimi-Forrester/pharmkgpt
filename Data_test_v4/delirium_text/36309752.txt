36309752|a|BACKGROUND: People with intellectual disabilities may face a disproportionate risk of experiencing high anticholinergic burden, and its negative sequalae, from a range of medications, and at younger ages than the general population, but there has been little previous study. Our aim was to determine the source of anticholinergic burden from prescribed medication. METHODS: Retrospective matched observational study using record linkage. Adults with (n = 4,305), and without (n = 12,915), intellectual disabilities matched by age-, sex- and neighbourhood deprivation. The main outcome measure was the prescription of long-term (approximately 12 months use) anticholinergic medications overall (classified according to the Anticholinergic Risk Scale [ARS]), by drug class, individual drugs, and polypharmacy. RESULTS: Adults with n = 1,654 (38.4%), and without n = 3,047 (23.6%), intellectual disabilities were prescribed medications long-term with anticholinergic effects. Of those on such drugs, adults with intellectual disabilities were most likely to be on central nervous system (62.6%), gastrointestinal (46.7%), and cardiovascular (28.4%) medications. They were prescribed more central nervous system, gynaecological/urinary tract, musculoskeletal, and respiratory medications, and less cardiovascular, infection, and endocrine medications than their matched comparators. Regardless of age, sex, or neighbourhood deprivation, adults with intellectual disabilities had greater odds of being prescribed antipsychotics (OR = 5.37 [4.40-6.57], p < 0.001), antiepileptics (OR = 2.57 [2.22-2.99], p < 0.001), and anxiolytics/hypnotics (OR = 1.28 [1.06-1.56], p = 0.012). Compared to the general population, adults with intellectual disabilities were more likely to be exposed to overall anticholinergic polypharmacy (OR = 1.48 [1.33-1.66], p < 0.001), and to psychotropic polypharmacy (OR = 2.79 [2.41-3.23], p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Adults with intellectual disabilities are exposed to a greater risk of having very high anticholinergic burden through polypharmacy from several classes of medications, which may be prescribed by several different prescribers. There is a need for evidence-based recommendations specifically about people with intellectual disabilities with multiple physical and mental ill-health conditions to optimise medication use, reduce inappropriate prescribing and adverse anticholinergic effects.
