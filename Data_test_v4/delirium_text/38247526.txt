38247526|t|The Amazonian Camu-Camu Fruit Modulates the Development of Drosophila melanogaster and the Neural Function of Adult Flies under Oxidative Stress Conditions.
38247526|a|Camu-camu (Myrciaria dubia) is known for its antioxidant properties, although little is known about its developmental safety effects, particularly on adult neural function under basal redox and oxidative stress conditions. Therefore, this study sought to address this gap by conducting three complementary protocols using Drosophila melanogaster to investigate these effects. The initial assays revealed that second-stage larvae consumed diets supplemented with various concentrations of camu-camu uniformly, establishing a 50% lethal concentration at 4.799 mg/mL. Hence, non-lethal (0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg/mL) and sub-lethal (5 and 10 mg/mL) concentrations were then chosen to evaluate the effects of camu-camu on preimaginal development and adult neural function. Our observations showed that camu-camu impacts the expression of antioxidant enzymes, reactive species, and lipoperoxidation. Notably, sub-lethal concentrations decreased preimaginal viability and locomotor activity, negatively influenced geotaxis and acetylcholinesterase activity, and increased reactive species, catalase, and glutathione S-transferase activity in flies. Additionally, the protective effects of camu-camu against oxidative stress induced by iron (20 mM) were assessed. Flies supplemented with 0.5 mg/mL of camu-camu during the larval period showed improved neural viability and function, and this supplementation was found to protect against oxidative stress. These findings are instrumental in evaluating the safety and efficacy of commercial supplements based on camu-camu, offering significant insights for future research and application.
