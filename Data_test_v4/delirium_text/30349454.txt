30349454|t|Analysis of Progression Toward Alzheimer's Disease Based on Evolutionary Weighted Random Support Vector Machine Cluster.
30349454|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) could be described into following four stages: healthy control (HC), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), late MCI (LMCI) and AD dementia. The discriminations between different stages of AD are considerably important issues for future pre-dementia treatment. However, it is still challenging to identify LMCI from EMCI because of the subtle changes in imaging which are not noticeable. In addition, there were relatively few studies to make inferences about the brain dynamic changes in the cognitive progression from EMCI to LMCI to AD. Inspired by the above problems, we proposed an advanced approach of evolutionary weighted random support vector machine cluster (EWRSVMC). Where the predictions of numerous weighted SVM classifiers are aggregated for improving the generalization performance. We validated our method in multiple binary classifications using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. As a result, the encouraging accuracy of 90% for EMCI/LMCI and 88.89% for LMCI/AD were achieved respectively, demonstrating the excellent discriminating ability. Furthermore, disease-related brain regions underlying the AD progression could be found out on the basis of the amount of discriminative information. The findings of this study provide considerable insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms in AD development.
