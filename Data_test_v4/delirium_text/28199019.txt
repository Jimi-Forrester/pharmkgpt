28199019|t|The role of drebrin in neurons.
28199019|a|Drebrin is an actin-binding protein that changes the helical pitch of actin filaments (F-actin), and drebrin-decorated F-actin shows slow treadmilling and decreased rate of depolymerization. Moreover, the characteristic morphology of drebrin-decorated F-actin enables it to respond differently to the same signals from other actin cytoskeletons. Drebrin consists of two major isoforms, drebrin E and drebrin A. In the developing brain, drebrin E appears in migrating neurons and accumulates in the growth cones of axons and dendrites. Drebrin E-decorated F-actin links lamellipodium F-actin to microtubules in the growth cones. Then drebrin A appears at nascent synapses and drebrin A-decorated F-actin facilitates postsynaptic molecular assembly. In the adult brain, drebrin A-decorated F-actin is concentrated in the central region of dendritic spines. During long-term potentiation initiation, NMDA receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx induces the transient exodus of drebrin A-decorated F-actin via myosin II ATPase activation. Because of the unique physical characteristics of drebrin A-decorated F-actin, this exodus likely contributes to the facilitation of F-actin polymerization and spine enlargement. Additionally, drebrin reaccumulation in dendritic spines is observed after the exodus. In our drebrin exodus model of structure-based synaptic plasticity, reestablishment of drebrin A-decorated F-actin is necessary to keep the enlarged spine size during long-term potentiation maintenance. In this review, we introduce the genetic and biochemical properties of drebrin and the roles of drebrin in early stage of brain development, synaptic formation and synaptic plasticity. Further, we discuss the pathological relevance of drebrin loss in Alzheimer's disease. This article is part of the mini review series "60th Anniversary of the Japanese Society for Neurochemistry".
