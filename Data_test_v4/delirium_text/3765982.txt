3765982|t|[Effect of biological fluids and brain extracts of persons with Alzheimer's disease on nerve tissue cultures].
3765982|a|Biological fluids (blood serum, cerebrospinal fluid) and brain extract obtained from patients with Alzheimer's disease (6 cases), simple senile dementia (5 cases), and other atrophic processes (1 case) were administered into the nutrient media of human fetal brain tissue culture. It was found that brain tissue extract obtained from patients with Alzheimer's disease stimulated accumulation of filamentous material in neurons while the CSF induced the formation of orderly filamentous rings. The effect of blood serum was characterized by nonspecific manifestations in the form of accumulation of structurally heterogeneous lamellar corpuscles.
