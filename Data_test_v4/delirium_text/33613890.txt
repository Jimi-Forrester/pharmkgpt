33613890|a|INTRODUCTION: Synaptic plasticity is inappropriately affected by neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer Disease (AD). In this study, we examined the effect of intrahippocampal amyloid-beta (Abeta1-40) on dentate gyrus Long-term Potentiation (LTP) and presynaptic short-term plasticity in a rat model of AD. METHODS: The experimental groups in this research included the control with no treatment, sham-operated receiving the vehicle (normal saline), and Abeta-lesioned groups. For modeling AD, aggregated Abeta1-40 (10 mug/2 mul on each side) was injected into the hippocampal CA1. Three weeks later, Population Spike (PS) amplitude and slope ratios were determined at different Inter-pulse Intervals (IPI) of 10, 20, 30, and 50 ms as a valid indicator of the short-term presynaptic facilitation and/or depression. In addition, PS amplitude and slope were taken as an index of long-term synaptic plasticity after application of High-frequency Stimulation (HFS) to induce LTP in the medial perforant-dentate gyrus pathway. RESULTS: No significant differences were noted amongst the experimental groups regarding fEPSP slope and paired-pulse indices as indicators of short-term plasticity. In contrast, fEPSP slope and PS amplitude significantly decreased following the application of HFS in Abeta-injected group. In addition, there was no significant difference between the control and sham-operated groups regarding the mentioned parameters. CONCLUSION: Findings of this study clearly demonstrated that microinjection of Abeta1-40 into the CA1 could impair LTP in dentate gyrus but could not modify short-term plasticity.
