37513218|t|Enhancing Health Benefits through Chlorophylls and Chlorophyll-Rich Agro-Food: A Comprehensive Review.
37513218|a|Chlorophylls play a crucial role in photosynthesis and are abundantly found in green fruits and vegetables that form an integral part of our diet. Although limited, existing studies suggest that these photosynthetic pigments and their derivatives possess therapeutic properties. These bioactive molecules exhibit a wide range of beneficial effects, including antioxidant, antimutagenic, antigenotoxic, anti-cancer, and anti-obesogenic activities. However, it is unfortunate that leafy materials and fruit peels often go to waste in the food supply chain, contributing to the prevailing issue of food waste in modern societies. Nevertheless, these overlooked materials contain valuable bioactive compounds, including chlorophylls, which offer significant health benefits. Consequently, exploring the potential of these discarded resources, such as utilizing them as functional food ingredients, aligns with the principles of a circular economy and presents exciting opportunities for exploitation.
