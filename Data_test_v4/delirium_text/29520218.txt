29520218|t|alpha-Synuclein Heterocomplexes with beta-Amyloid Are Increased in Red Blood Cells of Parkinson's Disease Patients and Correlate with Disease Severity.
29520218|a|Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) are characterized by abnormal accumulation/misfolding of specific proteins, primarily alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn), beta-amyloid1-42 (Abeta1-42) and tau, in both brain and peripheral tissues. In addition to oligomers, the role of the interactions of alpha-syn with Abeta or tau has gradually emerged. Nevertheless, despite intensive research, NDs have no accepted peripheral markers for biochemical diagnosis. In this respect, Red Blood Cells (RBCs) are emerging as a valid peripheral model for the study of aging-related pathologies. Herein, a small cohort (N = 28) of patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) and age-matched controls were enrolled to detect the content of alpha-syn (total and oligomeric), Abeta1-42 and tau (total and phosphorylated) in RBCs. Moreover, the presence of alpha-syn association with tau and Abeta1-42 was explored by co-immunoprecipitation/western blotting in the same cells, and quantitatively confirmed by immunoenzymatic assays. For the first time, PD patients were demonstrated to exhibit alpha-syn heterocomplexes with Abeta1-42 and tau in peripheral tissues; interestingly, alpha-syn-Abeta1-42 concentrations were increased in PD subjects with respect to healthy controls (HC), and directly correlated with disease severity and motor deficits. Moreover, total-alpha-syn levels were decreased in PD subjects and inversely related to their motor deficits. Finally, an increase of oligomeric-alpha-syn and phosphorylated-tau was observed in RBCs of the enrolled patients. The combination of three parameters (total-alpha-syn, phosphorylated-tau and alpha-syn-Abeta1-42 concentrations) provided the best fitting predictive index for discriminating PD patients from controls. Nevertheless further investigations should be required, overall, these data suggest alpha-syn hetero-aggregates in RBCs as a putative tool for the diagnosis of PD.
