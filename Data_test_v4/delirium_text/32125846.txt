32125846|a|Pterostilbene, 3',5'-dimethoxy-4-hydroxystilbene, is a resveratrol analogue and has been reported to have similar and often potent health-promoting properties. Pterostilbene has been shown to reduce weight gain, liver fat, plasma cholesterol, adiposity, inflammatory biomarkers, blood glucose, and other physiological characteristics of metabolic diseases in animal models. Studies on pterostilbene suggest that it may improve risk factors associated with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, fatty liver diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases. Many of the extensive studies on the potential health benefits of pterostilbene were conducted by Dr. Agnes Rimando, a scientist with the United States Department of Agriculture, in collaboration with many U.S. and other international research groups. This review highlights the pterostilbene research of Dr. Rimando.
