33614341|t|Use of Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) Blocks for Postoperative Pain Management in a Patient With an Open Abdomen: A Case Report and Review of Literature.
33614341|a|In light of the superior analgesia and opioid sparing effects provided by transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks, numerous new techniques and applications have evolved. However, TAP blocks are still underutilized in the critical care setting, and PubMed-listed reports on the relevance of TAP integrity for TAP block efficacy are lacking. Here, we report bilateral TAP blocks delivering quick, potent and durable pain relief to a patient with open abdomen (OA) after prior management with opioids and epidural anesthesia had failed. Extending TAP block application to OA patients even in the post-operative setting might hence reduce opioid consumption and quicken reconvalescence.
