12789866|a|This study evaluated length of stay (LOS) associated with atypical antipsychotic monotherapy in inpatients with Alzheimer's disease. In addition to sociodemographic information, data were also obtained on severity of illness, medications, used, patient satisfaction, and hospitalization. Sociodemographics and severity of illness at admission were similar in groups taking olanzapine (N = 66), quetiapine (N = 41), and risperidone (N = 147). The mean LOS for risperidone was significantly shorter than that for quetiapine (12.3 vs. 16.4 days, respectively; P < .02), but the difference between risperidone and olanzapine did not reach statistical significance (12.3 vs. 14.9 days, respectively; P < .08). The savings associated with risperidone versus quetiapine therapy, based on an estimated daily hospital care cost of $492, was $2,017.20 per patient.
