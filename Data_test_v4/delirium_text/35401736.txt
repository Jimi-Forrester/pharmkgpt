35401736|t|Assessment of Mental Workload by Visual Motor Activity among Control Group and Patient Suffering from Depressive Disorder.
35401736|a|Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mood state that is not usually associated with vision problems. Recent research has found that the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA levels in the occipital brain have dropped. Aim. The aim of the research is to evaluate mental workload by single channel electroencephalogram (EEG) approach through visual-motor activity and comparison of parameter among depressive disorder patient and in control group. Method. Two tests of a visual-motor task similar to reflect drawings were performed in this study to compare the visual information processing of patients with depression to that of a placebo group. The current study looks into the accuracy of monitoring cognitive burden with single-channel portable EEG equipment. Results. The alteration of frontal brain movement in reaction to fluctuations in cognitive burden stages generated through various vasomotor function was examined. By applying a computerised oculomotor activity analogous to reflector image diagram, we found that the complexity of the path to be drawn was more important than the real time required accomplishing the job in determining perceived difficulty in depressive disorder patients. The overall perceived difficulty of the exercise is positively linked with EEG activity measured from the motor cortex region at the start of every experiment test. The average rating for task completion for depression patients and in control group observed and no statistical significance association reported between rating scale and time spent on each trial (p=1.43) for control group while the normalised perceived difficulty rating had 0.512, 0.623, and 0.821 correlations with the length of the pathway, the integer of inclination in the pathway, and the time spent to complete every experiment test, respectively (p < 0.0001) among depression patients. The findings imply that alterations in comparative cognitive burden levels during an oculomotor activity considerably modify frontal EEG spectrum. Conclusion. Patients with depression perceived the optical illusion in the arrays as weaker, resulting in a little bigger disparity than individuals who were not diagnosed with depression. This discovery provided light on the prospect of adopting a user-friendly mobile EEG technology to assess mental workload in everyday life.
