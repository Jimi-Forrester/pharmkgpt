32796621|t|Green Route for the Isolation and Purification of Hyrdoxytyrosol, Tyrosol, Oleacein and Oleocanthal from Extra Virgin Olive Oil.
32796621|a|Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) phenols represent a significant part of the intake of antioxidants and bioactive compounds in the Mediterranean diet. In particular, hydroxytyrosol (HTyr), tyrosol (Tyr), and the secoiridoids oleacein and oleocanthal play central roles as anti-inflammatory, neuro-protective and anti-cancer agents. These compounds cannot be easily obtained via chemical synthesis, and their isolation and purification from EVOO is cumbersome. Indeed, both processes involve the use of large volumes of organic solvents, hazardous reagents and several chromatographic steps. In this work we propose a novel optimized procedure for the green extraction, isolation and purification of HTyr, Tyr, oleacein and oleocanthal directly from EVOO, by using a Natural Deep Eutectic Solvent (NaDES) as an extracting phase, coupled with preparative high-performance liquid chromatography. This purification method allows the total recovery of the four components as single pure compounds directly from EVOO, in a rapid, economic and ecologically sustainable way, which utilizes biocompatible reagents and strongly limits the use or generation of hazardous substances.
