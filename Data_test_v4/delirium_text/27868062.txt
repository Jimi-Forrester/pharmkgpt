27868062|t|Apolipoprotein E Gene Variants and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease: A Meta-Analysis.
27868062|a|Objectives. Apo E genes involved in lipoprotein synthesis and metabolism are considered one of the candidates to CHD. However, the results remain conflicting. Methods. We performed this meta-analysis based on 30 published studies including 11,804 CHD patients and 17,713 controls. Results. Compared with the wild genotype E3/3, the variant genotypes ApoEE3/4 and E4/4 were associated with 22% and 45% increased risk of CHD, respectively (E3/4 versus E3/3: OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.15-1.29; E4/4 versus E3/3: OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.23-1.71). Besides, compared with epsilon3 allele, carriers with the epsilon4 allele had a 46% increased risk of CHD (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.28-1.66), while the epsilon2 had no significantly decreased risk of CHD. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, epsilon4 had a 25% increased risk of CHD in Caucasians (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.11-1.41), and the effects were more evident in Mongolians (OR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.89-2.77). The epsilon2 allele had a decreased risk of CHD in Caucasians (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.74-0.96), but not in Mongolians. Conclusions. The analysis suggested that ApoEepsilon4 mutation was associated with the increased risk of CHD, while ApoEepsilon2 allele had a decreased risk of CHD just in Caucasians.
