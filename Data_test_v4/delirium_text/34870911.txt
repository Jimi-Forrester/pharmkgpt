34870911|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of a three-month course of therapy with citicoline, aimed at preventing the progression of cognitive deficit in 1st-degree relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), depending on the carriage of the ApoE4(+) genotype. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Study participants: 82 blood relatives of AD patients, 66 of them with signs of minimal cognitive dysfunction (group 1) objectively confirmed by clinical neuropsychological examination and 16 people with mild cognitive decline syndrome (group 2). Open comparative multidisciplinary study of the dynamics of cognitive status in relatives of AD patients who received a three-month course of citicoline therapy. The baseline indicators of the cognitive functioning of the relatives of the two groups were compared with the indicators at the end of the three-month course of therapy with citicoline in a daily dose of 1000 mg, depending on whether the treated persons had genotypes ApoE4(+) or ApoE4(-). Clinical-psychopathological, neuropsychological, psychometric, molecular-genetic, statistical. RESULTS: An association of the ApoE4(-) genotype with a significantly more pronounced positive effect of the course therapy with citicoline was established according to the general clinical impression (CGI-I scale), indicators of cognitive functioning (MMSE and MoCA scales), as well as according to most psychometric tests (with the exception of the number repetition test in reverse order), as well as for almost all indicators of the neuropsychological <<express method>> (excluding the parameter of the volume of visual memory). CONCLUSION: The results of course therapy with citicoline showed a negative effect of the carriage of the epsilon4 allele of the ApoE gene on the efficiency of treatment of blood relatives of AD patients who had signs of cognitive decline before the start of therapy, which did not reach the level of dementia. The obtained data can serve as the basis for the development of preventive therapeutic measures aimed at preventing the progression of cognitive deficit and the development of dementia in the group at high risk of developing dementia - in 1st degree relatives of AD patients, especially in carriers of the ApoE4(+) genotype.
