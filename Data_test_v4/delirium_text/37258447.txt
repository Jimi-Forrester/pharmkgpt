37258447|a|As a large and heterogeneous group of disorders, neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive loss of structure or function in neurons, finally leading to neuronal death. Neurodegenerative diseases cause serious threat to a patient's quality of life and the most common are Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Currently, little is known of the detailed etiology of these disorders; as such, there are no effective treatments available. Furthermore, the lack of targeted, effective, and resolvable therapy for neurodegenerative diseases, represents an expanding research field for the discovery of new therapeutic strategies. Investigations of the potential pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases will become the basis of preventing the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases and finding effective therapies. Existing theories and mechanisms, such as genetic and environmental factors, abnormal protein accumulation, and oxidative stress, are intricately associated with each other. However, there is no molecular theory that can entirely explain the pathological processes underlying neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the development of experimental technology and the support of multidisciplinary integration, it has been possible to perform more in-depth research on potential targets for neurodegenerative diseases and there have been many exciting discoveries in terms of original theories and underlying mechanisms. With this review, we intend to review the existing literature and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.
