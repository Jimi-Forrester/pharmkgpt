39907462|t|The Prevention and Treatment of Postoperative Delirium in the Elderly: A Narrative Systematic Review of Reviews.
39907462|a|OBJECTIVES: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication after major surgeries, posing significant challenges to patient recovery and outcomes, particularly among the elderly. A narrative systematic review was conducted to assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of interventions aimed at preventing and treating POD. METHODS: A review of the literature from 2017 to September 29, 2023, was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL. Systematic reviews, with or without meta-analyses, as well as practice guidelines, were included. Participants were adults, >=60 years. The methodological quality of included reviews was appraised using AMSTAR 2. RESULTS: After the search strategy identified 2295 references, 36 review studies were selected. Multicomponent interventions, incorporating both pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches, demonstrate promise, particularly in hip fracture patients. Notably, dexmedetomidine emerges as a potential preventive measure, showing a notable reduction in delirium incidence following cardiac surgery. While several pharmacological interventions show potential, evidence remains inconclusive, necessitating further investigation. Similarly, varying anesthesia type and monitoring methods has mixed outcomes on delirium prevention. Despite methodological variations and quality appraisal limitations, this review underscores the importance of multicomponent interventions and the potential efficacy of dexmedetomidine in mitigating POD. Integration of evidence-based protocols into clinical practice is advocated to improve patient outcomes. However, the complex interplay between intervention components calls for further research to optimize delirium management strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The strength of evidence associated with multicomponent interventions and dexmedetomidine use should require a genuine commitment from health care institutions to support their integration into efficient strategies to prevent and treat POD. Ongoing research is vital to uncover their full potential and refine clinical protocols, ultimately enhancing patient care outcomes.
