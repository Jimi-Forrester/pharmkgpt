39427216|t|The role of biophysical cues and their modulated exosomes in dental diseases: from mechanism to therapy.
39427216|a|Dental diseases such as caries and periodontitis have been common public health problems. Dental disease treatment can be achieved through stem cell-based dental regeneration. Biophysical cues determine the fate of stem cells and govern the success of dental regeneration. Some studies have manifested exosomes derived from stem cells could not only inherit biophysical signals in microenvironment but also evade some issues in the treatment with stem cells. Nowadays, biophysical cue-regulated exosomes become another promising therapy in dental regenerative medicine. However, methods to improve the efficacy of exosome therapy and the underlying mechanisms are still unresolved. In this review, the association between biophysical cues and dental diseases was summarized. We retrospected the role of exosomes regulated by biophysical cues in curing dental diseases and promoting dental regeneration. Our research also delved into the mechanisms by which biophysical cues control the biogenesis, release, and uptake of exosomes, as well as potential methods to enhance the effectiveness of exosomes. The aim of this review was to underscore the important place biophysical cue-regulated exosomes occupy in the realm of dentistry, and to explore novel targets for dental diseases.
