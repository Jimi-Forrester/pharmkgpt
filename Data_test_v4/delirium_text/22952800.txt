22952800|a|Intermediate filament (IF) overproduction induces abnormal accumulation of neuronal IF, which is a pathological indicator of some neurodegenerative disorders. In our study, alpha-Internexin- and peripherin-overexpressing PC12 cells (pINT-EGFP and pEGFP-peripherin) were used as models to study neuropathological pathways responsible for neurodegenerative diseases. Microarray data revealed that Cdk5-related genes were downregulated and Cdk5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 3 (GSK-3alpha and GSK-3beta) were upregulated in pINT-EGFP cells. Increased expression of phosphorylated neurofilament and aberrant activation of Cdk5 and GSK-3beta were detected in both pEGFP-peripherin and pINT-EGFP cells by Western blotting. In addition, pharmacological approaches to retaining viability of pINT-EGFP and pEGFP-peripherin cells were examined. Treatment with Cdk5 inhibitor and GSK-3beta inhibitor significantly suppressed neuronal death. Dynamic changes of disaggregation of EGFP-peripherin and decrease in green fluorescence intensity were observed in pEGFP-peripherin and pINT-EGFP cells by confocal microscopy after GSK-3beta inhibitor treatment. We conclude that inhibition of Cdk5 and GSK-3beta suppresses neurofilament phosphorylation, slows down the accumulation of neuronal IF in the cytoplasm, and subsequently avoids damages to cell organelles. The results suggest that suppression of extensive neurofilament phosphorylation may be a potential strategy for ameliorating neuron death. The suppression of hyperphosphorylation of neuronal cytoskeletons with kinase inhibitors could be one of potential therapeutic treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.
