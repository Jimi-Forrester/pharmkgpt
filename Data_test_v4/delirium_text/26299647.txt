26299647|a|In this study, a simple gold nanoparticle (GNP)-based colorimetric assay has been developed for studying the relationship between cell cycle and beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta, the biomarker of Alzheimer's disease [AD]) expression level. It was found that Abeta expression of neuronal cells (e.g., SHG-44 cell line) is strongly dependent on cell cycle phases; that is, the Abeta expression level was highest when cells were arrested in the G1/S phase by thymidine and was lowest when they were arrested in the G2/M phase by nocodazole. This finding may improve the understanding of AD pathology and provide a new tool for anti-dementia drug development.
