9094983|a|Cytokines mediate inflammatory responses through their receptors in the hematopoietic system. In a search for potential mediators of inflammatory responses in Alzheimer's disease, we examined brain for cytokine receptors. Herein we describe interleukin-8 receptor B (IL-8RB, also termed CXCR2) immunoreactivity in the central nervous system. Strong IL-8RB immunoreactivity is present in both Alzheimer's disease and control brains. Neurons, dendrites, and axons are clearly immunoreactive. In Alzheimer's disease, IL-8RB immunoreactivity is also present in some swollen dystrophic neurites of neuritic plaques. Double staining and confocal microscopic analysis reveals that these IL-8RB-positive neurites in plaques are neurofilament positive and are distinct from astrocytic or microglial processes. In general, these IL-8RB-positive neurities do not co-localize with PHF-1 or AT8 (hyperphosphorylated tau) immunoreactive neurites but instead co-localize with beta PP-positive neurites. These results demonstrate for the first time IL-8RB immunoreactivity in the central nervous system and imply a new role for this receptor outside the hematopoietic system. The strong presence of IL-8RB on neurons and the potential of glial cells to produce IL-8 suggest that this system might mediate neuronal-glial interactions.
