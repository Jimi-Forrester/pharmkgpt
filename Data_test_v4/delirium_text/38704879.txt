38704879|t|The incidence of neurological complications in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 ICU patients: An observational single-center cohort study in three COVID-19 periods.
38704879|a|BACKGROUND: Neurological complications in COVID-19 patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) have been previously reported. As the pandemic progressed, therapeutic strategies were tailored to new insights. This study describes the incidence, outcome, and types of reported neurological complications in invasively mechanically ventilated (IMV) COVID-19 patients in relation to three periods during the pandemic. METHODS: IMV COVID-19 ICU patients from the Dutch Maastricht Intensive Care COVID (MaastrICCht) cohort were included in a single-center study (March 2020 - October 2021). Demographic, clinical, and follow-up data were collected. Electronic medical records were screened for neurological complications during hospitalization. Three distinct periods (P1, P2, P3) were defined, corresponding to periods with high hospitalization rates. ICU survivors with and without reported neurological complications were compared in an exploratory analysis. RESULTS: IMV COVID-19 ICU patients (n=324; median age 64 [IQR 57-72] years; 238 males (73.5%)) were stratified into P1 (n=94), P2 (n=138), and P3 (n=92). ICU mortality did not significantly change over time (P1=38.3%; P2=41.3%; P3=37.0%; p=.787). The incidence of reported neurological complications during ICU admission gradually decreased over the periods (P1=29.8%; P2=24.6%; P3=18.5%; p=.028). Encephalopathy/delirium (48/324 (14.8%)) and ICU-acquired weakness (32/324 (9.9%)) were most frequently reported and associated with ICU treatment intensity. ICU survivors with neurological complications (n=53) were older (p=.025), predominantly male (p=.037), and had a longer duration of IMV (p<.001) and ICU stay (p<.001), compared to survivors without neurological complications (n=132). A multivariable analysis revealed that only age was independently associated with the occurrence of neurological complications (ORadj=1.0541; 95% CI=1.0171-1.0925; p=.004). Health-related quality-of-life at follow-up was not significantly different between survivors with and without neurological complications (n = 82, p=.054). CONCLUSIONS: A high but decreasing incidence of neurological complications was reported during three consecutive COVID-19 periods in IMV COVID-19 patients. Neurological complications were related to the intensity of ICU support and treatment, and associated with prolonged ICU stay, but did not lead to significantly worse reported health-related quality-of-life at follow-up.
