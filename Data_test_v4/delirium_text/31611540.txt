31611540|t|The Space between the Pial Sheath and the Cortical Venous Wall May Connect to the Meningeal Lymphatics.
31611540|a|We currently obtain pre- and post-contrast enhanced whole brain 3D-real inversion recovery images for the evaluation of endolymphatic hydrops. We noticed that the space between the pial sheath surrounding the cortical veins and the cortical venous wall is enhanced and this enhancement seems to connect to the meningeal lymphatics along superior sagittal sinus. This new anatomical concept regarding the outflow from the glymphatic system might be important for the future research in neuroscience.
