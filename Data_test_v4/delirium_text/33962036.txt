33962036|t|Mitochondrial dysfunction: A potential target for Alzheimer's disease intervention and treatment.
33962036|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative brain disorder which manifests as a progressive decline in cognitive function. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in the early stages of AD, and advances the progression of this age-related neurodegenerative disorder. Therefore, it can be a potential target for interventions to treat AD. Several therapeutic strategies to target mitochondrial dysfunction have gained significant attention in the preclinical stage, but the clinical trials performed to date have shown little progress. Thus, we discuss the mechanisms and strategies of different therapeutic agents for targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. We hope that this review will inspire and guide the development of efficient AD drugs in the future.
