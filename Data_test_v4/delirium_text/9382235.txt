9382235|t|[The epidural use of morphine and alpha 2-agonists for postoperative analgesia].
9382235|a|Three protocols of postoperative pain relief after gastric surgery were used in 60 male patients: regular intramuscular morphine, epidural morphine, and epidural morphine with 0.1 mg of clonidine. Pain relief was more effective with the epidural route of administration. Addition of clonidine in a daily dose of 0.1 mg allowed a twofold decrease of epidural morphine dose, involving lesser hyperdynamic postoperative cardiovascular changes and complete elimination of psychotic complications and delirium in alcohol-dependent patients.
