39030649|a|BACKGROUND: Despite urban (domestic dog) rabies cycles being the main target for rabies elimination by 2030, sylvatic (wildlife) rabies cycles can act as rabies spillovers especially in settlements contiguous to wildlife reserves. Rural communities next to wildlife reserves are characterized by unique socio-demographic and cultural practices including bat consumption, hunting for bushmeat, and non-vaccination of hunting dogs against rabies among others. This study aimed to compare the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) related to rabies transmission and prevention in the three districts of Uganda; (1) Nwoya, neighboring Murchison Falls National Park (MFNP) in the north, (2) Kamwenge neighboring Kibaale National Park (KNP), Queen Elizabeth National Park (QENP) and Katonga Game Reserve (KGR) in the west, and (3) Bukedea, neighboring Pian Upe Game Reserve (PUGR) in the east of Uganda. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in settlements contiguous to these wildlife reserves. Using a semi-structured questionnaire, data were collected from 843 households owning dogs and livestock. Data were collected between the months of January and April 2023. Stratified univariate analyses by district were carried out using the Chi-square test for independence and Fisher's exact test to compare KAPs in the three study districts. RESULTS: The median age of study participants was 42 years (Q1, Q3 = 30, 52) with males comprising the majority (67%, n = 562). The key findings revealed that participants from the Nwoya district in the north (MFNP) had little knowledge about rabies epidemiology (8.5%, n = 25), only 64% (n = 187) of them knew its signs and symptoms such as a rabid dog presenting with aggressiveness and showed negative attitudes towards prevention measures (15.3%, n = 45). Participants in the Kamwenge district-west (KNP, QENP, and KGR) had little knowledge and negative attitude towards wildlife-human interaction pertaining to rabies transmission and prevention especially those with no or primary level of education (20.9%, n = 27) while participants from Bukedea in the east (PUGR) had remarkedly poor practices towards rabies transmission, prevention, and control (37.8%, n = 114). CONCLUSIONS: Rabies from sylvatic cycles remains a neglected public health threat in rural communities surrounding national parks and game reserves in Uganda. Our study findings highlight key gaps in knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to rabies transmission and prevention among such communities. Communication and action between veterinary services, wildlife authority, public health teams, social science and community leaders through available community platforms is key in addressing rabies among the sympatric at-risk communities in Uganda.
