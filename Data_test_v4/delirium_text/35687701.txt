35687701|t|Phenylpropanoids on the Inhibition of beta-Amyloid Aggregation and the Movement of These Molecules through the POPC Lipid Bilayer.
35687701|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), caused by Abeta aggregation, is a major concern in medical research. It is a neurodegenerative disorder, leading to a loss of cognitive abilities, which is still claiming the lives of many people all over the world. This poses a challenge before the scientific community to discover effective drugs which can prevent such toxic aggregation. Recent experimental findings suggest the potency of two naturally-occurring phenylpropanoids, Schizotenuin A (SCH) and Lycopic Acid B (LAB) which can effectively combat the deleterious effects of Abeta aggregation, although nothing is known about their mechanism of inhibition. In this work, we deal with an extensive computational study on the inhibitory effects of these inhibitors by using an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation to interpret the underlying mechanism of their inhibitory processes. A series of investigations is carried out while studying the various structural and conformational changes of the peptide chains in the absence and presence of inhibitors. To investigate the details of the interactions between the peptide residues and inhibitors, nonbonding energy calculations, the radial distribution function, the coordination number of water and inhibitor molecules around the peptide residues, and hydrogen-bonding interactions are calculated. The potential of mean force (PMF) is calculated to estimate aggregate formation from their free-energy profiles. It is seen that the hydrophobic core of the KLVFFAE undergoes aggregation and that these inhibitors show great promise in preventing the onset of AD in the future by preventing Abeta aggregation. Also, the translocation studies on these inhibitors through a model POPC lipid bilayer shed light on their permeation properties and biocompatibility.
