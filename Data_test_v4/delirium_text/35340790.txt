35340790|a|Phenolic compounds derived from olive oil have beneficial health properties against cancer, neurodegenerative, and metabolic diseases. Therefore, there are discrepancies in their impact on mitochondrial function that result in changes in oxidative capacity, mitochondrial respiration, and energetic demands. This review focuses on the versatile role of oleuropein, a potent antioxidant that regulates the AMPK/SIRT1/mTOR pathway to modulate autophagy/mitophagy and maintain metabolic homeostasis.
