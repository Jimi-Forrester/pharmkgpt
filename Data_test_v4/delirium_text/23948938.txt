23948938|a|Cerebral clearance of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), which is implicated in Alzheimer's disease, involves elimination across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and we previously showed that an insulin-sensitive process is involved in the case of Abeta1-40. The purpose of this study was to clarify the molecular mechanism of the insulin-sensitive Abeta1-40 elimination across mouse BBB. An in vivo cerebral microinjection study demonstrated that [125I]hAbeta1-40 elimination from mouse brain was inhibited by human natriuretic peptide (hANP), and [125I]hANP elimination was inhibited by hAbeta1-40, suggesting that hAbeta1-40 and hANP share a common elimination process. Internalization of [125I]hAbeta1-40 into cultured mouse brain capillary endothelial cells (TM-BBB4) was significantly inhibited by either insulin, hANP, other natriuretic peptides or insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) inhibitors, but was not inhibited by phosphoramidon or thiorphan. Although we have reported the involvement of natriuretic peptide receptor C (Npr-C) in hANP internalization, cells stably expressing Npr-C internalized [125I]hANP but not [125I]hAbeta1-40, suggesting that there is no direct interaction between Npr-C and hAbeta1-40. IDE was detected in plasma membrane of TM-BBB4 cells, and internalization of [125I]hAbeta1-40 by TM-BBB4 cells was reduced by IDE-targeted siRNAs. We conclude that elimination of hAbeta1-40 from mouse brain across the BBB involves an insulin- and ANP-sensitive process, mediated by IDE expressed in brain capillary endothelial cells.
