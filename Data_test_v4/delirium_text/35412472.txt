35412472|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of the additional use of early neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) on an early mobilization (EM) protocol. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: ICU of the Clinical Hospital of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. PATIENTS: One hundred and thirty-nine consecutive mechanically ventilated patients were included in the first 48 hours of ICU admission. INTERVENTIONS: The patients were divided into two groups: EM and EM+NMES. Both groups received EM daily. In the EM+NMES group, patients additionally received NMES 5 days a week, for 60 minutes, starting in the first 48 hours of ICU admission until ICU discharge. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Functional status, muscle strength, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), frequency of delirium, days on mechanical ventilation, mortality, and quality of life were assessed. Patients in the EM+NMES group presented a significant higher score of functional status measured by the Functional Status Score for the ICU scale when compared with the EM group in the first day awake: 22 (15-26) versus 12 (8-22) (p = 0.019); at ICU discharge: 28 (21-33) versus 18 (11-26) (p = 0.004); and hospital discharge: 33 (27-35) versus 25 (17-33) (p = 0.014), respectively. They also had better functional status measured by the Physical Function Test in the ICU scale, took less days to stand up during the ICU stay, and had a significant shorter hospital LOS, lower frequency of ICU-acquired weakness, and better global muscle strength. CONCLUSIONS: The additional application of early NMES promoted better functional status outcomes on the first day awake and at ICU and hospital discharge. The patients in the EM+NMES group also took fewer days to stand up and had shorter hospital LOS, lower frequency of ICU-acquired weakness, and better muscle strength. Future studies are still necessary to clarify the effects of therapies associated with EM, especially to assess long-term outcomes.
