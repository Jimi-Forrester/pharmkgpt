38103074|t|Gut-Brain Axis Deregulation and Its Possible Contribution to Neurodegenerative Disorders.
38103074|a|The gut-brain axis is an essential communication pathway between the central nervous system (CNS) and the gastrointestinal tract. The human microbiota is composed of a diverse and abundant microbial community that compasses more than 100 trillion microorganisms that participate in relevant physiological functions such as host nutrient metabolism, structural integrity, maintenance of the gut mucosal barrier, and immunomodulation. Recent evidence in animal models has been instrumental in demonstrating the possible role of the microbiota in neurodevelopment, neuroinflammation, and behavior. Furthermore, clinical studies suggested that adverse changes in the microbiota can be considered a susceptibility factor for neurological disorders (NDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In this review, we will discuss evidence describing the role of gut microbes in health and disease as a relevant risk factor in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, including AD, PD, HD, and ALS.
