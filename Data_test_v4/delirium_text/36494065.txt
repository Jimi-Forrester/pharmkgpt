36494065|t|Consultation-Liaison Case Conference: Suicidal Ideation in a Patient at the End-of-Life.
36494065|a|Psychiatric comorbidities are common among patients approaching the end of life, often necessitating the involvement of consultation-liaison psychiatrists. We present the case of a patient with advanced metastatic prostate cancer and a complicated hospital course who made suicidal remarks and requested a hastened death. This common and challenging clinical scenario requires a multidisciplinary approach. In this article, experts in consultation psychiatry, palliative care, and psycho-oncology describe helpful diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for such cases. The key learning points are the differential diagnoses in end-of-life patients endorsing suicidal ideation, the psychiatric management of oncological and palliative care patients, the implementation of a safe discharge plan, and the role of the consultation-liaison psychiatrist in hospice care.
