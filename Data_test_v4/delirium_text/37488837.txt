37488837|t|Adult neurogenesis: a real hope or a delusion?
37488837|a|Adult neurogenesis, the process of creating new neurons, involves the coordinated division, migration, and differentiation of neural stem cells. This process is restricted to neurogenic niches located in two distinct areas of the brain: the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle, where new neurons are generated and then migrate to the olfactory bulb. Neurogenesis has been thought to occur only during the embryonic and early postnatal stages and to decline with age due to a continuous depletion of neural stem cells. Interestingly, recent years have seen tremendous progress in our understanding of adult brain neurogenesis, bridging the knowledge gap between embryonic and adult neurogenesis. Here, we discuss the current status of adult brain neurogenesis in light of what we know about neural stem cells. In this notion, we talk about the importance of intracellular signaling molecules in mobilizing endogenous neural stem cell proliferation. Based on the current understanding, we can declare that these molecules play a role in targeting neurogenesis in the mature brain. However, to achieve this goal, we need to avoid the undesired proliferation of neural stem cells by controlling the necessary checkpoints, which can lead to tumorigenesis and prove to be a curse instead of a blessing or hope.
