35454108|t|A Structural Perspective on Calprotectin as a Ligand of Receptors Mediating Inflammation and Potential Drug Target.
35454108|a|Calprotectin, a heterodimer of S100A8 and S100A9 EF-hand calcium-binding proteins, is an integral part of the innate immune response. Calprotectin (CP) serves as a ligand for several pattern recognition cell surface receptors including the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and cluster of differentiation 33 (CD33). The receptors initiate kinase signaling cascades that activate inflammation through the NF-kB pathway. Receptor activation by CP leads to upregulation of both receptor and ligand, a positive feedback loop associated with specific chronic inflammatory syndromes. Hence, CP and its two constituent homodimers have been viewed as potential targets to suppress certain chronic inflammation pathologies. A variety of inhibitors of CP and other S100 proteins have been investigated for more than 30 years, but no candidates have advanced significantly into clinical trials. Here, current knowledge of the interactions of CP with its receptors is reviewed along with recent progress towards the development of CP-directed chemotherapeutics.
