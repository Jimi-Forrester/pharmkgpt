35067701|a|OBJECTIVES: The co-occurrence of multiple medical or psycho-social conditions (geriatric syndromes (GS) and age-related diseases) is a growing concern in older people. Given the diversity of these conditions and their complex interactions, our aim was to determine whether they could be structured into synthetic dimensions in order to facilitate the management of multimorbidity. DESIGN: The underlying structure of 10 GSs and 8 age-related diseases was identified using a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), and confronted to subjective and objective health outcomes. SETTING: community residents from Bordeaux City (France) older than 75 years in 2010. PARTICIPANTS: 630 adults aged 75+ years who lived in Bordeaux and participated in the 10-year follow-up of the Three-City study. MEASUREMENTS: GSs included physical frailty, cognitive impairment and dementia, dependency, depressive symptoms, polymedication, thinness, falls, sensory deficit, social isolation, incontinence. Age-related diseases were cancer, cardiac diseases, peripheral vascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension, pulmonary diseases, osteoporosis, other chronic diseases. Association of the MCA-derived independent dimensions was assessed with 10-year visit subjective health and well-being, and with incident death and entry into institution during the remaining cohort follow-up. RESULTS: Most of the participants (82%) had at least two age-related syndromes or diseases. The MCA structured the 18 conditions into three major dimensions: Degradation (D) driven by GS, Vascular (V), and Psychosocial (P) representing 68.7%, 7.4%, and 5.7% of the total variance, respectively. Dimension D was a strong predictor of future death and institutionalization. Dimensions D and P were strongly associated with current well-being. CONCLUSIONS: This work confirmed that multimorbidity is very common among older adults, and demonstrated the essential role of GS as manifestations of aging, even more than age-related diseases.
