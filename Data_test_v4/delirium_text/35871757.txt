35871757|a|Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) treatment has revolutionized the landscape of cancer therapy with significant efficacy on hematologic malignancy, especially in relapsed and refractory B cell malignancies. However, unexpected serious toxicities such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) still hamper its broad application. Clinical trials using CAR-T cells targeting specific antigens on tumor cell surface have provided valuable information about the characteristics of ICANS. With unclear mechanism of ICANS after CAR-T treatment, unremitting efforts have been devoted to further exploration. Clinical findings from patients with ICANS strongly indicated existence of overactivated peripheral immune response followed by endothelial activation-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, which triggers subsequent central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and neurotoxicity. Several animal models have been built but failed to fully replicate the whole spectrum of ICANS in human. Hopefully, novel and powerful technologies like single-cell analysis may help decipher the precise cellular response within CNS from a different perspective when ICANS happens. Moreover, multidisciplinary cooperation among the subjects of immunology, hematology, and neurology will facilitate better understanding about the complex immune interaction between the peripheral, protective barriers, and CNS in ICANS. This review elaborates recent findings about ICANS after CAR-T treatment from bed to bench, and discusses the potential cellular and molecular mechanisms that may promote effective management in the future.
