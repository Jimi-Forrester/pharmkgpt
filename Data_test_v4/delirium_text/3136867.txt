3136867|t|[Alzheimer's disease: study of the distribution of tau proteins constituting helical filament pairs in human central nervous tissue].
3136867|a|Tau proteins are the major components of Paired Helical Filaments (PHF) of Alzheimer's disease. Using the immunoblot technique and an antiserum against PHF, we have studied the distribution of Tau proteins in the different areas of normal human brains and Alzheimer brains. Tau proteins were clearly present in cortical grey matter but were difficult to detect in the white matter. In Alzheimer brains, we observed two differences: first, there is an important background due to the partial dissociation of the lesions containing Tau aggregates. Second, the profile of Tau proteins is modified, due to abnormal phosphorylation. Thus, Tau proteins are found in large amounts in the grey matter of the cortical areas and are not exclusively distributed in the axonal domain. The normal cortical distribution of Tau in the human brain correlates well with the distribution of histological lesions that contain PHF (neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques) in the Alzheimer cortex.
