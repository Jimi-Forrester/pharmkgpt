38186957|t|A comprehensive research setup for monitoring Alzheimer's disease using EEG, fNIRS, and Gait analysis.
38186957|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a detrimental impact on brain function, affecting various aspects such as cognition, memory, language, and motor skills. Previous research has dominantly used electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to individually measure brain signals or combine the two methods to target specific brain functions. However, comprehending Alzheimer's disease requires monitoring various brain functions rather than focusing on a single function. This paper presents a comprehensive research setup for a monitoring platform for AD. The platform incorporates a 32-channel dry electrode EEG, a custom-built four-channel fNIRS, and gait monitoring using a depth camera and pressure sensor. Various tasks are employed to target multiple brain functions. The paper introduced the detailed instrumentation of the fNIRS system, which measures the prefrontal cortex, outlines the experimental design targeting various brain functioning programmed in BCI2000 for visualizing EEG signals synchronized with experimental stimulation, and describes the gait monitoring hardware and software and protocol design. The ultimate goal of this platform is to develop an easy-to-perform brain and gait monitoring method for elderly individuals and patients with Alzheimer's disease.
