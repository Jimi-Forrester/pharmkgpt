34639631|t|Green Line Hospital-Territory Study: A Single-Blind Randomized Clinical Trial for Evaluation of Technological Challenges of Continuous Wireless Monitoring in Internal Medicine, Preliminary Results.
34639631|a|BACKGROUND: Wireless vital parameter continuous monitoring (WVPCM) after discharge is compared to regular monitoring to provide data on the clinical-economic impact of complex patients (CPs) discharged from Internal Medicine Units of Ospedale dei Castelli, Lazio. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Major complications (MC) reduction. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Patients who reached discharge criteria within the 7th day from admission; difference in MC incidence at the conclusion of the standard telemonitoring/clinical monitoring phase, 5 and 30 days after discharge; and conditions predisposing to MC occurrence. METHODS: Open label randomized controlled trial with wearable wireless system that creates alerts on portable devices. Continuous glycemic monitoring is performed for patients with diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: There were 110 patients enrolled (mean age: 76.2 years). Comorbidity: Cumulative Illness Rating Scale CIRS-CI (comorbidities index): 3.93, CIRS SI (severity index): 1.93. About 19% scored a BRASS (Blaylock Risk Assessment Screening Score) >=20 indicating need for discharge planning requiring step-down care. Globally, 48% of patients in the control group had major complications (27 out of 56 patients), in contrast to 22% in the intervention group (12 out of 54 patients). CONCLUSIONS: Since WVPCM detects early complications during the post-discharge CPs monitoring, it increases safety and reduces inappropriate access to the Emergency Room, preventing avoidable re-hospitalizations.
