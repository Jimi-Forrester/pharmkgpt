19752506|t|Prognostic factors in stage D heart failure in the very elderly.
19752506|a|BACKGROUND: The clinical characteristics of frail older patients with advanced heart failure have scarcely been studied. OBJECTIVE: To describe this population and to identify some prognostic factors of mortality. METHODS: 104 patients aged 75 years and older hospitalized with refractory heart failure were enrolled in a prospective multicentric study. RESULTS: Mean age was 87.2 +/- 5.3 years. Dyspnea (79.8%), crepitant rales (76.9%) and peripheral edema (73.1%) were particularly frequent. Signs of low cardiac output such as renal insufficiency (46.9%), cutaneous low flow (40.4%), and systolic hypotension (< or =100 mm Hg) (24.3%) were observed less often. Signs of cognitive impairment including anxiety (55.4%), sleep disorders (43.7%) and delirium (35.5%) were frequent. Asthenia and chronic pain were noted in 92.3 and 37.5% of cases, respectively. Mortality rates were 32.7, 59.6 and 71.2% during hospitalization, at 6 months and at 12 months, respectively. According to the multivariate Cox model, six significant factors suggesting a poor prognosis were observed: chronic renal insufficiency, past neuropsychological pathology, long-term treatment with nitrates, presence of edema, low cutaneous flow, and pain. The ability to sit on a chair was the only significant factor associated with a good prognosis. CONCLUSION: Our study identified some clinical and prognostic factors which had been observed in very old patients with refractory heart failure. Pain management has to be a priority in these patients in order to improve their quality of life.
