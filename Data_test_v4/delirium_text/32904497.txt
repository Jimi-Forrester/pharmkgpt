32904497|t|Delirium in Older People with COVID-19: Clinical Scenario and Literature Review.
32904497|a|Delirium is a potentially fatal acute brain dysfunction that is characterised by inattention and fluctuating mental changes. It is indicative of an acute serious organ failure or acute infection. Delirium is also associated with undesirable health outcomes that include prolonged hospital stay, long-term cognitive decline and increased mortality. The new SARS-CoV-2 shows, not only pulmonary tropism but also, neurotropism which results in delirium in the acute phase illness particularly in the older age groups. The current assessment for COVID-19 in older people does not routinely include screening for delirium. Implementation of a rapid delirium screening tool is necessary because, without screening, up to 75% of cases can be missed. Delirium can also be exaggerated by health care policies that recommend social isolation and wearing personal protective equipment in addition to less interaction with patients. Non-pharmacological intervention for delirium prevention and management may be helpful if implemented as early and as often as possible in hospitalised older people with COVID-19. A holistic approach that includes psychological support in addition to medical care is needed for older people admitted to hospital with COVID-19.
