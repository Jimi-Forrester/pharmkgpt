34630391|t|Brain Versus Blood: A Systematic Review on the Concordance Between Peripheral and Central Kynurenine Pathway Measures in Psychiatric Disorders.
34630391|a|Objective: Disturbances in the kynurenine pathway have been implicated in the pathophysiology of psychotic and mood disorders, as well as several other psychiatric illnesses. It remains uncertain however to what extent metabolite levels detectable in plasma or serum reflect brain kynurenine metabolism and other disease-specific pathophysiological changes. The primary objective of this systematic review was to investigate the concordance between peripheral and central (CSF or brain tissue) kynurenine metabolites. As secondary aims we describe their correlation with illness course, treatment response, and neuroanatomical abnormalities in psychiatric diseases. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search until February 2021 in PubMed. We included 27 original research articles describing a correlation between peripheral and central kynurenine metabolite measures in preclinical studies and human samples from patients suffering from neuropsychiatric disorders and other conditions. We also included 32 articles reporting associations between peripheral KP markers and symptom severity, CNS pathology or treatment response in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder. Results: For kynurenine and 3-hydroxykynurenine, moderate to strong concordance was found between peripheral and central concentrations not only in psychiatric disorders, but also in other (patho)physiological conditions. Despite discordant findings for other metabolites (mainly tryptophan and kynurenic acid), blood metabolite levels were associated with clinical symptoms and treatment response in psychiatric patients, as well as with observed neuroanatomical abnormalities and glial activity. Conclusion: Only kynurenine and 3-hydroxykynurenine demonstrated a consistent and reliable concordance between peripheral and central measures. Evidence from psychiatric studies on kynurenine pathway concordance is scarce, and more research is needed to determine the validity of peripheral kynurenine metabolite assessment as proxy markers for CNS processes. Peripheral kynurenine and 3-hydroxykynurenine may nonetheless represent valuable predictive and prognostic biomarker candidates for psychiatric disorders.
