9777922|t|Combination therapy for early Alzheimer's disease: what are we waiting for?
9777922|a|The practical pharmacological approaches currently available to palliate the cognitive and functional losses in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) include cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI), antioxidants (e.g., vitamin E), anti-inflammatory agents, estrogen, seligiline, vasoactive agents, and ginkgo biloba. Reviewing available data on these therapies and using models from medical illnesses such as cancer and hypertension, we highlight the urgent need for evaluating combination therapies in early AD.
