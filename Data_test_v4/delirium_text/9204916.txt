9204916|t|Thrombin induces apoptosis in cultured neurons and astrocytes via a pathway requiring tyrosine kinase and RhoA activities.
9204916|a|Thrombin activity is a factor in acute CNS trauma and may contribute to such chronic neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer's disease. Thrombin is a multifunctional serine protease that catalyses the final steps in blood coagulation. However, increasing evidence indicates that thrombin also elicits a variety of cellular and inflammatory responses, including responses from neural cells. Most recently, high concentrations of thrombin were shown to cause cell death in both astrocyte and hippocampal neuron cultures. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanisms underlying thrombin-induced cell death. Our data show that thrombin appears to cause apoptosis as evidenced by cleavage of DNA into oligonucleosomal-sized fragments, fragmentation of nuclei, and prevention of death by inhibition of protein synthesis. Synthetic peptides that directly activate the thrombin receptor also induced apoptosis, indicating that thrombin-induced cell death occurred via activation of the thrombin receptor. The signal transduction cascade involves tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases and an intact actin cytoskeleton. Additional study revealed the involvement of the small GTP-binding protein RhoA. Thrombin induced RhoA activity in both astrocytes and hippocampal neurons, and inhibition of RhoA activity with exoenzyme C3 attenuated cell death, indicating that thrombin activation of RhoA was necessary for thrombin-induced cell death. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors blocked thrombin induction of RhoA, indicating that tyrosine kinase activity was required upstream of RhoA. These data suggest a sequential linkage of cellular events from which we propose a model for the second messenger cascade induced by thrombin in neural cells that can lead to apoptosis.
