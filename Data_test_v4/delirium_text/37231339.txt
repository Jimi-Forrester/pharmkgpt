37231339|t|Scedosporium infection disseminated "from toe to head" in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipient: a case report.
37231339|a|BACKGROUND: Scedosporium is a lesser-known non-Aspergillus genus of mold that can present in unsuspecting ways. If overlooked, it may disseminate and cause high mortality in high-risk allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients. CASE PRESENTATION: This case report describes a 65-year-old patient with Acute Myeloid Leukemia who underwent an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant after a period of prolonged neutropenia with fluconazole prophylaxis. She suffered severe debility with altered mentation from a S. apiospermum infection which likely disseminated from a toe wound to the lung and central nervous system. She was successfully treated with liposomal amphotericin B and voriconazole, but faced a prolonged recovery from physical and neurologic sequela. CONCLUSIONS: The case highlights the importance of adequate anti-mold prophylaxis in high-risk patients, and the value of a thorough physical examination in this patient population, with particular attention to skin and soft tissue findings.
