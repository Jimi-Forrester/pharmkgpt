38607204|t|Significance Analysis of the Improvement in Postoperative Recovery of Cardiac Surgery Patients Based on the Graded Management Established Using the Delirium Prediction Model.
38607204|a|Objective: To investigate the impact of graded management based on delirium prediction modeling on the improvement of recovery of cardiac surgery patients. Methods: Three hundred and twenty patients admitted to the Department of Critical Care Medicine of Nanjing Hospital affiliated with Nanjing Medical University from June 2021 to December 2023 after Type A aortic coarctation were selected as study subjects. They were grouped according to the randomized scale method and divided into 160 cases in each the control group and the observation group. In the control group, conventional nursing measures were adopted, and in the observation group, graded nursing interventions were carried out according to the established delirium risk prediction model. Comparison between the two groups in terms of the intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring time, hospitalization time, duration of delirium, and delirium incidence, and investigated nursing satisfaction, and quality of care scores. Results: Compared with the control group, the observation group's ICU custody time, hospitalization time, and delirium duration, decreased, and the quality of care, and satisfaction increased (P < .05). At the same time, the incidence of delirium in the observation group was also lower than that in the control group (P < .05). Conclusion: The graded management based on the delirium prediction model can effectively reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium in critically ill patients with Type A aortic coarctation, and at the same time improve patient satisfaction and quality of care.
