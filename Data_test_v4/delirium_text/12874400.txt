12874400|a|BACKGROUND: The neurodegenerative process in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in the Lewy body variant of AD (LBV) patients is characterized by cholinergic dysfunction and deposition of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) 1-40 and 1-42; however, the differential effects of Abeta species on the cholinergic system are not completely clear. OBJECTIVE: To better understand the relationship between levels of Abeta1-40 and 1-42 on cholinergic deficits in AD and LBV patients. METHODS: Levels of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and ChAT immunoreactivity in the plaques in the frontal cortex of patients with AD and LBV were correlated with Abeta1-42 and 1-40 levels determined by ELISA and with neuropathologic and neurologic markers. RESULTS: Although the overall levels of ChAT activity were reduced in AD and LBV cases, there was a direct correlation with Abeta1-42 levels. Furthermore, patients with high Abeta1-42 levels had more abundant cholinergic dystrophic neurites in the plaques than cases with lower Abeta1-42. CONCLUSION: Abeta1-42 may also trigger cholinergic dysfunction by promoting aberrant neuritic sprouting.
