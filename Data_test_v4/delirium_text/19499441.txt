19499441|t|Factors determining nurses' clinical judgments about hospitalized elderly patients with acute confusion.
19499441|a|Acute confusion(AC)/delirium is a common clinical phenomenon in hospitalized elders that is often overlooked or misdiagnosed by nurses of various cultural backgrounds. The aim of this study was to better understand factors affecting nurses' clinical judgments regarding the detection of AC in elderly Taiwanese patients. Nurses from two hospitals in Taiwan (n = 654, response rate = 71.3%) participated in the study. A two-level hierarchical linear model analysis was used to examine the data. The characteristics of patients explained the most variance of the model (86.2%), with characteristics of nurse participants and their health organizations accounting for 13.8% of the variance. Patient characteristics of age, infection, hydration, and hypoactive subtypes of AC, as well as a nurse's strong belief in traditional Chinese values, such as respect for elders, hard work, modesty, noncompetitiveness, and respect for tradition, were positively associated with difficulty detecting acute confusion. Findings of this study indicated that the accuracy of nurses' clinical judgments in detecting AC were most related to characteristics of patients.
