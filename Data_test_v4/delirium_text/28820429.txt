28820429|t|Propofol's Effects on the Fetal Brain for Non-Obstetric Surgery.
28820429|a|While the use of Propofol has been increasing in usage for general surgical procedures since its release to market, there has been little work done on its potential link to neurotoxicity in humans. Only recently, following the release of a warning label from the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) regarding a potential link to "neurotoxicity" in the neonate, did the surgical and anesthesiology communities become more aware of its potential for harm. Given the widespread use of this drug in clinical practice, the warning label naturally raised controversy regarding intrapartum Propofol usage. While intended to generate further studies, the lack of a viable anesthetic alternative raises issues regarding its current usage for surgical procedures in pregnant women. To answer the question whether current evidence is supportive of Propofol usage at its current levels in pregnant women, this review summarizes available evidence of fetal Propofol exposure in animal studies.
