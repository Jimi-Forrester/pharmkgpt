38612763|t|Overexpression of miR-25 Downregulates the Expression of ROBO2 in Idiopathic Intellectual Disability.
38612763|a|Idiopathic intellectual disability (IID) encompasses the cases of intellectual disability (ID) without a known cause and represents approximately 50% of all cases. Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from the olfactory neuroepithelium (NEO) contain the same information as the cells found in the brain, but they are more accessible. Some miRNAs have been identified and associated with ID of known etiology. However, in idiopathic ID, the effect of miRNAs is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the miRNAs regulating the expression of mRNAs that may be involved in development of IID. Expression profiles were obtained using NPC-NEO cells from IID patients and healthy controls by microarray. A total of 796 miRNAs and 28,869 mRNAs were analyzed. Several miRNAs were overexpressed in the IID patients compared to controls. miR-25 had the greatest expression. In silico analysis showed that ROBO2 was the target for miR-25, with the highest specificity and being the most down-regulated. In vitro assay showed an increase of miR-25 expression induced a decrease in ROBO2 expression. In neurodevelopment, ROBO2 plays a crucial role in episodic learning and memory, so its down-regulation, caused by miR-25, could have a fundamental role in the intellectual disability that, until now, has been considered idiopathic.
