32991400|t|Interventions to improve physical performances of older people with cancer before complex medico-surgical procedures: Protocol for an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
32991400|a|BACKGROUND: Current demographics lead increasing older cancer patients to undergo complex medico-surgical procedures, with substantial risk of decompensations and deconditioning. The Prehabilitation & Rehabilitation in Oncology: Adaptation to Disease and Accompaniment of Patients' Trajectories (PROADAPT) project is currently being developed with the aim of improving care, through standardized care pathways guided by existing evidence and implementation programs. A working group will specifically focus on improvement of physical performances before such procedures. These interventions may have been developed in different contexts: before surgery in large, before carcinologic surgery or complex medical interventions (chemotherapy, radiotherapy), or in primary care for elderly patients to prevent sarcopenia and frailty. Post-surgical interventions are out of the scope of this review. The objective of this review is to summarize the level of evidence to support physical reconditioning interventions and identify areas where further work is required. METHODS: This umbrella review will include moderate to high quality systematic reviews, meta-analysis, and pre-existing umbrella or meta-reviews. Two reviewers will independently search the following databases: PubMed/MedLine, Cochrane Library, Embase, and CINAHL. Research strategy will use diverse keywords used to refer to the concepts of "prehabilitation," "preoperative exercise," or "preoperative rehabilitation," with prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria and only systematic reviews selection. The distinct types of interventions presented using PRISMA guidelines and a narrative reporting of results. A focus will be made on outcomes such as physical performances, quality of life, autonomy in everyday activities, or number of hospital bed days. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for such an umbrella review. Our review will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed international journal using open access option if available. It will be complementary to reviews focused on hospital discharge of older people. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020100110.
