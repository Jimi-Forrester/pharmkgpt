31459089|a|Crocus sativus L. (family: Iridaceae) has been documented in traditional medicine with numerous medicinal properties. Recently, we have shown that C. sativus extract (IIIM-141) displays promising efficacy in a genetic mice (5XFAD) model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2017, 16, 1756). To translate the available traditional knowledge and the scientifically validated results into modern medicine, herein we aimed to carry out its preclinical development. IIIM-141 is primarily a mixture of crocins containing trans-4-GG-crocin (36 % w/w) as the principal component. The in vitro studies show that IIIM-141 has protective as well as therapeutic properties in assays related to AD. It induces the expression of P-gp, thereby enhancing the amyloid-beta clearance from an AD brain. It also inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome and protects SH-SY5Y cells against amyloid-beta- and glutamate-induced neurotoxicities. In behavioral models, it decreased the streptozotocin-induced memory impairment in rats and recovered the scopolamine-induced memory deficit in Swiss albino mice at 100 mg/kg dose. The acute oral toxicity study shows that IIIM-141 is safe up to the dose of 2000 mg/kg, with no effect on the body weight and on the biochemical/hematological parameters of the rats. The repeated oral administration of IIIM-141 for 28 days at 100 mg/kg dose did not cause any preterminal deaths and abnormalities in Wistar rats. The pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that after oral administration of IIIM-141, the majority of crocin gets hydrolyzed to its aglycone crocetin. The sustained release (SR) capsule formulation was developed, which showed an improved in vitro dissolution profile and a significantly enhanced plasma exposure in the pharmacokinetic study. The SR formulation resulted in 3.3-fold enhancement in the area under the curve of crocetin and doubling of the crocetin/crocin ratio in plasma compared with the extract. The data presented herein will serve as the benchmark for further research on this botanical candidate.
