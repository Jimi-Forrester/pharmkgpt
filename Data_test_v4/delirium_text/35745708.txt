35745708|t|Post-COVID Syndrome: The Research Progress in the Treatment of Pulmonary sequelae after COVID-19 Infection.
35745708|a|Post-COVID syndrome or long COVID is defined as the persistence of symptoms after confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, the pathogen responsible for coronavirus disease. The content herein presented reviews the reported long-term consequences and aftereffects of COVID-19 infection and the potential strategies to adopt for their management. Recent studies have shown that severe forms of COVID-19 can progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a predisposing factor of pulmonary fibrosis that can irreversibly compromise respiratory function. Considering that the most serious complications are observed in the airways, the inhalation delivery of drugs directly to the lungs should be preferred, since it allows to lower the dose and systemic side effects. Although further studies are needed to optimize these techniques, recent studies have also shown the importance of in vitro models to recreate the SARS-CoV-2 infection and study its sequelae. The information reported suggests the necessity to develop new inhalation therapies in order to improve the quality of life of patients who suffer from this condition.
