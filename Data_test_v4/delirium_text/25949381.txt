25949381|a|We report a man with type 1 diabetes mellitus, autoimmune hypothyroidism and a tentative diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Following treatment with beta interferon, he developed systemic lupus erythematosus with pericarditis, pleural effusions, cerebral infarction associated with anti-phospholipid antibody and acute renal failure due to thrombotic microangiopathy. He responded well to immunosuppression and anticoagulation. These complications may represent the most severe autoimmune reaction to beta interferon reported to date.
