34992849|t|The role of palliative care in lung transplantation.
34992849|a|Lung transplantation confers meaningful benefit for patients by extending life and improving quality of life. Palliative care is a medical specialty that likewise aims to improve the quality of life of patients enduring serious illness and their caregivers. Yet, while transplant candidates and recipients face serious illness they rarely receive palliative care, even at end of life. While limited palliative care utilization is likely multifactorial, one key reason is a limited understanding of the specialty of palliative care and evidence for palliative interventions. In this review, we address this key barrier by discussing in depth what the specialty of palliative care is and provides to patients and their caregivers. We then discuss the growing evidence for palliative care interventions to improve quality of life and reduce symptom burdens in patients with malignancy including those undergoing bone marrow transplantation and patients with chronic organ failure. We then consider what palliative care needs exist across pre and post transplantation based on studies of palliative care needs of patients with end stage lung disease, studies of quality of life after lung transplantation, and limited studies of palliative care utilization pre and post lung transplantation. Finally, we consider different models of palliative care and discuss how palliative care might optimally be incorporated in lung transplantation using a longitudinal, integrated approach to palliative care.
