37532007|t|Mechanosensitive Piezo1 Channel in Physiology and Pathophysiology of the Central Nervous System.
37532007|a|Since the discovery of the mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel in 2010, there has been a significant amount of research conducted to explore its regulatory role in the physiology and pathology of various organ systems. Recently, a growing body of compelling evidence has emerged linking the activity of the mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel to health and disease of the central nervous system. However, the exact mechanisms underlying these associations remain inadequately comprehended. This review systematically summarizes the current research on the mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel and its implications for central nervous system mechanobiology, retrospects the results demonstrating the regulatory role of the mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel on various cell types within the central nervous system, including neural stem cells, neurons, oligodendrocytes, microglia, astrocytes, and brain endothelial cells. Furthermore, the review discusses the current understanding of the involvement of the Piezo1 channel in central nervous system disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, stroke, and glioma.
