38518564|a|As Alzheimer's disease prevalence continues to rise, there is an increasing demand for efficient on-chip biosensors capable of early biomarker detection. This study presents a novel biosensor chip leveraging vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) technology, with Parylene C serving as the antibody coupling layer and utilizing a streamlined one-step antibody modification method. Integration of Parylene C enhances chip sensitivity from 34.28 muW/RIU to 40.32 muW/RIU. Moreover, post-testing removal of Parylene C enables chip reusability without significant alteration of results. The sensor demonstrates effective detection of Abeta42, an Alzheimer's biomarker, exhibiting a linear range of 1-200 ng/mL and a detection limit of 0.26 ng/mL. These findings underscore the reusability and reliability of the ultrathin Parylene C-based VCSEL biosensor chip, highlighting its potential for point-of-care Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.
