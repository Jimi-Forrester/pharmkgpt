32236400|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive interventions have the potential to enhance cognition among healthy older adults. However, little attention has been paid to the effect of cognitive training (CT) on mood and activities of daily living (ADL). OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of a multicomponent CT using a training program of executive functions, attention, memory and visuospatial functions (TEAM-V Program) on cognition, mood and instrumental ADL. DESIGN: A randomized, single-blinded, treatment-as-usual controlled trial. SETTING: Geriatric clinic in Bangkok, Thailand. PARTICIPANTS: 77 nondemented community-dwelling older adults (mean age 65.7+-4.3 years). INTERVENTION: The CT (TEAM-V) program or the treatment-as-usual controlled group. The TEAM-V intervention was conducted over 5 sessions, with a 2-week interval between each session. Of 77 participants randomized (n=40 the TEAM-V program; n=37 the control group). MEASUREMENTS: The Thai version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog), Thai version of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and The Chula ADL were used to assess at baseline, 6 months and 1 year. RESULTS: Compared with the control arm, the TEAM-V Program was associated with reducing anxiety (P = 0.004). Compared with the baseline, participants receiving the TEAM-V Program were associated with significantly improved general cognition (MoCA, P < 0.001), immediate recall (word recall task, P = 0.01), retrieval and retention of memory process (word recognition task, P = 0.01), attention (number cancellation part A, P < 0.001) and executive function (maze test, P = 0.02) at 1 year. No training effects on depression (P = 0.097) and IADL (P = 0.27) were detected. CONCLUSIONS: The TEAM-V Program was effective in reducing anxiety. Even though, the program did not significantly improve cognition, depression and ADL compared with the control group, global cognition, memory, attention and executive function improved in the intervention group compared with baseline. Further studies incorporating a larger sample size, longitudinal follow-up and higher-intensity CT should be conducted.
