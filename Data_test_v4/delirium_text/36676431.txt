36676431|a|The present study described three synthesis routes using different natural polysaccharides as low-cost non-toxic fuels and complexing agents for obtaining MgO. Cassava starch, Aloe vera leaves (mainly acemannan) gel, and citric pectin powder were mixed with magnesium nitrate salt and calcined at 750  C for 2 h. The samples were named according to the polysaccharide: cassava starch (MgO-St), citrus pectin (MgO-CP), and Aloe vera (MgO-Av). X-ray diffraction identified the formation of a monophasic periclase structure (FCC type) for the three samples. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms (B.E.T. method) showed an important difference in textural properties, with a higher pore volume (Vmax = 89.76 cc/g) and higher surface area (SA = 43.93 m2/g) obtained for MgO-St, followed by MgO-CP (Vmax = 11.01 cc/g; SA = 7.01 m2/g) and MgO-Av (Vmax = 6.44 cc/g; SA = 6.63 m2/g). These data were consistent with the porous appearance observed in SEM images. Porous solids are interesting as adsorbents for removing metallic and molecular ions from wastewater. The removal of copper ions from water was evaluated, and the experimental data at equilibrium were adjusted according to the Freundlich, Langmuir, and Temkin isotherms. According to the Langmuir model, the maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) was 6331.117, 5831.244, and 6726.623 mg g-1 for the adsorbents MgO-St, MgO-Av, and MgO-CP, respectively. The results of the adsorption isotherms indicated that the synthesized magnesium oxides could be used to decrease the amount of Cu2+ ions in wastewater.
