15314253|a|Apolipoprotein E (apoE) genotype is the single most important genetic risk factor for the most common (sporadic) form of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that the presence of the E4 isoform of this cholesterol-binding protein contributes directly to disease risk, age of onset, and severity of the neuropathology. For example, studies in transgenic mice demonstrate that apoE is necessary for the formation of plaques with neuritic pathology. The precise mechanism by which apoE contributes to the disease remains unknown. However, several lines of investigation from a number of laboratories now point to a role for proteolytic fragments of apoE in the formation of both plaques and tangles, the two pathological hallmarks of the disease. In particular, the C-terminal portion of apoE has been implicated in binding to amyloid and is localized to plaques. The N-terminal domain, on the other hand, is neurotoxic in culture and has been localized to, and implicated in the formation of, neurofibrillary tangles. These results suggest that inhibition of apoE proteolysis is a potential therapeutic strategy for AD. Using human brain homogenates, we have determined that proteolysis of apoE is greatest at acidic pH and can be inhibited by compounds targeting aspartic proteases. The feasibility of screening candidate inhibitors is supported by both ELISA and immunoblotting methods. Future studies will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays to test the efficacy of the most effective compounds for their ability to inhibit apoE proteolysis in human brain and apoE transgenic mouse brain tissue.
