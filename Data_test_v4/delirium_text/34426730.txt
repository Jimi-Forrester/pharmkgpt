34426730|t|The Contribution of White Matter Diffusion and Cortical Perfusion Pathology to Vascular Cognitive Impairment: A Multimode Imaging-Based Machine Learning Study.
34426730|a|Widespread impairments in white matter and cerebrovascular integrity have been consistently implicated in the pathophysiology of patients with small vessel disease (SVD). However, the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie the developing progress of clinical cognitive symptoms remain largely elusive. Here, we conducted cross-modal MRI scanning including diffusion tensor imaging and arterial spin labeling in a cohort of 113 patients with SVD, which included 74 patients with vascular mild cognitive impairment (vMCI) and 39 patients without vMCI symptoms, and hence developed multimode imaging-based machine learning models to identify markers that discriminated SVD subtypes. Diffusion and perfusion features, respectively, extracted from individual white matter and gray matter regions were used to train three sets of classifiers in a nested 10-fold fashion: diffusion-based, perfusion-based, and combined diffusion-perfusion-based classifiers. We found that the diffusion-perfusion combined classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 72.57% with leave-one-out cross-validation, with the diffusion features largely spanning the capsular lateral pathway of the cholinergic tracts, and the perfusion features mainly distributed in the frontal-subcortical-limbic areas. Furthermore, diffusion-based features within vMCI group were associated with performance on executive function tests. We demonstrated the superior accuracy of using diffusion-perfusion combined multimode imaging features for classifying vMCI subtype out of a cohort of patients with SVD. Disruption of white matter integrity might play a critical role in the progression of cognitive impairment in patients with SVD, while malregulation of coritcal perfusion needs further study.
