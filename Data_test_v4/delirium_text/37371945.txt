37371945|a|Oxidative stress, accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction, is a key mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Both carnosine and lipoic acid are potent antioxidants, the applicability of which in therapy is hindered by their limited bioavailability. This study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective properties of a nanomicellar complex of carnosine and lipoic acid (CLA) in a rotenone-induced rat model of PD. Parkinsonism was induced via the administration of 2 mg/kg rotenone over the course of 18 days. Two doses of intraperitoneal CLA (25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg) were administered alongside rotenone to assess its neuroprotective effect. At 25 mg/kg CLA decreased muscle rigidity and partially restored locomotor activity in animals that received rotenone. Furthermore, it caused an overall increase in brain tissue antioxidant activity, accompanied by a 19% increase in neuron density in the substantia nigra and increased dopamine levels in the striatum relative to animals that only received rotenone. Based on the acquired results, it may be concluded that CLA have neuroprotective properties and could potentially be beneficial in PD treatment when used in conjunction with the base therapy.
