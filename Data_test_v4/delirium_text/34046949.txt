34046949|a|Amyloid fibril formation is associated with various amyloidoses, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Amyloid fibrils form above the solubility of amyloidogenic proteins or peptides upon breaking supersaturation, followed by a nucleation and elongation mechanism, which is similar to the crystallization of solutes. Many additives, including salts, detergents, and natural compounds, promote or inhibit amyloid formation. However, the underlying mechanisms of the opposing effects are unclear. We examined the effects of two polyphenols, that is, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and kaempferol-7 O glycoside (KG), with high and low solubilities, respectively, on the amyloid formation of alpha-synuclein (alphaSN). EGCG and KG inhibited and promoted amyloid formation of alphaSN, respectively, when monitored by thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence or transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis revealed that, although interactions of alphaSN with soluble EGCG increased the solubility of alphaSN, thus inhibiting amyloid formation, interactions of alphaSN with insoluble KG reduced the solubility of alphaSN, thereby promoting amyloid formation. Our study suggests that opposing effects of polyphenols on amyloid formation of proteins and peptides can be interpreted based on the solubility of polyphenols.
