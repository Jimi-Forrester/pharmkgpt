25745459|a|After gene mutation, the pcDNA3.1/APP595/596 plasmid was transfected into HEK293 cells to establish a cell model of Alzheimer's disease. The cell model was treated with donepezil or compound Danshen tablets after culture for 72 hours. Reverse transcription-PCR showed that the mRNA expression of amyloid protein precursor decreased in all groups following culture for 24 hours, and that there was no significant difference in the amount of decrease between donepezil and compound Danshen tablets. Our results suggest that compound Danshen tablets can reduce expression of the mRNA for amyloid protein precursor in a transgenic cell model of Alzheimer's disease, with similar effects to donepezil.
