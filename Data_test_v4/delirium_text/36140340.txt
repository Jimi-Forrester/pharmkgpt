36140340|t|Platelets' Nanomechanics and Morphology in Neurodegenerative Pathologies.
36140340|a|The imaging and force-distance curve modes of atomic force microscopy (AFM) are explored to compare the morphological and mechanical signatures of platelets from patients diagnosed with classical neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) and healthy individuals. Our data demonstrate the potential of AFM to distinguish between the three NDDs-Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and normal healthy platelets. The common features of platelets in the three pathologies are reduced membrane surface roughness, area and height, and enhanced nanomechanics in comparison with healthy cells. These changes might be related to general phenomena associated with reorganization in the platelet membrane morphology and cytoskeleton, a key factor for all platelets' functions. Importantly, the platelets' signatures are modified to a different extent in the three pathologies, most significant in ALS, less pronounced in PD and the least in AD platelets, which shows the specificity associated with each pathology. Moreover, different degree of activation, distinct pseudopodia and nanocluster formation characterize ALS, PD and AD platelets. The strongest alterations in the biophysical properties correlate with the highest activation of ALS platelets, which reflect the most significant changes in their nanoarchitecture. The specific platelet signatures that mark each of the studied pathologies can be added as novel biomarkers to the currently used diagnostic tools.
