32948896|a|PURPOSE: Dizziness may affect quality of life in a negative way and contribute to falls. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare 75 years old with dizziness caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) to those with general dizziness/impaired balance (non-BPPV related) and to those reporting no dizziness, regarding health-related quality of life (HRQL), falls, tiredness, and walking speed in a population-based setting. METHOD: A cross-sectional population-based sample, including 671 75 years old (398 women, 273 men), was investigated for BPPV, dizziness symptoms, falls, and walking speed. HRQL was assessed using the 36-item Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). RESULT: A total of 67 persons (10%) had symptoms of BPPV with 11 (1.6%) having nystagmus when tested for BPPV. Having BPPV as well as general dizziness/impaired balance was associated with reduced HRQL, more tiredness, enhanced number of falls, and lower walking speed. Furthermore, the risk of having BPPV increased fourfold if symptoms of dizziness when turning in bed was reported. CONCLUSION: Having problems with dizziness is common among senior citizens where BPPV can be an unrecognized cause of dizziness that may impact HRQL and overall well-being. As BPPV is common among older adults, and is potentially curable through reposition maneuvers, it is important to liberally test for, and treat the condition. Information about dizziness when turning in bed can help to pinpoint persons with enhanced risk for BPPV also on a population-based level.
