6142617|a|The case histories of 49 patients suffering from delirium tremens in a trauma hospital are described. Particular attention is devoted to two questions: 1. Is delirium tremens always coupled with a low serum K+? It was shown that a low serum K+ in this illness is frequent but not obligatory. 2. Is there a danger that a relapse could ensue by another operation carried out within a relatively short interval after delirium tremens? It was found that as a rule there is no relapse.
