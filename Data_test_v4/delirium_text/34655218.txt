34655218|t|Social Networks and Cognitive Reserve: Network Structure Moderates the Association Between Amygdalar Volume and Cognitive Outcomes.
34655218|a|OBJECTIVES: The cognitive reserve hypothesis has been proposed as a key mechanism explaining the link between social networks and cognitive function but has rarely been empirically tested using neuroimaging data. This study examines whether social network attributes moderate the association between amygdalar volume and cognitive function. METHODS: Data were from the Social Networks in Alzheimer Disease study (N = 154) and Indiana Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Social networks were measured using the PhenX Social Network Battery. Regional data from magnetic resonance imaging (amygdalar volume [AV]) were analyzed using FreeSurfer software. Cognitive function was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and consensus diagnosis. Linear regression analyses were conducted to test the moderating role of social networks on the association between AV and cognitive function. RESULTS: Participants with greater ability to span multiple social roles and subgroups within their networks scored higher on the MoCA after adjusting for sociodemographic variables, depression, frequency of contact, and AV. Social networks moderated the association between AV and cognitive function. DISCUSSION: Among participants who engaged in diverse and loosely connected social networks, the expected adverse cognitive effects of brain volume in regions implicated in socioemotional processing were attenuated. These findings suggest that cognitive stimulation achieved through social interaction with a diverse array of social relationships across multiple contexts may help promote cognitive reserve.
