28445753|t|Pyroglutamate-Modified Amyloid-beta(3-42) Shows alpha-Helical Intermediates before Amyloid Formation.
28445753|a|Pyroglutamate-modified amyloid-beta (pEAbeta) has been described as a relevant Abeta species in Alzheimer's-disease-affected brains, with pEAbeta (3-42) as a dominant isoform. Abeta (1-40) and Abeta (1-42) have been well characterized under various solution conditions, including aqueous solutions containing trifluoroethanol (TFE). To characterize structural properties of pEAbeta (3-42) possibly underlying its drastically increased aggregation propensity compared to Abeta (1-42), we started our studies in various TFE-water mixtures and found striking differences between the two Abeta species. Soluble pEAbeta (3-42) has an increased tendency to form beta-sheet-rich structures compared to Abeta (1-42), as indicated by circular dichroism spectroscopy data. Kinetic assays monitored by thioflavin-T show drastically accelerated aggregation leading to large fibrils visualized by electron microscopy of pEAbeta (3-42) in contrast to Abeta (1-42). NMR spectroscopy was performed for backbone and side-chain chemical-shift assignments of monomeric pEAbeta (3-42) in 40% TFE solution. Although the difference between pEAbeta (3-42) and Abeta (1-42) is purely N-terminal, it has a significant impact on the chemical environment of >20% of the total amino acid residues, as revealed by their NMR chemical-shift differences. Freshly dissolved pEAbeta (3-42) contains two alpha-helical regions connected by a flexible linker, whereas the N-terminus remains unstructured. We found that these alpha-helices act as a transient intermediate to beta-sheet and fibril formation of pEAbeta (3-42).
