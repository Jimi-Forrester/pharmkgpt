35706352|a|OBJECTIVES: Neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations of post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (neuro-PASC) are common among COVID-19 survivors, but it is unknown how neuro-PASC differs from influenza-related neuro-sequelae. This study investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with and without new-onset neuro-PASC, and of flu patients with similar symptoms. METHODS: We retrospectively screened 18,811 COVID-19 patients and 5772 flu patients between January 2020 and June 2021 for the presence of new-onset neuro-sequelae that persisted at least 2 weeks past the date of COVID-19 or flu diagnosis. RESULTS: We observed 388 COVID-19 patients with neuro-PASC versus 149 flu patients with neuro-sequelae. Common neuro-PASC symptoms were anxiety (30%), depression (27%), dizziness (22%), altered mental status (17%), chronic headaches (17%), and nausea (11%). The average time to neuro-PASC onset was 138 days, with hospitalized patients reporting earlier onset than non-hospitalized patients. Neuro-PASC was associated with female sex and older age (p < 0.05), but not race, ethnicity, most comorbidities, or COVID-19 disease severity (p > 0.05). Compared to flu patients, COVID-19 patients were older, exhibited higher incidence of altered mental status, developed symptoms more quickly, and were prescribed psychiatric drugs more often (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides additional insights into neuro-PASC risk factors and differentiates between post-COVID-19 and post-flu neuro-sequelae.
