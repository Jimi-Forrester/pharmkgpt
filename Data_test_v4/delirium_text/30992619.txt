30992619|a|Syphilis is a great masquerader of several diseases. About 4%-10% of patients with untreated syphilis may develop neurosyphilis (NS). Psychiatric manifestations may rarely be the presenting feature of NS. We describe herein a case of an elderly man who presented with psychosis and after thorough workup was diagnosed to be a case of a NS. Schizophrenia-like psychosis as the presenting and the only manifested feature of NS in a nonhuman immunodeficiency virus-infected patient was a unusual and noteworthy feature in the present case.
