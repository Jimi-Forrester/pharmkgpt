38592226|t|Cognitive Impairment and Brain Atrophy in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease.
38592226|a|In Japan, the aging of the population is rapidly accelerating, with an increase in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and those undergoing dialysis. As a result, the number of individuals with cognitive impairment (CI) is rising, and addressing this issue has become an urgent problem. A notable feature of dementia in CKD patients is the high frequency of vascular dementia, making its prevention through the management of classical risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, smoking, etc., associated with atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis. Other effective measures, including the use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, addressing anemia, exercise therapy, and lifestyle improvements, have been reported. The incidence and progression of CI may also be influenced by the type of kidney replacement therapy, with reports suggesting that long-duration dialysis, low-temperature hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation can have a preferable effect on the preservation of cognitive function. In conclusion, patients with CKD are at a higher risk of developing CI, with brain atrophy being a contributing factor. Despite the identification of various preventive measures, the evidence substantiating their efficacy remains limited across all studies. Future expectations lie in large-scale randomized controlled trials.
