25156270|t|DAF-16 target identification in C. elegans: past, present and future.
25156270|a|In C. elegans, mutations in the conserved insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway lead to a robust extension in lifespan, improved late life health, and protection from age-related disease. These effects are mediated by the FoxO transcription factor DAF-16 which lies downstream of the IIS kinase cascade. Identifying and functionally testing DAF-16 target genes has been a focal point of ageing research for the last 10 years. Here, I review the recent advances in identifying and understanding IIS/DAF-16 targets. These studies continue to reveal the intricate nature of the IIS/DAF-16 gene regulation network and are helping us to understand the mechanisms that control lifespan. Ageing and age related disease is an area of intense public interest, and the biochemical characterization of the genes involved will be critical for identifying drugs to improve the health of our ageing population.
