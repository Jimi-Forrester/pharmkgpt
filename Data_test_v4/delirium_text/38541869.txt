38541869|t|A Benefit/Risk Assessment of Intrathecal Ziconotide in Chronic Pain: A Narrative Review.
38541869|a|BACKGROUND: Ziconotide is an intrathecal drug administered for the treatment of chronic pain. The current literature lacks an exhaustive benefit/risk assessment on this drug. We herein focus on Ziconotide's pharmacology and clinical applications. METHODS: Literature research was conducted to identify studies on Ziconotide administration for the treatment of chronic pain, published between January 1990 and March 2023 and located via PubMed, Embase, Medline, Cinahl, and Web of Science, using the following keywords: Ziconotide, Omega conotoxin, Prialt, SNX-111, intrathecal therapy, and neuropathic pain. Only publications written in English were selected. RESULTS: Among the 86 selected studies, we found 4 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and 3 prospective long-term studies concerning the intrathecal use of Ziconotide as a monotherapy in chronic pain. Other studies described the intrathecal infusion of Ziconotide combined with other drugs. Overall, Ziconotide has been proved to have strong efficacy for relieving chronic pain, although patients with co-morbid psychiatric disorders require a careful monitoring when treated with Ziconotide. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the use of Ziconotide, as a monotherapy or in conjunction with other therapies for the treatment of chronic pain, was reported to be efficacious. Overall, its use in patients with chronic pain refractory to other pharmacologic agents outweighs the possible adverse consequences, thus resulting in a favorable benefit/risk assessment.
