27038856|t|Effects of Intraoperative Hemodynamics on Incidence of Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Patients: A Retrospective Study.
27038856|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication in the elderly. This retrospective study investigated the effect of intraoperative hemodynamics on the incidence of POD in elderly patients after major surgery to explore ways to reduce the incidence of POD. MATERIAL/METHODS: Based on the incidence of POD, elderly patients (81+-6 y) were assigned to a POD (n=137) or non-POD group (n=343) after elective surgery with total intravenous anesthesia. POD was diagnosed based on the guidelines of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), using the confusion assessment method. The hemodynamic parameters, such as mean arterial pressure, were monitored 10 min before anesthesia (baseline) and intraoperatively. The incidence of intraoperative hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia, and bradycardia were calculated. RESULTS: At 30 min and 60 min after the initiation of anesthesia and at the conclusion of surgery, the monitored hemodynamic parameter values of the POD group, but not those of the non-POD group, were significantly higher than at baseline. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that intraoperative hypertension and tachycardia were significantly associated with POD. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative hypertension and tachycardia were significantly associated with POD. Maintaining intraoperative stable hemodynamics may reduce the incidence of POD in elderly patients undergoing surgery.
