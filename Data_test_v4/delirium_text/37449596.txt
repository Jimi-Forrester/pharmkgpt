37449596|t|Saliva: a challenging human fluid to diagnose brain disorders with a focus on Alzheimer's disease.
37449596|a|Biomarkers are molecules of biological processes that help in both the diagnosis of human diseases and in follow-up assessments of therapeutic responses. Biomarkers can be measured in many human fluids, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and saliva. The -omics methods (genomics, RNomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) are useful at measuring thousands of markers in a small volume. Saliva is a human fluid that is easily accessible, without any ethical concerns. Yet, saliva remains unexplored in regard to many human disease biomarkers. In this review, we will give an overview on saliva and how it can be influenced by exogenous factors. As we focus on the potential use of saliva as a diagnostic tool in brain disorders (especially Alzheimer's disease), we will cover how saliva is linked to the brain. We will discuss that saliva is a heterogeneous human fluid, yet useful for the discovery of biomarkers in human disorders. However, a procedure and consensus that is controlled, validated, and standardized for the collection and processing of saliva is required, followed by a highly sensitive diagnostic approach.
