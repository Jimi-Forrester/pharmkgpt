37399089|t|A Fast Emergency Department Triage Score based on Mobility, Mental Status and Oxygen Saturation compared with the Emergency Severity Index: A Prospective Cohort Study.
37399089|a|BACKGROUND: Waiting for triage in overburdened emergency departments (ED) has become an increasing problem, which endangers patients. A fast triage system to rapidly identifying low acuity patients should divert care and resources to more urgent cases. AIM: Objective of this study was to compare the performance of the Kitovu Hospital fast triage score (KFT) with the Emergency Severity Index (ESI), using mortality and hospital admission as proxies for the patients' acuity. DESIGN: A prospective observational study of consecutive patients presenting to a Swiss academic ED. METHODS: Patients were prospectively triaged into one of five ESI strata, and retrospectively assessed by the KFT score, which awards 1 point each for altered mental status, impaired mobility, and oxygen saturation <94%. RESULTS: The KFT score had a lower discrimination than the ESI for hospital admission, but a higher discrimination for mortality from 24-hour to one year after ED presentation. 5544 (67%) patients were assigned to the lowest acuity by the KFT score compared with 2,374 (28 7%) by the ESI; there was no significant difference in the 24-hour mortality of patients who were deemed low acuity by either score. CONCLUSION: Compared to the ESI, the KFT score identifies more than twice as many patients at low risk of early death. Therefore, this score might help to identify patients who could be managed through alternative pathways. This may be particularly helpful in situations of ED crowding and access block.
