37242458|t|Guanidines: Synthesis of Novel Histamine H3R Antagonists with Additional Breast Anticancer Activity and Cholinesterases Inhibitory Effect.
37242458|a|This study examines the properties of novel guanidines, designed and synthesized as histamine H3R antagonists/inverse agonists with additional pharmacological targets. We evaluated their potential against two targets viz., inhibition of MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 breast cancer cells viability and inhibition of AChE/BuChE. ADS10310 showed micromolar cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells, combined with nanomolar affinity at hH3R, and may represent a promising target for the development of an alternative method of cancer therapy. Some of the newly synthesized compounds showed moderate inhibition of BuChE in the single-digit micromolar concentration ranges. H3R antagonist with additional AChE/BuChE inhibitory effect might improve cognitive functions in Alzheimer's disease. For ADS10310, several in vitro ADME-Tox parameters were evaluated and indicated that it is a metabolically stable compound with weak hepatotoxic activity and can be accepted for further studies.
