Currently, the mechanisms underlying the disease are far from being elucidated. Thus, the study of proteins involved in its pathogenesis would allow getting further insights into the disease and identifying new markers for AD diagnosis. METHODS: We aimed here to analyze protein dysregulation in AD brain by quantitative proteomics to identify novel proteins associated with the disease. 10-plex TMT (tandem mass tags)-based quantitative proteomics experiments were performed using frozen tissue samples from the left prefrontal cortex of AD patients and healthy individuals and vascular dementia (VD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients as controls (CT). LC-MS/MS analyses were performed using a Q Exactive mass spectrometer. RESULTS: In total, 3281 proteins were identified and quantified using MaxQuant. Among them, after statistical analysis with Perseus (p value < 0.05), 16 and 155 proteins were defined as upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in AD compared to CT (Healthy, FTD and VD) with an expression ratio >= 1.5 (upregulated) or <= 0.67 (downregulated). After bioinformatics analysis, ten dysregulated proteins were selected as more prone to be associated with AD, and their dysregulation in the disease was verified by qPCR, WB, immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), pull-down, and/or ELISA, using tissue and plasma samples of AD patients, patients with other dementias, and healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS: We identified and validated novel AD-associated proteins in brain tissue that should be of further interest for the study of the disease. Remarkably, PMP2 and SCRN3 were found to bind to amyloid-beta (Abeta) fibers in vitro, and PMP2 to associate with Abeta plaques by IF, whereas HECTD1 and SLC12A5 were identified as new potential blood-based biomarkers of the disease.
