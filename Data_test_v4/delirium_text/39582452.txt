39582452|a|BACKGROUND: Pain and sedation management is an integral part of pediatric intensive care practice. Sedoanalgesia management must be balanced in order to optimize comfort and avoid complications. In order to achieve this balance, sedoanalgesia management needs to be clarified in pediatric intensive care units (PICU). With this study, we aimed to investigate sedation, analgesia, withdrawal and delirium practices, pharmacologic agent preferences, and current experiences and practices in scoring systems in PICUs in Turkiye. METHOD: A questionnaire consisting of 57 questions was sent via e-mail to the 'Pediatric Intensive Care and Emergency' group, which includes all intensive care specialists, subspecialty students and lecturers in Turkiye. RESULTS: Our study involved 36 pediatric intensive care physicians working in PICUs in Turkiye. Among the PICU specialists who participated in the study, 83.3% stated that they performed routine assessments of sedation efficacy. While dexmedetomidine was the most commonly used sedative agent in patients undergoing noninvasive mechanical ventilation, benzodiazepines were the most preferred pharmacologic agent for sedation during mechanical ventilation. Of the pediatric intensivists who participated in the study, 94.4% stated that they performed routine pain assessments in their units. Of the PICU specialists who participated in the study, 69.4% stated that muscle relaxants were most commonly used to prevent patient-ventilator incompatibility during mechanical ventilation. Of the participants, 88.8% made withdrawal assessments when discontinuing sedo-analgesic agents. Delirium assessment was routinely performed by 58.3% of the participants. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the practices in sedoanalgesia management in PICUs in Turkiye are in parallel with recommendations of the sedation guideline. Despite the increased sensitivity in sedoanalgesia management, awareness in the management of delirium and withdrawal syndrome is not at the desired level. Therefore, there is a need to develop guidelines, raise awareness and increase training on these issues in our Turkiye.
