29180691|t|Serum Uric Acid is Independently Associated with Enlarged Perivascular Spaces.
29180691|a|Enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) are reported to be associated with impaired cognitive function and sleep disorders. It is of clinical importance to understand the risk factors for EPVS. Hyperuricemia increases the risk of hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, which are well recognized to be associated with EPVS. Therefore, we postulated that serum uric acid (SUA) might be associated with EPVS. A total of 665 lacunar stroke patients were enrolled in this study. The SUA concentrations of patients with severe EPVS were much higher than those of patients with mild EPVS (for basal ganglia: 5.25 +- 1.40 mg/dl vs. 4.75 +- 1.40 mg/dl, p < 0.001; for white matter: 5.31 +- 1.41 mg/dl vs. 4.88 +- 1.37 mg/dl, p = 0.009). The percentage of subjects with severe EPVS tended to be higher in the highest quartile of SUA (chi-square test: P = 0.002 for basal ganglia and 0.006 for white matter). Spearman correlation analysis indicated that the SUA concentrations were positively correlated with the severity of EPVS (rho > 0, p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that high normal SUA was independently associated with a higher severity of EPVS. This finding suggests that high SUA levels might be an independent risk factor for EPVS in lacunar stroke patients.
