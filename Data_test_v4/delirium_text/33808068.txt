33808068|t|Palm Fruit Bioactive Complex (PFBc), a Source of Polyphenols, Demonstrates Potential Benefits for Inflammaging and Related Cognitive Function.
33808068|a|Cognitive function is a key aspect of healthy aging. Inflammation associated with normal aging, also called inflammaging is a primary risk factor for cognitive decline. A diet high in fruits and vegetable and lower in calories, particularly a Mediterranean Diet, may lower the risk of age-related cognitive decline due in part to the associated high intake of antioxidants and polyphenols. A phenolic, Palm Fruit Bioactive complex (PFBc) derived from the extraction process of palm oil from oil palm fruit (Elaeis guineensis), is reported to offset inflammation due to its high antioxidant, especially vitamin E, and polyphenol content. The benefit is thought to be achieved via the influence of antioxidants on gene expression. It is the purpose of this comprehensive review to discuss the etiology, including gene expression, of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) specific to dietary intake of antioxidants and polyphenols and to focus on the potential impact of nutritional interventions specifically PFBc has on MCI. Several in vitro, in vivo and animal studies support multiple benefits of PFBc especially for improving cognitive function via anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms. While more human studies are needed, those completed thus far support the benefit of consuming PFBc to enhance cognitive function via its anti-inflammatory antioxidant functions.
