31844492|t|Clinical utility of the INECO Frontal Screening for detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson's disease.
31844492|a|Cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease typically affect executive functions. Recently, the concept of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) has been related to PD (PD-MCI). PD-MCI is considered a transition phase to Parkinson's disease Dementia. Therefore, it is important to identify PD-MCI in a reliable way. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the INECO Frontal Screening (IFS) in detecting cognitive deficits in PD-MCI. Additionally, we compare the IFS and the Addenbrook Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R) between three groups; PD-MCI, MCI, and controls. METHODS: The IFS and ACE-R were administered to 36 patients with PD-MCI, 31 with MCI (amnestic-multidomain subtype) and 92 healthy controls. Sensitivity and specificity were determined using ROC analysis. The groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: The IFS had adequate accuracy in differentiating patients with PD-MCI from healthy controls (AUC=0.77, sensitivity=0.82, specificity=0.77), and good accuracy in differentiating PD-MCI from MCI patients (AUC=0.80, sensitivity=0.82, specificity=0.61). However the IFS had low accuracy in differentiating MCI patients from healthy controls (AUC=0.47, sensitivity=0.52, specificity=0.41). On the ACE-R, the PD-MCI group had low performance in Fluency and Language. Only patients with PD-MCI had difficulties on the IFS, specifically in inhibitory control and visual working memory. This dysexecutive profile explains the sensitivity and specificity values found in the IFS. CONCLUSION: The present study results suggest that the IFS is a suitable screening tool for exploring cognitive dysfunction in PD-MCI, especially in those patients with a dysexecutive profile.
