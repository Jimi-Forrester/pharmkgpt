38865456|t|Neuroimaging epicenters as potential sites of onset of the neuroanatomical pathology in schizophrenia.
38865456|a|Schizophrenia lacks a clear definition at the neuroanatomical level, capturing the sites of origin and progress of this disorder. Using a network-theory approach called epicenter mapping on cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging from 1124 individuals with schizophrenia, we identified the most likely "source of origin" of the structural pathology. Our results suggest that the Broca's area and adjacent frontoinsular cortex may be the epicenters of neuroanatomical pathophysiology in schizophrenia. These epicenters can predict an individual's response to treatment for psychosis. In addition, cross-diagnostic similarities based on epicenter mapping over of 4000 individuals diagnosed with neurological, neurodevelopmental, or psychiatric disorders appear to be limited. When present, these similarities are restricted to bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. We provide a comprehensive framework linking schizophrenia-specific epicenters to multiple levels of neurobiology, including cognitive processes, neurotransmitter receptors and transporters, and human brain gene expression. Epicenter mapping may be a reliable tool for identifying the potential onset sites of neural pathophysiology in schizophrenia.
