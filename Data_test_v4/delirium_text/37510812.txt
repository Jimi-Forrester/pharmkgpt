37510812|t|Defining the Role of Anaortic Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting.
37510812|a|As the population ages and co-morbidities become more prevalent, the complexity of patients presenting for coronary artery bypass surgery is increasing. Cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamping in these patients carry increased risk and, indeed, in some patients, with ascending aortic disease, the risks are prohibitive. Total-arterial anaortic coronary artery surgery is a technique that provides complete surgical coronary artery revascularization without cardiopulmonary bypass and without manipulating the ascending aorta. The technique essentially eliminates the risk of cerebral embolization of aortic atheroma and aortic injury. Anaortic techniques are an essential skillset for coronary artery surgery centers treating higher-risk patients.
