30233682|a|The transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 (TDP-43) may be involved in neurodegenerative disease and in the response to brain injury; however, alterations in the expression of TDP-43 following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) require further investigation. The present study reported a notable elevation in the expression of TDP-43 within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with aneurysmal SAH and increased brain expression of TDP-43 in a rat model of SAH. The TDP-43 protein and a derivative migrated at 43 and 24 kDa, respectively, as observed via the immunoblotting of concentrated CSF samples obtained from patients with SAH; no signal was detected in the CSF from healthy controls. SAH in rats was induced by intravascular suture puncture. The expression levels of TDP-43 in rat cortical lysates following SAH were increased at 0.5 h, peaked at 48 h and remained significantly elevated at 72 h post-injury, compared with sham controls. TDP-43 immunolabeling indication localization within neurons, astrocytes and microglia in the experimental rats. Collectively, the findings of the present study indicated the early involvement of TDP-43 in the brain in response to SAH, and that expression levels of TDP-43 in the CSF may serve as a prognostic biomarker among patients with this condition.
