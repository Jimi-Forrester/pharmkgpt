2682069|t|Practical management of urinary incontinence.
2682069|a|A comprehensive evaluation of incontinence using office-based techniques may discover reversible problems such as delirium, urinary infections, vaginitis, depression, drug effects, endocrinologic causes, immobility, or impaction. Treatment of these causes may alleviate incontinence. Bedside urodynamics are a sensitive, specific, and useful office-based technique that can identify detrusor instability, overflow incontinence, or stress incontinence. Low urinary flow rate, difficulty with catheterization, slow bladder filling or severe urgency, bladder capacity over 600 ml, and post-void residual over 150 ml need referral. Patients with hematuria, recurrent infections, recent surgery or pelvic irradiation, and pelvic or prostatic masses also need further evaluation. A number of medical and behavioral therapies are available for stress incontinence and detrusor instability that can substantially reduce incontinence, but most patients with overflow have more complicated problems requiring further evaluation, surgery, or long-term bladder drainage.
