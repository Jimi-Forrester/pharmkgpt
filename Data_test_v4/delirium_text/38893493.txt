38893493|t|Connecting GSK-3beta Inhibitory Activity with IKK-beta or ROCK-1 Inhibition to Target Tau Aggregation and Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's Disease-Discovery, In Vitro and In Cellulo Activity of Thiazole-Based Inhibitors.
38893493|a|GSK-3beta, IKK-beta, and ROCK-1 kinases are implicated in the pathomechanism of Alzheimer's disease due to their involvement in the misfolding and accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) and tau proteins, as well as inflammatory processes. Among these kinases, GSK-3beta plays the most crucial role. In this study, we present compound 62, a novel, remarkably potent, competitive GSK-3beta inhibitor (IC50 = 8 nM, Ki = 2 nM) that also exhibits additional ROCK-1 inhibitory activity (IC50 = 2.3 microM) and demonstrates anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Compound 62 effectively suppresses the production of nitric oxide (NO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lipopolysaccharide-induced model of inflammation in the microglial BV-2 cell line. Furthermore, it shows neuroprotective effects in an okadaic-acid-induced tau hyperphosphorylation cell model of neurodegeneration. The compound also demonstrates the potential for further development, characterized by its chemical and metabolic stability in mouse microsomes and fair solubility.
