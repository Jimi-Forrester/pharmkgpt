35592266|a|Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 entry into the central nervous system can result in neurological and/or neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, routes of SARS-Cov-2 entry into the brain via neuroinvasive pathways such as transcribrial, ocular surface or hematogenous system are discussed. It is argued that SARS-Cov-2-induced cytokine storm, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress increase the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Further studies on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants on protein aggregation, glia or microglia activation, and blood-brain barrier are warranted.
