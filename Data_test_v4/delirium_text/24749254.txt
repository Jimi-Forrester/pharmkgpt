24749254|a|Delirium can be caused by haemodynamics abnormalities during anaesthesia. The main role in delirium appearance is given to decreasing of cerebral perfusion pressure. Especially it can happen in patients with underlying intracranial hypertension. Anaesthetics effects on intracranial pressure are different therefore cerebral hypoperfusion can happens in these patients even without systemic hypotension. Purpose of the study was to define an effect of cerebral perfusion pressure decreasing during different technics of anaesthesia on frequency of delirium in elderly patients after major abdominal surgery. The article deals with results of study of 182 patients (medium age 69 y.o.) underwent elective major abdominal surgery. Delirium frequency was 11%, continuing of delirium was 3 days. The frequency of delirium was higher in patients who had got anaesthesia based on sevoflurane. Additionally these patients had higher frequency of cerebral perfusion pressure decreasing. Conclusions; Anaesthesia based on sevoflurane is characterized by higher frequency of postoperative delirium in elderly patients after major abdominal surgery.
