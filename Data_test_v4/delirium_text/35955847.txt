35955847|a|Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease represent some of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders afflicting millions of people worldwide. Unfortunately, there is a lack of efficacious treatments to cure or stop the progression of these disorders. While the causes of such a lack of therapies can be attributed to various reasons, the disappointing results of recent clinical trials suggest the need for novel and innovative approaches. Since its discovery, there has been a growing excitement around the potential for CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing to identify novel mechanistic insights into disease pathogenesis and to mediate accurate gene therapy. To this end, the literature is rich with experiments aimed at generating novel models of these disorders and offering proof-of-concept studies in preclinical animal models validating the great potential and versatility of this gene-editing system. In this review, we provide an overview of how the CRISPR-Cas9 systems have been used in these neurodegenerative disorders.
