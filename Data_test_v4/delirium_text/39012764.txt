39012764|t|Association between dietary riboflavin intake and cognitive decline in older adults: a cross-sectional analysis.
39012764|a|BACKGROUND: Research exploring the link between dietary riboflavin intake and cognitive decline in this demographic is limited. Our aim was to examine the association between riboflavin intake levels and cognitive decline. METHODS: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011 to 2014 were utilized in this cross-sectional analysis. The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease test Word Learning delayed recall trial (DR), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Animal Fluency Test(AFT) and Z test were used to evaluate cognitive performance. Multivariate logistic regression, restricted cubic spline and subgroup analysis were performed to evaluate the associations between riboflavin intake and cognitive decline. RESULTS: The study included a total of 2255 patients, with 47.9% being male. The incidence of cognitive decline was 23.8%. After adjusting for all selected covariates, we found that high riboflavin intake was associated with a lower risk of cognitive impairment in adults in the United States. When riboflavin intake was used as a Categorical variable, compared to those with the lowest intake, the odds ratio (OR) of individuals with the highest riboflavin intake for DR test, AFT test, DSST test and Z test were 0.73 (95% CI: 0.53~1), 0.68(95% CI: 0.49-0.96),0.53(95% CI: 0.37-0.77) and 0.56(95% CI: 0.39-0.8). The study also found an L-shaped association between riboflavin intake and cognitive decline, with an inflection point at approximately 2.984 mg/d. CONCLUSIONS: Our cross-sectional study in a nationwide sample of American old adults suggests that dietary riboflavin intake was negative associated with cognitive decline.
