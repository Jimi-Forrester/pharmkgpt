34198106|t|Understanding the COVID 19 Conundrum and Decluttering the scientific literature on COVID 19.
34198106|a|As COVID 19 continues to over burden the healthcare system globally, the scientists are relentlessly pursuing research and publishing copious data on relevant managements strategies for the infection. This short communication has attempted to simplify the available information on the subject in a manner that is easy to understand and implement in clinical setting. COVID 19 is not a single disease but a spectrum and should be classified based on clinical, radiological and laboratory parameters. A simple yet powerful way is to classify COVID 19 as COVIN - COVID Infection but no disease; COVIRI - COVID infection with predominant respiratory symptoms; COVIDI - COVID infection leading to an abnormal immune response and COVID S- referring to the sequalae of an acute COVID Infection. A clinical subtype specific approach may result in easier communication between healthcare providers which in turn may improve patient outcomes by providing targeted therapy.
