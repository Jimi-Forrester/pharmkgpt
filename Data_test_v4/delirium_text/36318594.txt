36318594|a|Older adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) may have an elevated risk of developing Alzheimer disease and related dementia. Higher intraindividual cognitive variability (IICV) has been proposed as a novel risk factor of Alzheimer disease and related dementia. Here, we examined the association between cross-domain IICV measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and cognitive impairment measured using traditional neuropsychological tests in older individuals with T1D. Participants with T1D (N=201) completed both the MoCA and a battery of traditional neuropsychological tests. Participants with cognitive impairment, determined using traditional tests, had significantly higher IICV scores and significantly lower total MoCA scores (P<0.001). However, the effect of the total score was greater than that of the IICV score on the likelihood of cognitive impairment (total odds ratio=3.50, IICV odds ratio=2.03, P<0.001). The MoCA total score performed better than the MoCA IICV score in identifying T1D individuals classified with cognitive impairment.
