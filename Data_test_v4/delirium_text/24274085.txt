24274085|a|BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is a multi-factorial disease and several risk-factors such as infections, inflammatory responses, oral hygiene, smoke, aging and individual predisposition are involved in the disease. Pathogens trigger chronic inflammation with cytokines release which in turn leads to the destruction of the connective and the teeth supporting bone. The identification of genetic factors controlling oral inflammation may increase our understanding of genetic predisposition to periodontitis.Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, Alpha-1-Antichymotripsin, hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl CoA reductase, Interferon alpha, Interleukin-1 Beta, Interleukin 10, Interleukin 6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor- alpha genes from a case/control study were investigated. RESULTS: The C allele of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, A allele of Interleukin 10 and GG genotype of Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha were individually associated with chronic periodontitis. However, the concomitant presence of the three genetic markers in the same subjects appeared to play a synergistic role and increased several folds the risk of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings offer new tools to implement the screening of unaffected subjects with an increased susceptibility of periodontitis and increase our understanding regarding the genetic inflammatory background related to familiarity of the disease.
