7837931|t|A multiple-dose safety trial of eptastigmine in Alzheimer's disease, with pharmacodynamic observations of red blood cell cholinesterase.
7837931|a|A placebo-controlled multiple dose study was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of multiple dose levels of eptastigmine in 25 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Twenty patients (12 M, 8 F; mean age 74, range 57-84) were randomized to receive 12mg (N = 3), 20mg (N = 6), 28mg (N = 6) or placebo (N = 5) tid on a double-blind basis for 14 days, followed by seven days of single blind placebo, in successively rising dose groups. All patients completed the study without intolerable or severe adverse events. All doses significantly (p < 0.001) reduced peak and trough RBC cholinesterase (AChE) activity as compared to baseline. Percent inhibition for Day 14 peak and trough RBC AChE peak and trough values, respectively, appeared proportional to dose: 18% and 21% (12mg); 36% and 35% (20mg); 40% and 44% (28mg). In order to determine the maximum tolerated dose of eptastigmine, an additional single-blind study was performed in five patients (2 M, 3 F; mean age 78, range 72-80) utilizing a rising dose schedule of eptastigmine (N = 4) or placebo (N = 1), starting with the previously tolerated 28mg tid dose and increasing by 4mg tid up to a potential maximum of 56mg tid. Dose-limiting adverse events occurred requiring discontinuation of medication in one patient at 48mg tid and two patients at 52mg tid; RBC AChE inhibition was proportional to dose, with peak values up to 70% inhibition at 48mg tid. The maximum tolerated dose of 48mg tid was identified as a basis for potential Phase II multicenter efficacy trials.
