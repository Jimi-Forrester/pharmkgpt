30025963|a|BACKGROUND AIMS: Degeneration of the central nerve system, particularly in Alzheimer's disease, is a burden on society, and despite years of research, there is no effective treatment. Cell therapy appears to be an option that is of growing interest in neural studies. The main aim of this study was to investigate the histological and physiological effects of transplantation the neuron-like cell (NLC)-derived mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) on the repair of brain lesions in an Alzheimer's animal model (AM) in rats. METHODS: Behavioral experiments were conducted in the light hours in a Y-shaped maze device. Animals were randomly divided into five groups, with seven rats per group. The nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) was destroyed bilaterally with an electrical lesion (0.5 mA for 3 s). One week after the bilateral lesion of the NBM, the differentiated NLCs (0.1 mL) were injected with stereotaxic surgery using a Hamilton syringe at NBM coordinates, and behavioral and histological tests were performed by the Y-maze task and hematoxylin and eosin staining after five weeks of the lesion. Also, differentiated cells detected by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis and fluorescent immunostaining. RESULTS: The expression of neuronal markers including Nestin, Map2, NF-H, Tuj-1, GFAP and Olig-2 was surveyed by using the immunocytochemistry and qRT-PCR methods, and the results confirmed that the genes in question were expressed significantly more compared than the control sample. Five weeks after the cell transplantation in the AM, morphological and physiological investigation during the determination period confirmed improved disease state in the tested models. CONCLUSIONS: It should be noted that by improving the neuronal connectivity in AM rat brains, the transplanted NLCs rescue Alzheimer's cognition. This research has presented some preclinical evidence that showed NLCs transplantation can be used for AM treatment.
