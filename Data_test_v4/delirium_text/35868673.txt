35868673|t|Malnutrition and Sarcopenia in COVID-19 Survivors.
35868673|a|Malnutrition has been one of the most common complications of older COVID-19 survivors. COVID-19 associated symptoms like loss of appetite as well as changes in taste and smell may trigger the deterioration of nutritional status, while other complications of the disease may contribute to it, like respiratory failure that necessitates admission to the ICU. Especially in nursing home residents reduced food intake may be related to preexisting and also to incident geriatric syndromes like delirium. Sarcopenia has also been highly prevalent in older COVID-19 survivors. It is caused and exacerbated by COVID-19-associated inflammatory processes, total or partial immobilization, and malnutrition. COVID-19 survivors may be at high risk of developing the vicious circle that results from the interaction of deteriorating nutritional status and declining functionality. Regular monitoring of nutritional and functional status is, therefore, indicated in all older COVID-19 survivors. If malnutrition and/or functional decline have been identified in this patient population, low-threshold provision of individualized nutritional and exercise interventions should be installed. In those that are most seriously affected by malnutrition and sarcopenia ambulatory or inpatient rehabilitation has to be considered. Geriatric rehabilitation programs should be specifically adapted to the needs of older patients with COVID-19.
