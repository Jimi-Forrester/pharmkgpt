28884980|t|Perioperative Stroke, In-Hospital Mortality, and Postoperative Morbidity Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: A Nationwide Study.
28884980|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Perioperative stroke is a significant complication of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This study aimed to quantify perioperative stroke as an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality and postoperative morbidity in patients receiving TAVI. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the National Inpatient Sample. Patients undergoing TAVI during 2012 and 2013 were identified using diagnostic codes of International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using patient demographics and comorbidities to identify predictors of mortality and morbidity, defined by a length of stay of >14 days and/or discharge to a place other than home. RESULTS: Data were obtained from 7,556 patients undergoing TAVI during 2012 and 2013. The incidence rates of mortality and morbidity were 4.57 and 71.12%, respectively. Perioperative stroke was an independent risk factor for mortality [odds ratio (OR)=3.182, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.530-6.618, p=0.002], as were infection (OR=17.899, 95% CI=9.876-32.440, p<0.001) and pericardial tamponade (OR=7.272, 95% CI=2.874-18.402, p<0.001). Stroke also predicted morbidity (OR=5.223, 95% CI=2.005-13.608, p=0.001), which was also associated with age, being female, being Asian, moderate and high Van Walraven scores (VWR), and infection. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, perioperative stroke was found to be independently associated with in-hospital mortality and postoperative morbidity, as are age and high VWR. Our findings support the use of further preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative management strategies during TAVI.
