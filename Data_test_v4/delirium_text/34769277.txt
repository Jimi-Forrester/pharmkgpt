34769277|t|Insights into the Pathogenesis of Neurodegenerative Diseases: Focus on Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Oxidative Stress.
34769277|a|As the population ages, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases is increasing. Due to intensive research, important steps in the elucidation of pathogenetic cascades have been made and significantly implicated mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. However, the available treatment in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is mainly symptomatic, providing minor benefits and, at most, slowing down the progression of the disease. Although in preclinical setting, drugs targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress yielded encouraging results, clinical trials failed or had inconclusive results. It is likely that by the time of clinical diagnosis, the pathogenetic cascades are full-blown and significant numbers of neurons have already degenerated, making it impossible for mitochondria-targeted or antioxidant molecules to stop or reverse the process. Until further research will provide more efficient molecules, a healthy lifestyle, with plenty of dietary antioxidants and avoidance of exogenous oxidants may postpone the onset of neurodegeneration, while familial cases may benefit from genetic testing and aggressive therapy started in the preclinical stage.
