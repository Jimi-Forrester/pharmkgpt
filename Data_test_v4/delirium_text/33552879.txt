33552879|a|Introduction: Guidelines and consensus statements do not support routine preoperative testing for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) prior to elective arthroplasty. Despite this, urine testing remains commonplace in orthopaedic practice. This mixed methods stepwise quality improvement project aimed to develop and implement a guideline to reduce unnecessary preoperative testing for asymptomatic bacteriuria prior to elective arthroplasty within a single centre. Methods: Step 1 - description of current practice in preoperative urine testing prior to arthroplasty within a single centre; Step 2 - examination of the association between preoperative urine culture and pathogens causing prosthetic joint infection (PJI); Step 3 - co-design of a guideline to reduce unnecessary preoperative testing for asymptomatic bacteriuria prior to elective arthroplasty; Step 4 - implementation of a sustainable guideline to reduce unnecessary preoperative testing for asymptomatic bacteriuria prior to elective arthroplasty. Results: Retrospective chart review showed inconsistency in mid-stream urine (MSU) testing prior to elective arthroplasty (49 % preoperative MSU sent) and in antimicrobial prescribing for urinary tract infection (UTI) and ASB. No association was observed between organisms isolated from urine and joint aspirate in confirmed cases of PJI. Co-design of a guideline and decision support tool supported through an implementation strategy resulted in rapid uptake and adherence. Sustainability was demonstrated at 6 months. Conclusion: In this stepwise study, implementation science methodology was used to challenge outdated clinical practice, achieving a sustained reduction in unnecessary preoperative urine testing for ASB prior to elective arthroplasty.
