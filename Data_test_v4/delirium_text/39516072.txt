39516072|a|Innate immunity protein interferon induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is a transmembrane protein that has a wide array of functions, including in viral infections, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and cancer. As an interferon stimulated gene (ISG), IFITM3's expression is upregulated by type-I, II, and III interferons. Moreover, the antiviral activity of IFITM3 is modulated by post-translational modifications. IFITM3 functions in innate immunity to disrupt viral fusion and entry to the plasma membrane as well as prevent viral escape from endosomes. As a gamma-secretase modulatory protein, IFITM3 distinctly modulates the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate amyloid beta peptides (Abeta) and Notch1 cleavages. Increased IFITM3 expression, which can result from aging, cytokine activation, inflammation, and infection, can lead to an upregulation of gamma-secretase for Abeta production that causes a risk of AD. Therefore, the prevention of IFITM3 upregulation has potential in the development of novel therapies for the treatment of AD.
