32858227|t|The impact of Geriatric Emergency Department Innovations (GEDI) on health services use, health related quality of life, and costs: Protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
32858227|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Older adults (age 65 and older) use the emergency department (ED) at a rate of nearly 50 ED visits per 100 older adults, accounting for over 23 million ED visits in the US annually, up to 20% of all ED visits. These ED visits are sentinel health events as discharged patients often return to the ED, experience declines in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and disability, or are later hospitalized. Those who are admitted incur increased costs and greater risk for poor outcomes including infections, delirium, and falls. The objective of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate the efficacy of the Geriatric Emergency Department Innovations (GEDI) program, an ED nurse-led geriatric assessment and care coordination program, in decreasing unnecessary health services use and improving Health-Related Quality-of-Life (HRQoL) for older adults in the ED. METHODS: Community dwelling older adults aged 65 and older who are vulnerable or frail according to the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) during an ED visit will be randomized to either GEDI (n = 420) or to usual ED care (n = 420). Outcome variables will be assessed during the ED visit and at 7-11 days and 28-32 days post ED visit. PROJECTED OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is hospitalization or death within 30 days of the ED visit. Secondary outcomes include health service use outcomes (ED visits and hospitalizations), healthcare costs, and HRQoL outcomes [Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scores: PROMIS-Preference, Physical Function, Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities, Anxiety, and Depression]. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.Gov identifier NCT04115371.
