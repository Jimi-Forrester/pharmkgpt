21889608|a|Lipoprotein metabolism in the central nervous system (CNS) is based on high-density lipoprotein-like particles that use apoE as their predominant apolipoprotein rather than apoA-I. Although apoA-I is not expressed in astrocytes and microglia, which produce CNS apoE, apoA-I is reported to be expressed in porcine brain capillary endothelial cells and also crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB). These mechanisms allow apoA-I to reach concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that are approximately 0.5% of its plasma levels. Recently, apoA-I has been shown to enhance cognitive function and reduce cerebrovascular amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) mice, raising questions about the regulation and function of apoA-I in the CNS. Peripheral apoA-I metabolism is highly influenced by ABCA1, but less is known about how ABCA1 regulates CNS apoA-I. We report that ABCA1 deficiency leads to greater retention of apoA-I in the CNS than in the periphery. Additionally, treatment of symptomatic AD mice with GW3965, an LXR agonist that stimulates ABCA1 expression, increases apoA-I more dramatically in the CNS compared to the periphery. Furthermore, GW3965-mediated up-regulation of CNS apoA-I is independent of ABCA1. Our results suggest that apoA-I may be regulated by distinct mechanisms on either side of the BBB and that apoA-I may serve to integrate peripheral and CNS lipid metabolism.
