38731387|t|Evaluation of the Quality of Recovery from General Anesthesia in Dogs with Two Different Low Doses of Dexmedetomidine.
38731387|a|The purpose of this study was to evaluate the quality of recovery from general anesthesia with the administration of two low doses of dexmedetomidine in canine patients. For this blind randomized clinical trial study, 30 dogs undergoing general anesthesia for diagnostic procedures or elective surgery (ovariectomy/castration) were included. The patients were randomly divided into three groups, and at the end of anesthesia, they received a bolus of dexmedetomidine at 1 mcg/kg IV (D1), or a bolus of dexmedetomidine at 0.5 mcg/kg (D0.5), or a bolus of NaCl, in a total of 0.5 mL of solution for all three groups. After administration of the bolus, the anesthetist monitored the patients every 5 min by measuring heart rate, systolic and mean blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The quality of recovery was also assessed using 4 different scales. The extubation time, time of headlift, and standing position were also recorded. Both groups receiving dexmedetomidine had better awakening and a lower incidence of delirium when compared to saline administration. The heart rate was lower, while the systolic pressure was higher in the two groups D1 and D0.5 compared to the NaCl with a low presence of atrioventricular blocks. The extubation time resulted significantly higher in the D1 (17 +- 6 min) compared to the D0.5 (10 +- 4 min) and NaCl (8 +- 3 min) (p < 0.0001); the headlift time D1 (25 +- 10 min) resulted significantly longer than the NaCl group (11 +- 5 min) (p = 0.0023) but not than the D0.5 (18 +- 9 min). No significant differences were found among the three groups for standing positioning (D1 50 +- 18 min, D0.5 39 +- 22 min, NaCl 28 +- 17 min). The preventive administration of a bolus of dexmedetomidine at a dosage of 0.5 mcg/kg or 1 mcg/kg IV during the recovery phase improves the quality of recovery in patients undergoing general anesthesia.
