38973975|t|Examining Psychological Factors in Peripheral Artery Disease: Affective Temperament, Anxiety, and Depression in Patients Undergoing Revascularization Procedures.
38973975|a|Purpose: This study aimed to assess the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients, correlating these symptoms with clinical parameters and examining affective temperaments within the study group. Material and Methods: A total of 159 PAD patients, predominantly male, admitted for vascular surgery due to lower limb atherosclerosis, participated in this cross-sectional study. Various assessments were conducted, including the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A) for affective temperaments, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) for anxiety and depression symptoms, and the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for pain intensity. Additionally, the Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) was measured to assess circulation in the legs. Results: The findings revealed a higher prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the PAD patient group compared to the control group. Notably, depressive and anxiety symptoms correlated with the severity of PAD, as indicated by lower ABI values in the operated leg. Patients undergoing surgical revascularizations exhibited higher depressive symptoms than those undergoing endovascular procedures. Furthermore, correlations were observed between depressive symptoms and the number of previous vascular procedures and amputations, alongside increased pain levels at admission. Clinical factors such as diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, previous revascularization procedures, amputations, and the intensity of affective temperaments did not correlate with HADS scores. Discussion: The study highlighted the intricate relationship between mood disorders and PAD severity, emphasizing the potential prognostic implications of untreated depression and anxiety in PAD patients. These findings suggest the importance of closely monitoring and addressing psychological well-being in PAD management. However, the study encountered limitations such as varying assessment timing and sample size discrepancies among comorbidities, impacting the observation of associations between mood disorders and certain conditions. Conclusion: In conclusion, depressive and anxiety symptoms are often in PAD. Further research is needed to explore therapeutic interventions targeting mental health and pain management to improve the course and outcomes of PAD.
