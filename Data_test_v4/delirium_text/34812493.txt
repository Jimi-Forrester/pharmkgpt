34812493|a|In interactions with caregivers, patients with dementia have communication challenges that are common and worrisome to families. Family and professional caregivers find it challenging to "guess" or "interpret" what their patients with dementia are trying to tell them. In this creative controversy article, we discuss how family and professional caregivers can seek to understand and correctly interpret the nonverbal communications of patients with dementia (behaviors, actions, facial expressions, and vocal sounds). Equipping family and professional caregivers with the resources to interpret the nonverbal communications of patients with dementia requires a commitment to in-service and family education in healthcare facilities. Nurses could play a critical role in raising the awareness among the public about the potential changes and declines in verbal communications of the patients with dementia.
