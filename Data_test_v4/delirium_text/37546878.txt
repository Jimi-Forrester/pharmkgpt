37546878|a|Metabolic dysregulation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). While metabolic dysregulation is a common link between these two tauopathies, a comprehensive brain metabolic comparison of the diseases has not yet been performed. We analyzed 342 postmortem brain samples from the Mayo Clinic Brain Bank and examined 658 metabolites in the cerebellar cortex and the temporal cortex between the two tauopathies. Our findings indicate that both diseases display oxidative stress associated with lipid metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction linked to lysine metabolism, and an indication of tau-induced polyamine stress response. However, specific to AD, we detected glutathione-related neuroinflammation, deregulations of enzymes tied to purines, and cognitive deficits associated with vitamin B. Taken together, our findings underscore vast alterations in the brain's metabolome, illuminating shared neurodegenerative pathways and disease-specific traits in AD and PSP.
