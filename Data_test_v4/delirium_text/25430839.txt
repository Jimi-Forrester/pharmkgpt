25430839|a|Often fatal and under-recognised, delirium is a common condition. The person can be hyperactive or hypoactive but the hypoactive form is more common in older people. Although a single factor can lead to delirium, in older people it is more likely to be multifactorial and could be a marker of a vulnerable brain with reduced reserve capacity.
