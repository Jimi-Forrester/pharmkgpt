32873367|t|Rehabilitation During COVID-19 Pandemic: An Indian Perspective.
32873367|a|It has been noted that as high as 20.3% of patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) require intensive care unit (ICU) admission. This has most commonly been attributed to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. These patients require prolonged periods of ICU stay, averaging approximately 20 days. As people recover and are discharged, there will be a new pandemic of critical illness survivors. These patients would present with impairments and disabilities arising because of prolonged ICU stay as well as consequences of severe respiratory illness. The longer the duration of ICU stay, the higher is the risk for long-term physical, cognitive, and emotional impairments needing comprehensive and early rehabilitation. This article focuses on the indispensable role of early and interdisciplinary rehabilitation in effective disaster management, restoring functions, and improving quality of life in COVID survivors. It outlines how to practically expand rehabilitation services in a resource-limited country, such as India, and lists the limitations being faced that prevent the uniform application of rehabilitation services in India. This would help to deal with the rapid increase in demand of postacute care facilities, be it in hospital services, in the form of inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation or home care facilities, including telemedicine.
