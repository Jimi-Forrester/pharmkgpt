36365240|t|Curcumin-Loaded Oil-Free Self-Assembled Micelles Inhibit the Influenza A Virus Activity and the Solidification of Curcumin-Loaded Micelles for Pharmaceutical Applications.
36365240|a|Curcumin, a well-known natural lipophilic phenolic compound, plays a vital role in inhibiting the influenza infection. Currently, many kinds of formulations for the enhancement of a water dispersion of curcumin have been developed; however, the anti-influenza abilities of formulated curcumin have been much less investigated. In this study, the optimized self-assembled micelles of RH 40/Tween 80 loaded with curcumin (Cur-M) in an oil-free-based system were spherical with a hydrodynamic size at 13.55 nm +- 0.208 and polydispersity at 0.144 characterized by atomic force microscopy and dynamic light scattering, respectively. Additionally, Cur-M significantly increased the bioactivity/stability of curcumin and effectively inhibited the influenza A virus infection and its replication after viral entry, indicating the alteration of the inhibition mechanisms of curcumin against virus infection via RH 40/Tween 80 micelle formulation. Furthermore, a solid formulation (Cur-SM) of Cur-M was successfully developed by a one-pot physical adsorption method using a small amount of adsorbent and ~50% of curcumin/Cur-M that could be burst released from Cur-SM in 1 h, facilitating the fast-releasing applications. Ultimately, all of the results show that Cur-SM acts as a good nano-formulation of curcumin with improved solubility/dispersity in aqueous solutions and demonstrate new anti-influenza mechanisms of curcumin for pharmaceutical development.
