38375047|t|Chemical composition and pharmacological activity of seco-prezizaane-type sesquiterpenes.
38375047|a|The seco-prezizaane-type sesquiterpenes (SPS), as a special class of sesquiterpenes with a highly oxidative five-ring cage structure and seven consecutive chiral centers, are isolated from the genus Illicium, which have a variety of biological activities, including neurotoxicity and neurotrophic effects, etc. This review summarizes the chemical constituents and pharmacological effects of SPS, and discusses the potential trend and scope of future research.
