23017429|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is considered to worsen life prognosis in elderly patients with stroke. We examined the effects of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon for treating delirium in elderly stroke patients with insomnia in comparison to the other drugs. METHODS: Elderly patients with delirium and insomnia after acute stroke who were treated with ramelteon (7 patients; mean age 76 years) and the other drugs (21 patients; mean age 77.3 years) between July 2011 and March 2012 at our hospital were retrospectively examined. RESULTS: All patients treated with ramelteon had a significant improvement within a week and were started on early and aggressive rehabilitation. No patient experienced oversedation, neurologic deterioration, or any other worsening effect associated with ramelteon treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin receptor agonists may be effective for the treatment of delirium in elderly patients with acute stroke.
