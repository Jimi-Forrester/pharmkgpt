38758999|t|Associations of Allostatic Load with Level of and Change in Cognitive Function Among Middle-Aged and Older Hispanic/Latino Adults: The Study of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging (SOL-INCA).
38758999|a|Background: Higher allostatic load (AL), a multi-system measure of physiological dysregulation considered a proxy for chronic stress exposure, is associated with poorer global cognition (GC) in older non-Hispanic white adults. However, evidence of these associations in middle-aged and older US-based Hispanic/Latino adults is limited. Objective: To examine associations of AL with level of cognition, performance in cognition 7 years later, and change in cognition over 7 years among middle-aged and older US-based Hispanic/Latino adults. Methods: We used data (n = 5,799, 45-74 years at baseline) from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) and SOL-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging (SOL-INCA). The AL score comprised 16 biomarkers representing cardiometabolic, glucose, cardiopulmonary, parasympathetic, and inflammatory systems (higher scores = greater dysregulation). Cognitive outcomes included GC and individual tests of verbal learning and memory, world fluency (WF), Digit Symbol Substitution (DSS), and Trail Making (Parts A & B). Survey-linear regressions assessed associations of AL with performance in cognition at baseline, 7 years later, and via 7-year cognitive change scores adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, and depressive symptoms. Results: Higher AL was associated with lower baseline performance in GC and WF; and lower 7-year follow-up performance in these same measures plus DSS and Trail Making Parts A & B. Higher AL was associated with more pronounced 7-year change (reduction) in GC and on WF and DSS tests. Conclusions: Findings extend previous evidence in predominantly older non-Hispanic white cohorts to show that AL is related to level of and change in GC (as well as WF and DSS) among middle-aged and older US-based Hispanic/Latino adults.
