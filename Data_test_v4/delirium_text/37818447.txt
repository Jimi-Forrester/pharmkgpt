37818447|a|Brain metastases in breast cancer (BC) patients are often associated with a poor prognosis. Recent studies have uncovered the critical roles of miRNAs in the initiation and progression of BC brain metastasis, highlighting the disease's underlying molecular pathways. miRNA-181c, miRNA-10b, and miRNA-21, for example, are all overexpressed in BC patients. It has been shown that these three miRNAs help tumors grow and metastasize by targeting genes that control how cells work. On the other hand, miRNA-26b5p, miRNA-7, and miRNA-1013p are all downregulated in BC brain metastasis patients. They act as tumor suppressors by controlling the expression of genes related to cell adhesion, angiogenesis, and invasion. Therapeutic miRNA targeting has considerable promise in treating BC brain metastases. Several strategies have been proposed to modulate miRNA expression, including miRNA-Mimics, antagomirs, and small molecule inhibitors of miRNA biogenesis. This review discusses the aberrant expression of miRNAs and metastatic pathways that lead to the spread of BC cells to the brain. It also explores miRNA therapeutic target molecular mechanisms and BC brain metastasis challenges with advanced strategies. The targeting of certain miRNAs opens a new door for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for this devastating disease.
