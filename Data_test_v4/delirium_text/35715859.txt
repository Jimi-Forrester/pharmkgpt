35715859|t|Targeting choroid plexus epithelium as a novel therapeutic strategy for hydrocephalus.
35715859|a|The choroid plexus is a tissue located in the lateral ventricles of the brain and is composed mainly of choroid plexus epithelium cells. The main function is currently thought to be the secretion of cerebrospinal fluid and the regulation of its pH, and more functions are gradually being demonstrated. Assistance in the removal of metabolic waste and participation in the apoptotic pathway are also the functions of choroid plexus. Besides, it helps to repair the brain by regulating the secretion of neuropeptides and the delivery of drugs. It is involved in the immune response to assist in the clearance of infections in the central nervous system. It is now believed that the choroid plexus is in an inflammatory state after damage to the brain. This state, along with changes in the cilia, is thought to be an abnormal physiological state of the choroid plexus, which in turn leads to abnormal conditions in cerebrospinal fluid and triggers hydrocephalus. This review describes the pathophysiological mechanism of hydrocephalus following choroid plexus epithelium cell abnormalities based on the normal physiological functions of choroid plexus epithelium cells, and analyzes the attempts and future developments of using choroid plexus epithelium cells as a therapeutic target for hydrocephalus.
