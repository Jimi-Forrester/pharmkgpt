35834360|a|BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious complication related to cardiac surgery. Several studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine administration on AKI prevention. OBJECTIVE: To assess if dexmedetomidine is associated with a protective effect of renal function after cardiac surgery. And the aim of conducting this meta-analysis is to summarize the literature and determine the clinical utility of dexmedetomidine administration in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases were comprehensively searched for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published before 1 December, 2021 that investigated the effect of dexmedetomidine on AKI prevention. RESULTS: Our analysis included 16 studies involving 2148 patients. Compared with the control group, dexmedetomidine administration significantly reduced AKI incidence (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.36-0.61; p <  0.00001; I2 = 26%) and the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) but did not alter mortality rate, length of stay in the hospital, and mechanical ventilation time. Furthermore, the incidence of delirium among patients treated with dexmedetomidine was significantly decreased. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine administration has a positive effect on preventing AKI and postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery and significantly reduces the length of stay in the ICU.
