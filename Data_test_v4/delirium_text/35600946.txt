35600946|t|Effect of Programmed Comprehensive Nursing for Postoperative Delirium in Intensive Care Unit Patients.
35600946|a|Background: This study is to evaluate the effect of programmed comprehensive nursing for postoperative delirium in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Methods: A total of 90 cases of ICU surgery patients admitted to our hospital from July 2019 to July 2020 were recruited and assigned via the random number table method (1 : 1) to receive either conventional nursing (control group) or programmed comprehensive nursing (experimental group). The delirium assessment method was used to record the incidence of delirium events at different time points after the intervention. Outcome measures included delirium events, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores, the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores, the activities of daily living (ADL) scale scores, nursing satisfaction, and total nursing efficiency. Results: Programmed comprehensive nursing was associated with significantly better nursing satisfaction, ADL scores, VAS scores, PSQI scores, and nursing efficiency than conventional nursing (all P < 0.05). Programmed comprehensive nursing resulted in a significantly lower incidence of postoperative delirium than conventional nursing (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The application of programmed comprehensive nursing for postoperative delirium in ICU patients shows a promising efficiency, effectively alleviates the clinical symptoms of patients, and optimizes various clinical indicators of patients; hence, it is worthy of further application and promotion.
