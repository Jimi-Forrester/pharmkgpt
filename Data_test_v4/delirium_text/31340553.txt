31340553|a|The synthesis and application of porphyrins has seen a huge shift towards research in porphyrin bio-molecular based systems in the past decade. The preferential localization of porphyrins in tumors, as well as their ability to generate reactive singlet oxygen and low dark toxicities has resulted in their use in therapeutic applications such as photodynamic therapy. However, their inherent lack of bio-distribution due to water insolubility has shifted research into porphyrin-nanomaterial conjugated systems to address this challenge. This has broadened their bio-applications, viz. bio-sensors, fluorescence tracking, in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT imaging to photo-immuno-therapy just to highlight a few. This paper reviews the unique theranostic role of porphyrins in disease diagnosis and therapy. The review highlights porphyrin conjugated systems and their applications. The review ends by bringing current challenges and future perspectives of porphyrin based conjugated systems and their respective applications into light.
