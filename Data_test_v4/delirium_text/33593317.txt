METHODS: A case-controlled study design have conducted at department of psychiatry of Shenzhen Longgang Center for Chronic Disease Control in Shenzhen, China mainland from 7th April to 15th June 2020.1674 participants (aged 18 to 65 years) in quarantine for 2 weeks and 1743 age-sex matched controls living in Shenzhen were recruited between 7th April 2020 and 15th June 2020. The assessment of depressive, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms were determined by self-reported questionnaires PHQ-9, GAD-7, and ISI, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 1674 participants in quarantine for 2 weeks and 1743 age-sex matched controls (32.6 +- 9.3 years vs. 32.7 +- 10.7 years, 49.8% vs. 47.8% females) were recruited. Population in quarantine had higher score on PHQ-9 (6.1 +- 5.5 vs. 3.0 +- 3.7, p < 0.001), GAD-7 (4.2 +- 4.7 vs. 1.9 +- 3.7, p < 0 001), and ISI (5.5 +- 5.8 vs. 3.1 +- 5.0%, p < 0.001) compared to general population. Population in quarantine showed significantly higher risks of depression (OR: 4.55, 95% CI: 3.82-5.41), anxiety (OR: 2.92, 95% CI: 2.43-3.51), and insomnia (OR: 2.40, 95% CI: 2.02-2.89), when compared to the general population. Younger, more education, non-married and lower household income showed higher risks of mental health problems.
