16944320|a|Deciphering what governs inflammation and its effects on tissues is vital for understanding many pathologies. The recent discovery that glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) promotes inflammation reveals a new component of its well-documented actions in several prevalent diseases which involve inflammation, including mood disorders, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and cancer. Involvement in such disparate conditions stems from the widespread influences of GSK3 on many cellular functions, with this review focusing on its regulation of inflammatory processes. GSK3 promotes the production of inflammatory molecules and cell migration, which together make GSK3 a powerful regulator of inflammation, while GSK3 inhibition provides protection from inflammatory conditions in animal models. The involvement of GSK3 and inflammation in these diseases are highlighted. Thus, GSK3 may contribute not only to primary pathologies in these diseases, but also to the associated inflammation, suggesting that GSK3 inhibitors may have multiple effects influencing these conditions.
