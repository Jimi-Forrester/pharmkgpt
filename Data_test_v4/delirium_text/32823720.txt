32823720|t|Comparison of Opioid-Free Anesthesia Versus Opioid-Containing Anesthesia for Elective Laparoscopic Surgery (COFA: LAP): A Protocol Measuring Recovery Outcomes.
32823720|a|The administration of opioids is a central element in contemporary anesthetic techniques in Australia; however, opioids have a range of side effects. As an alternative, opioid-free anesthesia (OFA) is an emerging mode of anesthesia intended to avoid these side effects. This study is the first to publish the use of OFA in Australia and is conducted in a regional Queensland Health Service. The design will utilize a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to investigate the impact of OFA for patients having an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 40) or tubal ligation (n = 40). Participant outcomes to be measured include: Quality of Recovery (QoR-15); Oral Morphine Equivalent Daily Dose (OMEDD) at 24-h post-operatively; time to first opioid (TTFO) dose; post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV); Post Anesthetic Care Unit length of stay (PACU-LOS); and hospital length of stay (LOS). The findings may challenge the essentiality of opioids in the peri-operative period, which in turn would influence the future intra-operative management of surgical patients. Ultimately, a reduction in anesthesia-associated opioid use will support a more general decline in opioid use.
