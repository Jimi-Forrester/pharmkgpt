39498303|a|Previous studies determined that Pyk2 is involved in several diseases in which the symptomatology presents alterations in energy balance. However, its role in obesity is poorly understood. To evaluate the metabolic role of the Pyk2 gene (PTK2B) in children and adolescents with obesity we measured its mRNA expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. For that we performed a cross-sectional study involving 130 Caucasian subjects that was divided into two groups according to BMI. Data showed increased PTK2B mRNA expression in children and adolescents with obesity. Interestingly, a positive correlation has been found between the levels of PTK2B with weight, BMI, BMI Z score, fat mass, waist circumference, waist to height ratio, diastolic blood pressure, and leptin. In addition, it is indicated that high levels of PTK2B gene expression might be a predictor of obesity development. This work provides important insights into the previously undescribed role of Pyk2 in obesity.
