39064650|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the prevalence of malnutrition and its determinants in older adults living in French Caribbean nursing homes. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was taken from the KASEHAD (Karukera Study of Ageing in EHPAD) study. Nutritional status was assessed with the Mini Nutritional Assessment Short-Form (MNA-SF). Clinical characteristics and scores on geriatric scales (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CESD) and Questionnaire Quality of Life Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD)) were extracted. Bivariate analysis and logistic models adjusted were performed to test the association between nutritional status and both socio-demographic variables and geriatric scales. RESULTS: A total of 332 older adults from six nursing homes were included in the KASEHPAD study. Among the participants, 319 had an MNA-SF score. The mean age was 81.3 +- 10.6 years, and half of the participants were men. The frequency of malnutrition (MNA-SF <= 7) was 27.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 22.0-32.5) (n = 88). Based on the multivariable analysis, a low MMSE was associated with malnutrition (OR: 0.81 (0.68-0.92); p = 0.015) and there was a borderline significant link between a higher CESD score and malnutrition (OR: 1.05 (1.00-1.12); p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive decline and a tendency toward depression were associated with malnutrition in nursing homes in the French West Indies. Although this study cannot establish causal relationships, the identification of these three geriatric syndromes in nursing homes is crucial for preventing adverse health events.
