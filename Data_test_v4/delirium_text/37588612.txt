37588612|a|Fermented seasonings are widely used in Korean cuisine; however, some contain high levels of biogenic amines (BAs). In this study, in order to estimate the potential BA risk from fermented seasoning, the BA contents in 50 commercial brands (n = 292) of five seasonings (soy sauce, Gochujang, Doenjang, Ssamjang, and Cheonggukjang) and their changes due to different cooking methods were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography. The risk assessment for consumer exposure was evaluated by computing the estimated daily intake (EDI), histamine (HIS) intake, and tyramine (TYR) intake. Maximum contents of HIS detected in Cheonggukjang, soy sauce, Doenjang, and Ssamjang were 318.46, 148.15, 123.65, and 114.07 mg/kg, respectively. However, even in the worst-case scenario, the EDI value and HIS intake results demonstrated that the seasonings had a limited impact on the risk of HIS poisoning due to their low consumption. Cheonggukjang exhibited the highest TYR content (312.89 mg/kg), and the TYR exposure results implied that those taking classical antidepressant monoamine oxidase inhibitors should pay attention to Cheonggukjang. After stir-frying, the total BA retentions in soy sauce and Gochujang were only 51.45% and 57.08%, respectively, which may be caused by high temperature. Based on the results of this study, the five seasonings contained various BAs, which can be influenced by the cooking process, and all five seasonings are safe for the general population in terms of the risk of BAs.
