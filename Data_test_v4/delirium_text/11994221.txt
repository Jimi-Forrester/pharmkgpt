11994221|t|Comparison of healthcare utilization and direct costs in three degenerative dementias.
11994221|a|The authors conducted a survey of healthcare utilization in three dementia syndromes to determine whether type of dementia influenced utilization or resulting direct costs. Patients with Alzheimer disease (n=131), dementia with parkinsonism (n=85), and Huntington disease (n=51) were identified from a registry and enrolled. Caregivers completed the mailed survey, and direct costs were estimated. The presence of dementia with parkinsonism resulted in significantly greater utilization of long-term care services and higher total direct costs. In all three groups, long-term care costs accounted for the majority of direct costs. Unique patterns of utilization and costs are seen in specific neurodegenerative dementias.
