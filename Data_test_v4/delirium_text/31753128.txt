31753128|t|Chronic neurological disorders and related comorbidities: Role of age-associated physiological changes.
31753128|a|Current knowledge indicates that the physiological aging process starts with subclinical changes at the molecular and cellular level, which affect nearly all physiological systems. For example, the age-associated remodeling of the immune system (i.e., immunosenescence) and vascular aging per se can contribute to frailty and vulnerability among older adults. They are also described as being implicated in the pathophysiology of some major chronic comorbid conditions such as age-associated diseases of the central (e.g., stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and related disorders) and peripheral (e.g., polyneuropathy) nervous systems. These neurologic disorders are also among the greatest contributors to geriatric syndromes, which refer to highly prevalent and chronic conditions among aged people of multifactorial origin, such as delirium, falls, incontinence, and frailty. Neurologic disorders can also occur in patients with one or more geriatric syndromes and thus further interfere with the quality of life, physical function, morbidity, and mortality. This chapter presents and discusses in three sections the complex interrelationships between the main determinants of aging with a specific focus on vascular aging, chronic neurologic disorders, and the specific clinical presentation of geriatric syndromes in older people.
