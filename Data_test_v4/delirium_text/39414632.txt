39414632|a|PURPOSE: This study aimed to identify associated risk factors for mortality in octogenarian trauma patients undergoing urgent or emergent laparotomy (UEL). METHODS: Trauma patients ages 80-89 years-old undergoing UEL within 6-hours of arrival were included. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine associated risk of mortality. RESULTS: From 701 octogenarians undergoing UEL, 324 (46.2%) died. Compared to survivors, UEL octogenarians who died had higher rates of cirrhosis (3.5% vs. 1.1%, p = 0.028), injuries to the brain (17.3% vs. 5.6%, p < 0.001), heart (8.6% vs. 1.6%, p < 0.001), and lung (57.4% vs. 23.9%, p < 0.001) and lower rates of functional independence (6.4% vs. 12.6%, p = 0.007). The strongest independent associated patient-related risk factor for death was cirrhosis (OR 8.28, CI 2.25-30.46, p = 0.001). However, undergoing concurrent thoracotomy increased risk of death significantly (OR 16.59, CI 2.07-132.76, p = 0.008). Functional independence was not associated with mortality (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: This national analysis emphasizes the need to identify and manage pre-existing conditions like cirrhosis and not determine futility based on pre-trauma functional status alone. Concurrent thoracotomy for hemorrhage control increases risk of death over 16-fold.
