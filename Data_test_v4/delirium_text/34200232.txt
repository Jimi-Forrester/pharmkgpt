34200232|t|Differential Epigenetic Signature of Corticospinal Motor Neurons in ALS.
34200232|a|Corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN) are an indispensable neuron population for the motor neuron circuitry. They are excitatory projection neurons, which collect information from different regions of the brain and transmit it to spinal cord targets, initiating and controlling motor function. CSMN degeneration is pronounced cellular event in motor neurons diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Genetic mutations contribute to only about ten percent of ALS. Thus understanding the involvement of other factors, such as epigenetic controls, is immensely valuable. Here, we investigated epigenomic signature of CSMN that become diseased due to misfolded SOD1 toxicity and TDP-43 pathology, by performing quantitative analysis of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethycytosine (5hmC) expression profiles during end-stage of the disease in hSOD1G93A, and prpTDP-43A315T mice. Our analysis revealed that expression of 5mC was specifically reduced in CSMN of both hSOD1G93A and prpTDP-43A315T mice. However, 5hmC expression was increased in the CSMN that becomes diseased due to misfolded SOD1 and decreased in CSMN that degenerates due to TDP-43 pathology. These results suggest the presence of a distinct difference between different underlying causes. These differential epigenetic events might modulate the expression profiles of select genes, and ultimately contribute to the different paths that lead to CSMN vulnerability in ALS.
