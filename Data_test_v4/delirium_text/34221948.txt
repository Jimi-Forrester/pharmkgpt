34221948|t|Intraoperative Hypotension Increased Risk in the Oncological Patient.
34221948|a|Patient safety advocacy involves avoiding, preventing, and amelioration of adverse outcomes or injuries caused by the process of healthcare rather than a patient's underlying medical illness. Intraoperative hypotension (IOH), a common morbid event, reduces perfusion to critical organs and tissues and has a wide incidence, depending on how it is defined. IOH has adverse intraoperative and postoperative consequences, which make its prevention important to improve patient outcomes. Certain populations have even greater consequences related to IOH, and clinicians must understand these risks. In this narrative review, we examine the risk of intraoperative hypotension in the oncological patient population.
