18298733|a|Banana, orange, and apple are the major fruits in Western and Asian diets. In order to find the effects of these fruits, neuron like PC12 cells were exposed to the extracts of these fruits before H(2)O(2) treatment. We found a significant viability of PC12 cells by the MTT reduction test, which indicated that the phenolics of banana, orange, and apple fruits prevented oxidative stress-induced neurotoxicity. Additional tests by lactate dehydrogenase and trypan blue exclusion assays showed that the extracts reduced oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell membrane damage. These results suggest that fresh apples, banana, and orange in our daily diet along with other fruits may protect neuron cells against oxidative stress-induced neurotoxicity and may play an important role in reducing the risk of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.
