27602722|t|Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Amyloid beta-Peptide (1-42): Tetramer Formation and Membrane Interactions.
27602722|a|The aggregation cascade and peptide-membrane interactions of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) have been implicated as toxic events in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Abeta42 forms oligomers and ultimately plaques, and it has been hypothesized that these oligomeric species are the main toxic species contributing to neuronal cell death. To better understand oligomerization events and subsequent oligomer-membrane interactions of Abeta42, we performed atomistic molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize both interpeptide interactions and perturbation of model membranes by the peptides. MD simulations were utilized to first show the formation of a tetramer unit by four separate Abeta42 peptides. Abeta42 tetramers adopted an oblate ellipsoid shape and showed a significant increase in beta-strand formation in the final tetramer unit relative to the monomers, indicative of on-pathway events for fibril formation. The Abeta42 tetramer unit that formed in the initial simulations was used in subsequent MD simulations in the presence of a pure POPC or cholesterol-rich raft model membrane. Tetramer-membrane simulations resulted in elongation of the tetramer in the presence of both model membranes, with tetramer-raft interactions giving rise to the rearrangement of key hydrophobic regions in the tetramer and the formation of a more rod-like structure indicative of a fibril-seeding aggregate. Membrane perturbation by the tetramer was manifested in the form of more ordered, rigid membranes, with the pure POPC being affected to a greater extent than the raft membrane. These results provide critical atomistic insight into the aggregation pathway of Abeta42 and a putative toxic mechanism in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
