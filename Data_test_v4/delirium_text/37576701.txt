37576701|a|The human intestine is a natural environment ecosystem of a complex of diversified and dynamic microorganisms, determined through a process of competition and natural selection during life. Those intestinal microorganisms called microbiota and are involved in a variety of mechanisms of the organism, they interact with the host and therefore are in contact with the organs of the various systems. However, they play a crucial role in maintaining host homeostasis, also influencing its behaviour. Thus, microorganisms perform a series of biological functions important for human well-being. The host provides the microorganisms with the environment and nutrients, simultaneously drawing many benefits such as their contribution to metabolic, trophic, immunological, and other functions. For these reasons it has been reported that its quantitative and qualitative composition can play a protective or harmful role on the host health. Therefore, a dysbiosis can lead to an association of unfavourable factors which lead to a dysregulation of the physiological processes of homeostasis. Thus, it has pre-viously noted that the gut microbiota can participate in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, chronic intestinal inflammation, diabetes mellitus, obesity and atherosclerosis, neurological disorders (e.g., neurological diseases, autism, etc.) colorectal cancer, and more.
