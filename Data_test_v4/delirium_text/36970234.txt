36970234|t|A case of intravascular lymphoma presenting with a lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum.
36970234|a|Intravascular lymphoma (IVL) is difficult to diagnose because its clinical presentation and laboratory and imaging findings are nonspecific. Herein, we report a case of IVL presenting as a lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum. A 52-year-old man attended the emergency department with a 2-week history of progressively worsening abnormal behavior and gait disturbance. Magnetic resonance imaging on admission revealed an oval lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum. The follow-up magnetic resonance imaging performed 2 months after disease onset revealed multiple high-signal areas in the bilateral cerebral white matter on T2-weighted images and diffusion-weighted images. The blood test results showed an elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase and serum-soluble interleukin-2 receptor. These findings were compatible with the diagnosis of IVL. IVL is often difficult to diagnose due to a wide variety of clinical presentations and imaging findings.
