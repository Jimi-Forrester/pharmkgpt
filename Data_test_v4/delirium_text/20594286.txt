20594286|a|The Japanese herbal medicine, yokukansan, has been reported to improve behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia and activities of daily living in patients with dementia. In the present case report, the authors report the effectiveness of yokukansan in treating psychiatric symptoms after traumatic brain injury. An 85-year-old man, who underwent surgery for hepatic portal cholangiocarcinoma, sustained traumatic brain injury after falling from bed as the result of postoperative delirium. He subsequently presented with psychiatric symptoms, showing markedly impulsive and aggressive behavior. Neuroleptics did not alleviate the symptoms. Ultimately, we succeeded in controlling the symptoms, without adverse effects, by giving the patient yokukansan. Yokukansan shows the potential for reducing aggressive and impulsive behavior in dementia as well as in other psychiatric diseases.
