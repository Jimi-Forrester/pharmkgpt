24190277|a|Elderly hip fracture patients, with and without cognitive decline, constitute an important target group for prevention. This patient group is at high-risk for in-hospital complications such as delirium, infection, pneumonia, fall, pressure ulcer and urinary tract infection. The aim of this paper is to highlight clinical pathways to meet the special care needs of older patients who have undergone treatment for a hip fracture and to ensure their rights to basic health and social care.
