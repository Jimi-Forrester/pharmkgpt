30009199|a|OBJECTIVE: Amyloid beta (Abeta) depositions in plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) represent common features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sequential deposition of post-translationally modified Abeta in plaques characterizes distinct biochemical stages of Abeta maturation. However, the molecular composition of vascular Abeta deposits in CAA and its relation to plaques remain enigmatic. METHODS: Vascular and parenchymal deposits were immunohistochemically analyzed for pyroglutaminated and phosphorylated Abeta in the medial temporal and occipital lobe of 24 controls, 27 pathologically-defined preclinical AD, and 20 symptomatic AD cases. RESULTS: Sequential deposition of Abeta in CAA resembled Abeta maturation in plaques and enabled the distinction of three biochemical stages of CAA. B-CAA stage 1 was characterized by deposition of Abeta in the absence of pyroglutaminated AbetaN3pE and phosphorylated AbetapS8. B-CAA stage 2 showed additional AbetaN3pE and B-CAA stage 3 additional AbetapS8. Based on the Abeta maturation staging in CAA and plaques, three case groups for Abeta pathology could be distinguished: group 1 with advanced Abeta maturation in CAA; group 2 with equal Abeta maturation in CAA and plaques; group 3 with advanced Abeta maturation in plaques. All symptomatic AD cases presented with end-stage plaque maturation, whereas CAA could exhibit immature Abeta deposits. Notably, Abeta pathology group 1 was associated with arterial hypertension, and group 2 with the development of dementia. INTERPRETATION: Balance of Abeta maturation in CAA and plaques defines distinct pathological subgroups of beta-amyloidosis. The association of CAA-related Abeta maturation with cognitive decline, the individual contribution of CAA and plaque pathology to the development of dementia within the defined Abeta pathology subgroups, and the subgroup-related association with arterial hypertension should be considered for differential diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.
