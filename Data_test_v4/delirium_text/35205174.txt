35205174|t|Pb Induces MCP-1 in the Choroid Plexus.
35205174|a|Lead (Pb) is an environmental element that has been implicated in the development of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additionally, innate immune activation contributes to AD pathophysiology. However, the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. The choroid plexus (CP) is not only the site of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production, but also an important location for communication between the circulation and the CSF. In this study, we investigated the involvement of the CP during Pb exposure by evaluating the expression of the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). MCP-1 is highly expressed in the CP compared to other CNS tissues. MCP-1 regulates macrophage infiltration and is upregulated in AD brains. Our study revealed that Pb exposure stimulated MCP-1 expression, along with a significantly increased macrophage infiltration into the CP. By using cultured Z310 rat CP cells, Pb exposure stimulated MCP-1 expression in a dose-related fashion and markedly activated both NF-kappaB and p38 MAP kinase. Interestingly, both SB 203580, a p38 inhibitor, and BAY 11-7082, an NF-kappaB p65 inhibitor, significantly blocked Pb-induced MCP-1 expression. However, SB203580 did not directly inhibit NF-kappaB p65 phosphorylation. In conclusion, Pb exposure stimulates MCP-1 expression via the p38 and NF-kappaB p65 pathways along with macrophage infiltration into the CP.
