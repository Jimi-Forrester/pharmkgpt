19679909|a|OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to estimate the survival of patients with dementia and to evaluate change in prognosis over time. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Individuals attending a day care center for dementia in a 10 year period were followed until December 1st 1996 or until death. These individuals are quite repres notentative for demented patients living in this area. RESULTS: Of 180 individuals, 167 had either been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or multi infarct dementia. Ninety seven had died during follow up. Crude survival as well as relative survival was calculated with regards to the onset of symptoms of dementia. Patients with Alzheimer's disease seemed to live 40% shorter than age and gender matched individuals in the society. CONCLUSION: Dementia is correlated with a definite shortening of survival. Patients in this time period seem to live longer than patients diagnosed 10-15 years earlier but any comparison is hampered by different methods of diagnosis.
