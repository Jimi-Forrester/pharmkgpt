32925047|t|Cognitive, Genetic, Brain Volume, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging Markers as Early Indicators of Dementia.
32925047|a|BACKGROUND: Although associated with dementia and cognitive impairment, microstructural white matter integrity is a rarely used marker of preclinical dementia. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the individual and combined effects of multiple markers, with special focus on microstructural white matter integrity, in detecting individuals with increased dementia risk. METHODS: A dementia-free subsample (n = 212, mean age = 71.33 years) included in the population-based Swedish National Study on Aging and Care (SNAC-K) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (T1-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, diffusion tensor imaging), neuropsychological testing (perceptual speed, episodic memory, semantic memory, letter and category fluency), and genotyping (APOE). Incident dementia was assessed during six years of follow-up. RESULTS: A global model (global cognition, APOE, total brain tissue volume: AUC = 0.920) rendered the highest predictive value for future dementia. Of the models based on specific markers, white matter integrity of the forceps major tract was included in the most predictive model, in combination with perceptual speed and hippocampal volume (AUC = 0.911). CONCLUSION: Assessment of microstructural white matter integrity may improve the early detection of dementia, although the added benefit in this study was relatively small.
