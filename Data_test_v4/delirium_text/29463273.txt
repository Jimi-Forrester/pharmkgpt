29463273|a|BACKGROUND: Oblique lateral interbody fusion (OLIF) offers the solution to problems of anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) and lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF). However, OLIF technique for degenerative spinal diseases of elderly patients has been rarely reported. The objective of this study was to determine the clinical and radiological results of OLIF technique for degenerative spinal diseases in patients under or over 65 years of age. METHODS: Sixty-three patients who underwent OLIF procedure were enrolled, including 29 patients who were less than 65 years of age and 34 patients who were over 65 years of age. Fusion rate, change of disc height and lumbar lordotic angle, Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), return to daily activity, patient's satisfaction rate (PSR), and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were used to assess clinical and functional outcomes. RESULTS: The mean NRS scores for back and leg pain decreased, respectively, from 4.6 and 5.9 to 2.3 and 1.8 in the group A (less than 65 years) and from 4.5 and 6.8 to 2.6 and 2.2 in the group B (over 65 years) at the final follow-up period. The mean ODI scores improved from 48.4 to 24.0% in the group A and from 46.5 to 25.2% in the group B at the final follow-up period. In both groups, the NRS and ODI scores significantly changed preoperatively to postoperatively (p <  0.001). However, statistical analysis yielded no significant difference in postoperative NRS/ODI scores between two groups. In both groups, the changes in the disc height, segmental lordosis, and fusion rate between the preoperative and postoperative periods were significant. The amount of change between preoperative and postoperative disc height, segmental lordosis, and whole lumbar lordosis demonstrated significant intergroup differences (p <  0.05). Overall perioperative complications occurred in 8 of 29 (27.6%) patients in the group A and in 10 of 34 (29.4%) patients in the group B. In both groups, the major complication incidence was 0 and 3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although there was the slightly high incidence of complication associated with high rate of co-morbidities in elderly patients, OLIF for degenerative lumbar diseases in elderly patients showed favorable clinical and radiological outcomes.
