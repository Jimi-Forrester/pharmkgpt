36829993|a|Oxidative stress is one of the main pathogenic factors of neuron damage in neurodegenerative processes; this makes it an important therapeutic target to which the action of neuroprotectors should be directed. One of these drugs is thymoquinone. According to modern data, this substance has a wide range of pharmacological activity, including neuroprotective, which was demonstrated in experimental modeling of various neurodegenerative diseases and pathological conditions of the brain. The neuroprotective effect of thymoquinone is largely due to its antioxidant ability. Currently available data show that thymoquinone is an effective means to reduce the negative consequences of acute and chronic forms of cerebral pathology, leading to the normalization of the content of antioxidant enzymes and preventing an increase in the level of lipid peroxidation products. Antioxidant properties make this substance a promising basis for the development of prototypes of therapeutic agents aimed at the treatment of a number of degenerative diseases of the central nervous system.
