22102154|a|The deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) fibrils into plaques within the brain parenchyma and along cerebral blood vessels is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta42 oligomers and fibrils cause the breakdown of neural circuits, neuronal death and eventually dementia. Drugs that inhibit Abeta42 aggregation may be a novel direction in AD drug discovery. Cryptotanshinone (CTS), an active component of the medicinal herb Salvia miltiorrhiza, has been shown to improve learning and memory in several pharmacological models of AD. However, the effects of CTS on the Abeta aggregation and toxicity are unclear. The current work shows the effectiveness of CTS on the inhibition of Abeta42 aggregation and toxicity to human neuroblastoma cells. In this study, we demonstrated that CTS can inhibit Abeta42 spontaneous aggregation using thioflavin T fluorescence assay and transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of CTS on Abeta-induced oxidative cell death in cultured SH-SY5Y cells. MTT and lactate dehydrogenase assays showed that CTS reduced the cytotoxicity induced by Abeta42. CTS also dramatically reduced Abeta42-induced cellular apoptosis and increased level of reactive oxygen species in these cells. Our study suggests that CTS may be useful in the inhibition or prevention of AD development and progression.
