32779447|a|The novel coronavirus has been spreading since December 2019. It was initially reported in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has currently become a pandemic affecting over seven million people worldwide, and the number is still rising. Wenzhou, as the first hit city out of Hubei Province, achieved a remarkable success in effectively containing the disease. A great record was also observed in Wenzhou for the clinical management of COVID-19 patients, leading to one of the lowest death rates in China. Researchers and clinical specialists proposed and formulated combined approaches such as computerized tomography (CT)- scans and molecular assays, as well as using both allopathic and traditional medications to mitigate its effects. Iranian and Chinese specialists and scientists had a communication in clinical, molecular and pharmaceutical aspects of COVID-19. A proper guideline was prepared according to the experiences of Chinese clinicians in managing the full spectrum of COVID-19 patients, from relatively mild to highly complex cases. The purpose of this guideline is to serve a reference in the hospital for specialists so that they may better diagnose cases and provide effective therapies and proposed antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs for patients.
