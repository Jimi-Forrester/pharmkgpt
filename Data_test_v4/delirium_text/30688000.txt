30688000|a|BACKGROUND: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may herald the first symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) whereas individuals with beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition are regarded as a high-risk group for AD. Recently, amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) studies have demonstrated clinical and cognitive feature differences between Abeta-positive and negative SCD, but details of their differences remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the relationships among Abeta deposition, clinical, and cognitive features in patients with SCD. METHODS: Forty-two patients with SCD (22 women, 74.5 +- 4.7 years) were examined using fluorine-18 florbetaben PET and were divided into Abeta-positive (n = 10) and negative (n = 32) groups. We compared cognitive and psychological outcomes, and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging data between the two groups. In addition, a linear regression analysis was performed to assess relationships between the severity of SCD and neuropsychological tests, affective scores, and demographic factors. RESULTS: The rate of score changes from the immediate recall to delayed recall in the logical memory subtest of the Wechsler's Memory Scale Revised were different between the groups (P = 0.04). However, the binary logistic regression analysis showed no significant differences between the two. In addition, the severity of SCD was significantly strong in women (P = 0.002). Furthermore, within the Abeta-negative group, subjective memory loss correlated with word fluency category score (P = 0.023) and apathy scale (P = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences were observed between Abeta-positive and -negative SCD on any of the neuropsychological measures, clinical measures, or SPECT imaging. Further, the severity of SCD was not predicted by the symptoms of anxiety, depression, or neuropsychological examination.
