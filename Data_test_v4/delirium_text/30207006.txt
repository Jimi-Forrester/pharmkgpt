30207006|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but is also recognized to be a heterogeneous condition. Biomarkers that predict AD progression in MCI are of clinical significance because they can be used to better identify appropriate candidates for therapeutic intervention studies. It has been hypothesized that comparing to structural measurements, functional ones may be more sensitive to early disease abnormalities and the sensitivity could be further enhanced when combined with cognitive task, a "brain stress test." In this study, we investigated the value of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), measured by arterial spin labeled perfusion MRI (ASL MRI) during a memory-encoding task, in predicting the estimated rate of hippocampal atrophy, an established marker of AD progression. Thirty-one amnestic MCI patients (20 male and 11 female; age: 70.9 +- 6.5 years, range from 56 to 83 years; mini mental status examination: 27.8 +- 1.8) and 42 normal control subjects (13 male and 29 female; age: 70.6 +- 8.8 years, range from 55 to 88 years; mini mental status examination: 29.1 +- 1.2) were included in this study. We compared the predictive value of CBF during task to CBF during rest and structural volumetry. Both region-of-interest and voxelwise analyses showed that baseline CBF measurements during task (strongest effect in fusiform gyrus, region-of-interest analysis statistics: r = 0.56, p = .003), but not resting ASL MRI or structural volumetry, were correlated with the estimated rate of hippocampal atrophy in amnestic MCI patients. Further, stepwise linear regression demonstrated that resting ASL MRI and volumetry did not provide complementary information in prediction. These results support the notion that physiologic measures during a cognitive challenge may increase the ability to detect subtle functional changes that predict progression. As such, ASL MRI could have important utility in stratifying candidates for AD treatment trials.
