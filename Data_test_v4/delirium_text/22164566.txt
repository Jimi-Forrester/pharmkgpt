22164566|a|A record-breaking number of drug shortages is impacting all areas of health care, but ED and EMS operations are under added pressure to work around such shortages quickly to meet critical patient needs. Experts say the most successful organizations have established strong communication channels between hospital pharmacists and providers so that when shortages arise, alternative approaches can be devised and communicated swiftly. By mid-September 2011, 213 drug shortages had been reported to the Drug Information Service at the University of Utah Hospitals and Clinics in Salt Lake City. This is more than the total number of shortages reported in 2010. In recent months, there have been reported shortages of drugs that are used routinely in emergency situations for such issues as pain, cardiac arrest, diabetic coma, seizures, excited delirium, and eclampsia of pregnancy. Experts say early recognition of drug shortages is essential so that providers and pharmacists can prioritize resources to optimize patient care. There is broad support for legislation under consideration in Congress that would require drug manufacturers to notify the FDA of anticipated drug shortages. Experts believe such action would enable the FDA to take steps to prevent many shortages from occurring.
