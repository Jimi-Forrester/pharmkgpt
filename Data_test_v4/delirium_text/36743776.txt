36743776|t|Matrixmetalloproteinase-9 gene polymorphism (rs 17576) increases the risk of depressive symptoms in bipolar disorder.
36743776|a|Objectives: Plasticity of neural synapses is known to be involved in the complications in bipolar disorder (BD) patients. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a role in synaptic plasticity and memory. Even though elevated MMP-9 levels are reported in neuropsychiatric disorders, there is limited data about MMP-9 gene polymorphism in BD. The objectives of the study was to investigate genotype frequency and allele frequency of MMP-9 genetic variant (rs 17576) in BD and its association with disease severity. Materials and Methods: Eighty BD cases and 80 controls were recruited in the study. MMP-9 genotyping and allele frequency and plasma MMP-9 levels were analyzed in both the groups. Hamilton depression rating scale and Young's Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) were used to evaluate severity of BD. Results: The genotype and minor allele (G allele) frequency were not significant between BD and controls. MMP-9 levels were significantly increased in BD patients with AG (P < 0.001) and GG (P = 0.022) genotypes compared to controls. BD patients with GG genotype (P = 0.038, OR: 3.26 (1.16-9.09), and G (mutant) allele (P = 0.013, OR 2.03(1.18-3.48) confer increased risk of depressive symptoms. MMP-9 was positively correlated with YMRS scale (r = 0.227, P = 0.043) in BD. Conclusion: MMP-9 gene polymorphism (rs 17576) is linked with depressive symptoms in BD.
