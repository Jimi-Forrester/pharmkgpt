38093571|t|[Driving: What is the relevance and usability of the Reisberg scale in 2023?]
38093571|a|The publication of the decree on the care of people with neurocognitive disorders brought to the fore the Reisberg's Global Deterioration Scale, a scale that only few clinicians use in memory centers or in geriatric. This scale has a number of limitations, not least of which is that it is obsolete, since it does not take into account disease advances in scientific knowledge with biomarkers. Consequently, the stages evoked no longer correspond to current descriptions. Moreover, it only concerns Alzheimer's disease, whereas in our practice we encounter other neurodegenerative pathologies. Even if we decide to use another global assessment scale, such as the Clinical Dementia Rating or the Functional Assessment Staging, they cannot replace a personalized assessment. Indeed, it is important to stress that this decree does not take into account the relevance of personalized assessments using, for example, neuropsychological tests to estimate driving ability. A personalized assessment accompanied by a real-life driving test would be preferable than a score on a global scale. This article therefore presents the Global Deterioration Scale, highlighting its unsuitability for assessing whether or not to continue driving.
