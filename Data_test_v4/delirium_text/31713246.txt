31713246|a|Monocarboxylates cannot cross the blood-brain barrier freely to participate in brain energy metabolism. Specific monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) are needed to cross cellular membranes. Monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2) is a major monocarboxylate transporter encoded by the SLC16A7 gene. Recent studies reported that neurodegenerative diseases of the CNS, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), were related to energy metabolic impairment. MCT2 also plays an important role in energy metabolism in the CNS. To provide experimental evidence for future research on the role of MCT2 in the pathological process of CNS degenerative diseases, the distribution and density of MCT2 in different subregions of wild-type mouse brain was examined using immunohistochemistry, western blot and immunogold post-embedding electron microscopic techniques. The amount of MCT2 was higher in cerebellum than in cortex and hippocampus on western blots, and there was no statistical difference between cortex and hippocampus. Immunohistochemistry assay revealed the highest density of MCT2 in the CA3 of the hippocampus. The granular cell layer of the cerebellum contained more MCT2 than the molecular layer. The MCT2 density on the end feet of astrocytes of molecular layer was lower than in hippocampus, but the postsynaptic densities (PSDs) of asymmetric synapses in the molecular layer exhibited a high density using immunogold post-embedding electron microscopic techniques.
