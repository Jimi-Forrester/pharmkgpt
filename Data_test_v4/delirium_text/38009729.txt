38009729|t|TRIM22 facilitates autophagosome-lysosome fusion by mediating the association of GABARAPs and PLEKHM1.
38009729|a|Tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins are a large family of E3 ubiquitin ligases implicated in antiviral defense systems, tumorigenesis, and protein quality control. TRIM proteins contribute to protein quality control by regulating the ubiquitin-proteasome system, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, and macroautophagy/autophagy. However, the detailed mechanisms through which various TRIM proteins regulate downstream events have not yet been fully elucidated. Herein, we identified a novel function of TRIM22 in the regulation of autophagy. TRIM22 promotes autophagosome-lysosome fusion by mediating the association of GABARAP family proteins with PLEKHM1, thereby inducing the autophagic clearance of protein aggregates, independent of its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Furthermore, a TRIM22 variant associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer disease interferes with autophagosome-lysosome fusion and autophagic clearance. These findings suggest TRIM22 as a critical autophagic regulator that orchestrates autophagosome-lysosome fusion by scaffolding autophagy-related proteins, thus representing a potential therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.
