37989483|a|BACKGROUND: Given that associations of Life's Essential 8 (LE8) and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) or its imaging markers were unclear, we examined relationship between them. METHODS: The cross-sectional study included community residents from the PolyvasculaR Evaluation for Cognitive Impairment and vaScular Events study. We calculated the total LE8 score, medical LE8 score and behavioural score, and categorised them into low (<60), moderate (60-79) or high (>=80) group. MRI markers included lacunes, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), enlarged perivascular spaces in basal ganglia (BG-EPVS) and cerebral microbleeds (CMB). In respect of, total CSVD score (0-4 points), WMH, lacunes or CMB were categorised as two grades, and BG-EPVS (N>10) was allocated one point. Based on modified total CSVD score (0-6 points), WMH or CMB was modified to three grades, and BG-EPVS (N>20) was allocated one point. RESULTS: Among 3061 participants in this study, 1424 (46.5%) were male. Higher LE8 score was associated with lower total CSVD score (moderate vs low: cOR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.96; high vs low: cOR 0.44, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.59), and the medical score was inversely related to the total CSVD score. Furthermore, the medical score was inversely related to odds of WMH (p<0.05), modified WMH (p<0.05), lacunes (p<0.05) or BG-EPVS (p<0.05), and the behavioural score were inversely related to the odds of lacunes and BG-EPVS. CONCLUSIONS: Higher LE8 score which indicates better cardiovascular status was associated with lower burden of CSVD and its MRI markers. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine the causality.
