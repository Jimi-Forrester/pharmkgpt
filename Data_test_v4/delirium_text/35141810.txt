35141810|t|Brain region-specific susceptibility of Lewy body pathology in synucleinopathies is governed by alpha-synuclein conformations.
35141810|a|The protein alpha-synuclein, a key player in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies, exists in different physiological conformations: cytosolic unfolded aggregation-prone monomers and helical aggregation-resistant multimers. It has been shown that familial PD-associated missense mutations within the alpha-synuclein gene destabilize the conformer equilibrium of physiologic alpha-synuclein in favor of unfolded monomers. Here, we characterized the relative levels of unfolded and helical forms of cytosolic alpha-synuclein in post-mortem human brain tissue and showed that the equilibrium of alpha-synuclein conformations is destabilized in sporadic PD and DLB patients. This disturbed equilibrium is decreased in a brain region-specific manner in patient samples pointing toward a possible "prion-like" propagation of the underlying pathology and forms distinct disease-specific patterns in the two different synucleinopathies. We are also able to show that a destabilization of multimers mechanistically leads to increased levels of insoluble, pathological alpha-synuclein, while pharmacological stabilization of multimers leads to a "prion-like" aggregation resistance. Together, our findings suggest that these disease-specific patterns of alpha-synuclein multimer destabilization in sporadic PD and DLB are caused by both regional neuronal vulnerability and "prion-like" aggregation transmission enabled by the destabilization of local endogenous alpha-synuclein protein.
