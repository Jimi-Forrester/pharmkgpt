30977102|a|The neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75NTR) plays important roles in regulating amyloid-beta (Abeta) metabolism in the brain. The expression of p75NTR is altered in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether p75NTR mRNA level in the peripheral blood cells is changed among AD patients and its potential to be a biomarker for AD. The study subjects included 26 patients with AD (PiB-PET positive) and 28 cognitively normal controls (PiB-PET negative). RNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells of fast blood. p75NTR mRNA was measured using quantitative real-time PCR assay. p75NTR mRNA levels in blood cells were comparable between AD patients and controls. p75NTR mRNA levels in blood cells were not correlated with MMSE scores, ApoE genotypes, gender, and age. p75NTR mRNA expression in blood cells is not changed in AD patients and is unlikely to be a biomarker for AD.
