37935904|a|PURPOSE: In 2012, the CROSS trial implemented a new neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy protocol for patients with locally advanced, resectable cancer of the esophagus prior to scheduled surgery. There are only limited studies comparing the CROSS protocol with a PF-based (cisplatin/5-fluorouracil) nRCT protocol. METHODS: In this retrospective, monocentric analysis, 134 patients suffering from esophageal cancer were included. Those patients received either PF-based nRCT (PF group) or nRCT according to the CROSS protocol (CROSS group) prior to elective en bloc esophagectomy. Perioperative mortality and morbidity, nRCT-related toxicity, and complete pathological regression were compared between both groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed in order to identify independent factors for pathological complete response (pCR). RESULTS: Thirty-day/hospital mortality showed no significant differences between both groups. Postoperative complications >= grade 3 according to Clavien-Dindo classification were experienced in 58.8% (PF group) and 47.6% (CROSS group) (p = 0.2) respectively. nRCT-associated toxicity >= grade 3 was 30.8% (PF group) and 37.2% (CROSS group) (p = 0.6). There was no significant difference regarding the pCR rate between both groups (23.5% vs. 30.5%; p = 0.6). In multivariate analysis, SCC (OR 7.7; p < 0.01) and an initial grading of G1/G2 (OR 2.8; p = 0.03) were shown to be independent risk factors for higher rates of pCR. CONCLUSION: We conclude that both nRCT protocols are effective and safe. There were no significant differences regarding toxicity, pathological tumor response, and postoperative morbidity and mortality between both groups. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and favorable preoperative tumor grading (G1 and G2) are independent predictors for higher pCR rate in multivariate analysis.
