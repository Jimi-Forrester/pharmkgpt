39199306|a|Alzheimer disease, the leading cause of dementia, and polycystic ovary syndrome, one of the most prevalent female endocrine disorders, appear to be unrelated conditions. However, studies show that both disease entities have common risk factors, and the amount of certain protein marker of neurodegeneration is increased in PCOS. Reports on the pathomechanism of both diseases point to the possibility of common denominators linking them. Dysregulation of the kynurenine pathway, insulin resistance, and impairment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, which are correlated with amyloid-beta aggregation are these common areas. This article discusses the relationship between Alzheimer disease and polycystic ovary syndrome, with a particular focus on the role of disorders of tryptophan metabolism in both conditions. Based on a review of the available literature, we concluded that systemic changes occurring in PCOS influence the increased risk of neurodegeneration.
