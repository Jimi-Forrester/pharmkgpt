37007045|a|Background: Long Mu Qing Xin Mixture (LMQXM) has shown potentially positive effects in alleviating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); however, the action mechanism is still not fully understood. This study aimed to predict the potential mechanism of LMQXM for ADHD using network pharmacology and molecular docking, which were then validated using animal experiments. Methods: Network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques were used to predict the core targets and potential pathways of LMQXMQ for ADHD, and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed the potential significance of dopamine (DA) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathways. To verify the hypothesis, we conducted an animal experiment. In the animal experiment, the young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were randomly divided into the model group (SHR), the methylphenidate hydrochloride group (MPH, 4.22 mg/kg), and 3 LMQXM groups (low-dose (LD) group, 5.28 ml/kg; medium-dose (MD) group, 10.56 ml/kg; and high-dose (HD) group, 21.12 ml/kg), and administered by gavage for 4 weeks; the WKY rats were set as the control group. The open field test and Morris water maze test were used to evaluate the behavioral performance of rats, high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to analyze DA levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum of rats, ELISA was used to detect cAMP concentrations in the PFC and striatum, and immunohistochemistry and qPCR were used to analyze positive cell expression and mRNA expression for indicators related to DA and cAMP pathways. Results: The results showed that beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, rhynchophylline, baicalein, and formononetin might be key components of LMQXM for ADHD and that these components bind well to the core targets, DA receptors (DRD1 and DRD2). Furthermore, LMQXM might act through the DA and cAMP signaling pathways. In the animal experiment, we found that MPH and LMQXM-MD controlled hyperactivity and improved learning and memory in SHRs, while LMQXM-HD only controlled hyperactivity in SHRs; meanwhile, MPH and LMQXM-MD upregulated DA and cAMP levels, mean optical density (MOD) of cAMP, and MOD and mRNA expression of DRD1 and PKA in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum of SHRs, while LMQXM-LD and LMQXM-HD upregulated DA and cAMP levels in the striatum, MOD of cAMP in the PFC, and mRNA expression of PKA in the PFC. However, we did not find a significant regulatory effect of LMQXM on DRD2. Conclusion: To sum up, this study demonstrated that LMQXM may increase DA levels mainly by activating the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway through DRD1, thereby controlling the behavioral disorders of SHRs, which is most effective at moderate doses, and this may be a key mechanism for LMQXM in the treatment of ADHD.
