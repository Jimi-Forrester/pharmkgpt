31656150|t|Aquaporins and Roles in Brain Health and Brain Injury.
31656150|a|In the literature screening, aquaporins were found in the cerebral structures including the pia mater, choroid plexus, ependyma, piriform cortex, hippocampus, dorsal thalamus, supraoptic and suprachiasmatic nuclei, white matter and subcortical organ. Among these, the most common are AQP1, AQP4, and AQP9. The roles of aquaporins have been demonstrated in several diseases such as cerebral edema, various central nervous system tumors, Alzheimer's Disease and epilepsy. In this review, the relationship between brain/brain-injury and aquaporin, has been reviewed.
