8744405|a|In this study of an aged wolverine (Gulo gulo), we document neuropathologic lesions (cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), neuritic plaques (NPs), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and granulovacuolar degeneration strikingly similar to those present in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the additional finding of concurrent cerebral hemorrhage. A beta immunoreactive cerebral amyloid angiopathy and senile plaques (neuritic and diffuse) were present throughout the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Ubiquitin immunoreactivity was noted in peripheral portions of some of the plaques. Argyrophilic intracellular neurofibrillary tangles containing abnormally phosphorylated (Ser 202) tau protein were present within cortical and hippocampal neurons. The wolverine should be added to the list of nonhuman species (dogs, nonhuman primates, polar bears) with amyloid deposits similar to those in aged humans and in humans with AD. The aged wolverine appears to be distinct from other nonhuman species in possessing plaques and NFTs, as well as other histologic cerebral lesions frequently associated with AD.
