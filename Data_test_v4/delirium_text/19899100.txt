19899100|t|Synthesis of monomeric and dimeric acridine compounds as potential therapeutics in Alzheimer and prion diseases.
19899100|a|Starting from substituted 9-chloroacridines, a series of quinacrine and spacered dimeric acridine compounds was prepared. Their ability to interrupt the protein association of prion- and Alzheimer-specific proteins and Ab peptides was explored using a fast screening system based on FACS analysis. The bis-acridines displayed a higher activity than the corresponding monomers. Among these derivatives, best results were obtained with the 2,4-dimethoxy-6-nitro compound 7h for Abeta-peptides and the 2-methoxy-6-nitro compound 7f for PrP.
