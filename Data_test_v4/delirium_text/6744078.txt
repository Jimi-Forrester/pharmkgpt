6744078|a|The incidence of psychological morbidity associated with delirium was compared between burn patients isolated in a bed-size plenum laminar air flow ventilation unit (PLAFVU) and matched control burn patients treated in standard open cubicles. In patients with burn sizes of less than 60 per cent of body surface area, delirium developed in 40 per cent of the patients treated in the PLAFVU, but only in 7 per cent of the matched control patients (P = 0.04). Most of the patients with burn sizes of 60 per cent or greater exhibited delirium regardless of the method of treatment. The development of psychological morbidity was more strongly associated with treatment in the PLAFVU than with common causes such as hyponatraemia or septicaemia. The present study suggests that in the majority of burn patients, i.e. those with less than 60 per cent burns, the development of psychological morbidity may in fact be influenced by types of treatment which affect patient psychology, rather than being solely the result of physiological derangements.
