20166915|t|Delirium in the elderly. A survey of environmental policies and procedures in Melbourne hospitals.
20166915|a|This study aimed to review the presence of policies for management of behavioural symptoms and physical restraints, the availability of delirium management protocols and educational programs, and accessibility of a physical environment appropriate for the management of delirium in Melbourne hospitals. A structured survey tool was developed, and 70 Melbourne hospitals were surveyed seeking responses from a senior member of the nursing staff. Overall, 90% of Melbourne hospitals responded to the survey. It was found that smaller hospitals have fewer policies relating to the management of behavioural symptoms, and fewer delirium management protocols. Some education is available for nursing staff; however, less for the night staff, who often manage behavioural symptoms associated with delirium. Physical restraint policies exist at most hospitals. Single rooms and night lights are generally available, but low-low beds and orientation devices are relatively uncommon.
