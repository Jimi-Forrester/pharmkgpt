32910696|t|Imaging findings of cerebral fat embolism syndrome: a case report.
32910696|a|Cerebral fat embolism (CFE) syndrome is relatively rare in clinical practice. Currently, there is no uniform standard of magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of the disease. In this report, we present head computed tomography and magnetic resonance images (T2-weighted images, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, diffusion-weighted images, and susceptibility-weighted images) in a case of CFE. This report explains the imaging characteristics of CFE and improves the clinician's understanding of this disease and its etiology.
