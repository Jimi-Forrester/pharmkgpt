12210288|t|No association between the neuronal nitric oxide synthase gene polymorphism and Alzheimer Disease.
12210288|a|Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). To examine the role of the neuronal NOS (nNOS) gene in AD, patients (n = 139) and control subjects (n = 101) were genotyped for the nNOS dinucleotide polymorphism. No association was demonstrated for AD and this particular nNOS polymorphism.
