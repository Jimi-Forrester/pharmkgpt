34455093|t|Postoperative Delirium in Patients After Brain Tumor Surgery.
34455093|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is a common surgical complication that can be associated with poorer outcome. Many patients with brain tumors experience delirium after surgery. We hypothesize that patients who experience delirium after resection of a brain tumor will have worse outcomes post surgery in terms of mortality, disposition, and length of stay compared with those without postoperative delirium. We also examine differences between nurse and physician diagnoses of delirium. METHODS: Data from patients undergoing brain tumor resection at University of Missouri Hospital were retrospectively collected. Delirium was defined using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 criteria. Patients with delirium were compared with patients without delirium using chi-squared test, Cohen Kappa value, and binomial proportion analysis at 95% confidence intervals or P < 0.05. RESULTS: Of 500 patients having brain tumor resections, 93 (18.6%) were diagnosed with postoperative delirium. Patients with delirium had higher 30-day mortality (9.78% vs. 1.48%; P < 0.0001), required restraints more often (42.39% vs. 5.91%, P < 0.0001), had longer hospital length of stay (14.3 vs. 6.3 days; P < 0.0001), and increased skilled nursing facility disposition (57.3% vs. 26.11%; P < 0.0001) than patients without delirium. Diagnosis of delirium between nursing staff and clinicians moderately correlated (Kappa 0.5677 +- 0.0536). CONCLUSIONS: Delirium, a common postoperative complication after brain tumor surgery, is associated with longer length of stay, increased disposition to skilled nursing facility, and increased 30-day mortality. These findings reinforce the importance of early recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of postoperative delirium in brain tumor resection patients.
