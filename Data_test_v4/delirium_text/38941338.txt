38941338|t|Electroconvulsive therapy for the acute management of severe agitation in dementia (ECT-AD): A modified study protocol.
38941338|a|OBJECTIVE: This study began as a single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the efficacy and safety of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for severe treatment-refractory agitation in advanced dementia. The aims are to assess agitation reduction using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), evaluate tolerability and safety outcomes, and explore the long-term stability of agitation reduction and global functioning. Due to challenges encountered during implementation, including recruitment obstacles and operational difficulties, the study design was modified to an open-label format and other protocol amendments were implemented. METHODS: Initially, the RCT randomized participants 1:1 to either ECT plus usual care or simulated ECT plus usual care (S-ECT) groups. As patients were enrolled, data were collected from both ECT and simulated ECT (S-ECT) patients. The study now continues in an open-label study design where all patients receive actual ECT, reducing the targeted sample size from 200 to 50 participants. RESULTS: Study is ongoing and open to enrollment. CONCLUSION: The transition of the ECT-AD study design from an RCT to open-label design exemplifies adaptive research methodologies in response to real-world challenges. Data from both the RCT and open-label phases of the study will provide a unique perspective on the role of ECT in managing severe treatment-refractory agitation in dementia, potentially influencing future clinical practices and research approaches.
