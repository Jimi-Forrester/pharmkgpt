38883092|a|Objective To quantify the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among ICU survivors in the Jazan region, Saudi Arabia, and explore the correlational relationships among these conditions to inform targeted mental health interventions in this unique regional context. Methods The study employed a cross-sectional observational design to assess ICU survivors from two major hospitals in the Jazan Region: Prince Mohammed Bin Nasser Hospital and King Fahad Central Hospital. One hundred participants were interviewed face-to-face to gather detailed insights into their post-ICU experiences. We employed the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and the post-trauma symptom scale (PTSS-10) to systematically assess the psychological impacts of anxiety, depression, and PTSD among participants. Results The demographic breakdown of participants showed a youthful skew, with 37% under 35 years, 49% aged between 36-60 years, and only 14% over 60 years, contrasting with typical ICU demographics, which generally skew older. This younger distribution may influence the psychological outcomes observed. The sample was fairly gender-balanced, with 53% male and 47% female, closely reflecting the regional gender ratio of ICU admissions. Among the participants, 24% were classified as 'abnormal' and 20% as 'borderline abnormal' for anxiety, while 25% were 'borderline abnormal' and 21% 'abnormal' for depression. About 8% of participants were diagnosed with severe PTSD. Anxiety was more strongly correlated with PTSD than depression. The analysis demonstrated significant associations between demographic factors and psychological distress among ICU survivors. Females reported higher anxiety, while lower education and unemployment were associated with increased depression. Additionally, lower household income was associated with higher PTSS scores, and marital status was linked to depression, suggesting that socioeconomic factors play a critical role in post-ICU psychological recovery. Conclusion The findings emphasize the imperative need for comprehensive mental health evaluations and tailored interventions for ICU survivors in the Jazan region.
