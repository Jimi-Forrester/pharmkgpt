38283164|t|Named Entity Recognition and Normalization for Alzheimer's Disease Eligibility Criteria.
38283164|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Finding effective treatments for this disease is crucial. Clinical trials play an essential role in developing and testing new treatments for AD. However, identifying eligible participants can be challenging, time-consuming, and costly. In recent years, the development of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically named entity recognition (NER) and named entity normalization (NEN), have helped to automate the identification and extraction of relevant information from the eligibility criteria (EC) more efficiently, in order to facilitate semi-automatic patient recruitment and enable data FAIRness for clinical trial data. Nevertheless, most current biomedical NER models only provide annotations for a restricted set of entity types that may not be applicable to the clinical trial data. Additionally, accurately performing NEN on entities that are negated using a negative prefix currently lacks established techniques. In this paper, we introduce a pipeline designed for information extraction from AD clinical trial EC, which involves preprocessing of the EC data, clinical NER, and biomedical NEN to Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Our NER model can identify named entities in seven pre-defined categories, while our NEN model employs a combination of exact match and partial match search strategies, as well as customized rules to accurately normalize entities with negative prefixes. To evaluate the performance of our pipeline, we measured the precision, recall, and F1 score for the NER component, and we manually reviewed the top five mapping results produced by the NEN component. Our evaluation of the pipeline's performance revealed that it can successfully normalize named entities in clinical trial ECs with optimal accuracies. The NER component achieved a overall F1 of 0.816, demonstrating its ability to accurately identify seven types of named entities in clinical text. The NEN component of the pipeline also demonstrated impressive performance, with customized rules and a combination of exact and partial match strategies leading to an accuracy of 0.940 for normalized entities.
