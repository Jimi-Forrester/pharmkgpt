38365646|a|BACKGROUND: Nonadherence to medication contributes substantially to worse health outcomes. Especially among older adults with chronic illness, multimorbidity leads to complex medication regimes and high nonadherence rates. In previous research, depressive symptomology has been identified as a major contributor to nonadherence, and some authors hypothesize a link via motivational deficits and low self-efficacy. However, the exact mechanisms linking depressive symptomology and nonadherence are not yet understood. This is in part because the often-employed sum scores cannot do justice to the complexity of depressive symptomology; instead, it is recommended to assess the influence of individual symptoms. METHODS: Following this symptom-based approach, we performed correlation, network and regression analysis using depressive symptoms as depicted by the items of the revised Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI) to assess their influence with nonadherence in N = 731 older adults with chronic neurological diseases. Nonadherence was measured with the self-report Stendal Adherence to Medication Score (SAMS). RESULTS: Even when controlling for sociodemographic and health-related covariates, the BDI remained the most influential contributor to nonadherence. Across different methods, Loss of Interest and Difficulty with Concentration were identified as particularly influential for nonadherence, linking nonadherence with other affective or somatic BDI items, respectively. Additionally, Fatigue, Problems with Decision Making, Suicidal Thoughts, and Worthlessness contribute to nonadherence. CONCLUSION: Using a symptom-driven approach, we aimed to understand which depressive symptoms contribute to higher levels of nonadherence. Our results refine previous hypotheses about motivation and control beliefs by suggesting that it is not merely a lack of beliefs in the efficacy of medication that connects depressive symptoms and nonadherence, but rather an overall lack of interest in improving one's health due to feelings of worthlessness and suicidal tendencies. This lack of interest is further substantiated by already sparse resources caused by changes in concentration and fatigue. In order to improve health outcomes and reduce nonadherence, these associations between depressive symptoms must be further understood and targeted in tailored interventions.
