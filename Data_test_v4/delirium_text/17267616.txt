17267616|t|APL-1, a Caenorhabditis elegans protein related to the human beta-amyloid precursor protein, is essential for viability.
17267616|a|Dominant mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene are associated with rare cases of familial Alzheimer's disease; however, the normal functions of APP and related proteins remain unclear. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has a single APP-related gene, apl-1, that is expressed in multiple tissues. Loss of apl-1 disrupts several developmental processes, including molting and morphogenesis, and results in larval lethality. The apl-1 lethality can be rescued by neuronal expression of the extracellular domain of APL-1. These data highlight the importance of the extracellular domain of an APP family member and suggest that APL-1 acts noncell-autonomously during development. Overexpression of APL-1 also causes several defects, including a high level of larval lethality. Decreased activity of sel-12, a C. elegans homologue of the human gamma-secretase component presenilin 1, partially rescues the lethality associated with APL-1 overexpression, suggesting that SEL-12 activity regulates APL-1 activity either directly or indirectly.
