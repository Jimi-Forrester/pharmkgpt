38596860|t|A Serious Game for Cognitive Stimulation of Older People With Mild Cognitive Impairment: Design and Pilot Usability Study.
38596860|a|Background: Cognitive stimulation of older people helps prevent, and even treat, age-related diseases, such as mild cognitive impairment. Playing games reduces the probability of experiencing this pathology, which is related to the loss of the ability to carry out some instrumental activities of daily living. Objective: This work describes the design and development of a serious game for the cognitive stimulation of older people, with exercises related to the daily life task of shopping. A pilot study for its preliminary usability validation is also presented. Methods: The designed serious game includes 4 exercises consisting of shopping in a hypermarket, ordering products, making payments, and organizing the purchase, thus dealing with the most frequent cognitive problems of older people associated with episodic declarative memory, naming, calculation, and organization, respectively. Results: A total of 19 older people participated in the pilot study for the usability validation of the serious game. They indicated that they like the aesthetic and interesting topic of the game. They reported that it provides a high level of entertainment and could be useful in daily life for mental stimulation. The participants found the serious game to be intuitive, but the ease of use and readability of the instructions could be improved. Conclusions: This study suggests that the innovative serious game developed could be accepted by older people for their cognitive stimulation to prevent or treat mild cognitive impairment, although a long-term intervention study should be performed as future work. Its ecological validity design, with everyday tasks, adaptable levels of difficulty, and motivational mechanisms, is a differentiating factor compared to similar serious games.
