32050555|a|Cholesterol is a critical component of eukaryotic membranes, where it contributes to regulating transmembrane signaling, cell-cell interaction, and ion transport. Dysregulation of cholesterol levels in the brain may induce neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, and Huntington disease. We previously reported that augmenting membrane cholesterol level regulates ion channels by decreasing the level of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which is closely related to beta-amyloid (Abeta) production. In addition, cholesterol enrichment decreased PIP2 levels by increasing the expression of the beta1 isoform of phospholipase C (PLC) in cultured cells. In this study, we examined the effect of a high-cholesterol diet on phospholipase C (PLCbeta1) expression and PIP2 levels in rat brain. PIP2 levels were decreased in the cerebral cortex in rats on a high-cholesterol diet. Levels of PLCbeta1 expression correlated with PIP2 levels. However, cholesterol and PIP2 levels were not correlated, suggesting that PIP2 level is regulated by cholesterol via PLCbeta1 expression in the brain. Thus, there exists cross talk between cholesterol and PIP2 that could contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.
