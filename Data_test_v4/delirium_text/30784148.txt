30784148|a|BACKGROUND: We performed a questionnaire survey of medical doctors engaged in the management of dementia to identify the actual status of treatment for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) in Japan. METHODS: Among participating medical doctors, we selected neurologists (Group N) and psychiatrists (Group P) because these physicians are usually involved in the management of DLB patients. The two groups were compared based on their diagnosis and treatment of DLB and in particular, parkinsonism. RESULTS: Neurological examinations and biomarker tests were less frequently performed by Group P than Group N. Antipsychotics and other psychotropics excluding anti-dementia drugs were significantly more frequently administered by Group P than Group N. The proportion of physicians who selected L-dopa as a first-line therapy for parkinsonism was significantly higher in Group N than in Group P. Despite these between-group differences, the following findings were common to the two groups: there was a discrepancy between the symptom that patients expressed the greatest desire to treat, and the awareness of physicians regarding the treatment of these symptoms; the initial agent was L-dopa; and physicians exercised caution against the occurrence of hallucinations, delusions, and other adverse drug reactions. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present survey offer valuable insight for the formulation of future DLB therapeutic strategies.
