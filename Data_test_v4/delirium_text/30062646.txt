30062646|a|The Klotho protein is a recently discovered protein and its overexpression is associated with life extension. Klotho deficiency or silencing of the Klotho gene in mice leads to an accelerated aging and short life, whereas overexpression of Klotho in mice extends lifespan. Klotho participates in many metabolic pathways and is highly expressed in the kidneys, the choroid plexus and neurons. It plays a key role in the calcium-phosphate metabolism, remyelination, and cognitive processes. The present paper is a short review of the literature on the role of Klotho in neurodegenerative disorders, with special attention paid to multiple sclerosis. The neuroprotective function of Klotho is also reported. It is also important to consider potential clinical applications of Klotho that might be useful in the treatment of many diseases.
