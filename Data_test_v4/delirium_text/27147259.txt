27147259|t|A Novel Abeta B-Cell Epitope Vaccine (rCV01) for Alzheimer's Disease Improved Synaptic and Cognitive Functions in 3 x Tg-AD Mice.
27147259|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive amyloid-beta accumulation, loss of cognitive abilities, and synaptic alterations. Given the remarkable recovery of cognition in AD models of targeting-Abeta immunotherapy, we sought to determine the molecular correlate(s) associated with improvement. We evaluated the efficacy of a recombinant chimeric 6Abeta15-T antigen formulated with alum adjuvant as a novel Abeta B-cell epitope vaccine (rCV01) in 3 x Tg-AD mice. rCV01 elicited robust Th2-polarized Abeta-specific antibodies without autoimmune T cell responses in 3 x Tg-AD mice. The long-lasting anti-Abeta42 antibodies were associated with markedly reduced AD-like pathology, enhanced synaptic function, and improved cognitive performance in aged 3 x Tg-AD mice. This is the first report to provide one hypothesis for the improved outcomes following vaccination is a reduction in the levels of active calpain in rCV01-immunized AD mice, which is likely attributable to preventing dynamin 1 and PSD-95 degradation allowing functional recovery of cognition. rCV01 is a highly immunogenic recombinant chimeric 6Abeta15-T vaccine that shows clear neuroprotective properties in preclinical mouse models of AD and is a candidate for an effective AD vaccine.
