37156373|a|BACKGROUND: Exercise may improve executive function among people living with all-cause dementia (PWD), but more evidence is needed. The aim of this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to examine whether exercise plus usual care improves the primary outcome of executive function, and secondary physiological (inflammation, metabolic aging, epigenetics) and behavioral (cognition, psychological health, physical function, and falls) outcomes compared to usual care alone among PWD. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: The strEngth aNd BaLance exercise on Executive function in people living with Dementia (ENABLED) protocol is a pilot parallel, 6-month assessor-blinded RCT (1:1) in residential care facilities, including n = 21 receiving exercise plus usual care and n = 21 usual care alone [NCT05488951]. We will collect primary (Color-Word Stroop Test) and secondary physiological (inflammation, metabolic aging, epigenetics) and behavioral (cognition, psychological health, physical function, and falls) outcomes at baseline and 6 months. We will obtain falls monthly from medical charts. We will collect physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep via wrist-worn accelerometers over 7 days at baseline and 6 months. The physical therapist-led adapted Otago Exercise Program will involve 1-h of strength, balance and walking 3x/week for 6 months in groups of 5-7. We will use generalized linear mixed models to examine differences over time in primary and secondary outcomes between groups and examine potential interactions with sex and race. DISCUSSION: This pilot RCT will examine the direct effects and potential underlying physiological mechanisms of exercise on executive function and other behavioral outcomes in PWD, which may have implications for clinical care management.
