30276005|t|Safety of Laparoscopic Radical Gastrectomy in Gastric Cancer Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease.
30276005|a|PURPOSE: The surgical outcomes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer were inferior compared with those of non-ESRD patients. This study aimed to evaluate the short- and long-term surgical outcomes of ESRD patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) and open gastrectomy (OG) for gastric cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2004 and 2014, 38 patients (OG: 21 patients, LG: 17 patients) with ESRD underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Comparisons were made based on the clinicopathological characteristics, surgical outcomes, and long-term survival rates. RESULTS: No significant differences were noted in the clinicopathological characteristics of either group. LG patients had lower estimated blood loss volumes than OG patients (LG vs. OG: 94 vs. 275 mL, P=0.005). The operation time and postoperative hospital stay were similar in both the groups. The postoperative morbidity for LG and OG patients was 41.1% and 33.3%, respectively (P=0.873). No significant difference was observed in the long-term overall survival rates between the 2 groups (5-year overall survival, LG vs. OG: 82.4% vs. 64.7%, P=0.947). CONCLUSIONS: In ESRD patients, LG yielded non-inferior short- and long-term surgical outcomes compared to OG. Laparoscopic procedures might be safely adopted for ESRD patients who can benefit from the advantages of minimally invasive surgery.
