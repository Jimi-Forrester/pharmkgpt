Recent research suggests that the amyloid-beta precursor protein intracellular domain (AICD) is a potential contributor to AD development and progression. The small AICD is rapidly degraded after processing from the full-length protein. The present study aimed to apply a highly efficient biotinylation approach in vitro to study AICD-associated complexes in neurocytes. METHODS: By co-expressing Escherichia coli biotin ligase with biotinyl-tagged AICD in the SH-SY5Y neuronal cell line, the effects of AICD overexpression on cell proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed. Besides, AICD-associated nuclear transcriptional complexes were purified and then examined by mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Our data showed that AICD overexpression not only affected cell proliferation but also led to apoptosis in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, biotinylation allowed single-step purification of biotinylated AICD-associated complexes from total nuclear extract via high-affinity biotin-streptavidin binding. Following this by mass spectrometry, we identified physically associated proteins, some reported previously and other novel binding partners, CUX1 and SPT5. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, a map of the AICD-associated nuclear interactome was depicted. Specifically, AICD can activate CUX1 transcriptional activity, which may be associated with AICD-dependent neuronal cell death. This work helps to understand the AICD-associated biological events in AD progression and provides novel insights into the development of AD.
