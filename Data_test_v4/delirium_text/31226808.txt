31226808|a|Infective endocarditis is a serious condition, which is associated with high mortality in elderly patients. Gemella haemolysans (GH) is a microorganism from the Streptococcus family, rarely involved in infective endocarditis. Here, we present a case of Gemella haemolysans endocarditis in an 86-year-old patient, successfully treated by antibiotics and surgery following a pre-treatment comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). This case is discussed in the context of a review of all published cases of Gemella haemolysans endocarditis. We illustrate the benefit of a systematic pre-treatment comprehensive geriatric assessment in elderly patients with infective endocarditis.
