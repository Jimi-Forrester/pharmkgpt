33894176|t|Recovery from Coronavirus Disease 2019 among Older Adults in Post-Acute Skilled Nursing Facilities.
33894176|a|OBJECTIVES: To examine functional outcomes of post-acute care for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-three community-dwelling adults >=65 years of age admitted for post-acute care from 2 SNFs from March 15, 2020, to May 30, 2020. MEASURE(S): COVID-19 status was determined from chart review. Frailty was measured with a deficit accumulation frailty index (FI), categorized into nonfrail, mild frailty, and moderate-to-severe frailty. The primary outcome was community discharge. Secondary outcomes included change in functional status from SNF admission to discharge, based on modified Barthel index (mBI) and continuous functional scale scored by physical (PT) and occupational therapists (OT). RESULTS: Among 73 admissions (31 COVID-19 negative, 42 COVID-19 positive), mean [standard deviation (SD)] age was 83.5 (8.8) and 42 (57.5%) were female, with mean FI of 0.31 (0.01) with no differences by COVID-19 status. The mean length of SNF stay for rehabilitation was 21.2 days (SD 11.1) for COVID-19 negative with 20 (64.5%) patients discharged to community, compared to 23.0 (SD 12.2) and 31 (73.8%) among patients who tested positive for COVID-19. Among those discharged to the community, all groups improved in mBI, PT, and OT score. Those with moderate-to-severe frailty (FI >0.35) had lower mBI scores on discharge [92.0 (6.7) not frail, 81.0 (15.4) mild frailty, 48.6 (20.4) moderate-to-severe frailty; P = .002], lower PT scores on discharge [54.2 (3.9) nonfrail, 51.5 (8.0) mild frailty, 37.1 (9.7) moderate-to-severe frailty; P = .002], and lower OT score on discharge [52.9 (3.2) nonfrail, 45.8 (9.4) mild frailty, 32.4 (7.4) moderate or worse frailty; P = .001]. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Older adults admitted to a SNF for post-acute care with COVID-19 had community discharge rates and functional improvement comparable to a COVID-19 negative group. However, those who are frailer at admission tended to have lower function at discharge.
