26431177|a|Identifying factors driving neural stem cell dysfunction in age-related neurodegenerative diseases remains critical for the development of potential regenerative therapies. Now in Cell Stem Cell,Hamilton et al. (2015) find that lipid accumulation observed during early stages of Alzheimer's disease impairs neural stem cell activity in the adult brain.
