38227522|a|Diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are defined by inflammation and the damage neurons undergo due to oxidative stress. A primary reactive oxygen species contributor in the central nervous system, NADPH oxidase 4, is viewed as a potential therapeutic touchstone and indicative marker for these ailments. This in-depth review brings to light distinct features of NADPH oxidase 4, responsible for generating superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, emphasizing its pivotal role in activating glial cells, inciting inflammation, and disturbing neuronal functions. Significantly, malfunctioning astrocytes, forming the majority in the central nervous system, play a part in advancing neurodegenerative diseases, due to their reactive oxygen species and inflammatory factor secretion. Our study reveals that aiming at NADPH oxidase 4 within astrocytes could be a viable treatment pathway to reduce oxidative damage and halt neurodegenerative processes. Adjusting NADPH oxidase 4 activity might influence the neuroinflammatory cytokine levels, including myeloperoxidase and osteopontin, offering better prospects for conditions like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This review sheds light on the role of NADPH oxidase 4 in neural degeneration, emphasizing its drug target potential, and paving the path for novel treatment approaches to combat these severe conditions.
