842245|t|[Clinical heterogeneity of consciousness disorders in the mussitational variant of delirium tremens].
842245|a|A clinical study of 183 patients detected the absence of a syndromological uniformity in the mussitative variant of delirium tremens. The dynamical clinical picture of psychosis may include during one of the stages of its development a delirious-amentive syndrome, short-time amentive states and oniric experiences. The seen variants of disordered consciousness have a tendency to a transition to clouded forms which subsequentive lead to a significant drop of socio-labour capacity making such disorders prognostically extremely significant. An analysis of "lucid periods" in this contingent demonstrated their affinity to one of the mild forms of disordered consciousness.
