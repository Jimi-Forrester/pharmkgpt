30768272|t|Remarkable Brain Penetration of Cyclopentadienyl M(CO)3+ (M = 99mTc, Re) Derivatives of Benzothiazole and Benzimidazole Paves the Way for Their Application as Diagnostic, with Single-Photon-Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), and Therapeutic Agents for Alzheimer's Disease.
30768272|a|The synthesis and evaluation of three novel 99mTc complexes (99mTc-1-3) and their corresponding Re complexes (Re-1-3), in which the phenyl ring of 2-phenylbenzothiazole or 2-phenylbenzimidazole is replaced by the cyclopentadienyl tricarbonyl [Cp99mTc(CO)3] core, are reported. Both 99mTc and Re complexes were prepared from the corresponding ferrocenyl derivatives, and the Re complexes were fully characterized by elemental analysis, spectroscopic methods, and X-ray crystallography. The complexes exhibit effective in vitro binding to beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques and fibrils, inhibit Abeta fibril formation, and significantly reduce Abeta-induced cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen species production in neuronal cell cultures. The brain uptake of the 99mTc complexes ranges between 7.94 and 3.99% ID/g at 2 min p.i., being the highest recorded for potential 99mTc Abeta plaque imaging probes in mice. Powered by their high brain uptake, the complexes represent strong theranostic candidates against Alzheimer's disease combining single-photon-emission computed tomography diagnostic (99mTc complexes) and antiamyloid therapeutic (Re complexes) potential.
