37298227|t|Conformation-Specific Association of Prion Protein Amyloid Aggregates with Tau Protein Monomers.
37298227|a|Protein aggregation into amyloid fibrils is associated with several amyloidoses, including neurodegenerative Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Despite years of research and numerous studies, the process is still not fully understood, which significantly impedes the search for cures of amyloid-related disorders. Recently, there has been an increase in reports of amyloidogenic protein cross-interactions during the fibril formation process, which further complicates the already intricate process of amyloid aggregation. One of these reports displayed an interaction involving Tau and prion proteins, which prompted a need for further investigation into the matter. In this work, we generated five populations of conformationally distinct prion protein amyloid fibrils and examined their interaction with Tau proteins. We observed that there was a conformation-specific association between Tau monomers and prion protein fibrils, which increased the aggregate self-association and amyloidophilic dye binding capacity. We also determined that the interaction did not induce the formation of Tau protein amyloid aggregates, but rather caused their electrostatic adsorption to the prion protein fibril surface.
