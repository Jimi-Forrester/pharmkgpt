26654409|t|Using Neuroleptics to Treat Delirium in Dying Cancer Patients at a Cancer Center in Saudi Arabia.
26654409|a|Neuroleptics are commonly used for treating delirium as a common problem in terminally ill cancer patients. However, prescribing patterns are believed to substantially vary among health professionals. The aim of this study is to determine the pattern of prescribing neuroleptics for treating delirium in cancer patients dying in a palliative care unit in Saudi Arabia. We reviewed the medical records of adults with advanced cancer who died in the palliative care unit over 23 months. In addition to patients' demographics, data collection included the pattern of prescribing neuroleptics for the treatment of delirium during the last week of life. For the 271 patients included (57.6% females), the median age was 54 years. Although 62% of patients were on around-the-clock (ATC) neuroleptics to treat delirium, about two thirds of these were requiring rescue doses (PRN [pro re nata]) as well. The ATC neuroleptics included haloperidol alone (89.3%), levomepromazine alone (2.4%), or both (8.3%). All neuroleptics were administered via the parenteral route. On average, the maximum daily doses of the ATC neuroleptics were 4 mg for haloperidol and 15.5 mg for levomepromazine. Patients with primary or metastatic brain cancers were less likely to be on neuroleptics (P < .0001). The authors conclude that in their palliative care unit, haloperidol is by far the most commonly used neuroleptic, followed by levomepromazine, to treat the common problem of delirium in patients dying with advanced cancer. The generally low doses of neuroleptics required may be attributed to several factors in this population, including cultural motives.
