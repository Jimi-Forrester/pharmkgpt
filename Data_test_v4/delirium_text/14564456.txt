14564456|a|Tau protein is the main component of neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Immunohistochemistry of tau protein is useful in the diagnosis of AD but produces diffuse staining of neocortical neurons in fire fatalities. To learn the cause of this phenomenon, we examined the temporal neocortex of 13 fire fatalities and 9 fatalities unrelated to fire. The diffuse tau immunoreactive neurons were observed in 10 fire fatalities with heat coagulation of the cerebrum. Diffuse staining was not found in the three fire fatalities without heat coagulation of the cerebrum or in fatalities unrelated to fire. The immunoreactivity progressively increased as a function of the degree of cerebral heat coagulation. These results demonstrate that diffuse tau immunoreactivity of neocortical neurons is a post-mortem phenomenon caused by prolonged exposure of the head to intense heat. Forensic pathologists should consider this phenomenon when they diagnose AD in fire fatalities.
