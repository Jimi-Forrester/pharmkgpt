37926810|t|Incidence and survival of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy from a French nationwide study of in- and out-patient databases.
37926810|a|BACKGROUND: Precise data about ATTR-CM incidence rates at national level are scarce. Consequently, this study aimed to estimate the annual incidence and survival of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) in France between 2011 and 2019 using real world data. We used the French nationwide exhaustive data (SNDS database) gathering in- and out-patient claims. As there is no specific ICD-10 marker code for ATTR-CM, diagnosis required both amyloidosis (identified by E85. ICD-10 code or a tafamidis meglumine delivery) and a cardiovascular condition (identified by ICD-10 or medical procedure codes related to either heart failure, arrhythmias, conduction disorders or cardiomyopathies), not necessarily reported at the same visit. Patients with probable AL-form of amyloidosis or probable AA-form of amyloidosis were excluded. RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2019, 8,950 patients with incident ATTR-CM were identified. Incidence rates increased from 0.6 / 100,000 person-years in 2011 to 3.6 / 100,000 person-years in 2019 (p < 0.001), reaching 2377 new cases in 2019. Sex ratios (M/F) increased from 1.52 in 2011 to 2.23 in 2019. In 2019, median age at diagnosis was 84.0 years (85.5 for women and 83.5 for men). Median survival after diagnosis was 41.9 months (95% CI [39.6, 44.1]). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first estimate of nationwide ATTR-CM incidence in France using comprehensive real-world databases. We observed an increased incidence over the study period, consistent with an improvement in ATTR-CM diagnosis in recent years.
