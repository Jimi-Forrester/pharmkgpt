11263076|a|The clinical signs and symptoms of so-called "cerebrovascular insufficiency" or "cerebral vascular dysfunction" have the characteristics of those of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. The clinical features of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion often show the symptoms of cognitive impairment and organic psychosyndromes. Cerebral hypoperfusion could be found in dementias of different origin (subcortical arteriosclerotic leucoencephalopathy [Binswanger], vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, etc.). Pathological changes caused by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion often confined only to the white matter (demyelisation, glial activation, damage of oligodendroglial cells, as well as scattered cell death). Each therapy has an influence on the biochemical and pathophysiological alterations caused by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion can be used with reason in these disorders. The mechanism of action of vinpocetine is interfering on many aspects with the biochemical and pathophysiological processes attributable to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, independently of the original alteration responsible for hypoperfusion. This fact might give an explanation on the beneficial effect of vinpocetine on clinical signs and symptoms of chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency.
