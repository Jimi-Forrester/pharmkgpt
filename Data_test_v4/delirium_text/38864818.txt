38864818|a|Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is an uncommon B-cell lymphoma associated with human herpesvirus 8 and comprises 3-4% of all HIV-related lymphomas. It traditionally presents as a pleural, pericardial, and/or peritoneal effusion, though it can occasionally manifest as an extracavitary or solid mass in the absence of an effusion. The extracavitary or solid variant of primary effusion lymphoma has been reported in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, lung, and lymph nodes. However, very few cases have been reported in the central nervous system. We describe a case of extracavitary or solid variant of primary effusion lymphoma presenting as a brain mass in an HIV-positive man, highlighting the clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic findings of a rare entity.
