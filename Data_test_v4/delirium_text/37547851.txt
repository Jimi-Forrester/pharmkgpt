37547851|a|Background: Although increased occurrence of septicemia in persons with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has been reported, incidence rates and risk of septicemia and urinary tract infection (UTI) after CDI are unclear. Methods: The first episode of CDI was identified using 2011-2017 MarketScan and CMS Medicare data and CDI cases categorized by standard surveillance definitions. Uninfected persons were frequency matched 4:1 to cases by the CDI case surveillance definition. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify risk factors for septicemia and UTI within 90 days of CDI onset, accounting for the competing risk of death in the Medicare population. Results: The incidence of septicemia was highest after hospital-onset CDI in the Medicare, younger commercial, and younger Medicaid populations (25.5%, 15.7%, and 19.5%, respectively) and lowest in those with community-associated CDI (3.8%, 4.3%, and 8.3%, respectively). In contrast, the incidence of UTI was highest in those with other healthcare facility onset CDI in all 3 populations (32.1%, 24.2%, and 18.1%, respectively). Hospital-onset CDI was associated with highest risk of septicemia compared with uninfected controls in all 3 populations. In the younger populations, risk of septicemia was more uniform across the CDI surveillance definitions. The risk of UTI was significantly higher in all CDI surveillance categories compared to uninfected controls, and among CDI cases it was lowest in those with community-associated CDI. Conclusions: The incidence of septicemia is high after CDI, particularly after hospital-onset infection. Additional preventive measures are needed to reduce infectious complications of CDI.
