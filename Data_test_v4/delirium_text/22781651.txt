METHODS: Cultured primary hippocampus neurons were treated with different concentrations of Abeta(1-42), apoptosis rate was detected by flow cytometry, real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot were used to detect IGF-I receptor expression. RESULTS: Primary cultured cells mature in 7(th) days; after detected by flow cytometry, early apoptosis rate in Abeta(1-42) 0, 30, 60, 100 micromol/L groups showed a concentration-dependent increase. PCR results showed that, in 30 (1.72 +- 0.33) and 60 micromol/L (1.86 +- 0.36) treatment groups levels of the IGF-I receptor gene were significantly higher than the control group (regarded as 1) (P < 0.01), 100 micromol/L group (0.70 +- 0.15) was significantly lower than the control group (P < 0.05). Results of Western blot showed 30 and 60 micromol/L protein level of the treatment groups are 1.08 +- 0.04, 1.74 +- 0.08 (P < 0.01) and 100 micromol/L group was 0.79 +- 0.11(P < 0.05), which had same trend with PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Abeta(1-42) induced altered expression of IGF-I receptors in rat hippocampus cells, maybe one of the molecule mechanisms of Alzheimer disease.
