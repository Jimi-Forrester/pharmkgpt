34009428|a|A 26-year-old female presented to the emergency department due to abdominal pain in spite of painkillers. After extensive clinical diagnostics, no specific cause could be found. The further course was aggravated by a seizure due to hyponatremia. The combination of abdominal and neurological symptoms as well as darkening of the urine led to the diagnosis of porphyria. Drugs that were known to be triggers were avoided and treatment with heme arginate and glucose was started. In addition, treatment of the delirium and infection led to a complete remission of symptoms.
