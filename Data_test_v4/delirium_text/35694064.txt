35694064|t|Cognitive Deficits in Patients with COVID-19 Infection during Their Hospital Stay: An Exploratory Study.
35694064|a|Background  The literature on presence of cognitive deficits in patients recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is emerging. However, the data on whether cognitive deficits have its onset during the acute phase of illness has not been evaluated extensively. Aim  This article estimates the level of cognitive functioning of patients with COVID-19 while they were admitted to COVID-designated wards. Secondary objectives were to assess the influence of medical comorbidities, severity of COVID-19 infection, and depressive and anxiety symptoms on cognitive functioning in patients with COVID-19 infection. Methods  Sixty-six clinically stable patients with COVID-19 infection were evaluated during their inpatient stay on Hindi Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (H-MoCA), Hindi Mini-Mental State Examination (HMSE) scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire -7. Results  The mean age of the study participants was 39.85 (standard deviation [SD] 16.89) years and the participants were evaluated after 9.34 (SD 4.98; median 9.0) days of being diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. About one-fourth (28.8%; n  = 19) of the participants had cognitive impairment on HMSE and about two-fifths ( n  = 26; 39.39%) had cognitive impairment as per the cutoff used for H-MoCA. A higher level of cognitive deficits were seen among participants who were older, diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, and those who required oxygen support during their hospital stay prior to assessment. Conclusion  Low cognitive score was found in one-fourth (28.8%) to two-fifths (39.9%) of the persons, depending on the assessment scale among those with acute COVID-19 infection. Low cognitive score was more prevalent among the elderly, those with diabetes mellitus, and those who required oxygen support prior to the assessment.
