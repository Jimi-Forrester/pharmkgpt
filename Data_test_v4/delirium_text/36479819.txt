36479819|t|Insights into the Effect of Catalytic Intratumoral Lactate Depletion on Metabolic Reprogramming and Immune Activation for Antitumoral Activity.
36479819|a|Lactate, a characteristic metabolite of the tumor microenvironment (TME), drives immunosuppression and promotes tumor progression. Material-engineered strategies for intratumoral lactate modulations demonstrate their promise for tumor immunotherapy. However, understanding of the inherent interconnections of material-enabled lactate regulation, metabolism, and immunity in the TME is scarce. To address this issue, urchin-like catalysts of the encapsulated Gd-doped CeO2 , syrosingopine, and lactate oxidase are used in ZIF-8 (USL, where U, S, and L represent the urchin-like Gd-doped CeO2 @ZIF-8, syrosingopine, and lactate oxidase, respectively) and orthotopic tumor models. The instructive relationships of intratumoral lactate depletion, metabolic reprogramming, and immune activation for catalytic immunotherapy of tumors is illustrated. The catalysts efficiently oxidize intratumoral lactate and significantly promote tumor cell apoptosis by in situ-generated  OH, thereby reducing glucose supply and inducing mitochondrial damage via lactate depletion, thus reprogramming glycometabolism. Subsequently, such catalytic metabolic reprogramming evokes both local and systemic antitumor immunity by activating M1-polarizaed macrophages and CD8+ T cells, leading to potent antitumor immunity. This study provides valuable mechanistic insights into material-interfered tumor therapy through intratumoral lactate depletion and consequential connection with metabolic reprogramming and immunity remodeling, which is thought to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.
