37759703|t|The Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU): Molecular Identity and Role in Human Diseases.
37759703|a|Calcium (Ca2+) ions act as a second messenger, regulating several cell functions. Mitochondria are critical organelles for the regulation of intracellular Ca2+. Mitochondrial calcium (mtCa2+) uptake is ensured by the presence in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex, a macromolecular structure composed of pore-forming and regulatory subunits. MtCa2+ uptake plays a crucial role in the regulation of oxidative metabolism and cell death. A lot of evidence demonstrates that the dysregulation of mtCa2+ homeostasis can have serious pathological outcomes. In this review, we briefly discuss the molecular structure and the function of the MCU complex and then we focus our attention on human diseases in which a dysfunction in mtCa2+ has been shown.
