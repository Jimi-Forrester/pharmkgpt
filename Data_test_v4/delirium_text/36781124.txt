36781124|t|A new electrochemical method that mimics phosphorylation of the core tau peptide K18 enables kinetic and structural analysis of intermediates and assembly.
36781124|a|Tau protein's reversible assembly and binding of microtubules in brain neurons are regulated by charge-neutralizing phosphorylation, while its hyperphosphorylation drives the irreversible formation of cytotoxic filaments associated with neurodegenerative diseases. However, the structural changes that facilitate these diverse functions are unclear. Here, we analyzed K18, a core peptide of tau, using newly developed spectroelectrochemical instrumentation that enables electroreduction as a surrogate for charge neutralization by phosphorylation, with simultaneous, real-time quantitative analyses of the resulting conformational transitions and assembly. We observed a tipping point between behaviors that paralleled the transition between tau's physiologically required, reversible folding and assembly and the irreversibility of assemblies. The resulting rapidly electroassembled structures represent the first fibrillar tangles of K18 that have been formed in vitro at room temperature without using heparin or other charge-complementary anionic partners. These methods make it possible to (i) trigger and analyze in real time the early stages of conformational transitions and assembly without the need for preformed seeds, heterogenous coacervation, or crowding; (ii) kinetically resolve and potentially isolate never-before-seen early intermediates in these processes; and (iii) develop assays for additional factors and mechanisms that can direct the trajectory of assembly from physiologically benign and reversible to potentially pathological and irreversible structures. We anticipate wide applicability of these methods to other amyloidogenic systems and beyond.
