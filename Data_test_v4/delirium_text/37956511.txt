37956511|a|Non-invasive ultrasound neuromodulation (USNM) is a powerful tool to explore neural circuits and treat neurological disorders. Due to the heterogeneity of the skull and regional variations in modulation and treatment objectives, it is necessary to develop an efficient and spatially controllable neuromodulation approach. Recently, transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) combined with external biomicro/nanomaterials for brain stimulation has garnered significant attention. This study focused on tFUS combined with perfluoropentane (PFP) nanodroplets (NDs) to improve the efficacy and spatial controllability of USNM. The developed two-stage variable pulse tFUS sequence that include the acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV) pulse for vaporizing PFP NDs into microbubbles (MBs) and the USNM sequence for inducing mechanical oscillations of the formed MBs to enhance neuronal activity. Further, adjusting the acoustic pressure of the ADV pulse generated the controllable vaporization regions, thereby achieving spatially controllable neuromodulation. The results showed that the mean densities of c-fos+ cells expression in the group of PFP NDs with ADV (109 +- 19 cells/mm2) were significantly higher compared to the group without ADV (37.34 +- 8.24 cells/mm2). The acoustic pressure of the ADV pulse with 1.98 MPa and 2.81 MPa in vitro generated the vaporization regions of 0.146 +- 0.032 cm2 and 0.349 +- 0.056 cm2, respectively. Under the same stimulation conditions, a larger vaporization region was also obtained with higher acoustic pressure in vivo, inducing a broader region of neuronal activation. Therefore, this study will serve as a valuable reference for developing the efficient and spatially controllable tFUS neuromodulation strategy.
