38192588|t|Hearing impairment and risk of dementia in The HUNT Study (HUNT4 70+): a Norwegian cohort study.
38192588|a|Background: Hearing impairment is strongly associated with future dementia. No studies have reported objectively measured hearing impairment in a cohort with a long period of follow-up (>20 years), and few have reported follow-up over 10 years. Hence, there is a need for high quality studies with sufficient follow-up time and data to account for reverse causality and confounding. We aimed to address this knowledge gap. Methods: This cohort study used individual participant data from The Trondelag Health Study (HUNT) in Norway. All current residents aged at least 20 years in the former Norwegian Nord-Trondelag County were invited to participate in four decennial surveys: HUNT1 (1984-1986), HUNT2 (1995-1997), HUNT3 (2006-2008), and HUNT4 (2017-2019) with individuals aged at least 70 years included in a substudy, known as HUNT4 70+. Here, we report the findings of this substudy. HUNT4 70+ comprised 7135 participants who were assessed for dementia using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 criteria and who had audiometry between 1996 and 1998. The primary objective was to investigate, with gold standard audiometric testing and dementia diagnostic assessment, whether hearing impairment was an independent risk factor for all-cause dementia. The secondary objective was to investigate if a risk also applied to Alzheimer dementia and non-Alzheimer dementia. We analysed the association using Poisson regression and adjusted for confounders. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04284384). Findings: At baseline, 1058 (15%) individuals had acquired hearing impairment with a hearing threshold of at least 25 decibel (dB) and, at follow-up, 1089 (15%) had dementia. In the total group, people with hearing impairment had a relative risk (RR) 1.04 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.09) per 10 dB increase in hearing thresholds. For individuals younger than 85 years at follow-up the RR was 1.12 (95% CI 1.05-1.21). Associations between hearing impairment and Alzheimer dementia and non-Alzheimer dementia were similar. There was no association for individuals aged at least 85 years. Interpretation: We found a moderate association between objectively measured hearing impairment and dementia in the younger age group (<85 years). The findings of no association in the older age group (>=85 years) might be due to the competing risk of death. The present study adds to the literature showing that acquired hearing impairment is a risk for dementias over a period which is too long for reverse causation, and with thorough consideration of confounders. Further research is needed to investigate associations between the different aetiologies of hearing loss and dementia subtypes, and risk differences for sexes.
