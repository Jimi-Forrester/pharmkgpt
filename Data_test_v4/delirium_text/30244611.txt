30244611|t|An evaluation of memantine ER + donepezil for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
30244611|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide and carries an immense societal burden. Unfortunately, no curative or disease-modifying treatment has yet been discovered. The currently approved medications are symptomatic. They include two classes: the cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, and the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine. Most evidence has shown that combining both classes is superior to monotherapy but may complicate the treatment regimen for patients and families. Namzaric , a fixed dose combination of donepezil and memantine extended-release (ER) (FDC memantine ER/donepezil), was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with moderate to severe AD and warrants further consideration as a clinically useful and advantageous pharmacotherapy in AD. Areas covered: This review discusses the pharmacological properties, efficacy, and safety/tolerability data of this FDC memantine ER/donepezil as well as its benefits and disadvantages for patients and families. A literature search using PubMed was conducted using Namzaric, donepezil, memantine, AD, and medication adherence as keywords. Expert opinion: Aside from its cost, FDC memantine ER/donepezil improves adherence to medication and reduces caregiver burden. It allows patients to benefit from combination therapy as the disease progresses, especially in those with dysphagia, poor adherence and limited caregiver support.
