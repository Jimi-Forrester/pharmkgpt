39402873|a|BACKGROUND: Mazus pumilus (MP) an Asian flowering plant, known for various reported pharmacological activities including antioxidant, anti-nociceptive, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antibacterial, antifungal, and hepatoprotective effects. This study focused on further exploring Mazus pumilus's methanol leaf extract (MPM) for bioactive principles and investigating its neuroprotective and cognition-enhancing potential in Alzheimer's disease models. METHODS: For the phytochemical screening and identification, TLC, HPLC, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) were employed. In-vitro antioxidant potential was assayed by DPPH Free Radical Scavenging method, followed by in-vivo neuroprotective effect of MPM (100, 200, 300 mg/kg) using Wistar-albino rats, sodium azide for induction of AD and rivastigmine as standard. Over 21 days, we observed neurobehavioral changes and performed biochemical (GSH, CAT, SOD, and AchE activity) and histopathological evaluations. RESULTS: Results revealed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, amino acids, terpenoids, glycosides, sterols, and saponins. HPLC analysis confirmed the presence of gallic acids, sinapic acid, and caffeic acid. DPPH confirmed the antioxidant effect of MPM, which served as a base for its potential neuroprotective activity. Biochemically, oxidative stress markers improved significantly post-treatment, with decreased GSH, SOD, CAT levels, and increased AchE activity, indicating a reversal of AD-induced changes. Behavioral assessments showed improvements in locomotion, memory, spatial learning, and cognition. Histologically, there was a dose-dependent reduction in neurodegenerative features like neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid beta plaques. CONCLUSIONS: Hence, this study concluded MPM is a promising candidate for prophylaxis and treatment of behavioral deficits and cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.
