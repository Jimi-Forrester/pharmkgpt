35048018|t|Alzheimer's Disease and Oral-Systemic Health: Bidirectional Care Integration Improving Outcomes.
35048018|a|Dentistry is an effective healthcare field that can impact Alzheimer's disease through prevention and education. Every day dental providers use an arsenal of assessment protocols directly coinciding with modifiable Alzheimer's risk factors. An innovative way to help in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease is to utilize oral health professionals who reach the public in ways other health care providers may not. Bidirectional care integration is needed to stifle many systemic diseases and Alzheimer's disease is no different. Ultimately with collaborative care the patient reaps the benefits. Alzheimer's is associated with many etiologies and pathophysiological processes. These include cardiovascular health, smoking, sleep, inflammatory pathogens, and diabetes. In the United States, dental providers assess each of these factors daily and can be instrumental in educating patients on the influence of these factors for dementia prevention. Globally, by 2025, the number of people with Alzheimer's disease is expected to rise by at least 14%. Such increases will strain local and national health care systems, but for the US if Medicare were expanded to include dental services, many older adults could be spared needless suffering. The goal of this perspective article is to highlight existing practices being used in the field of dentistry that can easily be adapted to educate patients in preventive care and treat risk factors. It is the duty of healthcare professionals to explore all opportunities to stem the advance of this disease and by integrating oral and systemic health into transdisciplinary science, health care and policy may do just that.
