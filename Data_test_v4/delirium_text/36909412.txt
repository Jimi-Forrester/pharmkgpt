36909412|a|Flavonoids are one of the most important bioactive components in litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) seeds and have broad-spectrum antiviral and antitumor activities. Litchi seeds have been shown to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells and induce apoptosis, particularly effective against breast and liver cancers. Elucidating the distribution of flavonoids is important for understanding their physiological and biochemical functions and facilitating their efficient extraction and utilization. However, the spatial distribution patterns and expression states of flavonoids in litchi seeds remain unclear. Herein, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) was used for in situ detection and imaging of the distribution of flavonoids in litchi seed tissue sections for the first time. Fifteen flavonoid ion signals, including liquiritigenin, apigenin, naringenin, luteolin, dihydrokaempferol, daidzein, quercetin, taxifolin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, myricetin, catechin, quercetin 3-beta-d-glucoside, baicalin, and rutin, were successfully detected and imaged in situ through MALDI-MSI in the positive ion mode using 2-mercaptobenzothiazole as a matrix. The results clearly showed the heterogeneous distribution of flavonoids, indicating the potential of litchi seeds for flavonoid compound extraction. MALDI-MS-based multi-imaging enhanced the visualization of spatial distribution and expression states of flavonoids. Thus, apart from improving our understanding of the spatial distribution of flavonoids in litchi seeds, our findings also facilitate the development of MALDI-MSI-based metabolomics as a novel effective molecular imaging tool for evaluating the spatial distribution of endogenous compounds.
