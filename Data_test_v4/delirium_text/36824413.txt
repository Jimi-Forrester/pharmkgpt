36824413|t|Huperzine A-Liposomes Efficiently Improve Neural Injury in the Hippocampus of Mice with Chronic Intermittent Hypoxia.
36824413|a|Background: Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) could cause neuronal damage, accelerating the progression of dementia. However, safe and effective therapeutic drugs and delivery are needed for successful CIH therapy. Purpose: To investigate the neuroprotective effect of Huperzine A (HuA) packaged with nanoliposomes (HuA-LIP) on neuronal damage induced by CIH. Methods: The stability and release of HuA-LIP in vitro were identified. Mice were randomly divided into the Control, CIH, HuA-LIP, and HuA groups. The mice in the HuA and HuA-LIP groups received HuA (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), and HuA-LIP was administered during CIH exposure for 21 days. HuA-LIP contains the equivalent content of HuA. Results: We prepared a novel formulation of HuA-LIP that had good stability and controlled release. First, HuA-LIP significantly ameliorated cognitive dysfunction and neuronal damage in CIH mice. Second, HuA-LIP elevated T-SOD and GSH-Px abilities and decreased MDA content to resist oxidative stress damage induced by CIH. Furthermore, HuA-LIP reduced brain iron levels by downregulating TfR1, hepcidin, and FTL expression. In addition, HuA-LIP activated the PKAalpha/Erk/CREB/BDNF signaling pathway and elevated MAP2, PSD95, and synaptophysin to improve synaptic plasticity. Most importantly, compared with HuA, HuA-LIP showed a superior performance against neuronal damage induced by CIH. Conclusion: HuA-LIP has a good sustained-release effect and targeting ability and efficiently protects against neural injury caused by CIH.
