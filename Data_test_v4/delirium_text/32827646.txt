32827646|a|Structurally and functionally active synapses are essential for neurotransmission and for maintaining normal synaptic and cognitive functions. Researchers have found that synaptic dysfunction is associated with the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and synaptic dysfunction is even one of the main physiological hallmarks of AD. MiRNAs are present in small, subcellular compartments of the neuron such as neural dendrites, synaptic vesicles, and synaptosomes are known as synaptic miRNAs. Synaptic miRNAs involved in governing multiple synaptic functions that lead to healthy brain functioning and synaptic activity. However, the precise role of synaptic miRNAs has not been determined in AD progression. This review emphasizes the presence of miRNAs at the synapse, synaptic compartments and roles of miRNAs in multiple synaptic functions. We focused on synaptic miRNAs alteration in AD, and how the modulation of miRNAs effect the synaptic functions in AD. We also discussed the impact of synaptic miRNAs in AD progression concerning the synaptic ATP production, mitochondrial function, and synaptic activity.
