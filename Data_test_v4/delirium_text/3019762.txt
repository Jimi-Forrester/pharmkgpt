3019762|t|[Relationship between the cyclic nucleotide content of blood plasma and the clinical course of chronic alcoholism].
3019762|a|In patients with chronic alcoholism out of abstinence the plasma cAMP concentration was shown to decrease and that of cGMP to increase, cAMP/cGMP ratio was 1.8 in contrast to control value of 4.2. During abstinence the plasma cAMP level was higher and cAMP/cGMP ratio in patients with abstinence was 3.1. In patients with acute hallucinosis the plasma cAMP level was lower but during delirium, on the contrary, as well as the plasma cGMP level, higher than in control. The treatment of alcoholic patients relieved clinical symptoms of abstinence but the plasma cyclic nucleotide levels didn't change significantly. In most patients after cessation of delirium the plasma cAMP level was significantly lower as compared with pretreatment level.
