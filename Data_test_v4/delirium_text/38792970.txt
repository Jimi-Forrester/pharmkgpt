38792970|t|Factors Associated with Length of Hospitalization in Patients with Diabetes and Mild COVID-19: Experiences from a Tertiary University Center in Serbia.
38792970|a|Background and Objectives: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increased number of hospitalized COVID-19-positive patients suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The objective of this research study was to explore factors associated with the length of hospitalization of patients with T2DM and the mild form of COVID-19. Material and Methods: This retrospective cohort study involved all patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and those who were treated in the dedicated COVID-19 department of the University Clinical Center (UCC) in Nis between 10 September 2021 and 31 December 2021. Upon admission, patients underwent blood tests for biochemical analysis, including blood count, kidney and liver function parameters (C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine kinase, and D-dimer), and glycemia and HbA1c assessments. Additionally, all patients underwent lung radiography. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were employed to assess the impact of specific factors on the length of hospitalization among patients with T2DM. Results: Out of a total of 549 treated COVID-19-positive patients, 124 (21.0%) had T2DM, while 470 (79.0%) did not have diabetes. Among patients with T2DM, men were significantly younger than women (60.6 +- 16.8 vs. 64.2 +- 15.3, p < 0.01). The average hospitalization length of patients with diabetes was 20.2 +- 9.6 (5 to 54 days), and it was significantly longer than for patients without diabetes, at 15.0 +- 3.4, which ranged from 3 days to 39 (t-test   5.86, p < 0.05). According to the results of the univariate regression analysis, each year of age is associated with an increase in the length of hospital stay of 0.06 days (95% CI: 0.024 to 0.128, p = 0.004). Patients who received oxygen therapy were treated for 2.8 days longer than those who did not receive oxygen treatment (95% CI: 0.687 to 4988, p = 0.010), and each one-unit increase in CRP level was associated with a 0.02-day reduction in the length of hospitalization (95% CI: 0.004 to 0.029, p = 0.008). Based on the results of the multivariate regression analysis, each year of age is associated with an increase in the length of hospitalization by 0.07 days (95% CI: 0.022 to 0.110, p = 0.003). Patients who received oxygen therapy were treated for 3.2 days longer than those who did not receive oxygen therapy (95% CI: 0.653 to 5726, p = 0.014), and each unit increase in CRP level was associated with a 0.02-day reduction in the length of hospitalization (95% CI: 0.005 to 0.028, p = 0.004). Conclusions: Based on the presented results, COVID-19-positive patients with diabetes had, on average, longer hospitalizations than COVID-19 patients without diabetes. The hospital treatment of patients with T2DM and a milder form of COVID-19 was associated with older age, the use of oxygen therapy, and elevated CRP values. Patients who received oxygen therapy were treated approximately 3 days longer than those who did not receive this therapy.
