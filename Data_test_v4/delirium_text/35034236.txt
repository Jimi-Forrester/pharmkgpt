35034236|a|The first case of coronavirus illness was discovered in Wuhan, China, in January 2020 and quickly spread worldwide within the next couple of months. The condition was initially only linked with respiratory disorders. After the evolution of various variants of the SARS-CoV-2, the critical impact of the virus spread to multiple organs and soon, neurological disorder manifestations started to appear in the infected patients. The review is focused on the manifestation of various neurological disorders linked with both the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. Disorders such as cytokine release syndrome, encephalitis, acute stroke, and Bell's palsy are given specific attention and psychological manifestations are also investigated. For a clear conclusion, cognitive impairment, drug addiction disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder are all fully examined. The association of the SARS-CoV-2 with neurological disorders and pathway is yet to be clear. For better understanding, the explanation of the possible mechanism of viral infection influencing the nervous system is also attempted in the review. While several vaccines and drugs are already involved in treating the SARS-CoV-2 condition, the disease is still considered fatal and more likely to leave permanent neurological damage, which leads to an essential requirement for more research to explore the neurological toll of the COVID-19 disease.
