27489858|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia. Classical hallmarks of AD such as amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary tangles do not completely explain AD pathogenesis. Recent investigations proposed Abeta peptide as an anti-microbial factor. Our previous works suggested that the concomitant presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from AD genetic studies might impair antiviral defenses and increase the individual susceptibility to herpes virus infection. Viruses of herpes family by inducing frequent cycles of reactivation and latency constantly challenge the immune response and drive the accumulation of memory T cells. However, the immune system is not able to completely eradicate these viruses. The continuous antigen stimulation activates chronic inflammatory responses that may progressively induce neurodegenerative mechanisms in genetically susceptible elderly. The aim of this paper is to suggest new perspectives in clinical pathogenesis of AD with potential prevention and new medical treatment of the age associated cognitive decline.
