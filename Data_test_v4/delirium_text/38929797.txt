38929797|t|Perioperative Blood Transfusion and Delirium after Total Knee or Hip Arthroplasty: Retrospective Analysis.
38929797|a|We investigated the type of blood component transfusion associated with increased postoperative delirium. Adult patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA) between 2017 and 2022 were included. Delirium was evaluated and treated within two days after surgery. A total of 6737 patients (4112 TKA/2625 THA) were retrospectively studied; 2.48% of patients in the TKA (n = 102) and THA (n = 65) groups had postoperative delirium. The blood transfusion (BT) and non-BT groups had similar percentages of patients who experienced postoperative delirium (3.34 vs. 2.35%, p = 0.080). In the multivariable logistic regression model, BT was not associated with postoperative delirium-adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.03, confidence interval (CI): 0.62, 1.71; p = 0.917. Moreover, transfusion of packed red blood cells (p = 0.651), platelets (p = 0.998), and cryoprecipitate (p = 0.999) were not associated with delirium. However, transfusion of fresh frozen plasma was associated with a 5.96-fold higher incidence of delirium-aOR: 5.96, 95% CI: 2.72, 13.04; p < 0.001. In conclusion, perioperative BT was not associated with postoperative delirium in patients who underwent TKA or THA. However, FFP transfusion was associated with an increased incidence of postoperative delirium.
