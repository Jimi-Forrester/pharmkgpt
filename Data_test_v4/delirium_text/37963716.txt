37963716|t|Elderly patients in the Emergency Department: Which patients should be selected for a different approach?
37963716|a|Background: While multidimensional and interdisciplinary assessment of older adult patients improves their short-term outcomes after evaluation in the emergency department (ED), this assessment is time-consuming and ill-suited for the busy environment. Thus, identifying patients who will benefit from this strategy is challenging. Therefore, this study aimed to identify older adult patients suitable for a different ED approach as well as independent variables associated with poor short-term clinical outcomes. Methods: We included all patients >=65 years attending 52 EDs in Spain over 7 d. Sociodemographic, comorbidity, and baseline functional status data were collected. The outcomes were 30-day mortality, re-presentation, hospital readmission, and the composite of all outcomes. Results: During the study among 96,014 patients evaluated in the ED, we included 23,338 patients >=65 years (mean age 78.4 [SD 8.1] years, 12,626 (54.1%) women). During follow-up, 5,776 (24.75) patients had poor outcomes after evaluation in the ED: 1,140 (4.88%) died, 4,640 (20.51) returned to the ED, and 1,739 (7.69) were readmitted 30 d after discharge following the index visit. A model including male sex, age >=75 years, arrival by ambulance, Charlson Cormorbidity Index >=3, and functional impairment had a C-index of 0.81 (0.80-0.82) for 30-day mortality. Conclusion: Male sex, age >=75 years, arrival by ambulance, functional impairment, or severe comorbidity are features of patients who could benefit from approaches in the ED different from the common triage to improve the poor short-term outcomes of this population.
