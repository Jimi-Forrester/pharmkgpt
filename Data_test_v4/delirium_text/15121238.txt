15121238|a|Changes in mRNA expression of soluble NSF-attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) and SNARE-associated proteins have been shown to occur in a number of disorders such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. We have shown previously that there is a decrease in protein levels of the SNARE-associated protein, complexin II (CPLXII) in Huntington's disease brain and in the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington's disease. In the current study, we used quantitative in situ hybridisation to examine mRNA expression of SNAREs (25 kDa synaptosome-associated protein (SNAP-25), syntaxin-1A and synaptobrevin-2) and SNARE-associated proteins (alpha-SNAP, CPLXI and CPLXII) in brain of R6/2 mice and their wild type littermates between 3 and 15 weeks of age. We found an early and progressive decrease of CPLXII expression in R6/2 mice brains. In contrast, no changes in SNARE expression were seen in R6/2 brains compared with wild type brain. Further, while decreased expression of alpha-SNAP and CPLXI was seen, this was not until 15 weeks of age and even then the changes were small. We suggest that downregulation of expression of mRNA encoding SNARE-associated proteins, first CPLXII and later CPLXI and alpha-SNAP, contributes to the progressive neuropathology of the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington's disease.
