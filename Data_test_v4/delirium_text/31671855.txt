31671855|t|MLL-Rearranged Acute Leukemia with t(4;11)(q21;q23)-Current Treatment Options. Is There a Role for CAR-T Cell Therapy?
31671855|a|The MLL (mixed-lineage leukemia) gene, located on chromosome 11q23, is involved in chromosomal translocations in a subtype of acute leukemia, which represents approximately 10% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 2.8% of acute myeloid leukemia cases. These translocations form fusions with various genes, of which more than 80 partner genes for MLL have been identified. The most recurrent fusion partner in MLL rearrangements (MLL-r) is AF4, mapping at chromosome 4q21, accounting for approximately 36% of MLL-r leukemia and particularly prevalent in MLL-r acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases (57%). MLL-r leukemia is associated with a sudden onset, aggressive progression, and notoriously poor prognosis in comparison to non-MLL-r leukemias. Despite modern chemotherapeutic interventions and the use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantations, infants, children, and adults with MLL-r leukemia generally have poor prognosis and response to these treatments. Based on the frequency of patients who relapse, do not achieve complete remission, or have brief event-free survival, there is a clear clinical need for a new effective therapy. In this review, we outline the current therapy options for MLL-r patients and the potential application of CAR-T therapy.
