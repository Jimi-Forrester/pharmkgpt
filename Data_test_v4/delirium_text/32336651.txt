32336651|t|Comparison of Pulmonary Gas Exchange During Kidney Transplantation: Second-Generation Laryngeal Mask Airway vs Endotracheal Tube.
32336651|a|INTRODUCTION: We evaluated whether second-generation laryngeal mask airway (LMA) could provide an adequate pulmonary gas exchange during prolonged abdominal surgery compared to endotracheal tube (ETT) using propensity score matching. METHODS: Of the 257 recipients who underwent living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT), the LMA group and ETT group were matched: 87 of 101 recipients who inserted second-generation LMA were matched with 87 of 156 recipients who inserted ETT. Arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fractional inspired oxygen (PFR) and intraoperative ventilator parameters were compared between the 2 groups. In addition, we compared incidences of postoperative pulmonary and nonpulmonary complications including hoarseness, vocal cord palsy, nausea, vomiting, arrhythmia, and delirium between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Median anesthesia time was 357 minutes. PaCO2 and PFR were comparable between the 2 groups and did not show group and time interaction. Ventilator parameters during surgery were comparable, and incidences of both postoperative pulmonary and nonpulmonary complications were also comparable between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Second-generation LMA could provide an adequate pulmonary gas exchange compared with ETT during LDKT. In terms of pulmonary gas exchange, second-generation LMA could be considered as a suitable alternative to ETT during prolonged abdominal surgery.
