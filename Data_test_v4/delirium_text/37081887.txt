37081887|a|The brain has long been considered an immune-privileged organ due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, recent discoveries have revealed the underestimated role of T cells in the brain through the meningeal lymphatic system. Age is the primary risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), resulting in marked age-dependent changes in T cells. Manipulating peripheral T cell immune response has been shown to impact AD, but the relationship between T cell aging and AD remains poorly understood. Given the limited success of targeting amyloid beta (Abeta) and the growing evidence of T cells' involvement in non-lymphoid organ aging, a deeper understanding of the relationship between T cells and AD in the context of aging is crucial for advancing therapeutic progress. In this review, we comprehensively examine existing studies on T cells and AD and offer an integrated perspective on their interconnections in the context of aging. This understanding can inform the development of new interventions to prevent or treat AD.
