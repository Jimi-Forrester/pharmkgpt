36016118|t|Clinical Manifestation, Management, and Outcomes in Patients with COVID-19 Vaccine-Induced Acute Encephalitis: Two Case Reports and a Literature Review.
36016118|a|INTRODUCTION: Vaccination is one of the best strategies to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and multiple vaccines have been introduced. A variety of neurological adverse effects have been noted after the implementation of large-scale vaccination programs. METHODS: We reported two rare cases of possible mRNA-1273 vaccine-induced acute encephalitis, including clinical manifestations, laboratory characteristics, and management. RESULTS: The clinical manifestations might be related to hyperproduction of systemic and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokines. mRNA vaccines are comprised of nucleoside-modified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mRNA, which is translated into SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by the host's ribosomes, activating the adaptive immune response. Exposed mRNA or vaccine components may also be detected as antigens, further resulting in aberrant proinflammatory cytokine cascades and activation of immune signaling pathways. Both patients exhibited significant clinical improvement after a course of steroid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The use of COVID-19 vaccines to prevent and control SARS-CoV-2 infections and complications is the most practicable policy worldwide. However, inaccurate diagnosis or other diagnostic delays in cases of vaccine-induced acute encephalitis may have devastating and potentially life-threatening consequences for patients. Early diagnosis and timely treatment can result in a favorable prognosis.
