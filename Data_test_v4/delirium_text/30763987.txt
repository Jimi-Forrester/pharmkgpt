30763987|t|Relationship between plasma YKL-40 levels and endothelial dysfunction in chronic kidney disease
30763987|a|Background/aim: We aimed to evaluate the relationship between YKL-40 and endothelial dysfunction in chronic kidney disease. Materials and methods: Twenty-nine  hemodialysis  patients,  101  patients  with  nondialytic  (stage  2,  3,  4,  and  5  ND)  chronic  kidney  disease  (CKD),  and  38  healthy  individuals  as  a  control  group  were  included.  YKL-40  levels  were  measured  by  ELISA.  Endothelial  dysfunction was indirectly measured by flow-mediated dilatation percentage (FMD) in the brachial artery. YKL-40 levels were higher in CKD patients than controls and highest in HD patients (P = 0.001). FMD values were lower in nondialytic CKD patients and lowest in HD patients (P = 0.001). YKL-40 negatively correlated with eGFR and FMD values (r = -0.674 and r = -0.471, respectively). This study shows that YKL-40 increases with CKD stage and is negatively correlated with FMD measurements
