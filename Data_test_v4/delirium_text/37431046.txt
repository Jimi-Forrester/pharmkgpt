37431046|a|Cherries are a good source of bioactive compounds, with high antioxidant activity as well as nutritional and therapeutic importance. In this study, cherry wines enriched with green tea infusion (mild and concentrated) were produced, and their biological properties were evaluated. During winemaking, the main vinification parameters (alcohol, reducing sugars, acidity, total polyphenol content) as well biological activity (antioxidant activity, alpha-glucosidase inhibition potential) were determined. An in vitro digestion process was also performed to evaluate the impact of the gastrointestinal environment on the biological stability of the wines, and to analyze the interactions of wine-intestinal microflora. The addition of green tea to the cherry wine significantly increased the total polyphenol content (up to 2.73 g GAE/L) and antioxidant activity (up to 22.07 mM TE/L), compared with the control wine. However, after in vitro digestion, a reduction in total polyphenols (53-64%) and antioxidant activity (38-45%) were noted. Wines fortified with green tea expressed a stronger inhibition effect on intestinal microflora growth, of which E. coli were the most sensitive microorganisms. The tea-derived bioactive compounds significantly increased the potential of alpha-glucosidase inhibition. The proposed wines could be a good alternative type of wine, with an increased polyphenol content and the potential to control the insulin response supporting therapy for diabetes.
