23974304|t|Radiosynthesis and in vivo evaluation of a 18F-labelled styryl-benzoxazole derivative for beta-amyloid targeting.
23974304|a|The formation of beta-amyloid deposits is considered a histopathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In vivo molecular imaging by means of amyloid-avid radiotracers will allow for an early and conclusive diagnostic of AD. Herein, we describe the radiosynthesis of the radiofluorinated styryl benzoxazole derivative [18F]-[2-[N-methyl-N-(2'-fluoroethyl)-4'-aminostyryl]benzoxazole] ([18F]-1) and its pre-clinical evaluation, including metabolic and biodistribution studies in male Wistar rats. The in vivo biological evaluation of [18F]-1 showed that this new radiotracer has a moderate brain uptake with a slow brain washout and a poor in vivo stability.
