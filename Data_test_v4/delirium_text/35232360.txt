35232360|t|Importance of Indazole against Neurological Disorders.
35232360|a|Indazole is a nitrogen-containing bicyclic compound, having three tautomeric forms: 1Hindazole, 2H-indazole, and 3H-indazole. Mostly, they are considered as 1H-indazole tautomeric forms, although they have the potential to tautomerism to 2H- and 3H-indazole forms. Indazoles are involved in a wide variety of biological and enzymatic processes. Therefore, they exhibit a series of pharmacological activities. Indazoles show potent activities against neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), mood disorders, etc., by inhibiting different signaling pathways and the generation of neurotransmitters and activation of enzyme activity. They effectively prevent neurological diseases by different mechanisms, such as by inhibiting the monoamine oxidase (MAO) and kinase enzymes like Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and leucinerich repeat kinase enzyme 2 (LRRK2). In this article, we have discussed multiple causative strategies of indazole to treat neurological diseases. This has aroused special attention in the discovery of the novel indazoles and their biological activities.
