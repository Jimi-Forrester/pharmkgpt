38311779|a|The abnormal aggregation of TDP-43 into cytoplasmic inclusions in affected neurons is a major pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Although TDP-43 is aberrantly accumulated in the neurons of most patients with sporadic ALS/FTD and other TDP-43 proteinopathies, how TDP-43 forms cytoplasmic aggregates remains unknown. In this study, we show that a deficiency in DCTN1, a subunit of the microtubule-associated motor protein complex dynactin, perturbs the dynamics of stress granules and drives the formation of TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregation in cultured cells, leading to the exacerbation of TDP-43 pathology and neurodegeneration in vivo. We demonstrated using a Drosophila model of ALS/FTD that genetic knockdown of DCTN1 accelerates the formation of ubiquitin-positive cytoplasmic inclusions of TDP-43. Knockdown of components of other microtubule-associated motor protein complexes, including dynein and kinesin, also increased the formation of TDP-43 inclusions, indicating that intracellular transport along microtubules plays a key role in TDP-43 pathology. Notably, DCTN1 knockdown delayed the disassembly of stress granules in stressed cells, leading to an increase in the formation of pathological cytoplasmic inclusions of TDP-43. Our results indicate that a deficiency in DCTN1, as well as disruption of intracellular transport along microtubules, is a modifier that drives the formation of TDP-43 pathology through the dysregulation of stress granule dynamics.
