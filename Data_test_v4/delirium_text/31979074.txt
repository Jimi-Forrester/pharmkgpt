31979074|a|Recipients of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy in Western countries often experience distressful physical and psychological adjustments. Sociocultural influences on post-implant recovery are likely; however, evidence from other ethnic/cultural backgrounds is lacking. This study aimed to examine the changes in physical function and psychological distress (anxiety and depressive symptoms) from pre-implant to one, six, and 12 months post-implant in Korean patients undergoing ICD therapy. A total of 34 patients underwent pre- to post-implant longitudinal assessments of physical and psychological function using mixed modeling procedures. Physical function significantly declined from pre-implant to one month post-implant (B = -10.05, p = 0.004) and then nearly returned to the pre-implant level at six months post-implant (B = 8.34, p = 0.028). This level of improvement continued through 12 months post-implant. In psychological distress, significant improvements were observed from pre-implant to one month (anxiety (B = -1.20, p = 0.020) and in depressive symptoms (B = -1.15, p = 0.037)), which then plateaued without significant changes from one to 12 months. We concluded that physical function recovery occurred six months post-implant, but function remained poor until 12 months post-implant. Psychological distress improved one month post-implant and it was maintained. Clinicians must provide more intensive interventions to improve long-term physical function after ICD therapy.
