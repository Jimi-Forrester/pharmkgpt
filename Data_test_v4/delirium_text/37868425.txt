37868425|t|Current Diagnostic and Treatment Methods of Alzheimer's Disease: A Narrative Review.
37868425|a|To diagnose and predict the possibility of Alzheimer's or a different kind of dementia, medical professionals employ tests that look at a patient's mental competence; however, such methods are impracticable. A reliable diagnosis at the start of treatment is essential for therapy. Except in situations with apparent genetic variations, most Alzheimer's patients lack a known etiology. Therefore, every Alzheimer's patient receives the same treatment plan, regardless of the etiology, which may or may not be successful in slowing or preventing the disease's progression. Tau pathology is further complicated by the amyloid buildup that arises from the cellular phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Alzheimer's is a degenerative, diverse, complicated, and incurable neurological disorder primarily affecting elderly individuals. The currently accepted drugs available for treating AD, which involve cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor antagonists only provide temporary relief from symptoms. The neurological disorder primarily affecting elderly individuals is degenerative, diverse, complicated, and incurable. Accurate diagnosis is the most essential prerequisite before beginning therapy. Most Alzheimer's patients' causes are still unclear, except for instances where hereditary variations have been noted. The gut microbiota composition significantly influences AD and any age-associated neurological illness. Therapies are very useful in improving the cognitive functions of AD. New microbiota-based therapy alternatives may now be available due to the more recent connection between the altered gut microbiome and neurodegeneration through the gut microbiota-brain axis.
