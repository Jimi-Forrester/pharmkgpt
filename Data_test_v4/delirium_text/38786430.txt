38786430|t|Study Protocol for the Residents' Mental Health Investigation, a Dynamic Longitudinal Study in Italy (ReMInDIt).
38786430|a|Medical residents constitute a vulnerable population susceptible to mental health disorders. In Italy, this was evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, when medical residents served on the front line and provided significant support to healthcare services. Therefore, the working group on "Public Mental Health" of the Medical Residents' Council of the Italian Society of Hygiene, Preventive Medicine, and Public Health (S.It.I.) designed the "Residents' mental health investigation, a dynamic longitudinal study in Italy" (ReMInDIt). This longitudinal study aims to assess the mental status of medical residents and to explore potential cause-effect relationships between risk/protective factors (identified among sociodemographic, residency program, and lifestyle characteristics) and mental health outcomes (anxiety and depressive symptoms). Data will be collected from a study population of 3615 residents enrolled in Italian residency programs in public health, occupational medicine, and forensic medicine through an online questionnaire that includes validated tools, requires 10 min for completion, and is disseminated by the residents' Councils. It will be followed by a follow-up administration after 12 months. The ReMInDIt study will play a significant role in generating evidence crucial for enhancing mental health services and promoting protective factors for the mental well-being of this important segment of healthcare professionals.
