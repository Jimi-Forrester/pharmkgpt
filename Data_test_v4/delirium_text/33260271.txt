33260271|a|AIM: Mild behavioural impairment (MBI) is a neurobehavioural syndrome characterized by emergent neuropsychiatric symptoms in later life. There has been no systematic review or meta-analysis on the prevalence of MBI. The main aim of the study is to calculate the pooled prevalence of MBI. METHODS: A search of the literature on MBI in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), cognitively normal (CN), and subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) and CN but at risk (CN-AR) subjects published between 1 January 2003 and 28 September 2020 was conducted. Meta-analysis using a random effects model was performed to determine the pooled estimate of the prevalence of MBI. Meta-regression was performed to identify factors contributing to the variance of prevalence rate. A systematic review was also performed to study the impact of MBI in cognitive outcomes and its correlation to the pathology and genetics of Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: Eleven studies conducted among 15 689 subjects underwent meta-analysis, revealing the pooled prevalence of MBI to be 33.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 22.6%-46.6%). Seven studies conducted among 1358 MCI subjects underwent meta-analysis, revealing the pooled prevalence to be 45.5% (95%CI: 36.1%-55.3%). Four studies conducted among 13 153 CN subjects underwent meta-analysis, revealing the pooled prevalence to be 17.0% (95%CI: 7.2%-34.9%). Five studies conducted among 1158 SCI or CN-AR subjects underwent meta-analysis, revealing the pooled prevalence to be 35.8% (95%CI: 21.4%-53.2%). A systematic review of 13 studies showed that MBI has a significant impact on cognitive deterioration and is associated with the pathology and genetics of Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSIONS: In MCI, CN, and SCI and CN-AR subjects, MBI is common. Our finding is potentially useful in planning future clinical trials.
