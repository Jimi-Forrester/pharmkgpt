24667175|a|Recently, the interest in natural products for the treatment of cancer is increasing because they are the pre-screened candidates. In the present study, we demonstrate the therapeutic effect of celastrol, a triterpene extracted from the root bark of Chinese medicine on gastric cancer. The proliferation of AGS and YCC-2 cells were most sensitively decreased in six kinds of gastric cancer cell lines after the treatment with celastrol. Celastrol inhibited the cell migration and increased G1 arrest in cell-cycle populations in both cell lines. The treatment with celastrol significantly induced autophagy and apoptosis and increased the expression of autophagy and apoptosis-related proteins. We also found an increase in phosphorylated AMPK following a decrease in all phosphorylated forms of AKT, mTOR and S6K after the treatment with celastrol. Moreover, gastric tumor burdens were reduced in a dose-dependent manner by celastrol administration in a xenografted mice model. Taken together, celastrol distinctly inhibits the gastric cancer cell proliferation and induces autophagy and apoptosis.
