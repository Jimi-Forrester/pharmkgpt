19564953|t|Microscopic investigation of reversible nanoscale surface size dependent protein conjugation.
19564953|a|Abeta(1-40) coated 20 nm gold colloidal nanoparticles exhibit a reversible color change as pH is externally altered between pH 4 and 10. This reversible process may contain important information on the initial reversible step reported for the fibrillogenesis of Abeta (a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease). We examined this reversible color change by microscopic investigations. AFM images on graphite surfaces revealed the morphology of Abeta aggregates with gold colloids. TEM images clearly demonstrate the correspondence between spectroscopic features and conformational changes of the gold colloid.
