38727435|t|The Interrelationship of Benefit Finding, Demoralization, and Stigma among Patients with Parkinson's Disease and Their Caregivers.
38727435|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease with a relentlessly progressive course of illness. This study aimed to assess the dyadic dynamics of benefit finding (BF), demoralization, and stigma on the depression severity of PD patients and their caregivers. This study used a cross-sectional design with purposive sampling. In total, 120 PD patients and 120 caregivers were recruited from the neurological ward or neurological outpatient clinic of a medical center in Taiwan from October 2021 to September 2022. PD patients and their caregivers were enrolled and assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, the Benefit Finding scale, Demoralization Scale, Stigma Subscale of the Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue, and Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire. Among the 120 patients and 120 caregivers that successfully completed the study, 41.7% (N = 50) and 60% (N = 72) were female, respectively. The most common psychiatric diagnoses of both the PD patients (17.5%) and their caregivers (13.3%) were depressive disorders. Using structural equation modeling, we found that the stigma, BF, and demoralization of PD patients might contribute to their depression severity. Demoralization and stigma of PD patients' caregivers might also contribute to the depression severity of PD patients. Caregivers' BF and demoralization were significantly linked with their depression severity. PD patients' BF degree and their caregivers' BF degree had significant interactive effects. Both patients' and their caregivers' stigma levels had significant interactive effects. Clinicians should be aware of and manage these contributing factors between PD patients and their caregivers in order to prevent them from exacerbating each other's depression.
