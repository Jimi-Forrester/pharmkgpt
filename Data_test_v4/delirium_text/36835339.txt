36835339|t|Impact of Microplastics on the Ocular Surface.
36835339|a|Plastics are synthetic materials made from organic polymers that are ubiquitous in daily living and are especially important in the healthcare setting. However, recent advances have revealed the pervasive nature of microplastics, which are formed by degradation of existing plastic products. Although the impact on human health has yet to be fully characterised, there is increasing evidence that microplastics can trigger inflammatory damage, microbial dysbiosis, and oxidative stress in humans. Although there are limited studies investigating their effect on the ocular surface, studies of microplastics on other organs provide some insights. The prevalence of plastic waste has also triggered public outcry, culminating in the development of legislation aimed at reducing microplastics in commercial products. We present a review outlining the possible sources of microplastics leading to ocular exposure, and analyse the possible mechanisms of ocular surface damage. Finally, we examine the utility and consequences of current legislation surrounding microplastic regulation.
