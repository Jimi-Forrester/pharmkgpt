30887795|t|Primary Age-Related Tauopathy: An Elderly Brain Pathology Frequently Encountered during Autopsy.
30887795|a|Due to the progressive aging of Korean society and the introduction of brain banks to the Korean medical system, the possibility that pathologists will have access to healthy elderly brains has increased. The histopathological analysis of an elderly brain from a subject with relatively well-preserved cognition is quite different from that of a brain from a demented subject. Additionally, the histology of elderly brains differs from that of young brains. This brief review discusses primary age-related tauopathy; this term was coined to describe elderly brains with Alzheimer's diseasetype neurofibrillary tangles mainly confined to medial temporal structures, and no beta-amyloid pathology.
