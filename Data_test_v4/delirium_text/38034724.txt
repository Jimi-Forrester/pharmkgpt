38034724|a|Background: Overweight and obesity as main health problems harm human beings worldwide. The number of people diagnosed with overweight and obese is gradually increasing. Green tea catechin has been reported to effectively help control body weight in overweight and obese population, and is protectively against the blood pressure and lipids in people with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Methods: We retrieved 4 English databases (PubMed, Web of science, Cochrane, Scoups) from inception to April 20, 2023. Two reviewers independently determined eligibility, assessed the reporting quality of included studies, and extracted the data. Data were extracted from eleven studies. The results were presented with the weighted mean differences (WMDs), and the confidence intervals (CIs) was 95 %. The random-effects or fixed-effects model was applied according to the heterogeneity. The subgroup analysis was used to identify the source of heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots, Egger's test, and Begg's test. Results: Eleven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) inclusion studies were screened from 3072 literature articles, involving 613 overweight and obese patients. After combining all studies, it was found that in overweight and obese people green tea catechin could reduce waist circumference (WC) (pooled WMD = -1.37 cm, 95 % CI: -2.52 to -0.22 cm, p = 0.019), and triglyceride (TG) (pooled WMD = -0.18 mmol/L, 95 % CI: -0.35 to -0.02 mmol/L, p = 0.032), and increase high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) (pooled WMD = 0.07 mmol/L, 95 % CI: 0.01-0.14 mmol/L, p = 0.031). Conclusion: Green tea catechin supplement effectively reduced WC and TG levels and improved HDL-c levels. However, it did not show the significant effect on the blood pressure in overweight and obese people. The present meta-analysis showed a moderate benefit of green tea catechin supplementation on lipid profiles in overweight and obese people.
