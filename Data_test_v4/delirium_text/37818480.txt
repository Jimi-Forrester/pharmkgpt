37818480|t|Resting-state prefrontal EEG biomarker in correlation with postoperative delirium in elderly patients.
37818480|a|Postoperative delirium (POD) is associated with adverse outcomes in elderly patients after surgery. Electroencephalography (EEG) can be used to develop a potential biomarker for degenerative cerebral dysfunctions, including mild cognitive impairment and dementia. This study aimed to explore the relationship between preoperative EEG and POD. We included 257 patients aged >70 years who underwent spinal surgery. We measured the median dominant frequency (MDF), which is a resting-state EEG biomarker involving intrinsic alpha oscillations that reflect an idle cortical state, from the prefrontal regions. Additionally, the mini-mental state examination and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) were performed before surgery as well as 5 days after surgery. For long-term cognitive function follow up, the telephone interview for cognitive status  (TICS) was performed 1 month and 1 year after surgery. Fifty-two (20.2%) patients were diagnosed with POD. A multivariable logistic regression analysis that included age, MoCA score, Charlson comorbidity index score, Mini Nutritional Assessment, and the MDF as variables revealed that the MDF had a significant odds ratio of 0.48 (95% confidence interval 0.27-0.85). Among the patients with POD, the postoperative neurocognitive disorders could last up to 1 year. Low MDF on preoperative EEG was associated with POD in elderly patients undergoing surgery. EEG could be a novel potential tool for identifying patients at a high risk of POD.
