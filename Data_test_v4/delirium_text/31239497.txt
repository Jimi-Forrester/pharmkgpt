31239497|t|Inhibition of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-Products in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: A Randomised Laboratory Trial in Piglets.
31239497|a|The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) modulates the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). RAGE inhibition attenuated lung injury and restored alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) in a mouse model of ARDS. However, clinical translation will require assessment of this strategy in larger animals. Forty-eight anaesthetised Landrace piglets were randomised into a control group and three treatment groups. Animals allocated to treatment groups underwent orotracheal instillation of hydrochloric acid (i) alone; (ii) in combination with intravenous administration of a RAGE antagonist peptide (RAP), or (iii) recombinant soluble (s)RAGE. The primary outcome was net AFC at 4 h. Arterial oxygenation was assessed hourly and alveolar-capillary permeability, alveolar inflammation and lung histology were assessed at 4 h. Treatment with either RAP or sRAGE improved net AFC (median [interquartile range], 21.2 [18.8-21.7] and 19.5 [17.1-21.5] %/h, respectively, versus 12.6 [3.2-18.8] %/h in injured, untreated controls), oxygenation and decreased alveolar inflammation and histological evidence of tissue injury after ARDS. These findings suggest that RAGE inhibition restored AFC and attenuated lung injury in a piglet model of acid-induced ARDS.
