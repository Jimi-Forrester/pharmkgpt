OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to understand the underlying mechanism of such improvement. METHODS: Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide was infused into the lateral ventricle of adult Wister rats using the osmotic pump. After 15 days of continuous infusion, a mesenchymal stem cell line (B10) was transplanted in the lateral ventricle. Learning-related behavior was evaluated by 2-way shuttle avoidance test. Fifteen days after B10 transplantation, pathological and expressional changes were evaluated. RESULTS: Compared to sham group, learning-related behavior was significantly decreased in Abeta-infused non-transplanted group, but not in B10-transplanted group. Nissl staining results demonstrated that the number of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in CA1 area in B10-transplanted group was similar to the sham group, whereas that was decreased in Abeta-infused non-transplanted group. Abeta mainly deposited in the vessels of the brains of Abeta-infused non-transplanted rats, which was decreased by B10 transplantation. Moreover, B10 transplantation increased vessel density as well as endoglin positive cells. The number of astrocyte and microglia was decreased in Abeta-infused non-transplanted group, which was returned to the level of sham animals by B10 transplantation. Real-time PCR and immunostaining results showed that B10 transplantation significantly increased IL-1beta mRNA and protein expression. CONCLUSION: Thus, our result showed that MSC transplantation effectively decreased Abeta deposition in the cerebral vessel and increased angiogenesis, which could be a possible cause of improved neurological performance in Abeta-infused AD model rats.
