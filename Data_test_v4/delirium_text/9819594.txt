9819594|a|Failing memory is a common complaint in the elderly, with the underlying fear of degenerative disease, especially Alzheimer's disease. However, compared with cognitive test results, these subjective complaints are not correlated with any recognizable cognitive disorder. Other factors are involved, including depression or anxiety as well as the social setting, self-esteem and the negative connotation of aging, requiring careful analysis for correct management. Age-related memory impairment is however quite real, expressed by a wide range of symptoms which can be detected on various psychomotor memory tests. The challenge is to detect those patients complaining of failing memory who really have age-related memory impairment and among them those who might be expected to progress to a state of dementia. In clinical practice, the clinician must look for non-cognitive factors (underlying disease state, sensorial disorder, depression, anxiety, social problems) and discuss with the patient his/her degree of independence in everyday activities. For certain patients, psychometric tests, advocated by some authors as capable of detecting pre-dementia states, may be indicated. In general, patients who complain of failing memory, who are not independent for certain everyday instrumental activities (telephone, transportation services, budget, medications) and who do not respond to clues on learning tests may be particularly susceptible to developing Alzheimer's disease.
