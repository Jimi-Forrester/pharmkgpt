33977009|t|Association between transient appetite loss and vitamin B1 deficiency in elderly patients with suspected deficiency.
33977009|a|BACKGROUND: There is scarce evidence associating vitamin B1 levels and appetite loss duration in elderly patients with suspected B1 deficiency. We aimed to investigate this association in elderly hospitalized patients with suspected vitamin B1 deficiency in rural Japan. METHODS: This cross-sectional study evaluated 309 elderly patients (aged >= 65 years) admitted to one rural Hospital between April 2017 and March 2019. We collected data on vitamin B1 level, age, sex, body mass index, albumin levels, area of residence, long-term care, dependent conditions, activities of daily living, Charlson comorbidity index, and appetite loss from the patients' electronic medical records. Vitamin B1 deficiency was defined as serum vitamin B1 levels <20 mug/dL. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U, Student's t, and chi-square tests, followed by multivariable logistic regression, to examine the association between vitamin B1 deficiency and appetite loss. RESULTS: Eighty-eight (28.5%) patients had vitamin B1 deficiency. In multivariable logistic regression, appetite loss (for both < 1 and > 1 week) before admission to the hospital showed a significant association with vitamin B1 deficiency (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] =10.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.16-22.00, P < .001; and AOR = 5.77, 95% CI: 2.88-11.50, P < .001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Appetite loss is associated with vitamin B1 deficiency in elderly Japanese patients living in rural areas. Therefore, physicians should be aware of the possibility of vitamin B1 deficiency in elderly patients with appetite loss and focus on early intervention.
