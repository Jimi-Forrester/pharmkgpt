37872918|t|A Case Report of Valacyclovir-Associated Neurotoxicity in End-Stage Renal Disease: A Rare but Preventable Side Effect.
37872918|a|Neurotoxicity can develop as a side effect of valacyclovir in patients with renal disease, especially without a renally adjusted dose. We present a 56-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who presented to the emergency room (ER) with agitation and confusion and was found to have valacyclovir-associated neurotoxicity (VAN). Five days prior, she had been prescribed the standard treatment of 500 mg valacyclovir twice daily for three days for herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1); however, her creatinine clearance was low enough to require a renally adjusted dose. Her condition was worsened from missing a dialysis session due to acute confusion. She was treated with three days of hemodialysis sessions. Improvement in mentation and agitation was observed after the second day of hemodialysis, and a complete resolution of symptoms and return to cognitive baseline occurred two days later. There are reports of daily hemodialysis shortening the neurotoxicity period and resulting in a faster return to normal mentation. This case is important as the dose of valacyclovir must be adjusted in those with kidney disease.
