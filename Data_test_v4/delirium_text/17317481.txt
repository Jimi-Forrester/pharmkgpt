17317481|t|Effectiveness of a cognitive rehabilitation program in mild dementia (MD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI): a case control study.
17317481|a|Data support the evidence that neuropsychological rehabilitation is effective in Alzheimer disease (AD), to strengthen the pharmacological treatment to delay the progression of dementia. At moment, a few studies have examined the efficacy of non-pharmacological treatment in MCI. This is a controlled study that assesses the effectiveness of neuropsychological rehabilitation on cognitive and behavioral symptoms and functional status in a group of community-dwelling subjects with MCI and MD. Our results demonstrate that a systematic rehabilitation, that provides a computerized cognitive program training, produces an improvement in cognitive and affective status of patients with MCI and MD, while a rehabilitation program not providing a punctual stimulation of cognitive functions, does not have significant effects.
