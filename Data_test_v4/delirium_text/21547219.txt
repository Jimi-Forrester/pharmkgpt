21547219|t|The Role of GSK3 in Presynaptic Function.
21547219|a|The past ten years of research have identified a number of key roles for glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) at the synapse. In terms of presynaptic physiology, critical roles for GSK3 have been revealed in the growth and maturation of the nerve terminal and more recently a key role in the control of activity-dependent bulk endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. This paper will summarise the major roles assigned to GSK3 in both immature and mature nerve terminals, the substrates GSK3 phosphorylates to exert its action, and how GSK3 activity is regulated by different presynaptic signalling cascades. The number of essential roles for GSK3, coupled with the numerous signalling cascades all converging to regulate its activity, suggests that GSK3 is a key integrator of multiple inputs to modulate the strength of neurotransmission. Modulation of these pathways may point to potential mechanisms to overcome synaptic failure in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.
