29201759|a|The Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is a rare disorder due to chronic liver disease (CLD), which is caused by the obstruction of hepatic venous outflow that can be located at any place from the small hepatic venules up to the entrance of the inferior vena cava (IVC) into the right atrium. Among the causes of BCS, the rarer one is coagulation factor deficiencies. Here, we report a case of BCS associated with deficiency of protein C resulting in thrombus in IVC. The patient was a 50-year-old male, who had been suffering from recurrent abdominal and leg swelling for a long period of 7 years. He was evaluated thoroughly, and other causes of liver cirrhosis were excluded.
