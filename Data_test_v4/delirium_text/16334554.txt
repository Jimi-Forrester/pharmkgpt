METHODS: AD model was established by injecting beta amyloid protein into the hippocampus of rat. The rats were killed ten days after injection. The hippocampus sections were made coronally on a freezing microtome. Brain sections were processed by immunohistochemical procedure with molocloned antibodies against NGF, BDNF and NT3. The number of positive neurons of NGF, BDNF and NT3 was counted and analyzed statistically. RESULTS: It was found that the number of NGF positive neurons increased and the immunostaining intensity became stronger as compared with the control (P<0.01). The number of BDNF positive neurons decreased and the immunostaining intensity weakened (P<0.01). There Our was no change in the number and immunostaining intensity of NT3 positive neurons (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: results show that NGF, BDNF, NT3 have experienced different changes in hippocampus of rat with AD, suggesting that they play different roles in the course of AD and bear relation to the physiological function of cholinergic neurons in hippocampus of rat with AD. In particular, BDNF exerts crucial effect on the degeneration of neuronal function in the hippocampus of rat with AD.
