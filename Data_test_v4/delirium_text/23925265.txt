23925265|t|Mitochondrial filamentation: a therapeutic target for neurodegeneration and aging.
23925265|a|It is reflected on the recently open possibility of new studies on Alzheimer's disease, Late Stage Dementia, Cytoskeleton Live Dynamics and Mitochondria, afforded by the new emerging field of mitochondrial physiology bioenergetics, Mitochondrial Filamentation. To this area the author groups provided some initial efforts. The considerations emphasize the many important relationships ahead for possible future studies with many other fields. Especially with Genome Alterations and Proteonomics.
