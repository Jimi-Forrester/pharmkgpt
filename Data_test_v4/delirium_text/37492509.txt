37492509|a|Curcumin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have shown promise as drug delivery systems to address the limited pharmacokinetic characteristics of curcumin. Functionalization with folic acid and PEGylation enhance anticancer activity, biocompatibility, stability, and permeability. Co-delivery with other drugs results in synergistically enhanced cytotoxic activity. Environment-responsive MSNs prevent undesirable drug leakage and increase selectivity towards target tissues. This review summarizes the methods of Cur-loaded MSN synthesis and functionalization and their application in various diseases, and also highlights the potential of Cur-loaded MSNs as a promising drug delivery system.
