22034451|t|Texture analysis of the brain: from animal models to human applications.
22034451|a|Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used to image brain in vivo both in studies in animal models and for human diagnosis. A large part of the value of MRI is due to the fact that soft tissue contrast is enhanced by the substantial variation in the T(1) and T(2) relaxation times between tissues. It may be possible to use an alternative approach, which does not rely on the absolute measurement of relaxation times. Generally speaking, textures are complex visual patterns composed of entities, or subpatterns, that have characteristic brightness, color, slope, size, etc. Thus, texture can be regarded as a similarity grouping in an image. The properties of the local subpattern give rise to the perceived lightness, uniformity, density, roughness, regularity, linearity, frequency, phase, directionality, coarseness, randomness, fineness, smoothness, and granulation. The purpose here is to illustrate how texture analysis can be used in animal models and in human clinical applications, as well as in the search for further pharmacological applications in humans. Thus, this article summarzes three different MRI studies in (i) rats, using the lipocarpine epileptic rat model as an animal model; (ii) patients with Alzheimer's disease; and (iii) patients with schizophrenia.
