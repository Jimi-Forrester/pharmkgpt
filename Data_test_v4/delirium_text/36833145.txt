36833145|a|BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 epidemic has afflicted patients with severe chronic illnesses who need continuous care between home and hospitals. This qualitative study examines the experiences and challenges of healthcare providers around acute care hospitals who have cared for patients with severe chronic illness in non-COVID-19 situations during the pandemic. METHODS: Eight healthcare providers, who work in various healthcare settings around acute care hospitals and frequently care for non-COVID-19 patients with severe chronic illnesses, were recruited using purposive sampling from September to October 2021 in South Korea. The interviews were subjected to thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four overarching themes were identified: (1) deterioration in the quality of care at various settings; (2) new emerging systemic problems; (3) healthcare providers holding on but reaching their limit; and (4) a decline in the quality of life of patients at the end of their lives, and their caregivers. CONCLUSION: Healthcare providers of non-COVID-19 patients with severe chronic illnesses reported that the quality of care was declining due to the structural problems of the healthcare system and policies centered solely on the prevention and control of COVID-19. Systematic solutions are needed for appropriate and seamless care for non-infected patients with severe chronic illness in the pandemic.
