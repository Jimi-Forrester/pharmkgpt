37554468|t|Nanotechnology prospects in brain therapeutics concerning gene-targeting and nose-to-brain administration.
37554468|a|Neurological diseases are one of the most pressing issues in modern times worldwide. It thus possesses explicit attention from researchers and medical health providers to guard public health against such an expanding threat. Various treatment modalities have been developed in a remarkably short time but, unfortunately, have yet to lead to the wished-for efficacy or the sought-after clinical improvement. The main hurdle in delivering therapeutics to the brain has always been the blood-brain barrier which still represents an elusive area with lots of mysteries yet to be solved. Meanwhile, nanotechnology has emerged as an optimistic platform that is potentially holding the answer to many of our questions on how to deliver drugs and treat CNS disorders using novel technologies rather than the unsatisfying conventional old methods. Nanocarriers can be engineered in a way that is capable of delivering a certain therapeutic cargo to a specific target tissue. Adding to this mind-blowing nanotechnology, the revolutionizing gene-altering biologics can have the best of both worlds, and pave the way for the long-awaited cure to many diseases, among those diseases thus far are Alzheimer's disease (AD), brain tumors (glioma and glioblastoma), Down syndrome, stroke, and even cases with HIV. The review herein collects the studies that tested the mixture of both sciences, nanotechnology, and epigenetics, in the context of brain therapeutics using three main categories of gene-altering molecules (siRNA, miRNA, and CRISPR) with a special focus on the advancements regarding the new favorite, intranasal route of administration.
