35775008|a|Objective: To determine the association between Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) with long-term symptoms and inflammatory cytokines, exploring the changes between 4-months and 1-year after COVID-19 infection. Methods: We conducted an observational, prospective cohort study, including patients >=18 years old with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between April to July 2020. All participants underwent two clinical follow-up visits, the first at 4-months (Visit 1) and the second at 1 year, after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Visit 2). Plasma glucose, total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides. Regarding pulmonary function, spirometry and lung diffusion capacity tests were assessed. For mental and neurocognitive evaluation, a short-form (SF-12), Beck depression and Hospital-Anxiety depression questionnaires were conducted at both time-points, whereas the Montreal Cognitive assessment was conducted during the second follow-up. Regarding to sleep evaluation, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Insomnia Severity index and STOP-BANG questionnaire were conducted. Additionally, a home sleep apnea test and 7-day wrist actigraphy were performed in all participants. Inflammatory cytokines were measured using an inflammatory cytokine bead array kit. p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant and statistical analyses were performed using R software. Results: A total of 60 patients were included in the first follow-up, from which 57 completed the second follow-up. The mean age was 46.4 years-old (SD +- 13.1) and 53.3% were male. 30% of cases reported mild COVID-19 infection, 28.3% with moderate illness, and 41.6% with severe illness. Moreover, 56.6% of them were admitted to the ICU. Regarding to metabolic values, the OSA group showed higher values of insulin resistance (IR) (27%), systolic blood pressure (SBP) 135.2 (+-19.1), dyslipidemia (67.5%), total cholesterol 202.1 (+-60.5), triglycerides 176.1 (+-119.0) and HOMA-IR 9.0 (+-18.8) in comparison with the non-OSA group. 1 year after COVID-19 infection, DLCO test remains abnormal in OSA patients (25% OSA vs. 3.6% non-OSA, p = 0.02). Finally, those participants with OSA who develop ARDS reported an adjusted OR 20.4 (95%-CI, 1.04-504) risk of neurocognitive impairment. Discussion: Among patients with previous COVID-19, OSA impact the development of incident glycemic, neurocognitive impairment, and abnormal functional pulmonary changes that persist up to 1 year since acute phase.
