31024617|t|The Functions of Non-coding RNAs in rRNA Regulation.
31024617|a|Ribosomes are ribonucleoprotein machines that decode the genetic information embedded in mRNAs into polypeptides. Ribosome biogenesis is tightly coordinated and controlled from the transcription of pre-rRNAs to the assembly of ribosomes. Defects or disorders in rRNA production result in a number of human ribosomopathy diseases. During the processes of rRNA synthesis, non-coding RNAs, especially snoRNAs, play important roles in pre-rRNA transcription, processing, and maturation. Recent research has started to reveal that other long and short non-coding RNAs, including risiRNA, LoNA, and SLERT (among others), are also involved in pre-rRNA transcription and rRNA production. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the mechanisms of non-coding RNA-mediated rRNA generation and regulation and their biological roles.
