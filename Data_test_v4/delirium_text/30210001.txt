30210001|a|BACKGROUND: We describe the phenomenon of crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) in four subjects diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) according to the National Institute on Aging - Alzheimer Association (NIA-AA) criteria, in combination with 18F-FDG PET and 11C-PiB PET imaging. METHODS: 18F-FDG PET showed a pattern of cerebral metabolism with relative decrease most prominent in the frontal-parietal cortex of the left hemisphere and crossed hypometabolism of the right cerebellum. 11C-PiB PET showed symmetrical amyloid accumulation, but a lower relative tracer delivery (a surrogate of relative cerebral blood flow) in the left hemisphere. CCD is the phenomenon of unilateral cerebellar hypometabolism as a remote effect of supratentorial dysfunction of the brain in the contralateral hemisphere. The mechanism implies the involvement of the cortico-ponto-cerebellar fibers. The pathophysiology is thought to have a functional or reversible basis but can also reflect in secondary morphologic change. CCD is a well-recognized phenomenon, since the development of new imaging techniques, although scarcely described in neurodegenerative dementias. RESULTS: To our knowledge this is the first report describing CCD in AD subjects with documentation of both 18F-FDG PET and 11C-PiB PET imaging. CCD in our subjects was explained on a functional basis due to neurodegenerative pathology in the left hemisphere. There was no structural lesion and the symmetric amyloid accumulation did not correspond with the unilateral metabolic impairment. CONCLUSION: This suggests that CCD might be caused by non-amyloid neurodegeneration. The pathophysiological mechanism, clinical relevance and therapeutic implications of CCD and the role of the cerebellum in AD need further investigation.
