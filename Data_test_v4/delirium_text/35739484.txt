35739484|a|BACKGROUND: Insulin has been demonstrated to play an important role in the occurrence and development of Alzheimer's disease, especially in those with diabetes. beta cells are important insulin-producing cells in human pancreas. This study aimed to investigate the association between beta-cell dysfunction and cognitive impairment among patients over 40-year-old with abnormal glucose metabolism in Chinese rural communities. METHODS: A sample of 592 participants aged 40 years or older from the China National Stroke Prevention Project (CSPP) between 2015 and 2017 were enrolled in this study. Abnormal glucose metabolism was defined when hemoglobin Alc >= 5.7%. Cognitive function was assessed by the Beijing edition of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale. Homeostasis assessment of beta-cell function was performed and classified into 4 groups according to the quartiles. A lower value of HOMA-beta indicated a worse condition of beta-cell function. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the association between beta-cell function and cognitive impairment. RESULTS: In a total of 592 patients with abnormal glucose metabolism, the average age was 60.20 +- 7.63 years and 60.1% patients had cognitive impairment. After adjusting for all potential risk factors, we found the first quartile of beta-cell function was significantly associated with cognitive impairment (OR: 2.27, 95%CI: 1.32-3.92), especially at the domains of language (OR: 1.64, 95%CI: 1.01-2.65) and abstraction (OR: 2.29, 95%CI: 1.46-3.58). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that worse beta-cell function is associated with cognitive impairment of people over 40-year-old with abnormal glucose metabolism in Chinese rural communities, especially in the cognitive domains of abstraction and language.
