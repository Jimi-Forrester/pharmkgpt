29855532|t|Inhibitory effects of Myricetin derivatives on curli-dependent biofilm formation in Escherichia coli.
29855532|a|Biofilms are well-organised communities of microbes embedded in a self-produced extracellular matrix (e.g., curli amyloid fibers) and are associated with chronic infections. Therefore, development of anti-biofilm drugs is important to combat with these infections. Previously, we found that flavonol Myricetin inhibits curli-dependent biofilm formation by Escherichia coli (IC50 = 46.2 muM). In this study, we tested activities of seven Myricetin-derivatives to inhibit biofilm formation by E. coli K-12 in liquid culture. Among them, only Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a major catechin in green tea, inhibited biofilm formation of K-12 (IC50 = 5.9 muM) more efficiently than Myricetin. Transmission electron microscopy and immunoblotting analyses demonstrated that EGCG prevented curli production by suppressing the expression of curli-related proteins. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that the transcripts of csgA, csgB, and csgD were significantly reduced in the presence of EGCG. Interestingly, the cellular level of RpoS, a stationary-phase specific alternative sigma factor, was reduced in the presence of EGCG, whereas the rpoS transcript was not affected. Antibiotic-chase experiments and genetic analyses revealed that EGCG accelerated RpoS degradation by ATP-dependent protease ClpXP in combination with its adaptor RssB. Collectively, these results provide significant insights into the development of drugs to treat chronic biofilm-associated infections.
