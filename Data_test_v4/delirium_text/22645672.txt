22645672|a|Purpose. We investigated the clinicopathologic features of early gastric cancer (EGC) patients who have undergone additional gastrectomy after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) because of their comorbidities. Methods. Eighteen (7.1%) of 252 GC patients were gastrectomized after prior ESD. Reasons for further surgery, preoperative and postoperative problems, and the clinical outcome were determined. Results. The 18 patients had submucosal EGC and several co-morbidities. Other primary cancers were observed in 8 (44.4%). Histories of major abdominal operations were observed in 6 (33.3%). Fourteen patients (77.8%) hoped for endoscopic treatment. Due to additional gastrectomy, residual cancer was suspected in 10, and node metastasis was suspected in 11. A cancer remnant was histologically observed in one. Node metastasis was detected in 3 (16.7%). Small EGC was newly detected in 4. Consequently, additional gastrectomy was necessary for the one third. No patient showed GC recurrence. However, 9 (50%) had new diseases, and 4 (22.2%) died of other diseases. The overall survival after surgery in these patients with additional gastrectomy was poorer than those with routine gastrectomy for submucosal EGC (P = 0.0087). Conclusions. Additional gastrectomy was safely performed in EGC patients with co-morbidities. However, some issues, including presence of node metastasis and other death after surgery, remain.
