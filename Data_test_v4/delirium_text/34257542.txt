34257542|a|Background: Bcl-2 associated athanogene2 (BAG2) is reported to act as an oncogene or a tumor-suppressor in tumors in a context-dependent way; however, its function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Methods: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, apoptotic assay, cell invasion assay and a set of bioinformatics tools were integrated to analyze the role of BAG2 in hepatocellular carcinoma. Results: BAG2 was significantly up-regulated in HCC. Prognostic analysis indicated that HCC patients with high expression of BAG2 had significantly shorter overall survival, progression free survival and disease specific survival. Besides, silencing BAG2 in HCC cells impaired cell proliferation, facilitated apoptosis and repressed invasion of the cells. Bioinformatics analysis showed that BAG2 might regulate ribosome biogenesis in HCC. Conclusion: This study revealed that the up-regulated BAG2 in HCC was associated with a worse prognosis and might favor the progression of the disease.
