25830469|a|As the number of people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) increases, clinicians must learn to educate patients and their caregivers about the communication problems associated with different stages of illness. Patients with AD will experience varying degrees of language impairments, concentration problems, and difficulty expressing themselves. Caregivers can learn to avoid common communication mistakes, such as correcting, reasoning with, and arguing with the person with AD. By equipping caregivers with strategies to aid verbal and nonverbal communication, clinicians can improve the interactions between patients with AD and their caregivers and lessen frustration on both sides.
