32051239|t|Acute Sleep-Wake Cycle Shift Results in Community Alteration of Human Gut Microbiome.
32051239|a|Disturbances of sleep and the underlying circadian rhythm are related to many human diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cognitive impairments. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has also been reported to be associated with the pathologies of these diseases. Therefore, we proposed that disturbed sleep may regulate gut microbiota homeostasis. In this study, we mimicked the sleep-wake cycle shift, one typical type of circadian rhythm disturbances in young people, in recruited subjects. We used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to define microbial taxa from their fecal samples. Although the relative abundances of the microbes were not significantly altered, the functional-profile analysis of gut microbiota revealed functions enriched during the sleep-wake cycle shift. In addition, the microbial networks were quite distinct among baseline, shift, and recovery stages. These results suggest that an acute sleep-wake cycle shift may exert a limited influence on the gut microbiome, mainly including the functional profiles of the microbes and the microbial relationships within the microbial community.IMPORTANCE Circadian rhythm misalignment due to social jet lag, shift work, early morning starts, and delayed bedtimes is becoming common in our modern society. Disturbances of sleep and the underlying circadian rhythms are related to multiple human diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cognitive impairments. Given the crucial role of microbiota in the same pathologies as are caused by sleep disturbance, how the gut microbiota is affected by sleep is of increasing interest. The results of this study indicate that the acute circadian rhythm disturbance caused by sleep-wake shifts affect the human gut microbiota, especially the functional profiles of gut microbes and interactions among them. Further experiments with a longer-time-scale intervention and larger sample size are needed to assess the effects of chronic circadian rhythm disruption on the gut microbiome and to guide possible microbial therapies for clinical intervention in the related diseases.
