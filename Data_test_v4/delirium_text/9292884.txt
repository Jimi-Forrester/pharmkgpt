9292884|t|A novel missense mutation in the presenilin-1 gene in a familial Alzheimer's disease pedigree with abundant amyloid angiopathy.
9292884|a|A number of missense mutations associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease have been reported in the presenilin-1 gene. The mutations were demonstrated to cluster in specific regions of the the protein. We report here a novel missense mutation at the C-terminus of the third transmembrane domain in the presenilin-1 protein in a family of Japanese origin with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. This mutation is located at a site that is different from the sites at which mutations are known to cluster. Although the clinical phenotype is similar to those of pedigrees associated with other presenilin-1 mutations, postmortem examination of this pedigree revealed heavy amyloid deposits in the walls of small meningeal arteries as well as around small vessels within the brain parenchyma. These results indicate that a mutation at the C-terminus of the third transmembrane domain in the presenilin-1, which is a novel site for mutations, may play a key role in Alzheimer's pathogenesis.
