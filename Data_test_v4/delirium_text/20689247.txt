20689247|a|BACKGROUND: Cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme and gamma-secretase results in the generation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides that aggregate and deposit as senile plaques in brains of Alzheimer disease patients. Due to the fundamental role gamma-secretase plays in the proteolysis of a number of proteins including Notch, pharmacological inhibition of gamma-secretase has been associated with mechanism-based toxicities. Therefore, efforts have focussed on the modulation of gamma-secretase activity to selectively decrease levels of Abeta42 peptide while avoiding deleterious activity on Notch processing. OBJECTIVE: Here, we describe the in vitro and in vivo characterisation of a novel gamma-secretase modulator, GSM-10h, and investigate the potential for shorter Abeta peptides to induce neurotoxicity in rat primary cortical neurons. METHODS: The effect of GSM-10h on Abeta levels was investigated in SH-SY5Y cells expressing mutant APP and in TASTPM mice expressing APP and presenilin-1 mutant transgenes. The effect of GSM-10h on Notch processing was also determined. RESULTS: In cells, GSM-10h decreased levels of Abeta42 while concomitantly increasing levels of Abeta38 in the absence of effects on Abeta40 levels. In TASTPM mice, GSM-10h effectively lowered brain Abeta42 and increased brain Abeta38, with no effect on Notch signalling. Unlike Abeta42, which causes neuronal cell death, neither Abeta37 nor Abeta38 were neurotoxic. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm GSM-10h exhibits the profile of a gamma-secretase modulator. In addition, TASTPM mice are shown to be responsive to treatment with a gamma-secretase modulator, thereby highlighting the utility of this bitransgenic mouse model in drug discovery efforts focussed on the development of gamma-secretase modulators.
