24246683|t|NF-kappabeta signaling and chronic inflammatory diseases: exploring the potential of natural products to drive new therapeutic opportunities.
24246683|a|Chronic inflammation has a key role in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases that represent major public health and financial concerns, including heart failure (HF), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and arthritis. Nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kappabeta) is a central component of inflammation; owing to its upstream signaling position, it is considered an attractive target for new anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hydroxytyrosol is an orally bioavailable polyphenol, obtained from olives, which inhibits NF-kappabeta activity and has elicited promising efficacy signals in several inflammatory diseases. Here, we further examine the role of NF-kappabeta in inflammation, provide an introduction to natural products and their anti-inflammatory effects and explore the potential of hydroxytyrosol as a new approach to combating the burden of chronic inflammatory diseases.
