32622032|t|Homeless persons with mental illness and COVID pandemic: Collective efforts from India.
32622032|a|COVID-19 pandemic had made an unprecedented impact worldwide. India has entered into a total lockdown by invoking the special provision of Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2015. The complete lockdown policy has a direct and indirect impact on Homeless Persons with Mental Illness (HPMI) concerning shelter, basic needs and access to health care, besides the transmission of COVID infection. In this manuscript, we highlight the collective efforts undertaken by both the Government and Civil Society in providing care and protection to HPMI against COVID during the lockdown in India.
