26266376|t|Effect of Intraoperative and Postoperative Infusion of Dexmedetomidine on the Quality of Postoperative Analgesia in Highly Nicotine-Dependent Patients After Thoracic Surgery: A CONSORT-Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Trial.
26266376|a|UNLABELLED: Smoking is one of the most common addictions in the world. Nicotine inhalation could increase the risk of cardiorespiratory diseases. However, the solution that improved postoperative analgesia for highly nicotine-dependent patients undergoing thoracic surgery has not been specifically addressed.This CONSORT-prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial investigated the efficacy of combination of dexmedetomidine and sufentanil for highly nicotine (Fagerstrom test of nicotine dependence >=6)-dependent patients after thoracic surgery.One hundred seventy-four male patients who underwent thoracic surgery were screened between February 2014 and November 2014, and a total of forty-nine were excluded. One hundred thirty-two highly nicotine-dependent male patients who underwent thoracic surgery and received postoperative patient-controlled intravenous analgesia were divided into 3 groups after surgery in this double-blind, randomized study: sufentanil (0.02 mug/kg/h, Group S), sufentanil plus dexmedetomidine (0.02 mug/kg/h each, Group D1), or sufentanil (0.02 mug/kg/h) plus dexmedetomidine (0.04 mug/kg/h) (Group D2). The patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) program was programmed to deliver a bolus dose of 2 ml, with background infusion of 2 ml/h and a lockout of 5 min, 4-hour limit of 40 ml, as our retrospective study. The primary outcome measure was the cumulative amount of self-administered sufentanil; the secondary outcome measures were pain intensity (numerical rating scale, NRS), level of sedation (LOS), Bruggrmann comfort scale (BCS), functional activity score (FAS), and concerning adverse effects.The amount of self-administered sufentanil were lower in group D2 compared with S and D1 groups during the 72 hours after surgery (P < 0.05), whereas the total dosage and dosage per body weight of sufentanil were significantly lower in D1 group than that of S group only at 4, 8, and 16 hours after surgery (P < 0.05). Compared with S group, the NRS scores at rest at 1, 4, and 8 hours after surgery and with coughing at 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours after surgery were significantly lower in D2 group (P < 0.05). However, compared with D1 group, the NRS scores both at rest and with coughing at 4 and 8 hours after surgery were significantly lower in D2 group (P < 0.05). The NRS scores both at rest and with coughing show that there were no significant differences between D1 group and S group at each time point after surgery (P > 0.05). LOS of group D2 was higher than S and D1 groups at 1 hour after surgery (P < 0.05), BCS of group D2 was higher than S and D1 groups at 4, 8, and 16 hours after surgery (P < 0.05), and FAS of group D2 was higher than S and D1 groups at 48 and 72 hours after surgery (P < 0.05). The number of rescue analgesia during 72 hours after surgery in D2 group was lower than S and D1 groups (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences among the 3 groups in terms of baseline clinical characteristics and postoperative adverse effects except for itching (P > 0.05).Among the tested patient-controlled analgesia options, the addition of dexmedetomidine (0.04 mug/kg/h) and sufentanil (0.02 mug/kg/h) showed better analgesic effect and greater patient satisfaction without other clinically relevant side effects for highly nicotine-dependent patients during the initial 72 hours after thoracic surgery.
