34576251|t|Enjoy Carefully: The Multifaceted Role of Vitamin E in Neuro-Nutrition.
34576251|a|Vitamin E is often associated with health benefits, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cholesterol-lowering effects. These properties make its supplementation a suitable therapeutic approach in neurodegenerative disorders, for example, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. However, trials evaluating the effects of vitamin E supplementation are inconsistent. In randomized controlled trials, the observed associations often cannot be substantiated. This could be due to the wide variety of study designs regarding the dosage and duration of vitamin E supplementation. Furthermore, genetic variants can influence vitamin E uptake and/or metabolism, thereby distorting its overall effect. Recent studies also show adverse effects of vitamin E supplementation regarding Alzheimer's disease due to the increased synthesis of amyloid beta. These diverse effects may underline the inhomogeneous outcomes associated with its supplementation and argue for a more thoughtful usage of vitamin E. Specifically, the genetic and nutritional profile should be taken into consideration to identify suitable candidates who will benefit from supplementation. In this review, we will provide an overview of the current knowledge of vitamin E supplementation in neurodegenerative disease and give an outlook on individualized, sustainable neuro-nutrition, with a focus on vitamin E supplementation.
