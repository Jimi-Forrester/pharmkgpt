38353229|t|Role of Cognitive Frailty in Older Adults With Cardiovascular Disease.
38353229|a|As the older adult population expands, an increasing number of patients affected by geriatric syndromes are seen by cardiovascular clinicians. One such syndrome that has been associated with poor outcomes is cognitive frailty: the simultaneous presence of cognitive impairment, without evidence of dementia, and physical frailty, which results in decreased cognitive reserve. Driven by common pathophysiologic underpinnings (eg, inflammation and neurohormonal dysregulation), cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, and frailty also share the following risk factors: hypertension, diabetes, obesity, sedentary behavior, and tobacco use. Cardiovascular disease has been associated with the onset and progression of cognitive frailty, which may be reversible in early stages, making it essential for clinicians to diagnose the condition in a timely manner and prescribe appropriate interventions. Additional research is required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the development of cognitive frailty, establish preventive and therapeutic strategies to address the needs of older patients with cardiovascular disease at risk for cognitive frailty, and ultimately facilitate targeted intervention studies.
