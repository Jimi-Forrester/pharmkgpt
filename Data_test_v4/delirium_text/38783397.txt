38783397|a|OBJECTIVE: Children with prolonged hospital admissions for CHD often develop delirium. Antipsychotic medications (APMs) have been used to treat delirium but are known to prolong the QTc duration. There is concern for prolongation of the QTc interval in cardiac patients who may be more vulnerable to electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and may have postoperative QTc prolongation already. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of APM on QTc duration in postoperative paediatric cardiac patients and determine the effect of quetiapine and risperidone in treating delirium and QTc prolongation. DESIGN: Retrospective study, July 1, 2017-May 31, 2022. SETTING: Tertiary children's hospital. PATIENTS: Included were patients admitted to the paediatric cardiac ICU at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: ECGs, delirium scores, and drug information were collected. Delirium was defined as Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD) score >9. Mixed effect models were performed to evaluate the effect of surgery on QTc change and the effect of antipsychotics on QTc and CAPD changes. There were 139 children, 55% male and 67% surgical admissions. Median age was 5.9 months. Mean QTc increased after cardiac surgery by 18 ms (p = 0.014, 95% CI 3.65-32.4). There was no significant change in QTc after antipsychotic administration (p = 0.064). The mean CAPD score decreased (12.5-7.2; p < 0.001). Quetiapine had the most improvement in delirium, and risperidone had the least improvement (77.8%, n = 14; 37.8%, n = 34, respectively; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The QTc interval did not have a statistically significant change after the administration of antipsychotics, while there was improvement in the CAPD score. APMs may be administered safely without significant prolongation of the QTc and are an effective treatment for delirium.
