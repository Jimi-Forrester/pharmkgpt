38334681|t|Brain-Type Glycogen Phosphorylase (PYGB) in the Pathologies of Diseases: A Systematic Review.
38334681|a|Glycogen metabolism is a form of crucial metabolic reprogramming in cells. PYGB, the brain-type glycogen phosphorylase (GP), serves as the rate-limiting enzyme of glycogen catabolism. Evidence is mounting for the association of PYGB with diverse human diseases. This review covers the advancements in PYGB research across a range of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, nervous system diseases, and other diseases, providing a succinct overview of how PYGB functions as a critical factor in both physiological and pathological processes. We present the latest progress in PYGB in the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases and discuss the current limitations and future prospects of this novel and promising target.
