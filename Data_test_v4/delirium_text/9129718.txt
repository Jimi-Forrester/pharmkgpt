9129718|t|ApoE genotype does not affect plasma tPA and PAI-1 antigen levels.
9129718|a|The presence of one or two apoliprotein E4 (apoE4) alleles constitutes a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and coronary heart disease (CHD). Numerous observations have suggested that misregulation of proteases may be instrumental in both diseases. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) has been recently demonstrated to play a key role in neuronal plasticity and in experimental neurodegeneration. One receptor for the ApoE protein is the LRP/alpha 2 macroglobulin receptor, which also binds to and endocytoses tPA and plasminogen activator inhibitor I (PAI-1). Here we tested whether the apoE genotype has an influence on the plasma levels of these proteins. We demonstrate that there is no difference in plasma levels of tPA- and PAI-1-antigens between middled-aged individuals with one apoE4 allele and those having none. This suggests that the impact of apoE4 on Alzheimer's disease is not the result of altered clearance of tPA or PAI-1 by the LRP receptor.
