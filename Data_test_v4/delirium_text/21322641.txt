21322641|a|Polymerization of monomeric amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) into soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils is one of the major pathways triggering the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using small molecules to prevent the polymerization of Abeta peptides can, therefore, be an effective therapeutic strategy for AD. In this study, we investigate the effects of mono- and biflavonoids in Abeta42-induced toxicity and fibrillogenesis and find that the biflavonoid taiwaniaflavone (TF) effectively and specifically inhibits Abeta toxicity and fibrillogenesis. Compared to TF, the monoflavonoid apigenin (AP) is less effective and less specific. Our data show that differential effects of the mono- and biflavonoids in Abeta fibrillogenesis correlate with their varying cytoprotective efficacies. We also find that other biflavonoids, namely, 2',8''-biapigenin, amentoflavone, and sumaflavone, can also effectively inhibit Abeta toxicity and fibrillogenesis, implying that the participation of two monoflavonoids in a single biflavonoid molecule enhances their activity. Biflavonoids, while strongly inhibiting Abeta fibrillogenesis, accumulate nontoxic Abeta oligomeric structures, suggesting that these are off-pathway oligomers. Moreover, TF abrogates the toxicity of preformed Abeta oligomers and fibrils, indicating that TF and other biflavonoids may also reduce the toxicity of toxic Abeta species. Altogether, our data clearly show that biflavonoids, possibly because of the possession of two Abeta binders separated by an appropriate size linker, are likely to be promising therapeutics for suppressing Abeta toxicity.
