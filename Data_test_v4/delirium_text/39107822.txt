39107822|a|BACKGROUND: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can be reactivated and proliferated with fatal outcome in immuno-compromised people, but the clinical consequences of EBV infection in patients with severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) remain uncertain. In this study, we investigated the infection rate, the influence and the early predictors of EBV infection in SFTS patients. METHODS: In this retrospective study, SFTS patients who were treated in the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from May 2011 to August 2021 were enrolled and divided into infected and non-infected groups. We compared the demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations and signs, laboratory tests and prognosis, and explored the risk factors of EBV infection by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 120 hospitalized SFTS patients with EBV-DNA testing were enrolled in this study. Patients with EBV infection had statistically significant higher mortality rate (32.0% vs. 11.43%, P = 0.005). Compared with the non-infected group, the EBV-infected group had higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), creatine-kinase (CK), fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), D-dimer, and CD56+ cell counts, lower levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, complement 3 (C3), and C4. The proportion of patients with age >= 60 years and ferritin > 1500.0 ng/ml in the EBV-infected group was significantly higher than that in the non-infected group. The results of ROC analysis showed that the cut-off values of CRP, IgG, C3, C4, and CD56+ cell counts to predict EBV infection were 13.2 mg/l, 12.5 g/l, 1.1 g/l, 0.6 g/l, 0.3 g/l, and 94.0 cells/microl. Multivariable logistic analysis showed that age >= 60 years old, CRP > 13.2 mg/l, BUN > 5.4 mmol/l, ferritin > 1500.0 ng/ml, IgG < 12.5 g/l, IgM < 1.1 g/l, C4 < 0.3 g/l, and CD56+ cell counts > 94.0 cells/microl were the independent risk factors of EBV infection in SFTS patients. CONCLUSIONS: SFTS combined with EBV infection is associated with high morbidity and mortality. It is necessary to strengthen screening for EBV infection and its early predictive markers after admission in SFTS patients.
