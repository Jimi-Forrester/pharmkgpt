31093445|a|According to the "amyloid cascade hypothesis", amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein occupied one of the risk factors of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cordyceps militaris (CM) has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and neuroprotective activities; however, its activity against cognitive dysfunction has not been studied yet. In this study, the CM ethanol extract was administered with a dose of 100 or 200 mg/kg for 2 weeks, and behavioral assessments were performed for learning and memory function in Abeta1-42-induced AD mice models. Supplementation with CM extract enhanced new route consciousness and novel object recognition, and in the Morris water maze test, CM-administered groups showed less time to reach to the hidden platform compared with the control group. Moreover, the CM extract inhibited nitric oxide production and lipid peroxidation in the brain, liver, and kidney. The present study indicated that CM could have the protective role from cognitive impairment and progression of AD.
