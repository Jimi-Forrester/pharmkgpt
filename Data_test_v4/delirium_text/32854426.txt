32854426|t|Parkinson's Disease-Cognitive Rating Scale for Evaluating Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review.
32854426|a|The aim of the present systematic review was to examine the evidence on the accuracy and psychometric properties of the Parkinson's Disease-Cognitive Rating Scale (PD-CRS) for evaluating the presence of cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as to highlight the quality and quantity of research available on the use of the PD-CRS in this population. We searched four databases from inception until July 2020. Eight studies, published between 2008 and 2020, met the inclusion criteria: One cross-sectional study in which participants were assessed with the index test (PD-CRS) and a reference standard diagnostic assessment, in accordance with the Level II criteria of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS); one case-control study comparing the PD-CRS to an extensive battery of tests (i.e., MDS Level II diagnosis); and six studies comparing the PD-CRS to other short cognitive batteries. In patients with Parkinson's disease, the PD-CRS test provides information about cortical and sub-cortical cognitive functions. Even if it demonstrated good psychometric properties, the results regarding the optimal threshold for detecting mild cognitive impairment and dementia in PD are somewhat inconsistent. Further cross-sectional studies are necessary to examine the optimum cut-off score for detecting cognitive dysfunction in PD patients.
