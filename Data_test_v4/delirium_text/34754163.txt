34754163|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia is a chronic progressive neurological disease affecting millions of people worldwide, and represents a relevant economic burden for healthcare systems. Although its pathogenesis is still unknown, recent findings have reported that a dysregulated gut-brain axis communication, a fundamental relationship mediated by several host and microbial molecules, is associated with cognitive disorders. In addition, gut microbiota manipulation reduces neuroinflammation, improving cognitive function by restoring the functional gut-brain axis. AIM: To better define the effects of probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) on cognitive function. METHODS: We performed a literature search of human randomized clinical trials to examine the effects of the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, or FMT on cognition outcomes in healthy or sick people of every age, sex, and nationality. We systematically searched Embase, Medline/PubMed, Cochrane Library, central and clinicaltrials.gov databases with a combination of comprehensive terms related to cognition and gut microbiota manipulation. Then we carefully reviewed and synthesized the data by type of study design and setting, characteristics of the studied population, kind of intervention (strain type or mixture type, dosage, and frequency of administration), control treatment, inclusion and exclusion criteria, follow-up duration, and cognitive or memory outcomes. RESULTS: After examining the titles and abstracts, the initial literature screening identified 995 articles, but we added 23 papers in our systematic review. The analyses of these selected studies highlighted that both probiotic supplementation and FMT improved cognitive function regardless of the type and posology of administration and the adopted cognitive tests and questionnaires. We found that most of the studies conducted in healthy people showed a significant positive effect of the intervention on at least one of the performed cognitive tests. Regarding unhealthy subjects, while FMT and especially probiotic administration had multiple beneficial effects on different cognitive functions, supplementation with prebiotics did not provide any cognitive improvement. CONCLUSION: Probiotic supplementation and FMT may represent a promising strategy to restore gut eubiosis and enhance the cognitive functions of healthy people and patients with neurological disorders.
