38439546|a|Two-thirds of small-bowel transplantation (SBT) recipients develop bacteremia, with the majority of infections occurring within 3 months post-transplant. Sepsis-related mortality occurs in 31% of patients and is commonly caused by bacteria of gut origin, which are thought to translocate across the implanted organ. Serial post-transplant surveillance endoscopies provide an opportunity to study whether the composition of the ileal and colonic microbiota can predict the emergence as well as the pathogen of subsequent clinical infections in the SBT patient population. Five participants serially underwent aspiration of ileal and colonic bowel effluents at transplantation and during follow-up endoscopy either until death or for up to 3 months post-SBT. We performed whole-metagenome sequencing (WMS) of 40 bowel effluent samples and compared the results with clinical infection episodes. Microbiome composition was concordant between participants and timepoint-matched ileal and colonic samples. Four out of five (4/5) participants had clinically significant infections thought to be of gut origin. Bacterial translocation from the gut was observed in 3/5 patients with bacterial infectious etiologies. In all three cases, the pathogens had demonstrably colonized the gut between 1-10 days prior to invasive clinical infection. Recipients with better outcomes received donor grafts with higher alpha diversity. There was an increase in the number of antimicrobial resistance genes associated with longer hospital stay for all participants. This metagenomic study provides preliminary evidence to support the pathogen translocation hypothesis of gut-origin sepsis in the SBT cohort. Ileal and colonic microbiome compositions were concordant; therefore, fecal metagenomic analysis could be a useful surveillance tool for impeding infection with specific gut-residing pathogens.
