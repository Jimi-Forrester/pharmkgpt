38960099|a|This comprehensive review elucidates the critical role of antioxidants to mitigate oxidative stress, a common denominator in an array of neurodegenerative disorders. Oxidative stress-induced damage has been linked to the development of diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This article examines a wide range of scientific literature and methodically delineates the several methods by which antioxidants exercise their neuroprotective benefits. It also explores into the complex relationship between oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, focusing on how antioxidants can alter signaling pathways and transcription factors to slow neurodegenerative processes. Key antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, glutathione, and polyphenolic compounds, are tested for their ability to combat reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. The dual character of antioxidants, which operate as both direct free radical scavengers and regulators of cellular redox homeostasis, is investigated in terms of therapeutic potential. Furthermore, the study focuses on new antioxidant-based therapy techniques and their mechanisms including Nrf-2, PCG1alpha, Thioredoxin etc., which range from dietary interventions to targeted antioxidant molecules. Insights into ongoing clinical studies evaluating antioxidant therapies in neurodegenerative illnesses offer an insight into the translational potential of antioxidant research. Finally, this review summarizes our present understanding of antioxidant processes in neurodegenerative illnesses, providing important possibilities for future study and treatment development.
