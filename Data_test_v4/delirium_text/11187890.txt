11187890|t|Dissecting the pathways to death.
11187890|a|This report summarizes recent findings in the field of basic and translational apoptosis research which were presented at the 1st Conference on 'Mechanisms of Cell Death and Disease: Advances in Therapeutic Intervention' organized by the European School of Hematology and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 13-17 May, in Dublin, Ireland, and puts them in the context of the literature. Recent discoveries have significantly advanced the understanding of biochemical and genetic requirements of distinct apoptosis pathways (ie mitochondrial, death-receptor and endoplasmic reticulum-mediated apoptosis) and their dysregulation in disease. Progress has been made especially in the elucidation of the mechanisms of action of the Bcl-2 family members, in detail the formation of channels and their regulation in the mitochondrial membranes, conformational changes in Bax and Bak, and crosstalk of death receptor-triggered apoptosis to the mitochondria by activation of Bax via Bid. In addition, novel insights have been gained about the regulation of caspases and novel caspase signaling pathways, such as activation of caspase-12 by the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Therapeutic applications of apoptosis manipulation include (1) the inhibition of caspases in acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, ie stroke, Alzheimer's or Huntington's disease by drugs and (2) sensitization of cancer cells for drug/radiation-induced apoptosis by modulation of survival signals and viral transfer of apoptosis promoting genes.
