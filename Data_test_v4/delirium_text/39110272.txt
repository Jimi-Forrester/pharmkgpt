39110272|a|BACKGROUND: While studies comparing the effectiveness of remifentanil and dexmedetomidine are prevalent in other nations, using remifentanil alone is uncommon in Malaysia. This research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of sedation with remifentanil or dexmedetomidine infusion in monitored anesthesia care for electrophysiology procedures. METHODS: This study is a single-center, single-blinded, prospective randomized clinical study. One hundred twenty patients were randomized into two groups (remifentanil vs dexmedetomidine). Demographic characteristics and clinical outcomes, including level of sedation, vital signs, and patient satisfaction were monitored and recorded. RESULTS: Group R showed a higher mean observer's assessment of alertness/sedation score (3.9 +- 0.7 vs 3.6 +- 0.8; p = 0.008), mean arterial pressure (92.0 +- 12.0 vs 83.0 +- 13.0 mmHg; p < 0.001), heart rate (82.0 +- 20.0 vs 73.0 +- 18.0 beats/min; p = 0.006), systolic blood pressure (139.0 +- 16.0 vs 123.0 +- 17.0 mmHg; p < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (75.0 +- 13.0 vs 69.0 +- 14.0 mmHg; p = 0.009) than Group D. Oxygen saturation (99.0 +- 1.0%; p = 0.220) and respiration rate (16.0 +- 3.0 breaths/min; p = 0.361) for both groups were the same. Adverse events, including hypotension, bradycardia, and respiratory depression were observed in both groups. Both groups gave positive responses ranging from fair to good for patient satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine is a better choice of anesthesia as it was associated with a higher level of sedation, more stable hemodynamics, lower incidence of adverse events, and better patient satisfaction.
