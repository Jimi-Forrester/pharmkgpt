38785724|t|Blood Coagulation-Inspired Fibrin Hydrogel for Portable Detection of Thrombin Based on Personal Glucometer.
38785724|a|As one of the biomarkers of coagulation system-related diseases, the detection of thrombin is of practical importance. Thus, this study developed a portable biosensor based on a personal glucometer for rapid detection of thrombin activity. Fibrinogen was used for the detection of thrombin, and the assay principle was inspired by the blood coagulation process, where thrombin hydrolyzes fibrinogen to produce a fibrin hydrogel, and the amount of invertase encapsulated in the fibrin hydrogel fluctuates in accordance with the activity of thrombin in the sample solution. The quantitative assay is conducted by measuring the amount of unencapsulated invertase available to hydrolyze the substrate sucrose, and the signal readout is recorded using a personal glucometer. A linear detection range of 0-0.8 U/mL of thrombin with a limit of detection of 0.04 U/mL was obtained based on the personal glucometer sensing platform. The results of the selectivity and interference experiments showed that the developed personal glucometer sensing platform is highly selective and accurate for thrombin activity. Finally, the reliability of the portable glucometer method for rapid thrombin detection in serum samples was investigated by measuring the recovery rate, which ranged from 92.8% to 107.7%. In summary, the fibrin hydrogel sensing platform proposed in this study offers a portable and versatile means for detecting thrombin using a personal glucometer. This approach not only simplifies the detection process, but also eliminates the need for large instruments and skilled operators, and substantially reduces detection costs.
