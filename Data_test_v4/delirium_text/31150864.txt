31150864|a|OBJECTIVE: To present a preliminary experience of perioperative management for patients with spinal tuberculosis (STB) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and discuss strategic factors that should be considered. METHODS: A retrospective study of 6 patients with STB and ESRD who underwent spine surgeries in our hospital from January 2010 to May 2017 was carried out. Medical records were reviewed for clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, radiologic findings, perioperative management, clinical outcomes, and complications. RESULTS: Except for 1 patient who died of cardiac arrest 5 days after surgery, this case series was followed with a mean follow-up period of 17.0 months (range, 9-23). There were no patients reporting major side effects related to an adjusted antituberculosis chemotherapy regimen. Postoperatively, surgical incision healed primarily, whereas delirium and pneumonia were noted in 2 patients. At final follow-ups, solid bony fusion was achieved in 4 patients, whereas fusion was indefinite in the patient who underwent surgery at L3/4 level. Visual analogue scale score improved from preoperative 5.2 +- 0.37 to 2.6 +- 0.55 at the final follow-ups. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative management of patients with STB and ESRD is a complicated issue, with multiple factors to be considered. Spinal surgery can achieve acceptable outcomes in these patients if meticulous management is performed.
