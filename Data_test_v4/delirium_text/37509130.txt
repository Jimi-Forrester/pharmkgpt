37509130|t|Exploratory Assessment of Proteomic Network Changes in Cerebrospinal Fluid of Mild Cognitive Impairment Patients: A Pilot Study.
37509130|a|(1) Background: Despite the existence of well-established, CSF-based biomarkers such as amyloid-beta and phosphorylated-tau, the pathways involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain an active area of research. (2) Methods: We measured 3072 proteins in CSF samples of AD-biomarker positive mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants (n = 38) and controls (n = 48), using the Explore panel of the Olink proximity extension assay (PEA). We performed group comparisons, association studies with diagnosis, age, and APOE epsilon4 status, overrepresentation analysis (ORA), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to determine differentially expressed proteins and dysregulated pathways. (3) Results: GSEA results demonstrated an enrichment of granulocyte-related and chemotactic pathways (core enrichment proteins: ITGB2, ITGAM, ICAM1, SELL, SELP, C5, IL1A). Moreover, some of the well-replicated, differentially expressed proteins in CSF included: ITGAM, ITGB2, C1QA, TREM2, GFAP, NEFL, MMP-10, and a novel tau-related marker, SCRN1. (4) Conclusion: Our results highlight the upregulation of neuroinflammatory pathways, especially chemotactic and granulocyte recruitment in CSF of early AD patients.
