34298610|t|DNA Based and Stimuli-Responsive Smart Nanocarrier for Diagnosis and Treatment of Cancer: Applications and Challenges.
34298610|a|The rapid development of multidrug co-delivery and nano-medicines has made spontaneous progress in tumor treatment and diagnosis. DNA is a unique biological molecule that can be tailored and molded into various nanostructures. The addition of ligands or stimuli-responsive elements enables DNA nanostructures to mediate highly targeted drug delivery to the cancer cells. Smart DNA nanostructures, owing to their various shapes, sizes, geometry, sequences, and characteristics, have various modes of cellular internalization and final disposition. On the other hand, functionalized DNA nanocarriers have specific receptor-mediated uptake, and most of these ligand anchored nanostructures able to escape lysosomal degradation. DNA-based and stimuli responsive nano-carrier systems are the latest advancement in cancer targeting. The data exploration from various studies demonstrated that the DNA nanostructure and stimuli responsive drug delivery systems are perfect tools to overcome the problems existing in the cancer treatment including toxicity and compromised drug efficacy. In this light, the review summarized the insights about various types of DNA nanostructures and stimuli responsive nanocarrier systems applications for diagnosis and treatment of cancer.
