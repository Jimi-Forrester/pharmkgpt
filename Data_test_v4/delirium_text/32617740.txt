32617740|a|BACKGOUND: Central obesity in midlife is a risk factor of cognitive decline and dementia, and also one of the factors that make cognitive functions deteriorate rapidly. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between truncal body composition (fat and muscle) and cognitive impairment in patients with dementia. METHODS: A total of 81 female over 60 years of age with probable Alzheimer's disease were recruited between November 2014 and September 2015. The Mini-Mental State Examination, Global Deterioration Scale, and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale were used to assess the cognitive functions. Both truncal fat and muscle mass were measured using body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and used as a percentage of body weight (TMM% and TFM%). Correlations between truncal composition and cognitive status were assessed by simple correlation analysis, which was followed by partial correlation analysis with age and educational years. RESULTS: TFM% was not related to cognitive impairment. In contrast, TMM% had a significantly negative correlation with all three cognitive assessment scores. After further adjusting for age, educational years, and vascular factors, there was still a relationship between TMM% and cognitive functions. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike truncal fat mass that showed no relevance with cognitive functions, the truncal muscle mass was negatively correlated with cognitive status. The truncal muscle mass is thought to affect cognitive status in dementia patients somehow.
