35860808|t|The roles and diagnostic value of miRNA-1246 in the serum of patients with intracranial aneurysms.
35860808|a|Background: Inflammatory response is one of the important factors affecting the formation of intracranial aneurysm. miR-1246 is involved in the regulation of several inflammatory diseases; however, its expression levels and the mechanism of action in intracranial aneurysms remain further investigated. Methods: Bioinformatics was used to analyze the levels of micro-RNAs (miRNAs) in the serum of intracranial aneurysm patients as well as in the intracranial aneurysm tissues downloaded from the GEO RNA-seq database. Blood samples were collected pre-operatively from patients with intracranial aneurysms as well as from healthy volunteers, and miRNA-1246 expression levels were detected using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Meanwhile, the diagnostic value of miR-1246 for intracranial aneurysm was explored using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Principle findings and results: Serum levels of miR-1246 were elevated in intracranial aneurysm patients. Bioinformatics studies revealed that the target genes of miR-1246, TP53, glycogen synthetase kinase (GSK), and transcription factor YY1 may play important roles in the development of intracranial aneurysms. miR-1246 is involved in inflammatory response, lipid, and atherosclerotic signaling pathways. Conclusions and significance: High level of miR-1246 is found in the serum of patients with intracranial aneurysms and may serve as a diagnostic or/and treatment marker for intracranial aneurysms.
