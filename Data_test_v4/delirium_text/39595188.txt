39595188|t|p75NTR Modulation Reduces Oxidative Stress and the Expression of Pro-Inflammatory Mediators in a Cell Model of Rett Syndrome.
39595188|a|Background: Rett syndrome (RTT) is an early-onset neurological disorder primarily affecting females, leading to severe cognitive and physical disabilities. Recent studies indicate that an imbalance of redox homeostasis and exacerbated inflammatory responses are key players in the clinical manifestations of the disease. Emerging evidence highlights that the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) is implicated in the regulation of oxidative stress (OS) and inflammation. Thus, this study is aimed at investigating the effects of p75NTR modulation by LM11A-31 on fibroblasts derived from RTT donors. Methods: RTT cells were treated with 0.1 microM of LM11A-31 for 24 h, and results were obtained using qPCR, immunofluorescence, ELISA, and Western blot techniques. Results: Our findings demonstrate that LM11A-31 reduces OS markers in RTT fibroblasts. Specifically, p75NTR modulation by LM11A-31 restores protein glutathionylation and reduces the expression of the pro-oxidant enzyme NOX4. Additionally, LM11A-31 significantly decreases the expression of the pro-inflammatory mediators interleukin-6 and interleukin-8. Additionally, LM11A-31 normalizes the expression levels of transcription factors involved in the regulation of the antioxidant response and inflammation. Conclusions: Collectively, these data suggest that p75NTR modulation may represent an effective therapeutic target to improve redox balance and reduce inflammation in RTT.
