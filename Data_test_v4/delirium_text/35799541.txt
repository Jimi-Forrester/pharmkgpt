35799541|t|Lamotrigine protects against cognitive deficits, synapse and nerve cell damage, and hallmark neuropathologies in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
35799541|a|Lamotrigine (LTG) is a widely used drug for the treatment of epilepsy. Emerging clinical evidence suggests that LTG may improve cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) double transgenic mice were used as a model of Alzheimer's disease. Five-month-old APP/PS1 mice were intragastrically administered 30 mg/kg LTG or vehicle once per day for 3 successive months. The cognitive functions of animals were assessed using Morris water maze. Hyperphosphorylated tau and markers of synapse and glial cells were detected by western blot assay. The cell damage in the brain was investigated using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The levels of amyloid-beta and the concentrations of interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the brain were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Differentially expressed genes in the brain after LTG treatment were analyzed by high-throughput RNA sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction. We found that LTG substantially improved spatial cognitive deficits of APP/PS1 mice; alleviated damage to synapses and nerve cells in the brain; and reduced amyloid-beta levels, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, and inflammatory responses. High-throughput RNA sequencing revealed that the beneficial effects of LTG on Alzheimer's disease-related neuropathologies may have been mediated by the regulation of Ptgds, Cd74, Map3k1, Fosb, and Spp1 expression in the brain. These findings revealed potential molecular mechanisms by which LTG treatment improved Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, these data indicate that LTG may be a promising therapeutic drug for Alzheimer's disease.
