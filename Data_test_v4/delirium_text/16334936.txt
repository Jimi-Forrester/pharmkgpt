16334936|a|Among the steadily increasing population of surgical older patients than 65 yr are the fast growing group about 85 yr and older. Postoperative averse effects on the cardiac, pulmonary, cerebral and urinary systems are the main concerns for elderly surgical patients who are at high risk. The function capacity of organs reduces with age, resulting in decreased reserve and ability to endure stress. The effect of anesthetics on postoperative delirium has been studied and a leasing hyposthesis has been that offending druha aggravate an age-associated central cholinergic insufficiency. In additional to being linked to narcotics, sedative, and anticholinergics, delirium has been associated with urinary tract infection, pneumonia, hypoxia or hypercarbia, fever, blood loss, and electrolyte disturbances. In this review, we document the incidence of postoperative averse outcomes and discuss way of improving perioperative anaesthesia care for this vulnerable surgical population. There is present possibility anaesthesia in elderly.
