38542311|t|The Chronic Effects of a Single Low-Intensity Blast Exposure on Phosphoproteome Networks and Cognitive Function Influenced by Mutant Tau Overexpression.
38542311|a|Blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT) is a pressing concern for veterans and civilians exposed to explosive devices. Affected personnel may have increased risk for long-term cognitive decline and developing tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease-related disorders (ADRD) or frontal-temporal dementia (FTD). The goal of this study was to identify the effect of BINT on molecular networks and their modulation by mutant tau in transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing the human tau P301L mutation (rTg4510) linked to FTD or non-carriers. The primary focus was on the phosphoproteome because of the prominent role of hyperphosphorylation in neurological disorders. Discrimination learning was assessed following injury in the subsequent 6 weeks, using the automated home-cage monitoring CognitionWall platform. At 40 days post injury, label-free phosphoproteomics was used to evaluate molecular networks in the frontal cortex of mice. Utilizing a weighted peptide co-expression network analysis (WpCNA) approach, we identified phosphopeptide networks tied to associative learning and mossy-fiber pathways and those which predicted learning outcomes. Phosphorylation levels in these networks were inversely related to learning and linked to synaptic dysfunction, cognitive decline, and dementia including Atp6v1a and Itsn1. Low-intensity blast (LIB) selectively increased pSer262tau in rTg4510, a site implicated in initiating tauopathy. Additionally, individual and group level analyses identified the Arhgap33 phosphopeptide as an indicator of BINT-induced cognitive impairment predominantly in rTg4510 mice. This study unveils novel interactions between ADRD genetic susceptibility, BINT, and cognitive decline, thus identifying dysregulated pathways as targets in potential precision-medicine focused therapeutics to alleviate the disease burden among those affected by BINT.
