36973813|t|alpha7 Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor: a key receptor in the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway exerting an antidepressant effect.
36973813|a|Depression is a common mental illness, which is related to monoamine neurotransmitters and the dysfunction of the cholinergic, immune, glutamatergic, and neuroendocrine systems. The hypothesis of monoamine neurotransmitters is one of the commonly recognized pathogenic mechanisms of depression; however, the drugs designed based on this hypothesis have not achieved good clinical results. A recent study demonstrated that depression and inflammation were strongly correlated, and the activation of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7 nAChR)-mediated cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) in the cholinergic system exhibited good therapeutic effects against depression. Therefore, anti-inflammation might be a potential direction for the treatment of depression. Moreover, it is also necessary to further reveal the key role of inflammation and alpha7 nAChR in the pathogenesis of depression. This review focused on the correlations between inflammation and depression as well-discussed the crucial role of alpha7 nAChR in the CAP.
