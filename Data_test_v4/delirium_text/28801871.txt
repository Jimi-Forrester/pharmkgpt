28801871|t|Pediatric Delirium: Evaluation, Management, and Special Considerations.
28801871|a|Delirium describes a syndrome of acute brain dysfunction with severe consequences on patient outcomes, medical cost, morbidity, and mortality. It represents a final common pathway of numerous pathophysiologic disturbances disrupting cerebral homeostasis. The diagnosis is predicated on recognition of the clinical features of the syndrome through ongoing clinical assessment. Early identification can be aided by routine screening, particularly in high-risk populations. Evaluation and management are continuous and simultaneous processes involving a multidisciplinary care team including child psychiatry consultation. Prevention, early identification and management are critical in alleviating symptoms, improving outcomes, and reducing distress for patients, families, and care teams. This review highlights our current understanding regarding pediatric delirium, its mechanisms, clinical manifestations, detection and management.
