37850113|a|Chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium) contains secondary metabolites, such as flavonoid compounds, especially luteolin-7-glucoside and quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside (quercitrin), in its tissues. Utilizing sucrose as an elicitor through callus culture presents an alternative method to enhance the production of secondary metabolites. This research aimed to determine the best sucrose concentration and harvest time for maximizing quercitrin content in chrysanthemum callus culture. The research employed a completely randomized design with four treatment groups: 0, 30, 45, and 60 g/l of sucrose added to MS medium containing 4 ppm 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Callus samples were harvested on the 15th and 30th days of culture. The observed parameters included callus morphology (color and texture), fresh weight, dry weight, the diameter of the callus, and quercitrin content analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that all callus cultures exhibited intermediate textures and varied colors, predominantly shades of brown. The treatment involving 45 g/l of sucrose with a 30th-day harvest yielded the highest fresh weight, dry weight, and quercitrin content, namely 2.108 g, 0.051 g, and 0.437 mg/g DW, respectively. Notably, the quercitrin content exhibited a 63.67% increase compared to the control.
