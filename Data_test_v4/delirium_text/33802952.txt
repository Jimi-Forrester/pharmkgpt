33802952|t|Sudden Death from Primary Cerebral Melanoma: Clinical Signs and Pathological Observations.
33802952|a|Primary cerebral tumors rarely provoke sudden death. The incidence is often underestimated with reported frequencies in the range of 0.02 to 2.1% in medicolegal autopsy series. Furthermore, primary cerebral melanoma is an uncommon neoplasm. It represents approximately 1% of all melanoma cases and 0.07% of all brain tumors. This neoplasm is very aggressive, and its annual incidence is about 1 in 10 million people. In the present study, a 20-year-old male was admitted to hospital with vomiting, headache, paresthesia and aggressive behavior. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head was performed showing a hyperdense nodule in the right parietal lobe with inflammation of the Silvian fissure. A complete autopsy was performed 48 h after death. A blackish material was displayed on the skull base, and posterior fossa. Microscopic examination diagnosed primary brain melanoma. A systematic review of the literature was also performed where no previous analogous cases were found. The forensic pathologist rarely encounters primary cerebral melanoma, and for these reasons, it seemed appropriate to describe this case as presenting aspecific clinical symptoms and leading to sudden unexpected death. Histopathological observations are reported and discussed to explain this surprising sudden death caused by a primary cerebral melanoma.
