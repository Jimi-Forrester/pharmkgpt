35852764|a|We report the case of a 70-year-old man coming to our attention for new onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) in a rapidly evolving CJD during SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. Our case report describes a fulminant CJD evolution associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, which led to patient death after 15 days from admission. First EEG presented continuous diffuse spikes, sharp waves and sharp-and-slow wave complexes, pattern consistent with a non-convulsive status epilepticus (NORSE). Our case supports how CJD with SARS-CoV-2 co-infection could be characterized by an accelerated evolution, as already hypothesize for others microorganism infections, and how the diagnosis might be more challenging due to its uncommon presentations, such as NORSE.
