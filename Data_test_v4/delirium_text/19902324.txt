19902324|t|Association between the RAGE G82S polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease.
19902324|a|The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is associated with several pathological states including Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, while its soluble form (sRAGE) acts as a decoy receptor. We have tested for association of AD with a functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the RAGE gene (G82S; rs2070600), a SNP associated with increased ligand affinity of RAGE. Analysis of a Chinese cohort (276 cases; 254 controls) showed a higher prevalence of the RAGE 82S allele and GS + SS genotype in the patients [82S vs. 82G: P = 0.017, odds ratio (OR) = 1.431; GS + SS vs. GG: P = 0.025, OR = 1.490]. Further stratification analysis revealed that the association of the RAGE G82S polymorphism with AD was significant in early onset AD stratum. Moreover, plasma sRAGE levels were lower in AD than in normal elderly controls, and the presence of the risk allele was associated with further plasma sRAGE reduction and a fast cognitive deterioration. The present study provides preliminary evidence that the RAGE G82S variant is involved in genetic susceptibility to AD.
