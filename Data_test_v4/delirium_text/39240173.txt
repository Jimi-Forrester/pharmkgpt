39240173|a|The blood-based detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is becoming challenging since the blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts the direct circulation of AD molecules in the blood, thereby precluding the detection of AD at an early-stage. Herein, we report the development of a novel CNT-metal-porous graphene hybrid (CNT-MGH) nano-interdigitated array (n-IDA) electrochemical 8-well biosensor for the successful early-stage diagnosis of AD from blood. Laser-induced graphene (LIG) technology has been used to fabricate the proposed CNT-MGH n-IDA 8-well sensor. Firstly, the electrochemical characterization (i.e., electrode gap, material composition, etc.) of the proposed sensor was demonstrated by measuring p-aminophenol (PAP) with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.1 picomole. Subsequently, the CNT-MGH n-IDA 8-well sensor was then used to diagnose AD via novel blood biomarkers p-Tau 217 and p-Tau 181 using an electrochemical enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (e-ELISA) enzyme by-product PAP. During e-ELISA, the alkaline phosphatase enzyme (IgG-AP) tagged to the detection antibody produced an electroactive ELISA by-product PAP by reacting with the enzyme-substrate 4-aminophenyl phosphate (PAPP). Finally, the CNT-MGH n-IDA 8-well sensor was then used to measure the current generated by the redox reaction via the e-ELISA by-product PAP. While quantified, the proposed CNT-MGH n-IDA 8-well sensor successfully detected p-Tau 217 and p-Tau 181 proteins in blood with LODs of 0.16 pg ml-1 and 0.08 pg ml-1, respectively.
