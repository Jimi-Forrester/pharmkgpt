32134817|t|Home Health Agency Factors Associated With Acute Care Hospitalization and Emergency Department Use.
32134817|a|We linked the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data for Home Health and the Home Health Compare data for the year 2016 to identify home healthcare agency (HHA) characteristics associated with acute care hospitalization (ACH) or emergency department (ED) use. The study cohort consisted of 9,800 HHAs. Beta regression was used to examine the association between average age, race/ethnic composition, number of skilled nursing visits, number of therapy visits, percentage of dual eligible patients, HHA ownership, HHA location, Medicare tenure, proportion of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, stroke, diabetes, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, cancer and Alzheimer disease, and ACH or ED use. After controlling for HHA-level characteristics, variations in HHAs' ACH and unplanned ED visits were found. For-profit HHAs were significantly less likely to have patients with ACH. (Odds ratio = -0.05, p = 0.020), HHAs in the Midwest, South, and West had lower odds of ACH. HHAs that serve more than 50% Black patients had significantly decreased odds (beta = -0.16, p < 0.001) of ACH. A 1-unit increase in the proportion of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, COPD, stroke, heart failure, and Alzheimer disease was associated with increased odds of hospitalization. For each unit increase in the number of skilled nursing visits, the odds of ACH increased by 0.02 (p = 0.001). For-profit and nonprofit HHAs had a significant decrease in the odds of unplanned ED visits (p < 0.05). An increase in the proportion of patients with COPD was associated with increased odds of unplanned ED visits (p < 0.001). HHA characteristics are associated with hospitalization and ED use without hospitalization. These characteristics point to variation in quality of care measured by ACH and ED use.
