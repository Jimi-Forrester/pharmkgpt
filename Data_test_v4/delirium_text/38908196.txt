38908196|t|Beyond PDE4 inhibition: A comprehensive review on downstream cAMP signaling in the central nervous system.
38908196|a|Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a key second messenger that regulates signal transduction pathways pivotal for numerous biological functions. Intracellular cAMP levels are spatiotemporally regulated by their hydrolyzing enzymes called phosphodiesterases (PDEs). It has been shown that increased cAMP levels in the central nervous system (CNS) promote neuroplasticity, neurotransmission, neuronal survival, and myelination while suppressing neuroinflammation. Thus, elevating cAMP levels through PDE inhibition provides a therapeutic approach for multiple CNS disorders, including multiple sclerosis, stroke, spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer's disease. In particular, inhibition of the cAMP-specific PDE4 subfamily is widely studied because of its high expression in the CNS. So far, the clinical translation of full PDE4 inhibitors has been hampered because of dose-limiting side effects. Hence, focusing on signaling cascades downstream activated upon PDE4 inhibition presents a promising strategy, offering novel and pharmacologically safe targets for treating CNS disorders. Yet, the underlying downstream signaling pathways activated upon PDE(4) inhibition remain partially elusive. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the existing knowledge regarding downstream mediators of cAMP signaling induced by PDE4 inhibition or cAMP stimulators. Furthermore, we highlight existing gaps and future perspectives that may incentivize additional downstream research concerning PDE(4) inhibition, thereby providing novel therapeutic approaches for CNS disorders.
