36072308|a|Purpose: Early and accurate prediction of elderly patients at high risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) after non-cardiac surgery will provide favorable evidence for rational perioperative management and long-term postoperative recovery. This study aimed to develop bedside dynamic nomograms to provide accurately an individualized prediction of the risk of POCD at 6-month postoperatively with patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery and to guide clinical decision-making and postoperative management. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively collected patients undergoing surgical treatment at the Nanjing First Hospital between May 2020 and May 2021. We collected the data on preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables. Clinical and laboratory data on admission and intraoperative variables and postoperative variables were used. We measured the performances of the nomograms using sensitivity, specificity of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), the area under the ROC curves (AUC), the 10-fold cross-validation, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: POCD was observed in 23 of 415 patients (5.6%) at 6-month postoperatively. The preoperative and postoperative models obtained 91.6% and 94.0% accuracy rates on the data. Compared to the preoperative model, the postoperative model had an area under the receiver characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.973 vs 0.947, corresponding to a specificity of 0.941 vs 0.918 and a sensitivity of 0.913 vs 0.870. The overall performance of the postoperative model was better than the preoperative model. Conclusion: In this study, we developed novel bedside dynamic nomograms with reasonable clinical utility that can provide individualized prediction of POCD risk at 6-month postoperatively in elderly patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery at different time points based on patient admission and postoperative data. External validations are needed to ensure their value in predicting POCD in elderly patients.
