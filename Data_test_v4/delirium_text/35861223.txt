35861223|a|OBJECTIVES: Aducanumab is a monoclonal antibody which has recently been licenced for use by the food and drug administration for treatment of patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild AD dementia. Appropriate use criteria (AUC) for Aducanumab in clinical practice are available. We look to review patients in our specialist interdisciplinary cognitive service with positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for AD for their hypothetical eligibility for Aducanumab, or a similar anti-amyloid agent. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was undertaken of patients with positive AD-biomarker CSF analysis. Data available at time of CSF analysis was reviewed to determine hypothetical eligibility for Aducanumab. RESULTS: Seventy patients had positive AD-CSF biomarkers. Forty nine of these were seen in the Gerontology-led service, with 21 in the neurology cohort. Average patient age was 70 years old. Forty patients (57%) met eligibility criteria for Aducanumab therapy by AUC guidelines. CONCLUSION: We highlight the patients within our service who would be appropriate for Aducanumab or similar anti-amyloid agents should licencing be granted in the European Union, and the need to develop the resources and capacity to deliver this or other emerging disease modifying AD therapies. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: All patients in the combined cognitive clinic provide consent re willingness to be contacted re research.
