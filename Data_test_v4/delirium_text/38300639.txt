38300639|t|Neuroinflammaging: A Tight Line Between Normal Aging and Age-Related Neurodegenerative Disorders.
38300639|a|Aging in the healthy brain is characterized by a low-grade, chronic, and sterile inflammatory process known as neuroinflammaging. This condition, mainly consisting in an up-regulation of the inflammatory response at the brain level, contributes to the pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Development of this proinflammatory state involves the interaction between genetic and environmental factors, able to induce age-related epigenetic modifications. Indeed, the exposure to environmental compounds, drugs, and infections, can contribute to epigenetic modifications of DNA methylome, histone fold proteins, and nucleosome positioning, leading to epigenetic modulation of neuroinflammatory responses. Furthermore, some epigenetic modifiers, which combine and interact during the life course, can contribute to modeling of epigenome dynamics to sustain, or dampen the neuroinflammatory phenotype. The aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge about neuroinflammaging with a particular focus on epigenetic mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of neuroinflammatory cascades in the central nervous system; furthermore, we describe some diagnostic biomarkers that may contribute to increase diagnostic accuracy and help tailor therapeutic strategies in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.
