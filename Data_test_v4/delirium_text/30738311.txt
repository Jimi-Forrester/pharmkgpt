30738311|a|Decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia (PE). Recent evidence indicates that S-glutathionylation may occur on the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), leading to eNOS uncoupling, characterized by a decreased NO production and an increased generation of superoxide anion (O2 -). We hypothesized that eNOS glutathionylation may occur in PE placentas and participate in eNOS dysfunction. The glutathionylation of eNOS was investigated in thirteen PE-affected patients and in nine normal pregnancies. Immunofluorescence, confocal microscopy and western-blot experiments carried out on eNOS immunoprecipitates, revealed a high level of eNOS glutathionylation in PE placentas, mostly reversed by dithiotreitol (DTT), thus indicative of S-glutathionylation. In order to investigate whether eNOS glutathionylation may alter trophoblast migration, an important event occurring during early placentation, cultured HTR-8/SVneo human trophoblasts (HTR8) were exposed either to low pO2 (O2 1%) or to pO2 changes (O2 1-20%), in order to generate oxidative stress. Trophoblasts exposed to low pO2, did not undergo oxidative stress nor eNOS S-glutathionylation, and were able to generate NO and migrate in a wound closure model. In contrast, trophoblasts submitted to low/high pO2 changes, exhibited oxidative stress and a (DTT reversible) S-glutathionylation of eNOS, associated with reduced NO production and migration. The autonomous production of NO seemed necessary for the migratory potential of HTR8, as suggested by the inhibitory effect of eNOS silencing by small interfering RNAs, and the eNOS inhibitor L-NAME, in low pO2 conditions. Finally, the addition of the NO donor, NOC-18 (5 microM), restored in part the migration of HTR8, thereby emphasizing the role of NO in trophoblast homeostasis. In conclusion, the high level of eNOS S-glutathionylation in PE placentas provides new insights in the mechanism of eNOS dysfunction in this disease.
