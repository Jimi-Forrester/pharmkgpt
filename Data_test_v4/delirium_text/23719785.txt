23719785|a|OBJECTIVE: To review recent clinical studies regarding the role of dexmedetomidine for prevention and treatment of delirium in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and PubMed searches (1988-Feburary 2013) were conducted, using the key words delirium, dexmedetomidine, Precedex, agitation, alpha-2 agonists, critical care, and intensive care. References from relevant articles were reviewed for additional information. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Clinical trials comparing dexmedetomidine with other sedatives/analgesics or with antipsychotics for delirium were selected. Studies that evaluated the use of dexmedetomidine for sedation for more than 6 hours were included in this review. DATA SYNTHESIS: Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha-2 receptor agonist that provides sedation, anxiolysis, and modest analgesia with minimal respiratory depression. Its mechanism of action is unique compared with that of traditional sedatives because it does not act on gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors. In addition, dexmedetomidine lacks anticholinergic activity and promotes a natural sleep pattern. These pharmacologic characteristics may explain the possible anti delirium effects of dexmedetomidine. Eight clinical trials, including 5 double-blind randomized trials, were reviewed to evaluate the impact of dexmedetomidine on ICU delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Currently available evidence suggests that dexmedetomidine is a promising agent, not only for prevention but also for treatment of ICU-associated delirium. However, larger, well-designed trials are warranted to define the role of dexmedetomidine in preventing and treating delirium in the ICU.
