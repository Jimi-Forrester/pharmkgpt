37946877|t|Optogenetics Sheds Light on Brown and Beige Adipocytes.
37946877|a|Excessive food intake leads to lipid accumulation in white adipose tissue, triggering inflammation, cellular stress, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome. In contrast, the dynamic energy expenditure and heat generation of brown and beige adipose tissue, driven by specialized mitochondria, render it an appealing candidate for therapeutic strategies aimed at addressing metabolic disorders. This review examines the therapeutic potential of brown and beige adipocytes for obesity and metabolic disorders, focusing on recent studies that employ optogenetics for thermogenesis control in these cells. The findings delve into the mechanisms underlying UCP1-dependent and UCP1-independent thermogenesis and how optogenetic approaches can be used to precisely modulate energy expenditure and induce thermogenesis. The convergence of adipocyte biology and optogenetics presents an exciting frontier in combating metabolic disorders and advancing our understanding of cellular regulation and energy balance.
