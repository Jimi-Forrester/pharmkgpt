33484739|a|AIM: Recent studies suggest the leptomeninges may have a lymphatic drainage system connecting the subarachnoid space with dorsal cervical lymph nodes. The distribution and histologic features of any dural "lymphatics" has not been established or extensively studied. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Duras from 113 patients were evaluated including 96 formalin-fixed dural samples (mean age 62 years) collected from 2010 to 2015. An additional 17 samples were collected from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (mean age 81) autopsied between 1995 and 1997. Two, 2 cm length coronal sections were taken from mid-convexity dura, parallel to the middle meningeal artery, 3-5 cm below and perpendicular to the superior sagittal sinus (SSS). Sections of twenty-two cases were also taken of the SSS and peri-SSS dura. To screen for possible lymphatics, 52 dural and 22 SSS samples from these cases were evaluated with CD31 and podoplanin (D240) immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Numerous unlined microscopic channels were found in 101 of 113 (89 %). In non-AD duras, 86 of 92 (93 %) had numerous channels. Duras with AD had significantly less channels i.e. 15 of 21(71 %, P = 0.048). None of the channels had lymphocytes, or neutrophils in their lumena. In the superior sagittal sinus, 9 of 9 non-AD and 12/13 AD SSS duras had fluid channels. Congo red stains revealed no amyloid-like material in the AD duras. Immunohistochemically, CD31 was not found in fluid channels but was in endothelium in 36 of 36 non-AD duras and in most blood vessels including 16 of 16 AD patients. Seven of 36 (19 %) with non-AD and 1 of 16 (6%) with AD had podoplanin in thin walled vessels suggestive of lymphatics but none showed staining in fluid channels. CONCLUSIONS: Unlined fluid channels are present in the dura but not clearly lymphatic.
