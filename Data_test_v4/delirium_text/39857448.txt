39857448|t|Exploring Strategies to Prevent and Treat Ovarian Cancer in Terms of Oxidative Stress and Antioxidants.
39857448|a|Oxidative stress is a state of imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and the antioxidant defence system in the body. Oxidative stress may be associated with a variety of diseases, such as ovarian cancer, diabetes mellitus, and neurodegeneration. The generation of oxidative stress in ovarian cancer, one of the common and refractory malignancies among gynaecological tumours, may be associated with several factors. On the one hand, the increased metabolism of ovarian cancer cells can lead to the increased production of ROS, and on the other hand, the impaired antioxidant defence system of ovarian cancer cells is not able to effectively scavenge the excessive ROS. In addition, chemotherapy and radiotherapy may elevate the oxidative stress in ovarian cancer cells. Oxidative stress can cause oxidative damage, promote the development of ovarian cancer, and even result in drug resistance. Therefore, studying oxidative stress in ovarian cancer is important for the prevention and treatment of ovarian cancer. Antioxidants, important markers of oxidative stress, might serve as one of the strategies for preventing and treating ovarian cancer. In this review, we will discuss the complex relationship between oxidative stress and ovarian cancer, as well as the role and therapeutic potential of antioxidants in ovarian cancer, thus guiding future research and clinical interventions.
