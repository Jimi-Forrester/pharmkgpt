We investigated the screening accuracy of the Japanese version of Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III) to diagnose MCI and dementia. METHODS: The original ACE-III was translated and adapted to Japanese. It was then administered to a Japanese population. The Hasegawa Dementia Scale-revised (HDS-R) and Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) were also applied to evaluate cognitive dysfunction. In total, 389 subjects (dementia = 178, MCI = 137, controls = 73) took part in our study. RESULTS: The optimal ACE-III cut-off scores to detect MCI and dementia were 88/89 (sensitivity 0.77, specificity 0.92) and 75/76 (sensitivity 0.82, specificity 0.90), respectively. ACE-III was superior to HDS-R and MMSE in the detection of MCI or dementia. The internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and inter-rater reliability of ACE-III were excellent. CONCLUSIONS: ACE-III is a useful cognitive test to detect MCI and dementia. ACE-III may be widely useful in clinical practice.
