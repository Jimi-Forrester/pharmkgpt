38904713|a|Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis affect millions of people around the world. In addition to age, which is a key factor contributing to the development of all neurodegenerative diseases, genetic and environmental components are also important risk factors. Current methods of treating neurodegenerative diseases are mostly symptomatic and do not eliminate the cause of the disease. Many studies focus on searching for natural substances with neuroprotective properties that could be used as an adjuvant therapy in the inhibition of the neurodegeneration process. These compounds include flavonoids, such as luteolin, showing significant anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective activity. Increasing evidence suggests that luteolin may confer protection against neurodegeneration. In this review, we summarize the scientific reports from preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies regarding the beneficial effects of luteolin in neurodegenerative diseases. Luteolin was studied most extensively in various models of Alzheimer's disease but there are also several reports showing its neuroprotective effects in models of Parkinson's disease. Though very limited, studies on possible protective effects of luteolin against Huntington's disease and multiple sclerosis are also discussed here. Overall, although preclinical studies show the potential benefits of luteolin in neurodegenerative disorders, clinical evidence on its therapeutic efficacy is still deficient.
