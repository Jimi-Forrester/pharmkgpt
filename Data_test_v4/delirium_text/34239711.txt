34239711|t|alpha-synuclein pathogenesis in hiPSC models of Parkinson's disease.
34239711|a|alpha-synuclein is an increasingly prominent player in the pathology of a variety of neurodegenerative conditions. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects mainly the dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain. Typical of PD pathology is the finding of protein aggregations termed 'Lewy bodies' in the brain regions affected. alpha-synuclein is implicated in many disease states including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease. However, PD is the most common synucleinopathy and continues to be a significant focus of PD research in terms of the alpha-synuclein Lewy body pathology. Mutations in several genes are associated with PD development including SNCA, which encodes alpha-synuclein. A variety of model systems have been employed to study alpha-synuclein physiology and pathophysiology in an attempt to relate more closely to PD pathology. These models include cellular and animal system exploring transgenic technologies, viral vector expression and knockdown approaches, and models to study the potential prion protein-like effects of alpha-synuclein. The current review focuses on human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models with a specific focus on mutations or multiplications of the SNCA gene. iPSCs are a rapidly evolving technology with huge promise in the study of normal physiology and disease modeling in vitro. The ability to maintain a patient's genetic background and replicate similar cell phenotypes make iPSCs a powerful tool in the study of neurological diseases. This review focuses on the current knowledge about alpha-synuclein physiological function as well as its role in PD pathogenesis based on human iPSC models.
