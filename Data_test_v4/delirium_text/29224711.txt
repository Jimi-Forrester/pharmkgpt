29224711|a|INTRODUCTION: Anesthesia emergence delirium is a self-limiting clinical phenomenon very common in children. Although pathophysiology is still uncertain, some factors seem to be involved, such as rapid awakening in an unknown environment, agitation during anesthetic induction, preoperative anxiety, environmental disorders, use of preanesthetic medication, use of inhalational anesthetics, and postoperative pain. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with anesthesia emergence delirium in children undergoing outpatient surgery. METHODS: A prospective observational study was carried out with 100 children aged 2 to 10 years, who underwent surgery on an outpatient basis. The study variables were: anesthesia emergence delirium and the associated risk factors (preoperative anxiety, child impulsive behavior, use of pre-anesthetic medication, traumatic induction, type of anesthesia, and postoperative pain). Multivariate Poisson's logistic regression was used to analyze the possible explanatory variables, where the prevalence ratios were estimated with the respective 95% confidence intervals, considering a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: Delirium and pain were observed in 27% and 20% of children, respectively. Only postoperative pain after Poisson's regression, was shown to be associated with anesthesia emergence delirium, with a prevalence ratio of 3.91 (p<0.000). CONCLUSION: The present study showed 27% prevalence of anesthesia emergence delirium in the study population. The incidence of anesthesia emergence delirium was higher in children who had postoperative pain.
