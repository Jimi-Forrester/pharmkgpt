33777563|a|As the world has struggled to adapt to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, new evidence has emerged suggesting that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may manifest with a wide variety of neurologic symptoms. We present the case of a 70-year-old patient hospitalized for COVID-19 related pneumonia who was treated with off-label interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitor tocilizumab and eventually developed prolonged delirium. MRI findings were consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). PRES was felt to be from SARS-CoV-2 infection, tocilizumab, or a combination. The patient received symptomatic treatment without success. These findings are consistent with few other recent reports, which have chronicled PRES findings in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, this is only the second example of PRES in a COVID-19 patient treated with tocilizumab. While cases of PRES have been noted to occur with other infectious diseases, clinicians should be aware of the association with SARS-CoV-2 infection and tocilizumab therapy, particularly when considering tocilizumab treatment outside its approved indication. Future research efforts are needed to establish evidence-based guidelines for the management of these patients.
