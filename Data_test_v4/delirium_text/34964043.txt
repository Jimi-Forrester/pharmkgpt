34964043|t|DelIrium VULnerability in GEriatrics (DIVULGE) study: a protocol for a prospective observational study of electroencephalogram associations with incident postoperative delirium.
34964043|a|INTRODUCTION: Delirium is a neurocognitive disorder common in older adults in acute care settings. Those who develop delirium are at an increased risk of dementia, cognitive decline and death. Electroencephalography (EEG) during delirium in older adults is characterised by slowing and reduced functional connectivity, but markers of vulnerability are poorly described. We aim to identify EEG spectral power and event-related potential (ERP) markers of incident delirium in older adults to understand neural mechanisms of delirium vulnerability. Characterising delirium vulnerability will provide substantial theoretical advances and outcomes have the potential to be translated into delirium risk assessment tools. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will record EEG in 90 participants over 65 years of age prior to elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We will record 4-minutes of resting state (eyes open and eyes closed) and a 5-minute frequency auditory oddball paradigm. Outcome measures will include frequency band power, 1/f offset and slope, and ERP amplitude measures. Participants will undergo cognitive and EEG testing before their elective procedures and daily postoperative delirium assessments. Group allocation will be done retrospectively by linking preoperative EEG data according to postoperative delirium status (presence, severity, duration and subtype). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Royal Adelaide Hospital, Central Adelaide Local Health Network and the University of South Australia Human Ethics Committee. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal articles and presentations at national and international conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12618001114235 and ACTRN12618000799257.
