28852258|a|Adverse cutaneous reactions are known to occur with psychotropic medications, which may lead to poor drug compliance. As compared to other group of psychotropics, there is relatively scarce literature on olanzapine-induced skin eruptions. We present a case of a 39-year-old man diagnosed with first episode mania and alcohol dependence syndrome who was started on tablet olanzapine which leads to fixed drug eruptions. Exhaustive investigations were done, all of which came out within normal limits. A diagnosis of fixed drug eruptions was made by the dermatologist. The skin eruptions subsided after stopping olanzapine. It has, thus, been emphasized that clinicians should be aware of the potential cutaneous eruptions associated with olanzapine. Early detection of the same would lead to timely management and hence better compliance with the psychotropic treatment.
