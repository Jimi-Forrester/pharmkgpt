32518634|t|Lithium and coronaviral infections. A scoping review.
32518634|a|The current rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) calls for a rapid response from the research community. Lithium is widely used to treat bipolar disorder, but has been shown to exhibit antiviral activity. This brief review took a systematic approach to identify six in vitro studies reporting on the influence of lithium on coronaviral infections. We propose mechanistic investigation of the influence of lithium - alone and with chloroquine - on the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
