12053079|a|We examined the incidence rates of psychiatric disorders in end-stage renal failure patients on hemodialysis (HD) based on 4-year long-term follow-up. Among various psychiatric disorders, the frequency of three psychiatric disorders, dementia, delirium, and major depression, was relatively high. One-year incidence rate of whole psychiatric disorders was 10.6% (7.1% in non-aged and 13.7% in aged). One-year incidence rate of dementia in aged patients was 4.2% (dementia of the Alzheimer's disease, 0.5%; multi-infarct dementia, 3.7%). One-year incidence rate of multi-infarct dementia in aged HD patients was 7.4 times as large as that in the elderly general populations, suggesting that aged HD patients tend to exhibit multi-infarct dementia. The high incidence rate may be closely related to advanced arteriosclerosis and other medical conditions. Psychiatric management is required for ESRD patients with three major psychiatric disorders, dementia, delirium, and major depression, in particular for aged patients with multi-infarct dementia who has received long-term HD therapy.
