38397004|t|Respiratory Dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease-Consequence or Underlying Cause? Applying Animal Models to the Study of Respiratory Malfunctions.
38397004|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative brain disease that is the most common cause of dementia among the elderly. In addition to dementia, which is the loss of cognitive function, including thinking, remembering, and reasoning, and behavioral abilities, AD patients also experience respiratory disturbances. The most common respiratory problems observed in AD patients are pneumonia, shortness of breath, respiratory muscle weakness, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The latter is considered an outcome of Alzheimer's disease and is suggested to be a causative factor. While this narrative review addresses the bidirectional relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and Alzheimer's disease and reports on existing studies describing the most common respiratory disorders found in patients with Alzheimer's disease, its main purpose is to review all currently available studies using animal models of Alzheimer's disease to study respiratory impairments. These studies on animal models of AD are few in number but are crucial for establishing mechanisms, causation, implementing potential therapies for respiratory disorders, and ultimately applying these findings to clinical practice. This review summarizes what is already known in the context of research on respiratory disorders in animal models, while pointing out directions for future research.
