32813409|t|Dietary education programs for adults with neurological diseases: a scoping review protocol.
32813409|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to identify and map the evidence on the types of dietary education programs that have been implemented and evaluated in any setting for adults with neurological diseases. This review will also examine program characteristics, including program duration, length, and number of sessions, and common behavior change techniques used. INTRODUCTION: Up to 1 billion people are affected by neurological diseases, most commonly Alzheimer's disease and dementias, epilepsy, Huntington's disease, motor neurone disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. Dietary recommendations for most of these diseases follow national dietary guidelines. Dietary education programs are recommended by the World Health Organization to promote adherence to a healthy diet, but it is not clear which dietary education programs have been conducted for adults with neurological diseases or the characteristics of such programs. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This review will consider qualitative and intervention studies (randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and pre-post studies) evaluating dietary education programs for adults with neurological diseases. Programs can be any format in any setting, and may include a comparator group (waitlist control, treatment as usual, or another intervention) or have no comparator group. METHODS: CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Emcare, MEDLINE, ProQuest (ProQuest Central and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses), PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar will be searched for publications in English. Neurological organizations will be contacted for unpublished literature. Titles and abstracts will be screened, and full texts accessed for final inclusion. Intervention details, study outcomes, behavior change techniques, and findings will be extracted. Results will be presented in a table with accompanying description.
