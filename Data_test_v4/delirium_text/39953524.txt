39953524|a|BACKGROUND: Preclinical evidence suggests that young plasma has beneficial effects on multiple organ systems in aged mice. Whether young plasma exerts beneficial effects in an aging human population remains highly controversial. Despite lacking data, young donor plasma infusions have been promoted for age-related conditions. Given the preclinical evidence that young plasma exerts beneficial effects by attenuating inflammation, this study examined whether administering a young plasma protein fraction to an elderly population would exert anti-inflammatory and immune modulating effects in humans, using surgery as a tissue injury model. METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled and randomized 38 patients undergoing major joint replacement surgery. Patients received four separate infusions of a plasma protein fraction derived from young donors, or placebo one day before surgery, before and after surgery on the day of surgery, and one day after surgery. Blood specimens for proteomic and immunological analyses were collected before each infusion. Based on the high-content assessment of circulating plasma proteins with single-cell analyses of peripheral immune cells, proteomic signatures and cell-type-specific signaling responses that separated the treatment groups were derived with regression models. RESULTS: Elastic net regression models revealed that administration a young plasma protein fraction significantly altered the proteomic (AUC = 0.796, p = 0.002) and the cellular immune response (AUC 0.904, p < 0.001) to surgical trauma resulting in signaling pathway- and cell type-specific anti-inflammatory immune modulation. Affected proteomic pathways regulating inflammation included JAK-STAT, NF-kappa B, and MAPK (p < 0.001). These findings were confirmed at the cellular level as the MAPK and JAK/STAT signaling responses were diminished and IkB, the negative regulator of NFkB, was elevated in adaptive immune cells. CONCLUSION: Reported findings provide a first proof of principle in humans that a young plasma protein fraction actively regulates inflammatory and immune responses in an elderly population. They provide a solid rationale for elucidating active principles in young plasma that may be of therapeutic benefits for a range of age-related pathologies.
