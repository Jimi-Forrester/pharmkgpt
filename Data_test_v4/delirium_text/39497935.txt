39497935|t|Antiseptics: An expeditious third force in the prevention and management of coronavirus diseases.
39497935|a|Notably, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have all had significant negative impact on global health and economy. COVID-19 alone, has resulted to millions of deaths with new cases and mortality still being reported in its various waves. The development and use of vaccines have not stopped the transmission of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of COVID-19, even among vaccinated individuals. The use of vaccines and curative drugs should be supplemented with adoption of simple hygiene preventive measures in the fight against the spread of the virus, especially for healthcare workers. Several virucidal topical antiseptics, such as povidone-iodine (PVP-I), citrox, cyclodextrins among others, have been demonstrated to be efficacious in the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in both in vitro and in vivo studies. The strategic application of these virucidal formulations could provide the additional impetus needed to effectively control the spread of the virus. We have here presented a simple dimension towards curtailing the dissemination of COVID-19, and other coronaviruses, through the application of effective oral, nasal and eye antiseptics among patients and medical personnel. We have further discussed the mechanism of action of some of these commonly available virucidal solutions while also highlighting some essential controversies in their use.
