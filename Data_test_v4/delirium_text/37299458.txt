37299458|a|The ability to preserve cognitive function and protect brain structure from the effects of the aging process and neurodegenerative disease is the goal of non-pharmacologic, lifestyle interventions focused on brain health. This review examines, in turn, current diet and exercise intervention trends and the collective progress made toward understanding their impact on cognition and brain health. The diets covered in this review include the Mediterranean diet (MeDi), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND), ketogenic diet, intermittent fasting, and weight loss management. The exercise approaches covered in this review include endurance, resistance, combined exercise programs, yoga, tai chi, and high-intensity interval training. Although valuable evidence is building concerning how diet and exercise influence cognitive performance and brain structure, many of the open questions in the field are concerned with why we see these effects. Therefore, more strategically designed intervention studies are needed to reveal the likely multiple mechanisms of action in humans.
