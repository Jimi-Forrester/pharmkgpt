15377876|a|There is substantial evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage may play a key role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease. Evidence supporting this in both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases is continuing to accumulate. This review discusses the increasing evidence for a role of both mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage in contributing to beta-amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease. I also discuss the increasing evidence that Parkinson's disease is associated with abnormalities in the electron transport gene as well as oxidative damage. Lastly, I reviewed the potential efficacy of coenzyme Q as well as a number of other antioxidants in the treatment of both Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.
