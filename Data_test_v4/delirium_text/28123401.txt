28123401|t|Neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and regeneration in multiple sclerosis: intercorrelated manifestations of the immune response.
28123401|a|Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory-demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system, with a strong neurodegenerative component. The question whether neurodegeneration in MS is independent or related to neuroinflammation has been long debated, but not yet fully clarified. Furthermore, little is still known on how neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in MS are related to potential regenerative processes. In this perspective, we briefly discuss main clinical, pathological and experimental evidence on the relationship between neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in MS, and on their connection with regeneration. We discuss that these processes in MS might represent intercorrelated manifestations of the immune response, especially of the innate immunity.
