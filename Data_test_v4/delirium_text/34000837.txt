34000837|t|Regulation of Cortisol in Patients Undergoing Total Joint Arthoplasty.
34000837|a|Osteoarthritis is a condition in which joint cartilage and bone degenerate progressively over time. Total joint arthroplasty is a definitive treatment. Cortisol is a hormone that is associated with pain and inflammation. This study aims to investigate the cortisol levels in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty. Plasma samples were collected from 71 total joint arthroplasty (TJA) patients at baseline (pre-surgery), 24 hours post-operation, and 5 days post-operation. Cortisol levels were measured in each sample using a commercially available ELISA kit. All results were compiled as group means +- SD. The plasma cortisol level at baseline were 218.5 +- 12 ng/mL. The 24-hour post-surgical samples showed a marked increase in cortisol levels 240.7 +- 15 ng/mL. The blood samples drawn at the 5th day after surgery showed a downward trend (74 +- 12 ng/mL). At 5 days post-operation, cortisol levels were significantly lower than at baseline or 24 hours post-operation. These results point to the fact that prior to surgery, the patient's emotional stress contributes to increased serum cortisol levels. The higher level of cortisol persists at 24 hours post-operation due to inflammation from the procedure. This data also suggests that at 5 days post-operation, the inflammatory response from the surgery and emotional stress subside, resulting in a near normalization of the cortisol levels. Cortisol is a hormone that plays a major role in the body's response to surgery. The relevance between cortisol and different points in the surgical timeline has the potential to prognosticate and improve recovery measures.
