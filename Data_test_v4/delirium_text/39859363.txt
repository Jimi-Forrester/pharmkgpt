39859363|t|Don't Be Surprised When These Surprise You: Some Infrequently Studied Sphingoid Bases, Metabolites, and Factors That Should Be Kept in Mind During Sphingolipidomic Studies.
39859363|a|Sphingolipidomic mass spectrometry has provided valuable information-and surprises-about sphingolipid structures, metabolism, and functions in normal biological processes and disease. Nonetheless, many noteworthy compounds are not routinely determined, such as the following: most of the sphingoid bases that mammals biosynthesize de novo other than sphingosine (and sometimes sphinganine) or acquire from exogenous sources; infrequently considered metabolites of sphingoid bases, such as N-(methyl)n-derivatives; "ceramides" other than the most common N-acylsphingosines; and complex sphingolipids other than sphingomyelins and simple glycosphingolipids, including glucosyl- and galactosylceramides, which are usually reported as "monohexosylceramides". These and other subspecies are discussed, as well as some of the circumstances when they are likely to be seen (or present and missed) due to experimental conditions that can influence sphingolipid metabolism, uptake from the diet or from the microbiome, or as artifacts produced during extraction and analysis. If these compounds and factors are kept in mind during the design and interpretation of lipidomic studies, investigators are likely to be surprised by how often they appear and thereby advance knowledge about them.
