37904099|t|Triglyceride-glucose index as a valuable predictor for aged 65-years and above in critical delirium patients: evidence from a multi-center study.
37904099|a|BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose index (TyG), an established indicator of insulin resistance, is closely correlated with the prognosis of several metabolic disorders. This study aims to investigate the association between the TyG index and the incidence of critical delirium in patients aged 65 years and older. METHODS: We focused on evaluating patients aged 65 years and older diagnosed with critical delirium. Data were obtained from the Medical Information Database for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) and the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD). Multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression were used to determine the relationship between the TyG index and the risk of delirium. RESULTS: Participants aged 65 years and older were identified from the MIMIC-IV (n = 4,649) and eICU-CRD (n = 1,844) databases. Based on optimal thresholds derived from RCS regression, participants were divided into two cohorts: Q1 (< 8.912), Q2 (>= 8.912). The logistic regression analysis showed a direct correlation between the TyG index and an increased risk of critical delirium among ICU patients aged 65 and older. These findings were validated in the eICU-CRD dataset, and sensitivity analysis further strengthened our conclusions. In addition, the subgroup analysis revealed certain differences. CONCLUSION: This study highlights a clear, independent relationship between the TyG index and the risk of critical delirium in individuals aged 65 years and older, suggesting the importance of the TyG index as a reliable cardio-cerebrovascular metabolic marker for risk assessment and intervention.
