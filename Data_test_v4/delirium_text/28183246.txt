28183246|t|Solid-State Structure of Abeta (Abeta) in Alzheimer's Disease.
28183246|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become the most common neurodegenerative disease. The deposition of amyloid fibrils in the brain is one of the characteristics of AD. The fibrils are composed of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). Abeta is produced through a series event of protease cleavage of a transmembrane protein called beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) which is commonly expressed in the brain. The production of Abeta and its propensity to aggregation to form oligomers and fibrils are believed to initiate a sequence of events that lead to AD dementia. The production of Abeta is influenced by the transmembrane domain (TM) structure of APP. The structure variety of different Abeta assemblies including oligomers and fibrils may result in different neurotoxicity to the brain. Therefore, enormous work has been carried out to study the structure of APP TM and various Abeta assemblies. Solid-state NMR has advantages in studying immobile protein structures with large molecular weight. In this review, solid-state NMR structure of APP TM and different Abeta assemblies will be discussed, especially various Abeta amyloid fibril structures. This structural information greatly enhanced our understanding in AD, providing fundamental knowledge that will help in finding a treatment for AD.
