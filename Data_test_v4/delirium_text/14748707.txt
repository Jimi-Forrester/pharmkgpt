14748707|t|Proteolytic cascade in the amyloidogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
14748707|a|beta-Amyloid, a neurotoxic peptide deposited in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, is released by a series of membrane-limited proteolytic events. beta-Secretase activity is enhanced by cellular targeting into intracellular cholesterol-rich microdomains, which are dispersed by statins.
