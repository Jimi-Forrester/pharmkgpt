32973919|a|Due to the high pathogenicity and mortality, the COVID-19 disaster caused global panic and anxiety. At present, diagnosis and treatment are of great concern. As time progresses, however, the sequelae caused by many other organ system complications and treatments will become increasingly obvious, and psychosomatic symptoms are one of these changes with great potential impact. Studies have shown that symptoms like poor sleep quality, anxiety and even delirium are not uncommon in patients during isolation. By summarizing the follow-up study on mental and psychological health of SARS in the past 10 years, and combining the characteristics of the existing cases of COVID-19, we will provide suggestions for the prevention and treatment of psychological diseases in clinical practice.
