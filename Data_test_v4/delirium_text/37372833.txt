37372833|a|A recent report from the United Nations state that the percentage of elderly individuals in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) will witness a sharp increase in the next three decades (5.6% in 2017 to 23% by 2050). This situation will lead to an increased prevalence of comorbidities and hence, will require close monitoring and constant care of such individuals who are prone to suffer from complications such as arthritis, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, neurological disorders, etc. Frailty is one such age-related phenomenon which enhances the risk of falling, functional restrictions and greater vulnerability to adverse consequences, which tend to lead to institutionalization. Such factors highlight the importance of the urgent awareness for circumventing the progression of frailty toward a compromised health status. This concise report is an attempt to sum up the relevant research articles published with regard to frailty and concomitant diseases in the last 5 years. It also sums up the research on frailty in the KSA elderly population, till date. This article reflects the opinions of an author on tackling such issues through a well-directed mechanism involving interdisciplinary transitional care and geriatric co-management.
