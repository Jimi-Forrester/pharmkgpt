31474954|a|Antiviral compounds targeting cellular metabolism instead of virus components have become an interesting issue for preventing and controlling the spread of virus infection, either as sole treatment or as a complement of vaccination. Some of these compounds are involved in the control of lipid metabolism and/or membrane rearrangements. Here, we describe the effect of three of these cell-targeting antivirals: lauryl gallate (LG), valproic acid (VPA), and cerulenin (CRL) in the multiplication of viruses causing important porcine diseases. The results confirm the antiviral action in cultured cells of LG against African swine fever virus (ASFV), foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), as well as the inhibitory effect of VPA and CRL on ASFV infection. Other gallate esters have been also assayed for their inhibition of FMDV growth. The combined action of these antivirals has been also tested in ASFV infections, with some synergistic effects when LG and VPA were co-administered. Regarding the mode of action of the antivirals, experiments on the effect of the time of its addition in infected cell cultures indicated that the inhibition by VPA and CRL occurred at early times after ASFV infection, while LG inhibited a late step in FMDV infection. In all the cases, the presence of the antiviral reduced or abolished the induction of virus-specific proteins. Interestingly, LG also reduced mortality and FMDV load in a mouse model. The possible use of cell-targeted antivirals against porcine diseases is discussed.
