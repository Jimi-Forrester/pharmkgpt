37639768|a|Majority of dementia research is conducted in non-Hispanic White participants despite a greater prevalence of dementia in other racial groups. To obtain a better understanding of biomarker presentation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the non-Hispanic White population, this study exclusively examined AD biomarker abnormalities in 85 Black and/or African American participants within the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Participants were classified by the ADNI into 3 clinical groups: cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia. Data examined included demographics, apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta1-42, CSF total tau (t-tau), CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau), 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and measures of cognition and function. Analyses of variance and covariance showed lower cortical thickness in 5 of 7 selected MRI regions, lower hippocampal volume, greater volume of white matter hyperintensities, lower measures of cognition and function, lower measures of CSF Abeta1-42, and greater measures of CSF t-tau and p-tau between clinical groups. Our findings confirmed greater AD biomarker abnormalities between clinical groups in this sample.
