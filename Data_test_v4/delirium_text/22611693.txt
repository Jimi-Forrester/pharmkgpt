22611693|t|[Mental disorders following delirium tremens].
22611693|a|Twenty-four patients, aged between 29-62 years (average age - 44+/-11 years), at the post-psychosis period of delirium tremens were observed. In 19 patients, this period was characterized by a triad of mental disorders including cognitive dysfunction, affective disturbances and alcohol anosognosia. Memantine was recommended for all patients with mental disorders. These disorders are reduced during 11-28 (in average - 18+/-4) days after the recovery of psychosis. The hypothesis on the close relationship of three types of described disorsers with mild forms of Korsakoff disease and the expediency of memantine therapy after the delirium tremens was expressed.
