38549629|a|Background: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) is a widely used screening tool for detecting older adults with Alzheimer's disease among their cognitively healthy peers. A previous study in Greek population showed that ADAS-Cog-Greek (G) is a valid tool and can identify people with Alzheimer's disease from older adult control group; however, there is no current data about whether ADAS-Cog can differentiate older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from those who have subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Objective: The current study aimed to examine the discriminant potential of ADAS-Cog-G in Greek older adults who meet the criteria for SCD or MCI. Methods: Four hundred eighty-two community-dwelling older adults, visitors of the Greek Alzheimer Association and Related Disorders, were enrolled in the current study. One hundred seventy-six of them met the criteria for SCD and three hundred six had MCI. Results: Path analysis applied to the data showed that age, as well as educational level affected ADAS-Cog-G performance. Results showed that the cut-off scores, which better discriminate people with SCD from MCI as well as their sensitivity and specificity values, were extracted in participants with high educational level (13 educational years<) and mainly under the age of 75 years. Conclusions: The current study provided evidence concerning the discriminant potential of ADAS-Cog-G to differentiate older adults with SCD from those with MCI in the Greek population, and therefore contributes to the relevant literature on the field.
