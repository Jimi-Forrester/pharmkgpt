35235946|t|Putting midodrine on the MAP: An approach to liberation from intravenous vasopressors in vasodilatory shock.
35235946|a|PURPOSE: Prolonged duration of intravenous (IV) vasopressor dependence in critically ill adult patients with vasodilatory shock results in increased length of stay in both the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital, translating to higher risk of infection, delirium, immobility, and cost. Acceleration of vasopressor liberation can aid in reducing these risks. Midodrine is an oral alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonist that offers a potential means of liberating patients from IV vasopressor therapy. This clinical review summarizes primary literature and proposes a clinical application for midodrine in the recovery phase of vasodilatory shock. SUMMARY: Five studies with a total of over 1,000 patients conducted between 2011 and 2021 were identified. In observational studies, midodrine administration was demonstrated to lead to faster time to liberation from IV vasopressor therapy and shorter ICU length of stay in patients recovering from vasodilatory shock. These findings were not replicated in a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. In this review, literature evaluating midodrine use for IV vasopressor liberation is summarized and study limitations are discussed. CONCLUSION: On the basis of this review of current literature, recommendations are provided on selecting appropriate candidates for adjunctive midodrine in the recovery phase of vasodilatory shock and considerations are discussed for safely and effectively initiating, titrating, and discontinuing therapy.
