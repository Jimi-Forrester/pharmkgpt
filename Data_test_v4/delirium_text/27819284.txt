27819284|a|We evaluated the effects of superimposing seizures on a genetic mutation with known involvement in both Autism Spectrum Disorder and in epilepsy. Neuron-subset specific (NS)-Pten heterozygous (HT) and wildtype (WT) adult mice received either intraperitoneal injections of kainic acid (20 mg/kg) to induce status epilepticus or the vehicle (saline). Animals then received a battery of behavioral tasks in order to evaluate activity levels, anxiety, repetitive-stereotyped behavior, social behavior, learning and memory. In the open field task, we found that HT mice after seizures showed a significant increase in total activity and total distance in the surround region of the open field. In the elevated plus maze task, we found that HT mice after seizures displayed increased total distance and velocity as compared to HT mice that did not undergo seizures and WT controls. In the social chamber test, we found the HT mice after seizures displayed an impairment in social behavior. These findings demonstrate that superimposing seizures on a genetic mutation can result in long-term alterations in activity and social behavior in mice.
