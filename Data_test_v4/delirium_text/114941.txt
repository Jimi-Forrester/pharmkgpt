114941|t|Rabies: otolaryngologic manifestations.
114941|a|Rabies is a rare, fatal viral infection, usually transmitted by the bite of an infected animal. Some 30,000 Americans are immunized annually, however, so public health considerations are common. The development of a new vaccine, grown in human diploid cell culture, is discussed. It appears to have high antigenicity with no serious morbidity. A case of a patient with fatal rabies who had fever, delirium, dysphagia, and cervical and pectoral subcutaneous emphysema is presented.
