37518982|t|Association between brain health outcomes and metabolic risk factors in persons with diabetes.
37518982|a|We performed a cross-sectional study to determine associations between cognition and MRI-derived brain outcomes, with obesity, diabetes duration, and metabolic risk factors in 51 Pima American Indians with longstanding type 2 diabetes (T2d) (mean [SD] age: 48.4 [11.3] years, T2d duration: 20.1 [9.1] years). Participants had similar cognition (NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery composite: 45.3 [9.8], p = 0.64, n = 51) compared to normative data. T2d duration, but not other metabolic risk factors, associated with decreased cortical thickness (Point Estimate (PE): -0.0061, 95%CI: -0.0113, -0.0009, n = 45), gray matter volume (PE: -830.39, 95%CI: -1503.14, -157.64, n = 45), and increased white matter hyperintensity volume (PE: 0.0389, 95%CI: 0.0049, 0.0729, n = 45).
