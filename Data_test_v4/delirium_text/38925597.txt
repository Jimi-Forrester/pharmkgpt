38925597|a|BACKGROUND: Mosaic Down syndrome is a triplication of chromosome 21 in some but not all cells. Little is known about the epidemiology of mosaic Down syndrome. We described prevalence of mosaic Down syndrome and the co-occurrence of common chronic conditions in 94,533 Medicaid enrolled adults with any Down syndrome enrolled from 2016 to 2019. METHODS: We identified mosaic Down syndrome using the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, tenth edition code for mosaic Down syndrome and compared to those with nonmosaic Down syndrome codes. We identified chronic conditions using established algorithms and compared prevalence by mosaicism. RESULTS: In total, 1966 (2.08%) had claims for mosaic Down syndrome. Mosaicism did not differ by sex or race/ethnicity with similar age distributions. Individuals with mosaicism were more likely to present with autism (13.9% vs. 9.6%) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (17.7% vs. 14.0%) compared to individuals without mosaicism. In total, 22.3% of those with mosaic Down syndrome and 21.5% of those without mosaicism had claims for Alzheimer's dementia (Prevalence difference: 0.8; 95% Confidence interval: -1.0, 2.8). The mosaic group had 1.19 times the hazard of Alzheimer's dementia compared to the nonmosaic group (95% CI: 1.0, 1.3). DISCUSSION: Mosaicism may be associated with a higher susceptibility to certain neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's dementia. Our findings challenge previous assumptions about its protective effects in Down syndrome. Further research is necessary to explore these associations in greater depth.
