38003681|t|Noncoupled Mitochondrial Respiration as Therapeutic Approach for the Treatment of Metabolic Diseases: Focus on Transgenic Animal Models.
38003681|a|Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to numerous chronic diseases, and mitochondria are targets for various toxins and xenobiotics. Therefore, the development of drugs or therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondria is an important task in modern medicine. It is well known that the primary, although not the sole, function of mitochondria is ATP generation, which is achieved by coupled respiration. However, a high membrane potential can lead to uncontrolled reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and associated dysfunction. For over 50 years, scientists have been studying various synthetic uncouplers, and for more than 30 years, uncoupling proteins that are responsible for uncoupled respiration in mitochondria. Additionally, the proteins of the mitochondrial alternative respiratory pathway exist in plant mitochondria, allowing noncoupled respiration, in which electron flow is not associated with membrane potential formation. Over the past two decades, advances in genetic engineering have facilitated the creation of various cellular and animal models that simulate the effects of uncoupled and noncoupled respiration in different tissues under various disease conditions. In this review, we summarize and discuss the findings obtained from these transgenic models. We focus on the advantages and limitations of transgenic organisms, the observed physiological and biochemical changes, and the therapeutic potential of uncoupled and noncoupled respiration.
