12029252|t|Recovery and outcome after minor pediatric surgery.
12029252|a|Recovery and outcome parameters of children undergoing surgery as outpatient are reported. There are minor differences between different drugs in terms of outcome, speed of recovery and recovery adverse events. There is a trend in increasing adverse events (most of all emergence delirium) during recovery from sevoflurane and nitrous oxide. Most complications (pain, nausea, vomiting, croup) are transient and managed before discharge. The most frequent complications at home are undertreated pain, loss of appetite, and behavioral changes.
