29081151|a|Objective: To evaluate and explore the mechanism of the effect of hypertonic pre-injection on postoperative delirium in the aged. Methods: From June 2016 to February 2017, participants scheduled hip arthroplasty surgery were randomly divided into four groups: Group 1 (H1) 30 patients pre-injected 4 ml/kg hypertonic solution were proceeded general anesthesia; Group 2 (H2) 30 patients pre-injected 4 ml/kg hypertonic solution were proceeded spinal canal anesthesia; Group 3 (C1) 30 patients pre-injected 4 ml/kg isotonic saline were proceeded general anesthesia; Group 4 (C2) 30 patients pre-injected 4 ml/kg isotonic saline were proceeded spinal canal anesthesia in Department of Anesthesiology, Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University.All these patients were operated after anesthesia.To avoid electrolyte disorder, the level of Na(+) , Ca(2+) , K(+) in the artery blood was analyzed.Peripheral venous blood was extracted to detect the concentration of inflammatory factors IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha and nerve injury factor S100beta.In order to evaluate the relationship of these inflammatory fators with monocyte, we used flow cytometry to detect the number of mononuclear in peripheral venous blood.After operation 1 to 3 days, all these patients were assessed cognitive function by Nu-DESC. Results: Electrolytes fluctuationed in the normal range in four groups at different time points.Compared with before infusion, IL-6, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha of four groups were significantly increased in postoperative.Compared with group H(H1 or H2), IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were increased and IL-10 was decreased in group C(C1 or C2) after the surgery.S100beta of group C(C1 and C2) was higher than before infusion.No significant changes were found in the cotykines mentioned above between group H1 and H2. The expression of monocytes CD14(+) CD16(+) /CD14(+ +) was decreased and the incidence of postoperative delirium was lower in group H than group C(13.3%, 10.0% vs 33.3%, 36.7%, P<0.05). Conclusion: Hypertonic saline can improve postoperative delirium of the aged and the mechanism may be related to the inhibition of monocyte cells secreting inflammatory factors.
