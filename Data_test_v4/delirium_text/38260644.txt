38260644|a|Background: We profiled circulating plasma metabolites to identify systemic biochemical changes in clinical and biomarker-assisted diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: We used an untargeted approach with liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry to measure small molecule plasma metabolites from 150 clinically diagnosed AD patients and 567 age-matched healthy elderly of Caribbean Hispanic ancestry. Plasma biomarkers of AD were measured including P-tau181, Abeta40, Abeta42, total-tau, neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Association of individual and co-abundant modules of metabolites were tested with clinical diagnosis of AD, as well as biologically-defined AD pathological process based on P-tau181 and other biomarker levels. Results: Over 6000 metabolomic features were measured with high accuracy. First principal component (PC) of lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPC) that bind to or interact with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and arachidonic acid (AHA) was associated with decreased risk of AD (OR = 0.91 [0.89-0.96], p = 2e-04). Association was restricted to individuals without an APOE epsilon4 allele (OR = 0.89 [0.84-0.94], p = 8.7e-05). Among individuals carrying at least one APOE epsilon4 allele, PC4 of lysoPCs moderately increased risk of AD (OR = 1.37 [1.16-1.6], p = 1e-04). Essential amino acids including tyrosine metabolism pathways were enriched among metabolites associated with P-tau181 levels and heparan and keratan sulfate degradation pathways were associated with Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio. Conclusions: Unbiased metabolic profiling can identify critical metabolites and pathways associated with beta-amyloid and phosphotau pathology. We also observed an APOE-epsilon4 dependent association of lysoPCs with AD and biologically based diagnostic criteria may aid in the identification of unique pathogenic mechanisms.
