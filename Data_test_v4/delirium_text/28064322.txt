28064322|a|Zinc ions form complexes with beta-amyloid peptides and play an important role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. It has been demonstrated by turbidimetry and correlation spectroscopy that synthetic peptide Abeta16 representing the metal-binding domain of beta-amyloid is able to interact with nucleic acids, chondroitin polysulfate, and dextran sulfates in the presence of zinc ions. The amino acid D7H substitution enhanced the peptide binding to polyanions, whereas the H6R and H6A-H13A substitutions abolished this interaction. It is suggested that the metal-binding domain may serve as a zinc-dependent site of beta-amyloid interaction with biological polyanions including DNA, RNA, and glycosaminoglycans.
