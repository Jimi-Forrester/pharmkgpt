30816798|t|Brain Vasculature and Cognition.
30816798|a|There is a complex interaction between the brain and the cerebral vasculature to meet the metabolic demands of the brain for proper function. Preservation of cerebrovascular function and integrity has a central role in this sophisticated communication within the brain, and any derangements can have deleterious acute and chronic consequences. In almost all forms of cognitive impairment, from mild to Alzheimer disease, there are changes in cerebrovascular function and structure leading to decreased cerebral blood flow, which may initiate or worsen cognitive impairment. In this focused review, we discuss the contribution of 2 major vasoactive pathways to cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive impairment in an effort to identify early intervention strategies.
