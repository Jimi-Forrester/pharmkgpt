37488845|t|Emergence of taurine as a therapeutic agent for neurological disorders.
37488845|a|Taurine is a sulfur-containing, semi-essential amino acid that occurs naturally in the body. It alternates between inflammation and oxidative stress-mediated injury in various disease models. As part of its limiting functions, taurine also modulates endoplasmic reticulum stress, Ca2+ homeostasis, and neuronal activity at the molecular level. Taurine effectively protects against a number of neurological disorders, including stroke, epilepsy, cerebral ischemia, memory dysfunction, and spinal cord injury. Although various therapies are available, effective management of these disorders remains a global challenge. Approximately 30 million people are affected worldwide. The design of taurine formation could lead to potential drugs/supplements for the health maintenance and treatment of central nervous system disorders. The general neuroprotective effects of taurine and the various possible underlying mechanisms are discussed in this review. This article is a good resource for understanding the general effects of taurine on various diseases. Given the strong evidence for the neuropharmacological efficacy of taurine in various experimental paradigms, it is concluded that this molecule should be considered and further investigated as a potential candidate for neurotherapeutics, with emphasis on mechanism and clinical studies to determine efficacy.
