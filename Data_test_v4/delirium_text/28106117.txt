28106117|a|Disease-modifying immunotherapies focusing on reducing amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition are the main treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, none of the Abeta immunotherapies has produced clinically meaningful results to date. The main reason for this lack of efficacy is that the vaccine induces insufficiently high antibody titers, as it contains small B-cell epitope of Abeta to avoid Abeta42-specific T-cell activation. With the aim of generating a potent AD vaccine, we designed the protein PP-3copy-Abeta1-6-loop123, comprising three copies of Abeta1-6 inserted into three loops of a novel vaccine platform, the norovirus P particle, which could present Abeta at its surface and remarkably enhance the immunogenicity of the vaccine. We demonstrated that PP-3copy-Abeta1-6-loop123 was able to elicit high antibody titers against Abeta42, without causing T-cell activation, in AD mice regardless of their age. Importantly, PP-3copy-Abeta1-6-loop123 treatment successfully reduced amyloid deposition, rescued memory loss, and repaired hippocampus damage in AD mice. The Abeta antibodies induced by this active immunotherapy reacted with and disrupted aggregated Abeta, reducing its cellular toxicity. In addition, our results suggested PP-3copy-Abeta1-6-loop123 immunization could restore Abeta42 homeostasis in both the serum and brain. Thus, the P particle-based Abeta epitope vaccine is a sufficiently immunogenic and safe immunotherapeutic intervention for Alzheimer's disease.
