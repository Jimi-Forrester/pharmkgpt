24988174|t|[Revised practice guidelines 'Delirium in adults and the elderly'].
24988174|a|A multidisciplinary workgroup has revised the 2004 practice guidelines on 'Delirium' on the initiative of the Dutch Geriatrics Society. In comparison with the previous version, the new guidelines place more emphasis on screening and non-pharmaceutical prevention and treatment. They recommend a degree of restraint when prescribing medication. Both the patient's and the caregiver's perspectives are discussed. The guidelines also focus on delirium in patients in a nursing home setting, and describe what the workgroup regards as optimal care for patients suffering from delirium. The revised guidelines consider the diagnosis and treatment of delirium as a part of basic medical care and primarily the responsibility of the attending physician. The workgroup advises consulting an expert in the field of delirium only in cases of lack of experience, and for complex cases. The guidelines also include recommendations for the organization of follow-up care for the delirium patient.
