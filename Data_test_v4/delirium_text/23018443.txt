23018443|a|OBJECTIVE: The apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele enhances cerebral accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and is a major risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesized that HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) would be associated with the APOE epsilon4 genotype and cerebral Abeta deposition. DESIGN: Clinicopathological study of HIV-infected adults from four prospective cohorts in the US National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium. METHODS: We used multivariable logistic regressions to model outcomes [Abeta plaques (immunohistochemistry) and HAND (standard criteria)] on predictors [APOE epsilon4 (allelic discrimination assay), older age (>=50 years), Abeta plaques, and their two-way interactions] and comorbid factors. RESULTS: Isocortical Abeta deposits generally occurred as diffuse plaques and mild-to-moderate amyloid angiopathy. Isocortical phospho-Tau-immunoreactive neurofibrillary lesions were sparse. The APOE epsilon4 and older age were independently associated with the presence of Abeta plaques [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 10.16 and 5.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.89 - 35.76 and 1.91-17.48, P = 0.0003 and 0.0019, respectively, n = 96]. The probability of HAND was increased in the presence of Abeta plaques among APOE epsilon4 carriers (adjusted OR 30.00, 95% CI 1.41-638.63, P = 0.029, n = 15), but not in non-epsilon4 carriers (n = 57). CONCLUSION: The APOE epsilon4 and older age increased the likelihood of cerebral Abeta plaque deposition in HIV-infected adults. Generally, Abeta plaques in HIV brains were immunohistologically different from those in symptomatic Alzheimer's disease brains. Nonetheless, Abeta plaques were associated with HAND among APOE epsilon4 carriers. The detection of APOE epsilon4 genotype and cerebral Abeta deposition biomarkers may be useful in identifying living HAND patients who could benefit from Abeta-targeted therapies.
