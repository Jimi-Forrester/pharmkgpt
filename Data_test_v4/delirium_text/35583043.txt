35583043|a|OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to test whether interpersonal dysfunction, characterized by loneliness and/or dissatisfaction with relationships, is an imminent predictor of financial exploitation vulnerability (FEV) among adults age 50+ within a 6-month observation period. This study also tests whether FEV prospectively predicts interpersonal dysfunction. METHODS: Twenty-six adults aged 50 or older completed a study involving baseline data collection and 13 follow-ups over 6 months. Linear mixed models were used for primary analyses. RESULTS: After adjustment for demographic, psychological and cognitive covariates, there were between-person effects of FEV and interpersonal dysfunction across follow-ups, suggesting that those with generally higher interpersonal dysfunction compared to other participants also reported greater FEV (B(SE) = 1.09(.33), p = .003). There was a within-person effect (B(SE) = .08(.03), p = .007) of elevated interpersonal dysfunction predicting greater FEV two weeks later across all follow-ups. Within-person effect of FEV was not predictive of interpersonal dysfunction (B(SE) = .25(.15), p = .10). There was also a significant effect of age (B(SE) = -.06(.02), p = .007), such that older individuals had lower FEV throughout follow-ups. CONCLUSION: Among adults age 50+, individuals with higher interpersonal dysfunction relative to others in the study reported greater FEV throughout the 6-month observation period. Increased loneliness and social dissatisfaction, relative to one's average level, predicts subsequent increases in FEV, and may be an imminent risk factor for exploitation.
