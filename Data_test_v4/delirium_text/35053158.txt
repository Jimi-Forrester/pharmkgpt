35053158|t|Shock-Induced Damage Mechanism of Perineuronal Nets.
35053158|a|The perineuronal net (PNN) region of the brain's extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounds the neural networks within the brain tissue. The PNN is a protective net-like structure regulating neuronal activity such as neurotransmission, charge balance, and action potential generation. Shock-induced damage of this essential component may lead to neuronal cell death and neurodegenerations. The shock generated during a vehicle accident, fall, or improvised device explosion may produce sufficient energy to damage the structure of the PNN. The goal is to investigate the mechanics of the PNN in reaction to shock loading and to understand the mechanical properties of different PNN components such as glycan, GAG, and protein. In this study, we evaluated the mechanical strength of PNN molecules and the interfacial strength between the PNN components. Afterward, we assessed the PNN molecules' damage efficiency under various conditions such as shock speed, preexisting bubble, and boundary conditions. The secondary structure altercation of the protein molecules of the PNN was analyzed to evaluate damage intensity under varying shock speeds. At a higher shock speed, damage intensity is more elevated, and hyaluronan (glycan molecule) is most likely to break at the rigid junction. The primary structure of the protein molecules is least likely to fail. Instead, the molecules' secondary bonds will be altered. Our study suggests that the number of hydrogen bonds during the shock wave propagation is reduced, which leads to the change in protein conformations and damage within the PNN structure. As such, we found a direct connection between shock wave intensity and PNN damage.
