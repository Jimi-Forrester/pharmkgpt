12545856|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly population. The occurrence of dementia correlates best with neuronal apoptosis. All the proteins (APP, PS1, PS2) encoded by AD-related genes are involved in regulating neuronal apoptosis. On the other hand numerous apoptosis-regulating factors have been identified to participate in AD neurodegeneration. Detailed studies on this field are of important significance in the understanding the pathogenesis and the therapeutic measures for AD. This review will discuss the interrelation and interaction between AD-related genes and apoptosis.
