24103321|a|Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second cause of degenerative dementia in autopsy studies. In clinical pratice however, the prevalence of DLB is much lower with important intercenter variations. Among the reasons for this low sensitivity of DLB diagnosis are (1) the imprecision and subjectivity of the diagnostic criteria; (2) the underestimation of non-motor symptoms (REM-sleep behavior disorder, dysautonomia, anosmia); mostly (3) the nearly constant association of Lewy bodies with Alzheimer's disease pathology, which dominates the clinical phenotype. With the avenue of targeted therapies against the protein agregates, new clinical scales able to apprehend the coexistence of Lewy pathology in Alzheimer's disease are expected.
