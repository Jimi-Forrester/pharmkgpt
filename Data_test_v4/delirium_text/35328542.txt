35328542|t|Structural Modifications on Chalcone Framework for Developing New Class of Cholinesterase Inhibitors.
35328542|a|Due to the multifaceted pharmacological activities of chalcones, these scaffolds have been considered one of the most privileged frameworks in the drug discovery process. Structurally, chalcones are alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl functionalities with two aryl or heteroaryl units. Amongst the numerous pharmacological activities explored for chalcone derivatives, the development of novel chalcone analogs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the research topics of most interest. Chalcones possess numerous advantages, such as smaller molecular size, opportunities for further structural modification thereby altering the physicochemical properties, cost-effectiveness, and convenient synthetic methodology. The present review highlights the recent evidence of chalcones as a privileged structure in AD drug development processes. Different classes of chalcone-derived analogs are summarized for the easy understanding of the previously reported analogs as well as the importance of certain functionalities in exhibiting cholinesterase inhibition. In this way, this review will shed light on the medicinal chemistry fraternity for the design and development of novel promising chalcone candidates for the treatment of AD.
