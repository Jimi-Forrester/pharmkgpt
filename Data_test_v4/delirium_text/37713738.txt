37713738|a|Prior research has yielded conflicting results about the potential influence of antipsychotics in patients with COVID-19. In this multicenter retrospective study, we examined the association of antipsychotic use at admission with 28-day all-cause mortality in a sample of 59,021 adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from January 2020 to November 2021. In a 1:1 ratio matched analytic sample (N=1,454) accounting for age, sex, hospital, hospitalization period, the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, other psychotropic medications, medications prescribed according to compassionate use or as part of a clinical trial, current diagnoses of psychiatric disorders, and clinical and biological markers of COVID-19 severity, antipsychotic use was not associated with 28-day mortality [23.5% (N=727) versus 18.6% (N=727); OR=1.16; 95%CI=0.89-1.51; p=0.280]. This association remained non-significant in exploratory analyses across all classes of antipsychotics and individual molecules, except for typical antipsychotics and loxapine, which were significantly linked to increased 28-day mortality, associations likely due to residual indication bias. Contrariwise, antipsychotics prescribed at daily doses higher than 200 mg of chlorpromazine-equivalents might be associated with reduced 28-day mortality when compared to patients not taking antipsychotics in the matched analytic sample [10.4% (N=154) versus 18.6% (N=727); AOR=0.56; 95%CI=0.31-0.96; p=0.040]. These results suggest that antipsychotic use, when prescribed at usual doses, are not be associated with 28-day mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
