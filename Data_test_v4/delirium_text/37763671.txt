37763671|a|New disease targets and medicinal chemistry approaches are urgently needed to develop novel therapeutic strategies for treating pulmonary diseases. Emerging evidence suggests that reduced activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a complex heterotrimeric enzyme that regulates dephosphorylation of serine and threonine residues from many proteins, is observed in multiple pulmonary diseases, including lung cancer, smoke-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, asthma, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Loss of PP2A responses is linked to many mechanisms associated with disease progressions, such as senescence, proliferation, inflammation, corticosteroid resistance, enhanced protease responses, and mRNA stability. Therefore, chemical restoration of PP2A may represent a novel treatment for these diseases. This review outlines the potential impact of reduced PP2A activity in pulmonary diseases, endogenous and exogenous inhibitors of PP2A, details the possible PP2A-dependent mechanisms observed in these conditions, and outlines potential therapeutic strategies for treatment. Substantial medicinal chemistry efforts are underway to develop therapeutics targeting PP2A activity. The development of specific activators of PP2A that selectively target PP2A holoenzymes could improve our understanding of the function of PP2A in pulmonary diseases. This may lead to the development of therapeutics for restoring normal PP2A responses within the lung.
