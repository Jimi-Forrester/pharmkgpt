35770026|t|Experimental radar data for monitoring brain atrophy progression.
35770026|a|This data set contains complex frequency domain signals obtained from unidirectional antennas mainly fabricated for radar-based head imaging. Data were obtained as part of a project investigating radar-based microwave imaging for monitoring neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease. The wearable device, measurement setup, and phantoms used are described. Multiple experiments were performed to get the data from three lamb brain phantoms that realistically mimic the whole-brain atrophy due to Alzheimer's disease. Microwave imaging has shown great potential for breast and brain screening due to its low cost, non-ionizing, portable, and wearable nature. Most of the studies are based on simulations with good results, but further evaluation on experimental data is required before its clinical viability. This work provides an open-source experimental dataset that can be used to evaluate novel signal processing and imaging techniques and validate simulation results. The data provide both the magnitude and phase value at each discrete frequency, making this data set useful for both time-delay and phase-shift based imaging algorithms.
