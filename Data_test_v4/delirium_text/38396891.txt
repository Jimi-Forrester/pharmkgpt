38396891|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are comorbidities that result from the sharing of common genes. The molecular background of comorbidities can provide clues for the development of treatment and management strategies. Here, the common genes involved in the development of the two diseases and in memory and cognitive function are reviewed. Network clustering based on protein-protein interaction network identified tightly connected gene clusters that have an impact on memory and cognition among the comorbidity genes of AD and T2DM. Genes with functional implications were intensively reviewed and relevant evidence summarized. Gene information will be useful in the discovery of biomarkers and the identification of tentative therapeutic targets for AD and T2DM.
