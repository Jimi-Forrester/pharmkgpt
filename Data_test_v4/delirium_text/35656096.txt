35656096|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the aging population, but despite extensive research, there is no consensus on the biological cause of AD. While AD research is dominated by protein/peptide-centric research based on the amyloid hypothesis, a theory that designates dysfunction in beta-amyloid production, accumulation, or disposal as the primary cause of AD, many studies focus on metabolomics as a means of understanding the biological processes behind AD progression. In this review, we discuss mass spectrometry (MS)-based AD metabolomics studies, including sample type and preparation, mass spectrometry specifications, and data analysis, as well as biological insights gleaned from these studies, with the hope of informing future AD metabolomic studies.
