24825568|a|BACKGROUND: Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau) accompany cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) in the aging brain and in Alzheimer's disease. CSVD is characterized by a heterogeneous spectrum of histopathological features possibly initiated by an endothelial dysfunction and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. OBJECTIVE: We test the hypothesis that characteristic features of CSVD are associated with the accumulation of Abeta and ptau in non-transgenic spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHRSP). METHODS: Amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) and tau were investigated by western blotting (n = 12 SHRSP, age 20 weeks). Lectin staining and plasma protein immunocytochemistry for BBB examination were performed in 38 SHRSP (age 12-44 weeks) and Abeta (n = 29) and ptau (n = 17) immunocytochemistry in 20-44 week-old SHRSP. We assessed the correlation between extracellular amyloid deposits and features of CSVD (n = 135, 12-44 weeks). RESULTS: In 20 week-old SHRSP, cortical AbetaPP expression was significantly increased compared to Wistar controls but tau levels were unchanged. At ages of 20-44 weeks, SHRSP exhibited an age-dependent increase in extracellular Abeta. Ptau was observed in 26-44 week-old SHRSP. Distinct features of CSVD pathology developed from the age of 12 weeks on. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that in a hypertensive rat model that displays features of CSVD from 12 weeks, there is an age-dependent extracellular deposition of Abeta observed from 20 weeks onwards, increased AbetaPP expression at 20 weeks and ptau accumulation from 26 weeks on. This study suggests that CSVD associated with hypertension results in an age-related failure of Abeta clearance, increase in AbetaPP expression, and intraneuronal tau hyperphosphorylation.
