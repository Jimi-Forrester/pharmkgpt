31517530|a|Aim: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to be themajor cause of dementia among the elderly. The structural properties and binding interactions of the AD drug physostigmine (-)-phy, and its analogues (-)-hex and (-)-phe and (+)-phe, were examined, as well as their impact on the conformational changes of two different AD target enzymes AChE and BChE. Materials & methods: The conformational changes were studied using molecular dynamics and structural properties using Quantum mechanics. Results & conclusions: The binding free energy (DeltaGbind) and the change in the free energy surface (FES) computed from the funnel metadynamics (FMD) simulation, both support the idea that inhibitors (-)-phe and (-)-hex have better binding activities toward enzyme AChE, and that (-)-phe is stronger in binding than the present AD drug (-)-phy.
