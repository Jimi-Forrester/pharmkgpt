28832680|a|BACKGROUND: The Chinese version of the Continuity Assessment Record and Evaluation (CARE-C) item set was developed to facilitate the assessment of post-acute care (PAC) patients in Taiwan. Considering that the length of hospital stay (LOS) has a significant effect on the total healthcare cost, determining whether the CARE-C scores could predict the LOS of PAC patients is of great interest to the PAC providers. METHODS: This prospective trial included PAC patients with stroke or central nervous system injuries. The demographic data and CARE-C scores were collected after admission and before discharge. A multivariable stepwise linear regression model was used to identify the predictors of the LOS using age, sex, tube placement status, CARE-C component scores at admission, and score differences between admission and discharge as independent variables. RESULTS: This study included 178 patients (66 women and 112 men), with a mean age of 61.9 +- 15.6 years. Indwelling urinary catheter placement status at admission (beta = 0.241, p = 0.002) was a positive predictor of the LOS, whereas age (beta = -0.189, p = 0.010), core transfer subscale score at admission (beta = -0.176, p = 0.020), and difference in continence subscale score (beta = -0.203, p = 0.008) were negative predictors of the LOS. The model explained 14% of the total variance. CONCLUSIONS: Indwelling urinary catheter placement status at admission, age, core transfer subscale score at admission, and difference in the CARE-C continence subscale score were identified as predictors of the LOS. The explanatory power of these predictors might be limited due to the regulations of Taiwan's National Health Insurance.
