35450536|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of aggregated amyloid fibers, neurodegeneration, and loss of memory. Although "Food and Drug Administration" (FDA) approved drugs are available to treat AD, drugs that target AD have limited access to the brain and cause peripheral side effects. These peripheral side effects are the results of exposure of peripheral organs to the drugs. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a very sophisticated biological barrier that allows the selective permeation of various molecules or substances. This selective permeation by the BBB is beneficial and protects the brain from unwanted and harmful substances. However, this kind of selective permeation hinders the access of therapeutic molecules to the brain. Thus, a peculiar drug delivery system (nanocarriers) is required. OBJECTIVE: Due to selective permeation of the "blood-brain barrier," nanoparticulate carriers may provide special services to deliver the drug molecules across the BBB. This review article is an attempt to present the role of different nanocarriers in the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Peer-reviewed and appropriate published articles were collected for the relevant information. RESULT: Nanoparticles not only traverse the blood-brain barrier but may also play roles in the detection of amyloid beta, diagnosis, and drug delivery. CONCLUSION: Based on published literature, it could be concluded that nano-particulate carriers may traverse the blood-brain barrier via the transcellular pathway, receptor-mediated endocytosis, transcytosis, and may enhance the bioavailability of drugs to the brain. Hence, peripheral side effects could be avoided.
