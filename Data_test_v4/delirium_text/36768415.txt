36768415|t|Alterations in Lymphocytic Metabolism-An Emerging Hallmark of MS Pathophysiology?
36768415|a|Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterised by acute inflammation and subsequent neuro-axonal degeneration resulting in progressive neurological impairment. Aberrant immune system activation in the periphery and subsequent lymphocyte migration to the CNS contribute to the pathophysiology. Recent research has identified metabolic dysfunction as an additional feature of MS. It is already well known that energy deficiency in neurons caused by impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation results in ionic imbalances that trigger degenerative pathways contributing to white and grey matter atrophy. However, metabolic dysfunction in MS appears to be more widespread than the CNS. This review focuses on recent research assessing the metabolism and mitochondrial function in peripheral immune cells of MS patients and lymphocytes isolated from murine models of MS. Emerging evidence suggests that pharmacological modulation of lymphocytic metabolism may regulate their subtype differentiation and rebalance pro- and anti-inflammatory functions. As such, further understanding of MS immunometabolism may aid the identification of novel treatments to specifically target proinflammatory immune responses.
