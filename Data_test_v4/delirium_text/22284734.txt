22284734|t|Neuroimaging of dementia with Lewy bodies.
22284734|a|Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a relative newcomer to the field of late-life dementia. Although a diversity of imaging methodologies is now available for the study of dementia, these have been applied most often to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies on DLB, although fewer, have yielded fascinating and important insights into the underlying pathophysiology of this condition and allowed clinical differentiation of DLB from other dementias. Imaging research on DLB has had significant ramifications in terms of raising the profile of DLB and helping define it as a distinctive and separate disease entity from AD.
