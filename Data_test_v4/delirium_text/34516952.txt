34516952|t|Fisetin, potential flavonoid with multifarious targets for treating neurological disorders: An updated review.
34516952|a|Neurodegenerative disorders pose a significant health burden and imprint a debilitative impact on the quality of life. Importantly, aging is intricately intertwined with the progression of these disorders, and their prevalence increases with a rise in the aging population worldwide. In recent times, fisetin emerged as one of the potential miracle molecules to address neurobehavioral and cognitive abnormalities. These effects were attributed to its actions on several macromolecules and multiple molecular mechanisms. Fisetin belongs to a class of flavonoids, which is found abundantly in several fruits and vegetables. Fisetin has manifested several health benefits in preclinical models of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Vascular dementia, and Schizophrenia. Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Huntington's disease, Stroke, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), and age-associated changes. This review aimed to evaluate the potential mechanisms and pharmacological effects of fisetin in treating several neurological diseases. This review also provides comprehensive data on up-to-date recent literature and highlights the various mechanistic pathways pertaining to fisetin's neuroprotective role.
