37562366|t|Clinical Observation of Macular Superficial Capillary Plexus and Ganglion Cell Complex in Patients with Parkinson's Disease.
37562366|a|INTRODUCTION: We investigated macular superficial capillary plexus (SCP) density and the thicknesses of the ganglion cell complex (GCC) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and correlated them. We also observed the correlations between SCP density and clinical parameters of PD patients. The retina might be a novel biomarker of PD and will be useful in the future for the early diagnosis of PD and detecting disease progression. METHODS: Seventy-four participants (38 patients with PD and 36 healthy controls) were recruited at the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University between January 2022 to June 2022 in this study. The macular SCP densities was measured by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and the GCC thickness was measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). The parameters were compared between PD patients and healthy controls. The correlation between SCP and clinical parameters was tested. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, PD patients showed reduced SCP densities in all areas of the macular region (parafovea-temporal: t=3.053, P=0.003; parafovea-superior: t=3.680, P=0.001; parafovea-nasal: t=4.643, P<0.001; parafovea-inferior: t=2.254, P=0.027; perifovea-temporal: t=3.798, P<0.001; perifovea-superior: t=3.014, P=0.004; perifovea-nasal: t=2.948, P=0.004; perifovea-inferior: t=3.337, P=0.021;). The average GCC thickness in the PD patients was significantly reduced (t=2.365, P=0.021). There were positive correlations between the average GCC thickness and the SCP densities in most of the areas of the macular regions in PD patients (parafovea-temporal: r=0.325, P=0.005; parafovea-superior: r=0.295, P=0.011; parafovea-nasal: r=0.335, P=0.003; perifovea-superior: r=0.362, P=0.002; perifovea-nasal: r=0.290, P=0.012; perifovea-inferior: r=0.333, P=0.004). We found significant correlations between SCP densities and Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scales, UPDRS III scores, and MMSE scores. No significant correlation was observed between SCP density and PD disease duration (all P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the macular superficial capillary plexus density was decreased, and the average ganglion cell complex thickness was reduced in PD patients. The correlation between SCP density damage and GCC thinning also suggested that the retinal microvascular damage may be associated with retinal structural degeneration in PD patients. OCTA and OCT may be considered objective biomarkers for detecting microvascular impairment and neuronal damage in the early stages of PD in the future.
