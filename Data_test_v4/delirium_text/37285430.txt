37285430|a|It is known that post-retrieval extinction but not extinction alone could erase fear memory. However, whether the coding pattern of original fear engrams is remodeled or inhibited remains largely unclear. We found increased reactivation of engram cells in the prelimbic cortex and basolateral amygdala during memory updating. Moreover, conditioned stimulus- and unconditioned stimulus-initiated memory updating depends on the engram cell reactivation in the prelimbic cortex and basolateral amygdala, respectively. Last, we found that memory updating causes increased overlapping between fear and extinction cells, and the original fear engram encoding was altered during memory updating. Our data provide the first evidence to show the overlapping ensembles between fear and extinction cells and the functional reorganization of original engrams underlying conditioned stimulus- and unconditioned stimulus-initiated memory updating.
