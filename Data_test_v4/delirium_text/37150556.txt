37150556|t|Agitated Geriatric Patients and Violence in the Workplace.
37150556|a|Older adults may suddenly exhibit behaviors that are viewed as noncompliant, noncooperative, and threatening. They may even lash out verbally and physically causing injury to health care staff. In addition to taking actions that prevent harm to the staff and the patient, determining what caused this behavior (dementia vs delirium or other cases) will be critical, as well as debriefing the staff after the incident.
