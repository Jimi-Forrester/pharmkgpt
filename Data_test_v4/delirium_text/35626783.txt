35626783|t|The Effects of Remifentanil and Fentanyl on Emergence Agitation in Pediatric Strabismus Surgery.
35626783|a|Emergence agitation (EA) is one of the main concerns in the field of pediatric anesthesia using sevoflurane. We investigated the effects of remifentanil and fentanyl on the incidence of EA in pediatric patients undergoing strabismus surgery. Ninety children were randomly allocated into two groups and received either remifentanil (group R: intraoperatively remifentanil 0.2 mug/kg/min) or fentanyl (group F: fentanyl 2 mug/kg at anesthetic induction) intraoperatively. After surgery, EA incidence was assessed using a four-point agitation scale and Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale in the post-anesthesia care unit. Face, leg, activity, cry, and consolability (FLACC) scores for postoperative pain were also assessed. The incidence of EA using the four-point agitation scale (scores >= 3) was similar in both groups (remifentanil group, 28.89% vs. fentanyl group, 24.44%). Similar results were obtained using the PAED scale (scores > 12), with an incidence of 33.33% in the remifentanil group and 26.67% in the fentanyl group. Differences in FLACC scores were not found to be statistically significant. A single bolus administration of fentanyl during anesthetic induction and continuous infusion of remifentanil during surgery had similar effects on the EA incidence in these pediatric patients.
