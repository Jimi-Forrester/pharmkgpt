30724072|t|Coimmunocapture and Electrochemical Quantitation of Total and Phosphorylated Amyloid-beta40 Monomers.
30724072|a|Phosphorylated proteins play important roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The most abundant constituent in AD's brain deposit is the amyloid-beta40 peptide (Abeta40). Based on it, the degree of phosphorylated Abeta40 in body fluids (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid, CSF), which is defined by the ratio of phosphorylated Abeta40 to total Abeta40 (pAbeta40/tAbeta40), is anticipated to be an index for early diagnosis of AD. The major challenge in pAbeta40/tAbeta40 detection is the large concentration difference between two Abeta40 forms in the real samples, which usually requires multichannel equipment and complicated detection process. In this paper, we revealed the unexpected close affinities of the anti-Abeta40 antibody to Abeta40 (40.2 nM-1) and to pAbeta40 (42.3 nM-1). Based on it, a convenient coimmunocapture and electrochemical quantitation of tAbeta40 and pAbeta40 was achieved on an anti-Abeta40 antibody immobilized Au electrode (anti-Abeta40/Au). Once Abeta40 and pAbeta40 were synchronously captured on the anti-Abeta40/Au electrode, the tAbeta40 levels in CSF samples were quantified with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. With the signal amplification from Cd2+/Ti4+-functionalized titanium phosphate nanospheres (Cd2+/Ti4+@TiP) which was selective conjugated to pAbeta40, concentrations of low abundant pAbeta40 as low as 1 fM were readily measured by square wave voltammetry. Our results reveal that despite the concentrations of tAbeta40 and pAbeta40 fluctuate in each individual case, the concentration ratios of pAbeta40/tAbeta40 in CSF samples from AD patients are significant larger than those from healthy donors. It demonstrates that the degree of phosphorylated Abeta40 is hopeful to be an effective index for evaluating the AD progress and improving the accuracy of clinic AD diagnosis.
