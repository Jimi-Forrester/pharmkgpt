32202560|a|Prognosis of advanced heart failure (HF) patients, often elderly, frail and with multiple comorbidities, has significantly improved due to recent advancements in interventional cardiology. A multidisciplinary approach is essential in order to better identify patients that could benefit from invasive procedures, avoiding futility. For patients with HF, the Multidimensional Prognostic Index could help the clinician in predicting not only the prognosis but also future quality of life. For cardiac surgical candidates, predictive scores should combine traditional mortality scores with geriatric parameters including nutritional status, screening of delirium, disabilities and comorbidities, in order to help the Heart Team in taking the right approach (i.e. conservative vs invasive strategies). Similarly, the indication to the implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator or to ablative procedures should consider both the complication rates and the real impact on the quality of life considering the expected net clinical benefit.In the terminal stages of HF the therapeutic target should be oriented to a palliative care approach. In this perspective, the figure of the palliativist plays a role of growing interest and should be integrated into the HF multidisciplinary team.
