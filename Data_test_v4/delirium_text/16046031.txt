16046031|t|Telomere shortening in T lymphocytes of older individuals with Down syndrome and dementia.
16046031|a|Telomere shortening has been recently correlated with Alzheimer's disease status. Therefore, we hypothesized that a possible association might exist for adults with Down syndrome (DS). Using blind, quantitative telomere protein nucleic acid FISH analyses of metaphase and interphase preparations from 18 age-matched trisomy 21 female study participants with and without dementia, we have observed increased telomere shortening in adults with DS and dementia (p < .01). From this initial study, we conclude that telomere shortening is associated with dementia in this high-risk population and suggest that additional research may show that telomere shortening may be a biological marker of dementia status.
