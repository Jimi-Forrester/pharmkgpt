38424490|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Postoperative delirium is a frequent and severe complication after cardiac surgery. Activity of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) has been discussed controversially regarding a possible role in its development. This study aimed to investigate the relevance of BChE activity as a biomarker for postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery or percutaneous valve replacement. METHODS: A total of 237 patients who received elective cardiothoracic surgery or percutaneous valve replacement at a tertiary care centre were admitted preoperatively. These patients were tested with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment investigating cognitive deficits, and assessed for postoperative delirium twice daily for three days via the 3D-CAM or the CAM-ICU, depending on their level of consciousness. BChE activity was measured at three defined time points before and after surgery. RESULTS: Postoperative delirium occurred in 39.7% of patients (n = 94). Univariate analysis showed an association of pre- and postoperative BChE activity with its occurrence (p = 0.037, p = 0.001). There was no association of postoperative delirium and the decline in BChE activity (pre- to postoperative, p = 0.327). Multivariable analysis including either preoperative or postoperative BChE activity as well as age, MoCA, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, type of surgery and intraoperative administration of red-cell concentrates was performed. Neither preoperative nor postoperative BChE activity was independently associated with the occurrence of postoperative delirium (p = 0.086, p = 0.484). Preoperative BChE activity was lower in older patients (B = -12.38 (95% CI: -21.94 to -2.83), p = 0.011), and in those with a history of stroke (B = -516.173 (95% CI: -893.927 to -138.420), p = 0.008) or alcohol abuse (B = -451.47 (95% CI: -868.38 to -34.55), p = 0.034). Lower postoperative BChE activity was independently associated with longer procedures (B = -461.90 (95% CI: -166.34 to -757.46), p = 0.002), use of cardiopulmonary bypass (B = -262.04 (95% CI: -485.68 to -38.39), p = 0.022), the number of administered red cell-concentrates (B = -40.99 (95% CI: -67.86 to -14.12), p = 0.003) and older age (B = -9.35 (95% CI: -16.04 to -2.66), p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: BChE activity is not independently associated with the occurrence of postoperative delirium. Preoperative BChE values are related to patients' morbidity and vulnerability, while postoperative activities reflect the severity, length and complications of surgery.
