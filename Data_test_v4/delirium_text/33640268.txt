33640268|t|Association of Depressive Symptoms With Postoperative Delirium and CSF Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease Among Hip Fracture Patients.
33640268|a|OBJECTIVES: While there is growing evidence of an association between depressive symptoms and postoperative delirium, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain unknown. The goal of this study was to explore the association between depression and postoperative delirium in hip fracture patients, and to examine Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology as a potential underlying mechanism linking depressive symptoms and delirium. METHODS: Patients 65 years old or older (N = 199) who were undergoing hip fracture repair and enrolled in the study "A Strategy to Reduce the Incidence of Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Patients" completed the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) preoperatively. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained during spinal anesthesia and assayed for amyloid-beta (Abeta) 40, 42, total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181. RESULTS: For every one point increase in GDS-15, there was a 13% increase in odds of postoperative delirium, adjusted for baseline cognition (MMSE), age, sex, race, education and CSF AD biomarkers (OR = 1.13, 95%CI = 1.02-1.25). Both CSF Abeta42/t-tau (beta = -1.52, 95%CI = -2.1 to -0.05) and Abeta42/p-tau181 (beta = -0.29, 95%CI = -0.48 to -0.09) were inversely associated with higher GDS-15 scores, where lower ratios indicate greater AD pathology. In an analysis to identify the strongest predictors of delirium out of 18 variables, GDS-15 had the highest classification accuracy for postoperative delirium and was a stronger predictor of delirium than both cognition and AD biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: In older adults undergoing hip fracture repair, depressive symptoms were associated with underlying AD pathology and postoperative delirium. Mild baseline depressive symptoms were the strongest predictor of postoperative delirium, and may represent a dementia prodrome.
