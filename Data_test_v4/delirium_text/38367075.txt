38367075|t|Nervous System Response to Neurotrauma: A Narrative Review of Cerebrovascular and Cellular Changes After Neurotrauma.
38367075|a|Neurotrauma is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. For instance, traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes more than 30% of all injury-related deaths in the USA annually. The underlying cause and clinical sequela vary among cases. Patients are liable to both acute and chronic changes in the nervous system after such a type of injury. Cerebrovascular disruption has the most common and serious effect in such cases because cerebrovascular autoregulation, which is one of the main determinants of cerebral perfusion pressure, can be effaced in brain injuries even in the absence of evident vascular injury. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier regulatory function may also ensue whether due to direct injury to its structure or metabolic changes. Furthermore, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) can be affected leading to sympathetic hyperactivity in many patients. On a cellular scale, the neuroinflammatory cascade medicated by the glial cells gets triggered in response to TBI. Nevertheless, cellular and molecular reactions involved in cerebrovascular repair are not fully understood yet. Most studies were done on animals with many drawbacks in interpreting results. Therefore, future studies including human subjects are necessarily needed. This review will be of relevance to clinicians and researchers interested in understanding the underlying mechanisms in neurotrauma cases and the development of proper therapies as well as those with a general interest in the neurotrauma field.
