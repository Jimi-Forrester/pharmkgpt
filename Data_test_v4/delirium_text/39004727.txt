39004727|t|Unraveling the differential mechanisms of revascularization promoted by MSCs & ECFCs from adipose tissue or umbilical cord in a murine model of critical limb-threatening ischemia.
39004727|a|BACKGROUND: Critical limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) constitutes the most severe manifestation of peripheral artery disease, usually induced by atherosclerosis. CLTI patients suffer from high risk of amputation of the lower extremities and elevated mortality rates, while they have low options for surgical revascularization due to associated comorbidities. Alternatively, cell-based therapeutic strategies represent an effective and safe approach to promote revascularization. However, the variability seen in several factors such as cell combinations or doses applied, have limited their success in clinical trials, being necessary to reach a consensus regarding the optimal "cellular-cocktail" prior further application into the clinic. To achieve so, it is essential to understand the mechanisms by which these cells exert their regenerative properties. Herein, we have evaluated, for the first time, the regenerative and vasculogenic potential of a combination of endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from adipose-tissue (AT), compared with ECFCs from umbilical cord blood (CB-ECFCs) and AT-MSCs, in a murine model of CLTI. METHODS: Balb-c nude mice (n:32) were distributed in four different groups (n:8/group): control shams, and ischemic mice (after femoral ligation) that received 50 microl of physiological serum alone or a cellular combination of AT-MSCs with either CB-ECFCs or AT-ECFCs. Follow-up of blood flow reperfusion and ischemic symptoms was carried out for 21 days, when mice were sacrificed to evaluate vascular density formation. Moreover, the long-term molecular changes in response to CLTI and both cell combinations were analyzed in a proteomic quantitative approach. RESULTS: AT-MSCs with either AT- or CB-ECFCs, promoted a significant recovery of blood flow in CLTI mice 21 days post-ischemia. Besides, they modulated the inflammatory and necrotic related processes, although the CB group presented the slowest ischemic progression along the assay. Moreover, many proteins involved in the repairing mechanisms promoted by cell treatments were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of AT-MSCs with AT-ECFCs or with CB-ECFCs promoted similar revascularization in CLTI mice, by restoring blood flow levels, together with the modulation of the inflammatory and necrotic processes, and reduction of muscle damage. The protein changes identified are representative of the molecular mechanisms involved in ECFCs and MSCs-induced revascularization (immune response, vascular repair, muscle regeneration, etc.).
