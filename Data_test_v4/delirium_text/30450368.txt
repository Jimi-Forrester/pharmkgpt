30450368|a|Hypertension and obesity are prevalent diseases in elderly people, and their combination can cause deleterious effects on physiological system. Moderate intensity aerobic training (MIAT) seems to be a beneficial approach to control and treat these diseases separately. However, few studies have investigated the impact of MIAT on cardiovascular risk factors associated with these conditions (i.e., elevated blood pressure values, blood markers, and body composition). Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the effects of MIAT on blood pressure, blood markers, and body composition in hypertensive overweight/obese elderly patients. Twenty-four hypertensive overweight/obese elderly patients were randomized into control group (CG) and training group (TG), submitted to 12 weeks of MIAT of 50 min, 3 days per week, at 60% of maximal HR (heart rate). There was a decrease in diastolic blood pressure (-10.1 +- 3.3; p = .01; effect size = 1.29) and mean arterial pressure (MAP; -8.2 +- 3.7; p = .04; effect size = 0.94) following 12 weeks of training in the TG as compared with baseline. There was an increase in triacylglycerol levels in the TG (+0.1 +- 0.0; p = .02). There were no significant changes in body composition for both groups. The present study revealed that 12 weeks of MIAT can decrease blood pressure in hypertensive obese elderly patients, with no significant modifications in blood markers and body composition.
