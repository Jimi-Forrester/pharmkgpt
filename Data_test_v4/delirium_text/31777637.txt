31777637|t|Phantom Pain Limb: A Case Report in a Soldier - Theory and Therapy.
31777637|a|BACKGROUND: Incidents in the form of unwanted things at work often occur, including civilians or officials. Like what happened during training at an Active on Duty Military Personnel (ADMP). The incident caused chronic disability and pain that we know as phantom pain limb. The frequency of "phantom pain limb" develops in individuals. Therefore, identifying the best method for treating PLP is very important. This review highlights the field of phantom pain-related investigations, focusing on PLP. CASE REPORTS: We found a case of phantom pain limb, in an Indonesia National Army or called Tentara Nasional Indonesia soldier who is still active; the OS is a referral from the neurology department. The OS was taken to the hospital because of complaints of previous leg pain and had received treatment. CONCLUSION: There are several promising therapies, pharmacology and others, for their treatment, and many theories have been developed to explain what we observe in patient amputations. However, we continue to lack clear evidence and explanation of the reasons that some individuals develop PLP, and some do not, why some pain subsides over time, and other PLPs still exist, and what molecular and biological mechanisms work.
