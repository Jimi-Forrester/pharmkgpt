37547895|t|ICU Delirium in Cardiac Patients.
37547895|a|Delirium is a prevalent complication in critically ill medical and surgical cardiac patients. It is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospitalizations, cognitive impairments, functional decline, and hospital costs. The incidence of delirium in cardiac patients varies based on the criteria used for the diagnosis, the population studied, and the type of surgery (cardiac or not cardiac). Delirium experienced when cardiac patients are in the intensive care unit (ICU) is likely preventable in most cases. While there are many protocols for recognizing and managing ICU delirium in medical and surgical cardiac patients, there is no homogeneity, nor are there established clinical guidelines. This review provides a comprehensive overview of delirium in cardiac patients and highlights its presentation, course, risk factors, pathophysiology, and management. We define cardiac ICU patients as both medical and postoperative surgical patients with cardiac disease in the ICU. We also highlight current controversies and future considerations of innovative therapies and nonpharmacological and pharmacological management interventions. Clinicians caring for critically ill patients with cardiac disease must understand the complex syndrome of ICU delirium and recognize the impact of delirium in predicting long-term outcomes for ICU patients.
