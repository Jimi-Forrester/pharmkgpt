35284732|t|a Versatile Schiff Base Chemosensor for the Determination of Trace Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ in the Water and Its Bioimaging Applications.
35284732|a|In this work, a simple and versatile Schiff base chemosensor (L) was developed for the detection of four adjacent row 4 metal ions (Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+) through colorimetric or fluorescent analyses. L could recognize the target ions in solutions containing a wide range of other cations and anions. The recognition mechanisms were verified with a Job's plot, HR-MS assays, and 1H NMR titration experiments. Then, L was employed to develop colorimetric test strips and TLC plates for Co2+. Meanwhile, L was capable of quantitatively measuring the amount of target ions in tap water and river water samples. Notably, L was used for imaging Zn2+ in HepG2 cells, zebrafish, and tumor-bearing mice, which demonstrated its potential biological applications. Therefore, L can probably serve as a versatile tool for the detection of the target metal ions in environmental and biological applications.
