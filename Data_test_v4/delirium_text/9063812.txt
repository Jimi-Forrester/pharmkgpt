9063812|t|Aromatic and branched-chain amino acid levels in alcoholics.
9063812|a|Plasma aromatic amino acid (AAA) and branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) concentrations were determined in 292 alcoholics. The BCAA/AAA molar ratio in patients with alcohol withdrawal symptoms was compared with the ratio in patients without such symptoms. The BCAA/AAA molar ratio in patients with transient hallucinations or with delirium tremens was significantly lower than that in patients without these symptoms. The BCAA/AAA molar ratio tended to be lower in patients with alcohol withdrawal seizures than in patients without such symptoms. The BCAA/AAA molar ratio had a negative correlation with plasma total bilirubin and LDH, and a positive correlation with plasma cholinesterase and albumin. These results indicate that abnormalities of amino acid metabolism caused by liver damage in alcohol dependence may have an important role in the pathogenesis of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome.
