39014305|t|Diffusion spectrum imaging in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: correlation with ventricular enlargement.
39014305|a|BACKGROUND: To investigate the association between white matter changes and ventricular expansion in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) based on diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI). METHODS: We included 32 patients with iNPH who underwent DSI using a 3T MRI scanner. The lateral ventricles were manually segmented, and ventricular volumes were measured. Two methods were utilised in the study: manual region-of-interest (ROI) delineation and tract diffusion profile analysis. General fractional anisotropy (GFA) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were extracted in different white matter regions, including the bilateral internal capsule (anterior and posterior limbs) and corpus callosum (body, genu, and splenium) with manual ROI delineation. The 18 main tracts in the brain of each patient were extracted; the diffusion metrics of 100 equidistant nodes on each fibre were calculated, and Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to determine the correlation between diffusion measures and ventricular volume of iNPH patients. RESULTS: The GFA and FA of all ROI showed no significant correlation with lateral ventricular volume. However, in the tract diffusion profile analysis, lateral ventricular volume was positively correlated with part of the cingulum bundle, left corticospinal tract, and bilateral thalamic radiation posterior, whereas it was negatively correlated with the bilateral cingulum parahippocampal (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The effect of ventricular enlargement in iNPH on some white matter fibre tracts around the ventricles was limited and polarizing, and most white matter fibre tract integrity changes were not associated with ventricular enlargement; this reflects that multiple pathological mechanisms may have been combined to cause white matter alterations in iNPH.
