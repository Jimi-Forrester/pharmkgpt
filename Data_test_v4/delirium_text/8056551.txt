8056551|a|It has been recently shown that NGF is not only involved in the survival and development of sympathetic and neural crest-derived sensory neurons, but also in some mechanisms of the immune system. For this reason, we studied the content of NGF in CSF samples from patients with diseases in which neuroimmunological mechanisms seem to be involved (multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, chronic relapsing polyradiculoneuritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and tumors of the nervous system), as well as from a number of normal control subjects. We setup an ELISA aimed at the beta subunit of NGF, obtaining good validation tests and a detection limit of 28 pg beta NGF per ml. None of the samples was found to contain detectable levels of NGF and, when a concentration method for sample enrichment was used, only one patient was NGF-positive. This suggests that NGF is probably not involved in the neuroimmunological mechanisms underlying some inflammatory and degenerative diseases of the nervous system.
