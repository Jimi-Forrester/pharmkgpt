METHODS: This study was undertaken in the Istanbul Medeniyet University Goztepe Training and Research Hospital Medical ICU. Between May 2012 and January 2013, 111 patients (53 female, 58 male; mean age, 73.79+-14.73, mean length of ICU length stay, 9.1+-10.7; prevalence of geriatric patients, 77.5%) were admitted to the ICU. The common indications for ICU admission, prevalence of mechanical ventilation support, hematological and biochemical parameters and their effects on mortality were assessed. RESULTS: The common indications for ICU admission were hemodynamic instability (48.6%), respiratory failure (27.9%) and sepsis (15.3%). Hypertension (46.8%) was the most common comorbidity. Prevalance rates of heart failure and diabetes mellitus were 32.4% and 25.2% respectively. Mortality rate was 52.3% in all patients. Approximately 80% of all deaths was observed within the first fifteen-day. In additon, mortality rate (85.7%) was prominent within patients in need of the mechanical ventilation support. Mechanical ventilation requirement, increased ferritin and vitamin B12 levels were independent risk factors for mortality in critically ill patients (p<0.01, for all). CONCLUSION: Mortality rate was higher in medical ICU. Herein, increased prevalence of geriatric population, concomitant comorbidities and mechanical ventilation requirements may play role.
