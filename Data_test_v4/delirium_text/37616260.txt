37616260|t|Discovery of novel RARalpha agonists using pharmacophore-based virtual screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation studies.
37616260|a|Nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs) are ligand-dependent transcription factors involved in various biological processes, such as embryogenesis, cell proliferation, differentiation, reproduction, and apoptosis. These receptors are regulated by retinoids, i.e., retinoic acid (RA) and its analogs, as receptor agonists. RAR agonists are promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of serious dermatological disorders, including some malignant conditions. By inducing apoptosis, they are able to inhibit the proliferation of diverse cancer cell lines. Also, RAR agonists have recently been identified as therapeutic options for some neurodegenerative diseases. These features make retinoids very attractive molecules for medical purposes. Synthetic selective RAR agonists have several advantages over endogenous ones, but they suffer poor pharmacokinetic properties. These compounds are normally lipophilic acids with unfavorable drug-like features such as poor oral bioavailability. Recently, highly selective, potent, and less toxic RAR agonists with proper lipophilicity, thus, good oral bioavailability have been developed for some therapeutic applications. In the present study, ligand and structure-based virtual screening technique was exploited to introduce some novel RARalpha agonists. Pharmacokinetic assessment was also performed in silico to suggest those compounds which have optimized drug-like features. Finally, two compounds with the best in silico pharmacological features are proposed as lead molecules for future development of RARalpha agonists.
