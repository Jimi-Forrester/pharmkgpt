38041119|t|17-year follow-up of association between telomere length and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality in individuals with metabolic syndrome: results from the NHANES database prospective cohort study.
38041119|a|BACKGROUND: The relationship between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and mortality risk in individuals with metabolic syndrome (MetS) remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the association between telomere length and long-term all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, in individuals with MetS in the United States. METHODS: A total of 1980 participants with MetS aged 18 years or older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) prospective cohort study (1999-2002) were included in this cohort study. Medical records review was used to identify the cause of deaths as of December 2018. We employed Kaplan-Meier curves, fitted curves, and Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause and CVD mortality, stratified by tertiles of LTL. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 17.75 years of participants with metabolic syndrome, 819 deaths occurred, including 231 cardiovascular deaths. After adjusting for multiple covariates, participants with shorter telomere length had a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.11-1.6) and CVD mortality (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.96-1.93) compared with those in the highest tertile of telomere length. All-cause mortality (P < 0.001) and cardiovascular disease mortality (P = 0.028) followed a similar pattern across tertiles of telomere length. CONCLUSION: In individuals with MetS, shorter telomere length is associated with increased risks of death from cardiovascular disease and all causes. The underlying mechanisms and clinical implications of these findings require additional investigation.
