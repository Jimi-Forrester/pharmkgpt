36797613|a|Alzheimer's is a chronic neurodegenerative disease where amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are formed inside the brain. It is also characterized by progressive memory loss, depression, neuroinflammation, and derangement of other neurotransmitters. Due to its complex etiopathology, current drugs have failed to completely cure the disease. Natural compounds have been investigated as an alternative therapy for their ability to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). Traditional herbs and formulations which are used in the Indian ayurvedic system are rich sources of antioxidant, anti-amyloidogenic, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory compounds. They promote quality of life by improving cognitive memory and rejuvenating brain functioning through neurogenesis. A rich knowledge base of traditional herbal plants (Turmeric, Gingko, Ashwagandha, Shankhpushpi, Giloy, Gotu kola, Garlic, Tulsi, Ginger, and Cinnamon) combined with modern science could suggest new functional leads for Alzheimer's drug discovery. In this article Ayurveda, the ancient Indian herbal medicine system based on multiple clinical and experimental, evidence have been reviewed for treating AD and improving brain functioning. This article presents a modern perspective on the herbs available in the ancient Indian medicine system as well as their possible mechanisms of action for AD treatment. The main objective of this research is to provide a systematic review of herbal drugs that are easily accessible and effective for the treatment of AD.
