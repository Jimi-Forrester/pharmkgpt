33503369|a|The commentary authors suggested removing one reference from the meta-analysis of PD and SIBO from our previously published article. We explained the reason why the mentioned study was included in the analysis. Furthermore, we provided the new result by re-meta-analyzing the PD and SIBO with the mentioned study removed and found the result was stable to the previous one.
