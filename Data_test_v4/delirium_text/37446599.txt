37446599|a|Seaweeds have gained considerable attention in recent years due to their potential health benefits and high contents of bioactive compounds. This review focuses on the exploration of seaweed's health-promoting properties, with particular emphasis on phlorotannins, a class of bioactive compounds known for their antioxidant and antidiabetic properties. Various novel and ecofriendly extraction methods, including solid-liquid extraction, ultrasound-assisted extraction, and microwave-assisted extraction are examined for their effectiveness in isolating phlorotannins. The chemical structure and isolation of phlorotannins are discussed, along with methods for their characterization, such as spectrophotometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and chromatography. Special attention is given to the antioxidant activity of phlorotannins. The inhibitory capacities of polyphenols, specifically phlorotannins from Ascophyllum nodosum against digestive enzymes, such as alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase, are explored. The results suggest that polyphenols from Ascophyllum nodosum seaweed hold significant potential as enzyme inhibitors, although the inhibitory activity may vary depending on the extraction conditions and the specific enzyme involved. In conclusion, seaweed exhibits great potential as a functional food ingredient for promoting health and preventing chronic diseases. Overall, this review aims to condense a comprehensive collection of high-yield, low-cost, and ecofriendly extraction methods for obtaining phlorotannins with remarkable antioxidant and antidiabetic capacities.
