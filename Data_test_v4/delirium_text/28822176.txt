28822176|a|Diabetes mellitus, a kind of chronic metabolic disease, has become one of major threats to human health with an increasing incidence. As a basic pathology of chronic complications related to diabetes mellitus, cerebral microangiopathy is mainly found in patients with Alzheimer's disease and lacunar infarction, and becomes one of the main reasons of death and disability in diabetic patients. The pathogenesis of cerebral microangiopathy is complicated, involving such signal pathways as metabolic abnormalities of polyol, saccharification hyperactivity, oxidative stress, abnormal transport of amyloid-beta across blood-brain barrier and protein kinase C activation. Treatment targeting at related pathogenesis may bring a new hope to prevention and delay of the occurrence and development of cerebral microangiopathy of diabetes mellitus. Currently, pathogenesis, diagnosis and therapies for cerebral microangiopathy of diabetes mellitus have become hot topics in medical studies. This article reviews pathogenesis, clinical diagnosis and treatment for cerebral microangiopathy of diabetes mellitus, in order to provide new ideas for the prevention and treatment of cerebral microangiopathy of diabetes mellitus.
