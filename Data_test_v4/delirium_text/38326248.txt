38326248|t|Study protocol for a prediction model for mild cognitive impairment in older adults with diabetes mellitus and construction of a nurse-led screening system: a prospective observational study.
38326248|a|INTRODUCTION: With an increasing number of older adults in China, the number of people with cognitive impairment is also increasing. To decrease the risk of dementia, it is necessary to timely detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is the preliminary stage of dementia. The prevalence of MCI is relatively high among older adults with diabetes mellitus (DM); however, no effective screening strategy has been designed for this population. This study will construct a nurse-led screening system to detect MCI in community-dwelling older adults with DM in a timely manner. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A total of 642 participants with DM will be recruited (n=449 for development, n=193 for validation). The participants will be divided into MCI and none-MCI groups. The candidate predictors will include demographic variables, lifestyle factors, history of diseases, physical examinations, laboratory tests and neuropsychological tests. Univariate analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression screening, and multivariate logistic regression analysis will be conducted to identify the outcome indicators. Based on the multivariate logistic regression equation, we will develop a traditional model as a comparison criterion for the machine learning models. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and calibration curve will be used to evaluate the calibration. Sensitivity, specificity, area under the curves and clinical decision curve analysis will be performed for all models. We will report the sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve and decision curve analysis of the validation dataset. A prediction model with better performance will be adopted to form the nurse-led screening system. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This prospective study has received institutional approval of the Medical Ethics Committee of Qidong Hospital of TCM (QDSZYY-LL-20220621). Study results will be disseminated through conference presentations, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and publication. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2200062855.
