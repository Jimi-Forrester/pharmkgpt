27698747|a|The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in a gastric cancer cell line treated with celecoxib. The human gastric carcinoma cell line NCI-N87 was treated with 15 microM celecoxib for 72 h (celecoxib group) and an equal volume of dimethylsulfoxide (control group), respectively. Libraries were constructed by NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep kit for Illumina. Paired-end RNA sequencing reads were aligned to a human hg19 reference genome using TopHat2. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and lncRNAs were identified using Cuffdiff. Enrichment analysis was performed using GO-function package and KEGG profile in Bioconductor. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed using STRING database and module analysis was performed using ClusterONE plugin of Cytoscape. ATP5G1, ATP5G3, COX8A, CYC1, NDUFS3, UQCRC1, UQCRC2 and UQCRFS1 were enriched in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5 and CXCL8 were enriched in the chemokine signaling and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways. ITGA3, ITGA6, ITGB4, ITGB5, ITGB6 and ITGB8 were enriched in the integrin-mediated signaling pathway. DEGs co-expressed with lnc-SCD-1:13, lnc-LRR1-1:2, lnc-PTMS-1:3, lnc-S100P-3:1, lnc-AP000974.1-1:1 and lnc-RAB3IL1-2:1 were enriched in the pathways associated with cancer, such as the basal cell carcinoma pathway in cancer. In conclusion, these DEGs and differentially expressed lncRNAs may be important in the celecoxib treatment of gastric cancer.
