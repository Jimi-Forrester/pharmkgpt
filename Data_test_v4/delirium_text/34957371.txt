34957371|a|Background: Spatial accessibility has consistently been shown to influence utilisation of care and health outcomes, compared against local population needs. We sought to identify how appropriately nursing homes (NHs) are distributed in Ireland, as its NH market lacks central planning. Methods: We used multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approaches to develop composite indices of both access (incorporating measures of availability, choice, quality and affordability) and local NH need for over 65s (relating to the proportion living alone, with cognitive disabilities or with low self-rated health, estimated scores for activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, the average number of disabilities per person and the average age of this group). Data for need were derived from census data. Results were mapped to better understand underlying geographical patterns. Results: By comparing local accessibility and need, underserved areas could be identified, which were clustered particularly in the country's northwest. Suburbs, particularly around Dublin, were by this measure relatively overserved. Conclusions: We have developed multi-dimensional indices of both accessibility to, and need for, nursing home care. This was carried out by combining granular, open data sources and elicited expert/stakeholder opinion from practitioners. Mapping these data helped to highlight clear evidence of inequitable variation in nursing home distribution.
