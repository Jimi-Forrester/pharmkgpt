30923473|t|Sleep and Attention in Alzheimer's Disease.
30923473|a|Individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) present with a wide variety of symptoms, including sleep disruption and sleep disorders. Conversely, disordered sleep has been associated with an increased risk of developing AD. Both conditions individually have adverse effects on attention, which can be further divided into selective, sustained, divided, and alternating attention. The neural mechanisms underpinning sleep problems in AD involve the disruption of the circadian system. This review comprehensively discusses the types of attention impairments, the relationship between AD pathology and sleep disruption, and the effect of sleep issues on attention in AD. Recommendations for future research include addressing the lack of consistency among study designs and outcomes, and the need to continue exploring the biology of sleep and attention in AD.
