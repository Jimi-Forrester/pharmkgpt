39501749|t|Neuroprotective properties of zinc oxide nanoparticles: therapeutic implications for Parkinson's disease.
39501749|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) significantly affects millions of people worldwide due to the progressive degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Despite extensive research efforts, effective treatments that can halt or reverse the progression of PD remain elusive. In recent years, nanotechnology has emerged as a promising new avenue for addressing this challenge, with zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) standing out for their extensive therapeutic potential. ZnO-NPs have shown remarkable promise in neuroprotection through several key mechanisms. The multifaceted properties of ZnO-NPs suggest that they could play a crucial role in intervening across various fundamental mechanisms implicated in PD. By targeting these mechanisms, ZnO-NPs offer new insights and potential strategies for managing and treating PD. This review aims to provide a thorough examination of the molecular mechanisms through which ZnO-NPs exert their neuroprotective effects. It highlights their potential as innovative therapeutic agents for PD and outlines directions for future research to explore and harness their full capabilities.
