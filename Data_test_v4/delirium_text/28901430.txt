28901430|t|Effect of early weaning on the expression of excitatory amino acid transporter 1 in the jejunum and ileum of piglets.
28901430|a|The present study aimed to compare the expression levels of excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) and growth status of piglets weaned at 10-20 days after birth with suckling piglets. A total of 40 hybrid piglets (Landrace x Large White x Duroc) born to 40 different sows, with similar body weight were selected for the present study. They were randomly divided into two groups (n=20 per group): Control group (suckling piglets) and experimental group (weaned piglets, reared in isolation). The experiment lasted for 10 days. At the end of the experiment, 12 piglets were randomly selected from each group and the jejunum and the ileum were collected in order to determine excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) expression levels and free amino acid content. The present study determined that early weaning significantly reduced EAAC1 gene and protein (57 and 73 kDa) expression levels and glutamate transporter associate protein 3-18 (GTRAP3-18; 50 kDa) in the jejunum and the ileum compared with the suckling group (P<0.05). Weaning led to an increased content of free glutamic acid (Glu) and total amino acids in the jejunum; however, content of free Glu and total amino acids in the ileum was significantly reduced (P<0.05). Early weaning reduced the expression of EAAC1 and GTRAP3-18, which was possibly due to the amino acid absorption and transport disorder in the small intestine due to the Glu deficiency.
