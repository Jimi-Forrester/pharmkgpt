35409675|t|Prognostic Factors of the Inability to Bear Self-Weight at Discharge in Patients with Fragility Femoral Neck Fracture: A 5-Year Retrospective Cohort Study in Thailand.
35409675|a|An inability to bear self-weight is one of the unfavorable results in geriatric hip fracture, which needs to be prevented. This study determines pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative prognostic factors of the inability to bear self-weight at discharge in patients with fragility femoral neck fracture. This retrospective study was conducted at Chiang Mai University (CMU) hospital with an observational cohort design. Electronic medical records of patients aged >= 50 years old with fragility femoral neck fractures between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2019 were reviewed. Pre-, intra-, and post-operative factors were collected. Ambulation status at discharge time was classified into either ability or inability to bear self-weight. Analysis of prognostic factors was done using multivariable risk ratio regression. In total, 269 patients were recruited in this study. Significantly prognostic factors of inability to bear self-weight at discharge were end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cirrhosis, cerebrovascular disease, pre-fracture ambulatory status, having associated fractures, increasing intra-operative blood loss, and having pressure sore. These prognostic factors could be used to predict patients' outcomes at discharge. Proper management could then be offered to the patients by the multidisciplinary care team to enhance surgical outcomes.
