35334937|t|Therapeutic Effects of a Novel Form of Biotin on Propionic Acid-Induced Autistic Features in Rats.
35334937|a|Magnesium biotinate (MgB) is a novel biotin complex with superior absorption and anti-inflammatory effects in the brain than D-Biotin. This study aimed to investigate the impact of different doses of MgB on social behavior deficits, learning and memory alteration, and inflammatory markers in propionic acid (PPA)-exposed rats. In this case, 35 Wistar rats (3 weeks old) were distributed into five groups: 1, Control; 2, PPA treated group; 3, PPA+MgBI (10 mg, HED); 4, PPA+MgBII (100 mg, HED); 5, PPA+MgBIII (500 mg, HED). PPA was given subcutaneously at 500 mg/kg/day for five days, followed by MgB for two weeks. PPA-exposed rats showed poor sociability and a high level of anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive impairments (p < 0.001). In a dose-dependent manner, behavioral and learning-memory disorders were significantly improved by MgB supplementation (p < 0.05). PPA decreased both the numbers and the sizes of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. However, MgB administration increased the sizes and the densities of Purkinje cells. MgB improved the brain and serum Mg, biotin, serotonin, and dopamine concentrations, as well as antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD, GPx, and GSH) (p < 0.05). In addition, MgB treatment significantly regulated the neurotoxicity-related cytokines and neurotransmission-related markers. For instance, MgB significantly decreased the expression level of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-17, CCL-3, CCL-5, and CXCL-16 in the brain, compared to the control group (p < 0.05). These data demonstrate that MgB may ameliorate dysfunctions in social behavior, learning and memory and reduce the oxidative stress and inflammation indexes of the brain in a rat model.
