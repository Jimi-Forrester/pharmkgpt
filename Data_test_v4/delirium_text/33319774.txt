33319774|a|Ketamine is increasingly being used as a therapeutic for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), yet the effects of ketamine on the human brain remain largely unknown. This pilot study employed diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to examine relationships between ketamine treatment and white matter (WM) microstructure, with the aim of increasing the current understanding of ketamine's neural mechanisms of action in humans. Longitudinal dMRI data were acquired from 13 individuals with TRD two hours prior to (pre-infusion), and four hours following (post-infusion), an intravenous ketamine infusion. Free-water imaging was employed to quantify cerebrospinal fluid-corrected mean fractional anisotropy (FA) in 15 WM bundles pre- and post-infusion. Analyses revealed that higher pre-infusion FA in the left cingulum bundle and the left superior longitudinal fasciculus was associated with greater depression symptom improvement 24 h post-ketamine. Moreover, four hours after intravenous administration of ketamine, FA rapidly increased in numerous WM bundles in the brain; this increase was significantly associated with 24 h symptom improvement in select bundles. Overall, the results of this preliminary study suggest that WM properties, as measured by dMRI, may have a potential impact on clinical improvement following ketamine. Ketamine administration additionally appears to be associated with rapid WM diffusivity changes, suggestive of rapid changes in WM microstructure. This study thus points to pre-treatment WM structure as a potential factor associated with ketamine's clinical efficacy, and to post-treatment microstructural changes as a candidate neuroimaging marker of ketamine's cellular mechanisms.
