25969670|a|BACKGROUND: Cultivation of osteoclasts is a basic tool for investigating osteolytic bone diseases. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) is the standard supplement used for in vitro cell culture medium. Typically, the serum volume fraction used for osteoclast cultivation is 10%. In this study, we investigated the use of a low serum (1% FBS) model for culturing osteoclasts. RESULTS: To confirm the validity of this model for use in osteoclast research, we compared the capacity for osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption of RANKL-induced RAW 264.7 cells cultured in medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% FBS. Osteoclasts were successfully generated in medium supplemented with 1% FBS, and exhibited prolonged longevity and similar bone resorbing ability to those generated in medium supplemented with 10% FBS, although the osteoclasts were smaller in size. Proteomics and bioinformatics analyses were performed to assess the suitability of osteoclasts formed in low serum-containing medium for use in research focusing on osteoclast differentiation and function. Our study demonstrated that a total of 100 proteins were differentially expressed in cells cultured in medium containing 1% FBS, of which 29 proteins were upregulated, and 71 proteins were downregulated. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation pathways were downregulated obviously; however, the osteoclast signaling pathway was unaffected. The data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD001935. CONCLUSION: Our study provides clear evidence of the validity of the low serum model for use in studying RANKL-dependent osteoclasts differentiation and bone resorption with the advantage of prolonged survival time.
