34291398|t|Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy and Blood-Brain Barrier Dysfunction.
34291398|a|Sepsis is a life-threatening clinical condition caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common but poorly understood neurological complication of sepsis, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. SAE clinical presentation may range from mild confusion and delirium to severe cognitive impairment and deep coma. Important mechanisms associated with SAE include excessive microglial activation, impaired endothelial barrier function, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. Endotoxemia and pro-inflammatory cytokines produced systemically during sepsis lead to microglial and brain endothelial cell activation, tight junction downregulation, and increased leukocyte recruitment. The resulting neuroinflammation and BBB dysfunction exacerbate SAE pathology and aggravate sepsis-induced brain dysfunction. In this mini-review, recent literature surrounding some of the mediators of BBB dysfunction during sepsis is summarized. Modulation of microglial activation, endothelial cell dysfunction, and the consequent prevention of BBB permeability represent relevant therapeutic targets that may significantly impact SAE outcomes.
