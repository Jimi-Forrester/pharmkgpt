39210076|a|PURPOSE: Assessing olfactory function is highly significant in clinical practice, particularly in the context of the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Recent approaches in this field emphasize the importance of reducing the time and cost devoted to olfactory testing procedures. Hence, the aim of the present study was to examine the reliability and basic characteristics of Digital Scent Device 20 (DSD-20), an innovative olfactory test consisting of 20 "universal odors", in a European population. METHODS: A total of 88 participants (mean age = 45.1, SD = 20.3) volunteered for the study. The sample consisted of 37 normosmic controls and 51 dysosmic patients. RESULTS: The correlation between DSD-20 and the total score in Sniffin' Sticks was high (TDI; R = .80, p < .001), and the test correlated with the individual components of the Sniffin' Sticks test. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient between DSD-20 test and retest was very high (R = .88, p < .001), which was additionally confirmed by a Bland-Altman plot. Essential characteristics of the DSD-20 are its simplicity in self-administration, speed of application, portability, and the fact that it can be reused. CONCLUSION: Overall, the present study confirms previous notions on DSD-20 by demonstrating its high reliability and usefulness in separating patients with hyposmia/anosmia and normosmic controls.
