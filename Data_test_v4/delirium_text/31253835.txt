31253835|a|Methamphetamine (METH) is a powerfully addictive psychostimulant that has a pronounced effect on the central nervous system (CNS). The present study aimed to assess METH toxicity in differentiated C6 astroglia-like cells through biochemical and toxicity markers with acute (1 h) and chronic (48 h) treatments. In the absence of external stimulants, cellular differentiation of neuronal morphology was achieved through reduced serum (2.5%) in the medium. The cells displayed branched neurite-like processes with extensive intercellular connections. Results indicated that acute METH treatment neither altered the cell morphology nor killed the cells, which echoed with lack of consequence on reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO) or inhibition of any cell cycle phases except induction of cytoplasmic vacuoles. On the other hand, chronic treatment at 1 mM or above destroyed the neurite-like processors and decreased the cell viability that paralleled with increased levels of ROS, lipid peroxidation and lactate, depletion in glutathione (GSH) level and inhibition at G0/G1 phase of cell cycle, leading to apoptosis. Pre-treatment of cells with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, 2.5 mM for 1 h) followed by METH co-treatment for 48 h rescued the cells completely from toxicity by decreasing ROS through increased GSH. Our results provide evidence that increased ROS and GSH depletion underlie the cytotoxic effects of METH in the cells. Since loss in neurite connections and intracellular changes can lead to psychiatric illnesses in drug users, the evidence that we show in our study suggests that these are also contributing factors for psychiatric-illnesses in METH addicts.
