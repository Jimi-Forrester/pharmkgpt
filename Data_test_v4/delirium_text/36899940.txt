36899940|t|Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Drive Lipid Peroxidation during Ferroptosis.
36899940|a|Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death that is intricately linked to cellular metabolism. In the forefront of research on ferroptosis, the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids has emerged as a key driver of oxidative damage to cellular membranes leading to cell death. Here, we review the involvement of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), lipid remodeling enzymes and lipid peroxidation in ferroptosis, highlighting studies revealing how using the multicellular model organism Caenorhabditis elegans contributes to the understanding of the roles of specific lipids and lipid mediators in ferroptosis.
