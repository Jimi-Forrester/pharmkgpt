22528108|a|Transgenic mice are used increasingly to model brain amyloidosis, mimicking the pathogenic processes involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this chapter, an in vivo strategy is described that has been successfully used to map amyloid-beta deposits in transgenic mouse models of AD with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), utilizing both the endogenous contrast induced by the plaques attributed to their iron content and by selectively enhancing the signal from amyloid-beta plaques using molecular-targeting vectors labeled with MRI contrast agents. To obtain sufficient spatial resolution for effective and sensitive mouse brain imaging, magnetic fields of 7-Tesla (T) or more are required. These are higher than the 1.5-T field strength routinely used for human brain imaging. The higher magnetic fields affect contrast agent efficiency and dictate the choice of pulse sequence parameters for in vivo MRI, all addressed in this chapter. Two-dimensional (2D) multi-slice and three-dimensional (3D) MRI acquisitions are described and their advantages and limitations are discussed. The experimental setup required for mouse brain imaging is explained in detail, including anesthesia, immobilization of the mouse's head to reduce motion artifacts, and anatomical landmarks to use for the slice alignment procedure to improve image co-registration during longitudinal studies and for subsequent matching of MRI with histology.
