36157681|t|Effect of Different Durations of Eye-Covering Pretreatment on Emergence Delirium after Ophthalmic Surgery in Preschool-Aged Children: A Randomized Controlled Study.
36157681|a|Background: Preoperative eye-covering training for 3 hours has been reported to effectively reduce the incidence of emergence delirium (ED) in preschool children. However, most children can only maintain the eye being covered for less than 60 min, and shortening eye-covering duration can also achieve similar clinical effects as long duration of eye-covering. This study was designed to compare the effects of 30-min and 60-min eye-covering pretreatment based on cartoon education only on preoperative anxiety, postoperative ED, and pain score after ophthalmic surgery with general anesthesia in preschool-aged children. Methods: Preschool-aged children (3-7 years) who were diagnosed with cataract, blepharoptosis, trichiasis, strabismus, eyelid tumor, and underwent ophthalmic surgery with general anesthesia from August 2021 to January 2022 were recruited. A total of 228 patients were randomly assigned at a 1 : 1:1 ratio to receive 30-min eye covering (30-min group), 60-min eye covering (60-min group) pretreatment, or programmed education only (C group). The preoperative anxiety, postoperative emergence delirium, and pain were compared between the groups. Results: The preoperative anxiety score, postoperative ED score, and incidence of ED in the 30-min group (n = 76) and 60-min group (n = 72) were significantly lower than those in the C group (n = 76), demonstrating a significant between-group difference (P < 0.001). However, the 30-min group and 60-min group had no significant difference in the abovementioned outcome measures (P > 0.05). Moreover, no significant difference was found in postoperative pain scores among the three groups (H = 0.274, P=0.872). Conclusion: Both 30-min and 60-min eye-covering pretreatments significantly reduce preoperative anxiety and postoperative ED after ophthalmic surgery with general anesthesia in preschool-aged children. The effects of the two groups show no intergroup difference, but the 30-min eye-covering pretreatment may be more convenient for practicing. Trial Registration. This study was registered with the No. NCT04973150.
