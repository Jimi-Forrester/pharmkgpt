33006708|t|From bedside to battlefield: intersection of ketone body mechanisms in geroscience with military resilience.
33006708|a|Ketone bodies are endogenous metabolites that are linked to multiple mechanisms of aging and resilience. They are produced by the body when glucose availability is low, including during fasting and dietary carbohydrate restriction, but also can be consumed as exogenous ketone compounds. Along with supplying energy to peripheral tissues such as brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, they increasingly are understood to have drug-like protein binding activities that regulate inflammation, epigenetics, and other cellular processes. While these energy and signaling mechanisms of ketone bodies are currently being studied in a variety of aging-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus, they may also be relevant to military service members undergoing stressors that mimic or accelerate aging pathways, particularly traumatic brain injury and muscle rehabilitation and recovery. Here we summarize the biology of ketone bodies relevant to resilience and rehabilitation, strategies for translational use of ketone bodies, and current clinical investigations in this area.
