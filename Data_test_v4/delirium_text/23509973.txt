23509973|a|Amyloid beta fibrillation can lead to major disorder of neurons processes and is associated with several neuronal diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease). We report here an importance of slight temperature changes, in the physiological range (35-42  C), on the amyloid fibrillation process in the presence and absence of hydrophilic (silica) and hydrophobic (polystyrene) nanoparticles (NPs). The results highlight the fact that slight increases in temperature can induce inhibitory and acceleratory effects of hydrophobic and hydrophilic NPs on the fibrillation process, respectively. Using further in vivo considerations, the outcomes of this study can be used for considerable modifications on the current diagnosis and treatment approaches in amyloid-involved diseases.
