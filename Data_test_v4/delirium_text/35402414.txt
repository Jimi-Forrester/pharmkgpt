35402414|t|Genetic Engineering of Microalgae for Secondary Metabolite Production: Recent Developments, Challenges, and Future Prospects.
35402414|a|Microalgae are highly diverse photosynthetic organisms with higher growth rate and simple nutritional requirements. They are evolved with an efficiency to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions, resulting in a variety of genetic diversity. Algae accounts for nearly half of global photosynthesis, which makes them a crucial player for CO2 sequestration. In addition, they have metabolic capacities to produce novel secondary metabolites of pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and industrial applications. Studies have explored the inherent metabolic capacities of microalgae with altered growth conditions for the production of primary and secondary metabolites. However, the production of the targeted metabolites at higher rates is not guaranteed just with the inherent genetic potentials. The strain improvement using genetic engineering is possible hope to overcome the conventional methods of culture condition improvements for metabolite synthesis. Although the advanced gene editing tools are available, the gene manipulation of microalgae remains relatively unexplored. Among the performed gene manipulations studies, most of them focus on primary metabolites with limited focus on secondary metabolite production. The targeted genes can be overexpressed to enhance the production of the desired metabolite or redesigning them using the synthetic biology. A mutant (KOR1) rich in carotenoid and lipid content was developed in a recent study employing mutational breeding in microalgae (Kato, Commun. Biol, 2021, 4, 450). There are lot of challenges in genetic engineering associated with large algal diversity but the numerous applications of secondary metabolites make this field of research very vital for the biotech industries. This review, summarise all the genetic engineering studies and their significance with respect to secondary metabolite production from microalgae. Further, current genetic engineering strategies, their limitations and future strategies are also discussed.
