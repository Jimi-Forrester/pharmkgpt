32896578|a|Astrocyte activation is one of the crucial hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) along with amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and neuron death. Glial scar and factors secreted from activated astrocytes have important contribution on neuronal health in AD. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of astrocyte activation both in in vitro and in vivo models of AD. In this regard, mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascades that control several fundamental and stress related cellular events, has been implicated in astrocyte activation in various neurological diseases. We checked activation of different MAPKs by western blot and immunocytochemistry and found that both JNK and p38K, but not ERK pathways are activated in Abeta-treated astrocytes in culture and in Abeta-infused rat brain cortex. Next, to investigate the downstream consequences of these two MAPKs (JNK and p38K) in Abeta-induced astrocyte activation, we individually blocked these pathways by specific inhibitors in presence and absence of Abeta and checked Abeta-induced cellular proliferation, morphological changes and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) upregulation. We found that activation of both JNK and p38K signalling cascades are involved in astrocyte proliferation evoked by Abeta, whereas only p38K pathway is implicated in morphological changes and GFAP upregulation in astrocytes exposed to Abeta. To further validate the implication of p38K pathway in Abeta-induced astrocyte activation, we also observed that transcription factor ATF2, a downstream phosphorylation substrate of p38, is phosphorylated upon Abeta treatment. Taken together, our study indicates that p38K and JNK pathways mediate astrocyte activation and both the pathways are involved in cellular proliferation but only p38K pathway contributes in morphological changes triggered by Abeta.
