34959389|t|Posiphen Reduces the Levels of Huntingtin Protein through Translation Suppression.
34959389|a|Posiphen tartrate (Posiphen) is an orally available small molecule that targets a conserved regulatory element in the mRNAs of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and alpha-synuclein (alphaSYN) and inhibits their translation. APP and alphaSYN can cause neurodegeneration when their aggregates induce neurotoxicity. Therefore, Posiphen is a promising drug candidate for neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Posiphen's safety has been demonstrated in three independent phase I clinical trials. Moreover, in a proof of concept study, Posiphen lowered neurotoxic proteins and inflammatory markers in cerebrospinal fluid of mild cognitive impaired patients. Herein we investigated whether Posiphen reduced the expression of other proteins, as assessed by stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) followed by mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, an in vitro model of neuronal function, were used for the SILAC protein profiling response. Proteins whose expression was altered by Posiphen treatment were characterized for biological functions, pathways and networks analysis. The most significantly affected pathway was the Huntington's disease signaling pathway, which, along with huntingtin (HTT) protein, was down-regulated by Posiphen in the SH-SY5Y cells. The downregulation of HTT protein by Posiphen was confirmed by quantitative Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Unchanged mRNA levels of HTT and a comparable decay rate of HTT proteins after Posiphen treatment supported the coclusion that Posiphen reduced HTT via downregulation of the translation of HTT mRNA. Meanwhile, the downregulation of APP and alphaSYN proteins by Posiphen was also confirmed. The mRNAs encoding HTT, APP and alphaSYN contain an atypical iron response element (IRE) in their 5'-untranslated regions (5'-UTRs) that bind iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), and Posiphen specifically bound this complex. Conversely, Posiphen did not bind the IRP1/IRE complex of mRNAs with canonical IREs, and the translation of these mRNAs was not affected by Posiphen. Taken together, Posiphen shows high affinity binding to the IRE/IRP1 complex of mRNAs with an atypical IRE stem loop, inducing their translation suppression, including the mRNAs of neurotoxic proteins APP, alphaSYN and HTT.
