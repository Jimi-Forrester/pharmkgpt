32480359|a|PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy and safety of suvorexant for the prevention of delirium during acute hospitalization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pubmed (1946 to December 2019) and Embase (1947 to December 2019) were queried using the search term combination: delirium, confusion, cognitive defect, encephalopathy, critically ill patient, critical illness, or hospitalization and suvorexant or orexin receptor antagonist. Studies analyzed for relevance evaluated clinical outcomes of patients treated with suvorexant for prevention of delirium. Studies appropriate to the objective were evaluated, including two randomized controlled trials and four retrospective studies. RESULTS: In acutely hospitalized patients, treatment with suvorexant 15 to 20 mg alone or in combination with ramelteon resulted in a reduction in development of delirium, time until delirium onset, and length of hospital stay. When assessed, suvorexant was well tolerated and adverse effects were no worse than placebo. CONCLUSION: Based on the reviewed literature, suvorexant has shown positive outcomes in the prevention of delirium during an acute hospitalization. Larger trials comparing the efficacy of suvorexant to other sleep modulating options are necessary to further delineate its role for the prevention of delirium.
