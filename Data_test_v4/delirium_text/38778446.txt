38778446|t|Bio-Nano Toolbox for Precision Alzheimer's Disease Gene Therapy.
38778446|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most burdensome aging-associated neurodegenerative disorder, and its treatment encounters numerous failures during drug development. Although there are newly approved in-market beta-amyloid targeting antibody solutions, pathological heterogeneity among patient populations still challenges the treatment outcome. Emerging advances in gene therapies offer opportunities for more precise personalized medicine; while, major obstacles including the pathological heterogeneity among patient populations, the puzzled mechanism for druggable target development, and the precision delivery of functional therapeutic elements across the blood-brain barrier remain and limit the use of gene therapy for central neuronal diseases. Aiming for "precision delivery" challenges, nanomedicine provides versatile platforms that may overcome the targeted delivery challenges for AD gene therapy. In this perspective, to picture a toolbox for AD gene therapy strategy development, the most recent advances from benchtop to clinics are highlighted, possibly available gene therapy targets, tools, and delivery platforms are outlined, their challenges as well as rational design elements are addressed, and perspectives in this promising research field are discussed.
