425768|t|[Induced visual hallucinations and visual adaptation disorders in patients with delirium tremens].
425768|a|In 91 cases of alcoholic delirium, acute alcoholic hallucinosis and alcoholic withdrawal conditions, a clinico-experimental study of the formation of evoked visual hallucinations was conducted with the aid of a dozed compression of the eye (a modification of Lippman's test). The following 3 stages in the development of pseudoperception are described: sensorial, hallucinoid, hallucinatory. A parallel study of visual dark adaptation (40 cases) and brain bioelectrical activity (37 patients) detected 7 pathological types of changed time of visual dark adaptation and disorders of brain bioelectrical activity. These factors are connected with conditions of sensorial disadaptation, having a clinico-diagnostic significance.
