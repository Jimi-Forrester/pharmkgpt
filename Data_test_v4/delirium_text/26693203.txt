26693203|t|Association between Plasma Leptin and Estrogen in Female Patients of Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment.
26693203|a|Increasing evidences suggested the association between leptin and cognitive functions. Estrogen is an important factor that regulates the production and metabolism of leptin. However, little is known about the relationship between leptin and estrogen in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Plasma levels of leptin, total estradiol, and beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) were measured in a total of 23 female amnestic MCI (aMCI) patients and 19 female cognitively normal controls. This study showed that female aMCI patients had lower plasma levels of leptin and higher levels of estradiol compared to female normal controls. Leptin and estradiol levels were not correlated with cognitive performances or plasma Abeta levels in either aMCI patients or normal controls. There was a significant negative correlation between leptin and estrogen in female aMCI patients (r = -0.633, p = 0.002) but not in female normal controls. The potential mechanisms of this disease-stage-specific association between leptin and estrogen need further investigations.
