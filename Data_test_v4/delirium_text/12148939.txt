12148939|a|Habit learning refers to the incremental implicit learning of associations. Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibit deficits in explicit memory and in conceptual implicit memory tasks that rely on the cortical areas damaged in AD. The authors tested patients with AD and controls on a probabilistic classification task in which participants implicitly acquire cue-outcome associations. Both groups showed evidence of learning across 50 trials, and performance did not differ significantly between the groups. In contrast, patients with AD exhibited a profound impairment in explicit memory for the testing episode. These results are consistent with the idea that habit learning relies on subcortical structures, including the basal ganglia, and is independent of the medial temporal and cortical areas damaged in AD.
