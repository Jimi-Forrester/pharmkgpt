2195164|t|Alzheimer cortical neurons containing abundant amyloid mRNA. Relationship to amyloid deposition and senile plaques.
2195164|a|Since the detailed molecular events leading to the formation of amyloid-containing senile plaques of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain are incompletely understood, the present studies were undertaken to address this issue using a combination of molecular and cytochemical approaches. Amyloid precursor protein riboprobes containing the A4 (beta-amyloid) domain were applied to cortex using the in situ hybridization method to examine the distribution of neuronal amyloid mRNA in relation to the laminar pattern of amyloid deposition and the localization of plaques. The derived data indicated that high levels of amyloid mRNA can be synthesized by AD cortical neurons that appeared to be morphologically intact. The distribution of these cells was not coincident with the cortical laminar pattern that is typical of amyloid deposits observed after immunostaining with anti-A4 monoclonal antibodies. Further, there was no obvious relationship between neurons containing abundant amyloid mRNA and the distribution of plaques identified by thioflavin S staining. While the neuronal synthesis of amyloid may be a significant factor at some point during plaque formation, it may not be the exclusive determinant. The possibility is raised that processes affecting secretion, diffusion, and/or transport of amyloid away from neuronal or non-neuronal cells of origin to sites of deposition may be meaningful aspects of the molecular pathology of Alzheimer's disease.
