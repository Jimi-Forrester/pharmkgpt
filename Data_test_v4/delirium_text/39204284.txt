39204284|a|This article deals with Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders of marine mammals as putative neuropathology and neuropathogenesis models for their human and, to some extent, their animal "counterparts" in a dual "One Health" and "Translational Medicine" perspective. Within this challenging context, special emphasis is placed upon Alzheimer's disease (AD), provided that AD-like pathological changes have been reported in the brain tissue of stranded cetacean specimens belonging to different Odontocete species. Further examples of potential comparative pathology interest are represented by viral infections and, in particular, by "Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis" (SSPE), a rare neurologic sequela in patients infected with Measles virus (MeV). Indeed, Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV)-infected striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) may also develop a "brain-only" form of CeMV infection, sharing neuropathological similarities with SSPE. Within this framework, the global threat of the A(H5N1) avian influenza virus is another major concern issue, with a severe meningoencephalitis occurring in affected pinnipeds and cetaceans, similarly to what is seen in human beings. Finally, the role of Brucella ceti-infected, neurobrucellosis-affected cetaceans as putative neuropathology and neuropathogenesis models for their human disease counterparts is also analyzed and discussed. Notwithstanding the above, much more work is needed before drawing the conclusion marine mammal CNS disorders mirror their human "analogues".
