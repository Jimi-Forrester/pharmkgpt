20856923|a|The development of amyloid-containing neuritic plaques is an invariable characteristic of Alzheimer's diseases (AD). The conversion from monomeric amyloid beta protein (Abeta) to oligomeric Abeta and finally neuritic plaques is highly dynamic. The specific Abeta species that is correlated with disease severity remains to be discovered. Oligomeric Abeta has been detected in cultured cells, rodent and human brains, as well as human cerebrospinal fluid. Synthetic, cell, and brain derived Abeta oligomers have been found to inhibit hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and this effect can be suppressed by the blockage of Abeta oligomer formation. A large body of evidence suggests that Abeta oligomers inhibit N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor dependent LTP; additional receptors have also been found to elicit downstream pathways upon binding to Abeta oligomers. Amyloid antibodies and small molecular compounds that reduce brain Abeta levels and block Abeta oligomer formation are capable of reversing synaptic dysfunction and these approaches hold a promising therapeutic potential to rescue memory disruption.
