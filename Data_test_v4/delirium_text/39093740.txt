39093740|t|Effect of epinephrine-mixed fascia iliaca compartment block on bleeding in total hip arthroplasty: A single-center retrospective study.
39093740|a|Fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) reduces opioid consumption and pain scores after total hip arthroplasty (THA), and has recently been widely applied. We investigated whether FICB could also reduce postoperative bleeding. One hundred and fifteen consecutive patients who underwent elective THA under general anesthesia over 5 months were retrospectively analyzed. They were divided into 2 groups: the FICB group received an epinephrine-mixed FICB procedure and the control group did not receive any block. Using the hematocrit measured at 4 different time points (preoperative and 1, 24, and 48 hours after surgery), the estimated blood loss (EBL) was calculated for 3 different time periods (0-1, 1-24, 24-48 hours after surgery). EBL at 1 to 24 hours (226 vs 398 mL, P = .008) was significantly lower in the FICB group than in the control group. Additionally, the number of packed red cell (PRC) units transfused per patient over 48 hours was 0.38 units in the FICB group, which was significantly lower than the 0.70 units used in the control group (P = .040). Epinephrine-mixed FICB in THA has the potential to reduce postoperative bleeding in the first 24 hours after surgery as well as reduce PRC transfusion requirements.
