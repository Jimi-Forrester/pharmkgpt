39727822|a|(1) Background: Frailty is a multifactorial syndrome that significantly impacts the functional abilities of older adults, making them more vulnerable to falls, disabilities, and dependence. Exercise can serve as an effective intervention for pre-frail and frail older adults, improving muscle strength and reducing the risk of falls. This research aims to clarify the physical exercise protocols and their outcomes for this population. (2) Methods: A scoping review was conducted to summarize the evidence on physical activity parameters for frail and pre-frail older adults. The search included primary evidence sources published in PubMed, PEDro, Biomed, Scopus, and Springer, as well as search engines like Google Scholar and Dialnet. The keywords used were ([frailty] OR [frail] AND [exercise]). The PEDro and MINORS scales were used to assess the quality of the evidence and evaluate the risk of bias. (3) Results: Eighteen studies met the eligibility criteria. The most commonly reported exercise program was multicomponent, which included aerobic activities at 70% of the maximum effort and strength exercises at 20% to 80% of the participants' maximum capacity. This approach proved effective for this population. (4) Conclusions: The studies suggest that exercise is a successful intervention strategy for addressing frailty. However, not all the articles provided adequate information regarding the dosing of their interventions.
