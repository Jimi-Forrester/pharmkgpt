2354791|a|Dementia occurs as a primary component of Senile Dementia of the Alzheimer's type (SDAT) and as a secondary component of Parkinson's Disease (PD) in a subset of PD patients. We compared caregiver distress subsequent to the unique features of these dementing illnesses. Self- and other-rated depression was compared in spousal caregivers for 23 SDAT patients, 23 PD with dementia patients, and 23 control subjects. The two caregiving groups were similar in the length of time they had been providing assistance and in caregiver distress, and both caregiver groups were more depressed than comparison subjects.
