29743682|t|Preoperative screening for illicit drug use in patients undergoing emergency surgery: A prospective observational study.
29743682|a|Knowledge of illicit drug users (IDUs) is important because of the comorbidity related to drug use. In this prospective, observational study, we screened 1007 patients undergoing emergency surgery and found that 75 of them (7.5%) were IDUs The results of preoperative screening showed that the rates of HIV and syphilis infection were significantly higher in IDUs (HIV (+) 2.6%, syphilis (+) 10.7%) than in non-IDUs (HIV (+) 0, syphilis (+) 0.5%). Intraoperative consumption of remifentanil (IDUs: 1.85 +- 1.30 vs. non-IDUs: 1.31 +- 0.86, p = 0.009), midazolam (IDUs: 4.82 +- 1.52 vs. non-IDUs: 4.15 +- 1.81, p = 0.002), and atracurium (IDUs: 31.5 +- 15.1 vs. non-IDUs: 25.5 +- 11.9, p = 0.006) and the proportion of patients requiring postoperative fentanyl (IDUs: 15 (20.0%) vs. non-IDUs: 95 (1.2%), p = 0.031) were significantly increased in IDUs compared to non-IDUs. Postoperative complications were observed in 22.7% (17/75) of patients who were IDUs, which was significantly increased when compared with non-IDUs (6.0%, 56/932, p < 0.001). The mortality rate within 30 days after surgery was similar between the two groups. These findings suggested that the IDUs were associated with increased rates of HIV and syphilis infection; greater consumption of intraoperative opioids, sedatives, and muscle relaxants; increased postoperative complications and a similar mortality rate within 30 days after surgery when compared with non-IDUs.
