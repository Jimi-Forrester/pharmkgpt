32531952|t|Induction of the Endoplasmic-Reticulum-Stress Response: MicroRNA-34a Targeting of the IRE1alpha-Branch.
32531952|a|Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the unfolded protein response (UPR). Modulating the UPR is one of the major challenges to counteract the development of neurodegenerative disorders and other diseases with affected UPR. Here, we show that miR-34a-5p directly targets the IRE1alpha branch of the UPR, including the genes BIP, IRE1alpha, and XBP1. Upon induction of ER stress in neuronal cells, miR-34a-5p overexpression impacts the resulting UPR via a significant reduction in IRE1alpha and XBP1s that in turn leads to decreased viability, increased cytotoxicity and caspase activity. The possibility to modify the UPR signaling pathway by a single miRNA that targets central genes of the IRE1alpha branch offers new perspectives for future therapeutic approaches against neurodegeneration.
