33514871|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Recent studies have revealed thiamine deficiency (TD) as a cause of delirium in cancer patients. However, the extent to which Wernicke encephalopathy is present and in what patients is not well understood. SUBJECTS/METHODS: In this retrospective descriptive study, we investigated referred cancer patients who were diagnosed with delirium by a psycho-oncologist to clarify the proportion of TD, the therapeutic effect of thiamine administration, and the factors involved in its onset. RESULTS: Among 71 patients diagnosed with delirium by a psycho-oncologist, TD was found in 45% of the patients. Intravenous administration of thiamine led to a recovery in about 60% of these patients. We explored the factors associated with TD using a multivariable regression model with a Markov chain Monte Carlo imputation procedure. We found an association between TD and chemotherapy (adjusted odds ratio, 1.98 [95% confidence interval, 1.04-3.77]); however, there were no significant associations between TD and the other factors we considered. CONCLUSIONS: TD is not particularly rare in delirium patients undergoing psychiatric consultation. The delirium was resolved in more than half of these patients by intravenous administration of thiamine. Oncologists should consider TD as a cause of delirium in cancer patients. Further prospective study is needed to clarify the relationship between TD and delirium in cancer patients.
