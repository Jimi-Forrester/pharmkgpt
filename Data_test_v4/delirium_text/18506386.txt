18506386|a|Growing evidence advanced the idea that the soluble form of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE) might serve as a risk marker for several disorders including Alzheimer disease. We found a reduced level of circulating sRAGE in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The reduction of sRAGE in MCI, as well as the anticipation of the disease in patients with the lowest sRAGE levels (<or=225 pg/ml), suggest a role of the RAGE axis in the pathogenesis of the disease.
