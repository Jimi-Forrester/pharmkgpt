22293074|t|[Development and treatment of delirium in critically ill children].
22293074|a|Delirium is a common and often under-recognised neuropsychiatric disorder in paediatric critical care, secondary to a general medical condition. Paediatric delirium (PD) is associated with high morbidity and mortality and prolonged stay at the intensive care unit. This review introduces the reader to PD and focuses on diagnostic tools, prognosis and treatment. The literature about PD is sparse. In order to make recommendations about PD based on evidence more clinical studies are urgently needed.
