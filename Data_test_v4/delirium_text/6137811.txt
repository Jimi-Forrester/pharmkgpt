6137811|a|Dementia, delirium, and depression are not part of normal aging but are organic brain syndromes that often are reversible. Thus, it is imperative that primary care physicians carefully look for a reversible cause in a patient with one of these disorders. Even an irreversible condition, such as Alzheimer's disease, can be effectively treated with drugs that are carefully chosen to minimize serious side effects. Patients with cognitive impairment deserve to be treated with dignity, and every effort should be made to maintain the highest level of function possible.
