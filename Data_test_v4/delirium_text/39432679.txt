39432679|a|In animal models, brain neurodegeneration biomarkers drain into cervical lymph nodes (CLNs), and this drainage function is reduced with ageing. If this occurred in humans, CLNs may provide a readily accessible measure of this aspect of protein clearance. We tested this hypothesis in people using ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA). We measured amyloid-beta 40 and 42, phospho-Tau-181, glial-fibrillary-acidic-protein, and neurofilament-light using single molecule array in CLN aspirates and plasma from: i) a discovery cohort of 25 autoimmune patients, and from ii) plasma, CLNs and capillary blood in four healthy volunteers, an optimisation cohort. FNA was well-tolerated by all participants. In both cohorts, all biomarkers were detected in all plasma and CLN samples, other than neurofilament-light (8/17 of discovery cohort). CLN biomarker concentrations were significantly greater than plasma concentrations for all except neurofilament-light, most markedly for phospho-Tau-181 (266-fold; P<0.02), whose CLN concentrations decreased with age (Spearman r=-0.66, P=0.001). This study presents the first evidence that neurodegenerative biomarkers are detectable in human CLNs. Raised CLN:plasma biomarker ratios suggest their concentration in CLNs may offer a distinct compartment for minimally-invasive measurement of brain clearance and lymphatic drainage, with potential applicability to study of ageing and future clinical trials.
