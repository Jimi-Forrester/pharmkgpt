30297802|t|Metallo-Curcumin-Conjugated DNA Complexes Induces Preferential Prostate Cancer Cells Cytotoxicity and Pause Growth of Bacterial Cells.
30297802|a|DNA nanotechnology can be used to create intricate DNA structures due to the ability to direct the molecular assembly of nanostructures through a bottom-up approach. Here, we propose nanocarriers composed of both synthetic and natural DNA for drug delivery. The topological, optical characteristics, and interaction studies of Cu2+/Ni2+/Zn2+-curcumin-conjugated DNA complexes were studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM), UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared and mass spectroscopy. The maximum release of metallo-curcumin conjugates from the DNA complexes, triggered by switching the pH, was found in an acidic medium. The bacterial growth curves of E. coli and B. subtilis displayed a prolonged lag phase when tested with the metallo-curcumin-conjugated DNA complexes. We also tested the in vitro cytotoxicity of the metallo-curcumin-conjugated DNA complexes to prostate cancer cells using an MTS assay, which indicated potent growth inhibition of the cells. Finally, we studied the cellular uptake of the complexes, revealing that DNA complexes with Cu2+/Ni2+-curcumin exhibited brighter fluorescence than those with Zn2+-curcumin.
