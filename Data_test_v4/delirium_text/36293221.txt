36293221|t|Rat Group IIA Secreted Phospholipase A2 Binds to Cytochrome c Oxidase and Inhibits Its Activity: A Possible Episode in the Development of Alzheimer's Disease.
36293221|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive form of dementia, is characterized by the increased expression of secreted phospholipase A2 group IIA (GIIA) in the affected tissue and the dysfunction of neuronal mitochondria, similar to that induced by an orthologous GIIA from snake venom, beta-neurotoxic ammodytoxin (Atx), in the motor neurons. To advance our knowledge about the role of GIIA in AD, we studied the effect of rat GIIA on the neuronal mitochondria and compared it with that of the Atx. We produced recombinant rat GIIA (rGIIA) and its enzymatically inactive mutant, rGIIA(D49S), and demonstrated that they interact with the subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase (CCOX-II) as Atx. rGIIA and rGIIA(D49S) bound to this essential constituent of the respiratory chain complex with an approximately 100-fold lower affinity than Atx; nevertheless, both rGIIA molecules potently inhibited the CCOX activity in the isolated rat mitochondria. Like Atx, rGIIA was able to reach the mitochondria in the PC12 cells from the extracellular space, independent of its enzymatic activity. Consistently, the inhibition of the CCOX activity in the intact PC12 cells and in the rat's brain tissue sections was clearly demonstrated using rGIIA(D49S). Our results show that the effects of mammalian and snake venom beta-neurotoxic GIIA on the neuronal mitochondria have similar molecular backgrounds. They suggest that the elevated extracellular concentration of GIIA in the AD tissue drives the translocation of this enzyme into local neurons and their mitochondria to inhibit the activity of the CCOX in the respiratory chain. Consequently, the process of oxidative phosphorylation in the neurons is attenuated, eventually leading to their degeneration. Atx was thus revealed as a valuable molecular tool for further investigations of the role of GIIA in AD.
