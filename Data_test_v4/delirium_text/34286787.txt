34286787|a|Herein, we investigated both fruits and leaves of Morus macroura Miq. as a potential source of bioactive compounds against Alzheimer's disease (AD). LC-HRMS-assisted chemical profiling of its extracts showed that they are a rich source of diverse phytochemicals. Among the 29 identified compounds in both the fruit and leaf extracts, moracin D, chrysin, resveratrol, and ferulic acid were predicted to pass the human blood-brain barrier (BBB), and hence, reach their therapeutic targets in the brain. Subsequently, these compounds were subjected to a comprehensive pharmacophore-based screening for their protein targets relevant to AD using two independent software programs (i.e. Swiss Target Prediction and PharmMapper). The results of this initial virtual screening were further refined by a number of docking and molecular dynamic simulation experiments to suggest a number of crucial AD-related proteins (e.g. acetylcholine esterase, beta-secretase, and monoamine oxidase) as potential targets for these compounds. Finally, in vitro testing was performed to validate the in silico investigation's results, where chrysin, resveratrol, and ferulic acid were found to inhibit the predicted AD-related enzymes with IC50 values comparable with those of the reference inhibitors. Additionally, they were able to inhibit the aggregation of amyloid-beta, one of the hallmarks in AD pathogenesis, and to exhibit considerable antioxidant capacity. Our results highlighted Morus macroura compounds as future anti-Alzheimer chemical leads.
