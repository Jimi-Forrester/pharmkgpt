28214529|t|Role of human GKN1 on APP processing in gastric cancer.
28214529|a|Gastrokine 1 (GKN1) is highly expressed in gastric tissue and is secreted into the stomach but is not expressed in gastric cancer. GKN1 belongs to the BRICHOS domain family and plays a major role in maintaining gastric mucosa integrity. We previously demonstrated that a recombinant human GKN1 protein was able to interact with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and was endowed with an anti-amyloidogenic property because it inhibited polymerization of the Abeta(1-40) peptide released from APP upon its partial hydrolysis. Here, we report that GKN1 can act as a physiological suppressor of Abeta production in gastric cancer cells. GKN1 blocked the access of gamma-secretase to APP, thereby facilitating the cleavage of APP by alpha- and beta-secretases. GKN1 directly interacted with APP C-terminal fragments, C83 and C99. In addition, it did not affect gamma-secretase activity in gastric cancer cells because it did not alter Notch1 processing. GKN1-mediated inhibition of APP processing might represent a new approach for the prevention and therapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
