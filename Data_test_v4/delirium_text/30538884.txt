30538884|t|The Challenges and Knowledge Gaps in Malaria Therapy: A Stakeholder Approach to Improving Oral Quinine Use in the Treatment of Childhood Malaria in Ghana.
30538884|a|BACKGROUND: The study was undertaken to elicit the knowledge, views, and perceptions of key stakeholders on malaria, its bioburden, and treatment options, in order to ascertain the knowledge gabs and challenges, especially in the use of oral quinine in childhood malaria. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a well-structured Likert Scale and self-administered questionnaire. The principal site of the study was a government-run children's hospital located in the Ashiedu Keteke Sub-Metro of Accra. The study population included health workers, parents, and guardians or care givers. The participants were 300, purposively selected, and consisted of both men (41%) and women (59%) who were twenty years and above, whether employed (42%), self-employed (37%), or unemployed (21%). RESULTS: Majority of the participants (78%) demonstrated above average knowledge of malaria. However, their awareness of the causes, modes of transmission, signs, and symptoms as well as preventive mechanisms of malaria did not result in low incidence of malaria. About 77% of the respondents agreed they would seek treatment within 24 hours once signs and symptoms are detected. Though close to 50% undertook home treatment of malaria, majority eventually sought treatment at hospital or clinic. Above 92% of respondents knew that quinine is used to treat malaria and agreed its bitter taste greatly affects compliance, especially in children. Consequently, 95% of the respondents would be glad if its bitter taste is masked. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated the availability of substantial knowledge of the devastating effects of malaria, especially in children. Therefore, there is the need to ensure the availability and utilization of effective paediatric formulations in the fight against malaria. From this study, fast dissolving oral thin film with a good mouth feel, would be the formulation of choice for quinine.
