35761833|t|On the Association between Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Extragastric Manifestations.
35761833|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and extragastric manifestations such as headache, fatigue, and dizziness. A prospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary hospital in Athens, where patients with GI problems and extragastric symptoms were treated only for their GI problems, and improvement in extragastric manifestations was recorded. Inclusion criteria were an age older than 18 years, the presence of at least one of the three extragastric symptoms investigated in this study (headache, dizziness, and fatigue), and the concomitant presence of at least one gastrointestinal symptom (e.g., nausea, belching, abdominal tenderness, epigastric pain, halitosis, flatulence, diarrhea, bad odor of flatulence, flatulence, and constipation). A standardized questionnaire was used to collect demographic data (such as age, weight, and height), patients' symptoms, laboratory findings (gastric biopsy, gastroscopy, and colonoscopy), and intensity/frequency of GI and extragastric symptoms. Statistically significant associations were found between GI symptoms (nausea, constipation, halitosis, and belching) and dizziness, fatigue, and headache (frequency, intensity, and duration). Treatment of GI problems resulted in a significant improvement in extragastric symptoms within one month of treatment initiation. It should be emphasized that the actual reason for the improvement in extragastric symptoms was solely the resolution of the GI problems, as patients did not receive specific treatments for headache, dizziness or fatigue, or other changes in daily life. This study demonstrates the association between extragastric manifestations and GI disorders.
