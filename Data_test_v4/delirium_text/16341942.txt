16341942|a|Amounts of glutamate metabolizing enzymes such as glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), glutamine synthetase (GS), GS-like protein (GSLP), and phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG) were compared in prefrontal cortex of control subjects and patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). The target proteins were quantified by ECL-Western immunoblotting in extracts from brain tissue prepared by two different techniques separating enzymes preferentially associated with cytoplasm (GDH I and II isoenzymes, GS, and partially GSLP) and membrane (GDH III, PAG, and partially GSLP) fractions. Amounts of all listed enzymes were found significantly increased in the patient group compared with controls. Some links between the measured values were observed in the control, but not in the AD patient group. The results may suggest for the pathological interruption of regulatory relations between distinct enzymes of glutamate metabolism in brain of AD patients.
