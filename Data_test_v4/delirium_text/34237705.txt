34237705|a|We evaluated the association of metabolic health and obesity phenotypes with the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study enrolled 136,847 elderly participants aged 60 or above from the Korean National Health Insurance System. At baseline examinations in 2009 and 2010, subjects were categorized into four groups: the metabolically healthy non-obese (MHNO), metabolically healthy obese (MHO), metabolically unhealthy non-obese (MUNO), and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO) groups. Based on the phenotypic transition after 2 years, the subjects were further categorized into 16 subgroups. They were followed from 2009 to 2015 to monitor for AD development. The MHO phenotype protected subjects from AD, relative to the MHNO phenotype (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.65-0.81). Among subjects initially classified as MHO, 41.8% remained MHO, with a significantly lower risk of AD compared with the stable MHNO group (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.50-0.77). Among MUO subjects at baseline, those who changed phenotype to MUNO were at higher risk of AD (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.28-1.70), and the transition to the MHO phenotype protected subjects from AD (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.50-0.78). The MHO phenotype conferred a decreased risk of AD. Maintenance or recovery of metabolic health might mitigate AD risk among obese individuals.
