39062777|a|Aging is a multifaceted process influenced by hereditary factors, lifestyle, and environmental elements. As time progresses, the human body experiences degenerative changes in major functions. The external and internal signs of aging manifest in various ways, including skin dryness, wrinkles, musculoskeletal disorders, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer. Additionally, cancer, like aging, is a complex disease that arises from the accumulation of various genetic and epigenetic alterations. Circadian clock dysregulation has recently been identified as an important risk factor for aging and cancer development. Natural compounds and herbal medicines have gained significant attention for their potential in preventing age-related diseases and inhibiting cancer progression. These compounds demonstrate antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, anti-metastatic, and anti-angiogenic effects as well as circadian clock regulation. This review explores age-related diseases, cancers, and the potential of specific natural compounds in targeting the key features of these conditions.
