The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of purple grape juice consumption with or without high-fat diet in the gestational and lactation period on acetylcholinesterase activity and oxidative stress parameters in the hippocampus of female descendants. During pregnancy and lactation, 40 female Wistar rats received a control diet or a high-fat diet, with half of them receiving grape juice. After lactation, the female descendants received water and control diet in ad libitum until euthanasia on the 120 postnatal day. Hippocampus from were removed for analysis of AChE activity, protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation. It was observed that high-fat diet consumption during the pregnancy increased the AChE activity and the grape juice reduced this activity in descendants. The same was observed in protein oxidation, the descendants from high-fat diet had significantly highest values, and grape juice decreased the levels. We conclude that dietary choices during pregnancy can alter the acetylcholinesterase levels and grape juice is an important alternative to improve this function in adulthood.
