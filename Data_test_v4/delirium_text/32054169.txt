The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of GABA and/or PIP treatment on the gene expression pattern of a pig kidney epithelial cell line. METHODS: LLCPK1 cells were treated with GABA, PIP, or both, and then the gene expression pattern was analyzed using microarray. Gene ontology analysis was done using GeneOntology (Geneontology.org), and validation was performed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Gene ontology enrichment analysis was used to identify key pathway(s) of genes whose expression levels were regulated by these treatments. Microarray results showed that GABA had a positive effect on the transcription of genes related to regulation of erythrocyte differentiation and that GABA and PIP in combination had a synergistic effect on genes related to immune systems and processes. Furthermore, we found that effects of GABA and/or PIP on these selected genes were controlled by JNK/p38 MAPK pathway. CONCLUSION: These results can improve our understanding of mechanisms involved in the effect of GABA and/or PIP treatment on pig kidney epithelial cells. They can also help us evaluate their potential as a clinical diagnosis and treatment.
