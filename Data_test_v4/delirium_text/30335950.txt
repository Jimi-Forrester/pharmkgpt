30335950|a|The fibrillogenesis of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) is considered a crucial factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hence, inhibiting Abeta fibrillogenesis is regarded as the primary therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of AD. However, the development of effective inhibitors against Abeta fibrillogenesis has faced significant challenges. Previous studies have shown that pristine single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) can inhibit fibrillogenesis of some amyloid proteins. However, the poor dispersibility of SWNTs in an aqueous environment greatly hinders their inhibitory efficacy. Here, we examined the inhibitory activity of hydroxylated SWNTs (SWNT-OH) on the aggregation and cytotoxicity of Abeta42 using thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, atomic force microscopy (AFM), cellular viability assays, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. ThT and AFM results showed that SWNT-OH inhibits Abeta42 fibrillogenesis and disaggregates preformed amyloid fibrils in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the ratio of hydroxyl groups in SWNT-OH is crucial for their effect against Abeta42 aggregation. SWNT-OH exerted cytoprotective effects against Abeta42 fibrillation-induced cytotoxicity. The results of free-energy decomposition studies based on MD simulations revealed that nonpolar interactions, and especially van der Waals forces, contributed most of the free energy of binding in the SWNT-OH-Abeta complex. Two regions of the Abeta pentamer were identified to interact with SWNT-OH, spanning H13-Q15 and V36-G38. The findings presented here will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the inhibitory effect of hydroxylated nanoparticles against Abeta fibrillogenesis, which is critical for the search for more effective agents that can counteract amyloid-mediated pathologies.
