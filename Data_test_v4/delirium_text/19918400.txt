19918400|t|Catatonic syndrome associated with lead intoxication: a case report.
19918400|a|INTRODUCTION: Little is known about catatonia associated with lead intoxication. CASE PRESENTATION: A retired printing house worker man presented with one week history of refusal to eat and mutism. He was treated with possible diagnosis of catatonia with administration of Lorazepam 3 mg P.O. daily. Significant improvement occurred after 48 hours. In further examinations, there was no evidence of physical and mental disorders while impairment in neuropsychiatry test, identification of Dohle body, basophilic stippling and toxic granulation in peripheral blood smear and blood lead level of 12.8 mug/dl were recorded. CONCLUSION: Possibly, lead intoxication results in changes in neurotransmitter system that leads to catatonia. Lorazepam improves patient's condition through changes in this system.
