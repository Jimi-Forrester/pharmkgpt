39788872|a|BACKGROUND: The harm-benefit balance for early out-of-bed mobilisation of patients with severe acquired brain injury (ABI) in neurointensive care units (neuro-ICUs) is unclear, and there are no clinical guidelines. This study aimed to survey the current clinical practice and perceptions among clinicians involved in first out-of-bed mobilisation in Scandinavian neuro-ICUs. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, anonymous, web-based survey; the reporting follows the recommended CROSS checklist. Clinicians involved in the first out-of-bed mobilisation in all 14 Scandinavian neuro-ICUs were eligible to participate. The questionnaire was distributed to local contact persons. Respondents were asked about their clinical practice regarding the first out-of-bed mobilisation, and perceived harms and benefits of early mobilisation. RESULTS: One hundred eighty clinicians (53% nurses, 31% physicians, and 14% therapists) completed the questionnaire. Eighty-one percent indicated that more than half of patients underwent their first out-of-bed mobilisation in the neuro-ICU. More respondents from Denmark than the remaining countries indicated that both physicians, nurses and physiotherapists contributed to the decision on when to mobilise. Intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, sedation, presence of vasospasm and arterial blood pressure were the most used safety clinical indicators for deciding about mobilisation. Clinicians stated several positive effects of mobilisation, for example, improved bowel movements, level of consciousness, motor function, and reduced risk of pneumonia, contractures, delirium, and deep vein thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Mobilisation out of bed is frequently performed in patients with severe ABI in Scandinavian neuro-ICUs. The perceived clinical safety indicators for mobilisation were ICP, CPP, level of sedation, presence of vasospasms, and ABP.
