31243240|t|Decrease in Butyrylcholinesterase Accompanied by Intermediate-like Syndrome after Massive Ingestion of a Glyphosate-surfactant.
31243240|a|An 86-year-old woman intentionally drank approximately 300 mL of a glyphosate-surfactant. She was found with consciousness disturbance and experienced several vomiting episodes. On arrival, serum biochemistry revealed a decreased level of butyrylcholinesterase (B-CHE) [11 (normal range: 180-450) IU/L]. Later, her B-CHE level further decreased to single-digit values, and she became comatose with involuntary movement and an increase in muscle tone. Her consciousness level and muscle tone improved with the recovery of her B-CHE level. Physicians should be alert for the occurrence of intermediate syndrome when the B-CHE levels of patients who have consumed a massive amount of glyphosate-surfactant show a prolonged decrease.
