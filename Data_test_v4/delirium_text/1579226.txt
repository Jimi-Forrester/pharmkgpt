1579226|t|The middle latency auditory evoked potential may be abnormal in dementia.
1579226|a|The P1 potential (50 msec) of the middle latency auditory evoked potential was lacking in 12 of 31 (39%) patients with probable Alzheimer's disease and seven of 12 (58%) demented patients with Parkinson's disease. Component P1 was not present in one normal control subject and one nondemented Parkinson's disease patient. Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that abnormalities of P1 in dementia may be due to cholinergic dysfunction.
