39324394|a|BACKGROUND: Very late-onset psychosis (VLOP) is associated with higher rates of dementia but the proportion who develop dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is unknown. We aimed to identify individuals with VLOP who develop dementia and DLB and characterize the risk factors for progression. METHODS: Anonymized data were retrieved from electronic records for individuals with VLOP. Patients developing dementia after psychosis were identified, in addition to those with >2 core features of DLB at the time of dementia or DLB identified by a natural language processing application (NLP-DLB). Demographic factors, Health of the National Outcome Scale (HoNOS) and symptoms at index psychosis were explored as predictors of progression to dementia. RESULTS: In 1425 patients with VLOP over 4.29 years (mean) follow up, 197 (13.8%) received a subsequent diagnosis of dementia. Of these, 24.4% (n = 48) had >2 core features of DLB and 6% (n = 12) had NLP-DLB. In cox proportional hazard models, older age and cognitive impairment at the time of psychosis were associated with increased risk of incident dementia. Visual hallucinations and 2+ core features of DLB at index psychosis were associated with increased risk of dementia with 2+ symptoms of DLB but not all-cause dementia. Two or more core features of DLB at index psychosis were associated with 81% specificity and 67% sensitivity for incident NLP-DLB. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with VLOP who develop dementia, core features of DLB are common. Visual hallucinations or two core features of DLB in VLOP should prompt clinicians to consider DLB and support further investigation.
