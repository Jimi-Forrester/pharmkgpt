36769717|t|Relationship between Middle Cerebral Artery Pulsatility Index and Delayed Neurocognitive Recovery in Patients undergoing Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy.
36769717|a|A steep Trendelenburg (ST) position combined with pneumoperitoneum may cause alterations in cerebral blood flow with the possible occurrence of postoperative cognitive disorders. No studies have yet investigated if these alterations may be associated with the occurrence of postoperative cognitive disorders. The aim of the study was to evaluate the association between an increased middle cerebral artery pulsatility index (Pi), measured by transcranial doppler (TCD) 1 h after ST combined with pneumoperitoneum, and delayed neurocognitive recovery (dNCR) in 60 elderly patients undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP). Inclusion criteria were: >=65 years; ASA class II-III; Mini-Mental Examination score > 23. Exclusion criteria were: neurological or psychiatric pathologies; any conditions that could interfere with test performance; severe hypertension or vascular diseases; alcohol or substance abuse; chronic pain; and an inability to understand Italian. dNCR was evaluated via neuropsychological test battery before and after surgery. Anesthesia protocol and monitoring were standardized. The middle cerebral artery Pi was measured by TCD, through the trans-temporal window and using a 2.5 MHz ultrasound probe at specific time points before and during surgery. In total, 20 patients experiencing dNCR showed a significantly higher Pi after 1 h from ST compared with patients without dNCR (1.10 (1.0-1.19 95% CI) vs. 0.87 (0.80-0.93 95% CI); p = 0.003). These results support a great vulnerability of the cerebral circulation to combined ST and pneumoperitoneum in patients who developed dNCR. TCD could be used as an intraoperative tool to prevent the occurrence of dNCR in patients undergoing RALP.
