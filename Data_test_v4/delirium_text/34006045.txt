34006045|a|INTRODUCTION: The Bronx is a borough of New York City that has been profoundly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Limited reports exist discussing the anaesthetic management of obstetric patients infected with COVID-19. We review a cohort of obstetric patients in the Bronx with COVID-19 and report their delivery data, anaesthetic management, and maternal-fetal outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed 92 pregnant patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who delivered between 1 February 2020 and 1 May 2020. Medical records were reviewed for patient characteristics, anaesthetic management, and clinical outcomes. Patients were stratified by mode of delivery and COVID-19 disease severity. RESULTS: Of the 92 deliveries, 49 (53%) were vaginal, 14 (15%) were scheduled caesareans, and 29 (32%) were unscheduled caesareans. 64 patients (70%) were asymptomatic for COVID-19 (mild disease: 18 patients [19%], moderate disease: 7 patients [8%], severe disease: 2 patients [2%], critical disease: 1 patient [1%]). 83 patients (90%) received neuraxial analgesia and/or anaesthesia, with combined spinal-epidural (CSE) and dural puncture epidural (DPE) as the most common techniques. 5 patients (5%) required general anaesthesia (GA) for caesarean delivery, 3 (3%) of whom were intubated for severe or critical COVID-19 disease. CONCLUSIONS: Given the risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 aerosol transmission, GA was avoided in all but the most critically ill patients. CSE and DPE were optimal for minimizing catheter failure rates and risk of conversion to GA. SARS-CoV-2 infection in obstetric patients may be associated with an increased risk for adverse outcomes including preeclampsia, preterm delivery, unscheduled caesarean delivery, and mechanical ventilation.
