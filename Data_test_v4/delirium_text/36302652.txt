36302652|t|lncRNA Malat1 and miR-26 cooperate in the regulation of neuronal progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation.
36302652|a|Neurogenesis is a finely tuned process, which depends on the balanced execution of expression programs that regulate cellular differentiation and proliferation. Different molecular players ranging from transcription factors to chromatin modulators control these programs. Adding to the complexity, also non-coding (nc)RNAs take part in this process. Here we analyzed the function of the long non-coding (lnc)RNA Malat1 during neural embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. We find that deletion of Malat1 leads to inhibition of proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Interestingly, this co-insides with an increase in the expression of miR-26 family members miR-26a and miR-26b in differentiating ESCs. Inactivation of miR-26a/b rescues the proliferative phenotype of Malat1 knockout (KO) cells and leads to accelerated neuronal differentiation of compound Malat1KO/mir-26KO ESCs. Together our work identifies a so far unknown interaction between Malat1 and miR-26 in the regulation of NPC proliferation and neuronal differentiation.
