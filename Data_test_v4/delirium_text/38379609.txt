38379609|t|Renal rescue after inadvertent coverage during endovascular aneurysm repair.
38379609|a|Inadvertent renal artery obstruction during endovascular aortic repair is a rare but serious complication. In such cases, endovascular recanalization is typically attempted; however, it can be challenging, leading to many severe cases. Moreover, if treatment is delayed, the blockage time of the renal artery poses a problem. We encountered a case of inadvertent renal artery occlusion during endovascular aortic repair. In this case, bailout stent implantation through a gap between the aortic wall and a stent graft made by a balloon catheter was effective in reducing the renal ischemia time and facilitating the revascularization procedure.
