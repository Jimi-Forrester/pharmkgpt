33769638|t|Abnormalities of intrinsic brain activity in essential tremor: A meta-analysis of resting-state functional imaging.
33769638|a|Neuroimaging studies using a variety of techniques have demonstrated abnormal patterns of spontaneous brain activity in patients with essential tremor (ET). However, the findings are variable and inconsistent, hindering understanding of underlying neuropathology. We conducted a meta-analysis of whole-brain resting-state functional neuroimaging studies in ET compared to healthy controls (HC), using anisotropic effect-size seed-based d mapping, to identify the most consistent brain activity alterations and their relation to clinical features. After systematic literature search, we included 13 studies reporting 14 comparisons, describing 286 ET patients and 254 HC. Subgroup analyses were conducted considering medication status, head tremor status, and methodological factors. Brain activity in ET is altered not only in the cerebellum and cerebral motor cortex, but also in nonmotor cortical regions including prefrontal cortex and insula. Most of the results remained unchanged in subgroup analyses of patients with head tremor, medication-naive patients, studies with statistical threshold correction, and the large subgroup of studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging. These findings not only show consistent and robust abnormalities in specific brain regions but also provide new information on the biology of patient heterogeneity, and thus help to elucidate the pathophysiology of ET.
