9577669|a|Lewy body disease (LBD) is a progressive neurological disorder with parkinsonism, having many Lewy bodies (LBs) and degenerative changes. LBD is classified into the three types according to the distribution of LBs: "brain-stem type", "transitional type" and "diffuse type". The brain-stem type is identical to classical Parkinson's disease (PD). The diffuse type is nominated as "diffuse Lewy body disease" (DLBD). DLBD is a neuropathological entity, characterized by abundant LBs not only in the basal ganglia and brain-stem but in the cerebral cortex, combined with senile changes. Juvenile onset DLBD is called "pure form" of DLBD because of no or few senile changes. The LBs are present in the amygdala, nucleus basalis of Meynert, hypothalamic nuclei, substantia nigra, nucleus paranigralis, locus caeruleus, dorsal vagal nucleus and reticular nuclei. The cerebral LBs are numerous in the parahippocampal gyrus, cingular gyrus, and insular, frontal and temporal cortices. The LBs show immunoreactivity to ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-immunoreactive neurites in the CA2-3 region appear to be specific for DLBD. The clinical features of DLBD in the senium are progressive dementia, psychotic state, parkinsonism and autonomic signs. In general, progressive dementia is an initial symptom, followed by parkinsonism in the later stage. Some show progressive autonomic failure. A few present respiratory failure or vocal cord palsy resulting in sudden death in DLBD. DLBD is characterized neurochemically by severe affection of multiple neurotransmitters networks. In DLBD an impairment of the innominato-cortical cholinergic and mesocortical dopaminergic system, differentiating from Alzheimer's disease and PD, may play an important role in developing disease process.
