39603509|a|The clinical manifestations of Parkinson's Disease (PD) are driven by aggregation of alpha-Synuclein (alpha-Syn) in the brain. However, there is increasing evidence that PD may be initiated in the gut and thence spread to the brain, e.g. via the vagus nerve. Many studies link PD to changes in the gut microbiome, and bacterial amyloid has been shown to stimulate alpha-syn aggregation. Yet we are not aware of any studies reporting on a direct connection between microbiome components and alpha-Syn aggregation. Here we report that soluble extract from the gut microbiome of the rats, particularly young rats transgenic for PD, show a remarkably strong ability to inhibit in vitro alpha-Syn aggregation and keep it natively unfolded and monomeric. The active component(s) are heat-labile molecule(s) of around 30-100 kDa size which are neither nucleic acid nor lipid. Proteomic analysis identified several proteins whose concentrations in different rat samples correlated with the samples' anti-inhibitory activity, while a subsequent pulldown assay linked the protein chaperone DnaK with the inhibitory activity of young rat's microbiome, confirmed in subsequent in vitro assays. Remarkably, the microbiome extracts also protected neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and zebrafish embryos against alpha-Syn toxicity. Our study sheds new light on the gut microbiome as a potential source of protection against PD and opens up for new microbiome-based therapeutic strategies.
