9092214|a|According to the latest research the therapy of dementia includes following strategies: Above all there is a necessity for thoroughly diagnostic tests to exclude diseases which secondary induce reduced brain function. The early onset of non pharmacological treatments e.g. "brain-jogging" is essential. Pharmacological therapy with nootropics (e.g. Codergocrin, Nicergolin, Ginkgo biloba, Piracetam, Pyritinol, Naftidrofuryl) is recommended as early as possible, because they have no relevant side effects. Calcium antagonists may also be administered because of their neuroprotective properties. One pharmacological approach to enhance cholinergic functions involves inhibiting ACH-degradation by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. Although this relatively new therapy has benefits, in some patients it has not been effective and has a potential to cause serious adverse (hepatic) events; only mild to medium severe dementias of Alzheimer's disease should be treated with this therapeutic principle. In the case of personality disorders there are psychotherapy and the administration of psychoactive drugs necessary.
