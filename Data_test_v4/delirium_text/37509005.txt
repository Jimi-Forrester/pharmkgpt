37509005|t|Mood Symptoms and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Due to Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Are Associated with Immune Activation and Aberrations in the Erythron.
37509005|a|BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune and neuroinflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by peripheral activation of immune-inflammatory pathways which culminate in neurotoxicity causing demyelination of central neurons. Nonetheless, the pathophysiology of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS)-related chronic fatigue, depression, anxiety, cognitive impairments, and autonomic disturbances is not well understood. OBJECTIVES: The current study aims to delineate whether the remitted phase of RRMS is accompanied by activated immune-inflammatory pathways and if the latter, coupled with erythron variables, explain the chronic fatigue and mood symptoms due to RRMS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We recruited 63 MS patients, 55 in the remitted phase of RRMS and 8 with secondary progressive MS, and 30 healthy controls and assessed erythron variables, and used a bio-plex assay to measure 27 serum cytokines. RESULTS: A significant proportion of the MS patients (46%) displayed activation of the immune-inflammatory response (IRS) and compensatory immune response (CIRS) systems, and T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cytokine profiles. Remitted RRMS patients showed increased chronic fatigue, depression, anxiety, physiosomatic, autonomic, and insomnia scores, which could partly be explained by M1 macrophage, Th1, Th-17, growth factor, and CIRS activation, as well as aberrations in the erythron including lowered hematocrit and hemoglobin levels. CONCLUSIONS: Around 50% of remitted RRMS patients show activation of immune-inflammatory pathways in association with mood and chronic-fatigue-like symptoms. IRS and CIRS activation as well as the aberrations in the erythron are new drug targets to treat chronic fatigue and affective symptoms due to MS.
