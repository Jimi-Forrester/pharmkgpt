39064242|a|Dementia is a highly prevalent condition with devastating clinical and socioeconomic sequela. It is expected to triple in prevalence by 2050. No treatment is currently known to be effective. Symptomatic late-onset dementia and predementia (SLODP) affects 95% of patients with the syndrome. In contrast to trials of pharmacological prevention, no treatment is suggested to remediate or cure these symptomatic patients. SLODP but not young onset dementia is intensely associated with multimorbidity (MUM), including brain-perturbating conditions (BPCs). Recent studies showed that MUM/BPCs have a major role in the pathogenesis of SLODP. Fortunately, most MUM/BPCs are medically treatable, and thus, their treatment may modify and improve SLODP, relieving suffering and reducing its clinical and socioeconomic threats. Regrettably, the complex system features of SLODP impede the diagnosis and treatment of the potentially remediable conditions (PRCs) associated with them, mainly due to failure of pattern recognition and a flawed diagnostic workup. We suggest incorporating two SLODP-specific conceptual themes into the diagnostic workup: MUM/BPC and multilevel phenomenological themes. By doing so, we were able to improve the diagnostic accuracy of SLODP components and optimize detecting and favorably treating PRCs. These revolutionary concepts and their implications for remediability and other parameters are discussed in the paper.
