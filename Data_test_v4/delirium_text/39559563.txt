39559563|a|Introduction: Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSDs) are a group of highly prevalent symptoms in residents with a neurocognitive disorder, including agitation and depressive symptoms. Caregiving staff often mention knowledge and skills deficits regarding optimal BPSD management. While several staff training on BPSDs management exist internationally, their transferability to other clinical contexts is limited, owing to methodological challenges. Therefore, to address this implementation gap, there is a strong need for training based on high-quality research to strengthen existing evidence, and ensure feasibility and reproducibility. Methods: This qualitative study, part of a larger research project, occurred in 2022 on long-term care (LTC) centre unit and an alternate level of care (ALC) hospital unit located in the Province of Quebec, Canada. This study aimed to (1) evaluate the needs and perceptions of staff caregivers regarding BPSD management, (2) identify the training content and modalities to prioritize according to experts, (3) develop intradisciplinary training on BPSD management, and (4) pretest the preliminary version of the training. Objectives one and two were evaluated using focus groups and objective four using individual cognitive interviews. Qualitative interview data was audio-recorded with participants' consent, transcribed verbatim, and thematically content analysed using an established method. Results: Overall, thirteen caregivers participated in objective one (8 from the LTC unit, and 6 from the ALC unit). The main staff training need identified on each site was the management of resident's aggressive behaviours. Staff verbalized a preference for virtual training. Objective 2 involved a panel of eight experts. Experts recommended the use of an online training platform, and certain training models and indicators. Based on caregivers' and experts' input, five interactive online staff training capsules lasting from 20 to 25 min each and an algorithm guiding the evaluation and management of BPSDs were created. The training capsules and the algorithm were iteratively improved following cognitive interviews with 4 caregivers from the participating sites. Conclusion: An interactive virtual staff training on BPSD management was created based on staff and expert consultation. The next step in the investigation will be to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the training.
