37860615|a|Background: Periodontal disease is often caused by bacterial plaque. However, there are indications that some infective agents, including parasites, may play important roles in the pathogenesis of the disease. Aim: This study aimed at assessing the prevalence of gingivitis and periodontitis, as well as the prevalence of Entamoeba gingivalis and Trichomonas tenax, in the oral biofilm of individuals with periodontal diseases using polymerase chain reaction. Materials and Methods: One hundred and six respondents with periodontal disease participated in the study. All study participants had a full-mouth examination, and dental plaque samples were collected with a sterile curette. Samples were transported to the laboratory in a cold chain and stored frozen till analyzed. DNA was extracted from the samples and amplified using EGO and ENTAM primers for Entamoeba and TGBK primers for T. tenax. Results: The mean age of respondents was 45 +- 16.3 years, with none using tobacco. The prevalence of gingivitis and periodontitis obtained from this study was 84.9% and 15.1%. The prevalence obtained for Entamoeba and T. tenax was 0.9% each; however, no participant had both parasites. The positive samples were from male participants with moderate gingivitis. Conclusion: Gingivitis was more prevalent than periodontitis, though with a high preponderance in females. E. gingivalis and T. tenax may not be of etiologic importance in periodontal disease as they occurred sparsely in the studied population.
