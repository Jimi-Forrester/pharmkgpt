37496671|a|Ischemic stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, and there are limited effective treatment strategies. QHRD106, a polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-modified long-acting tissue kallikrein preparation, has not been reported previously. In this study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of QHRD106 in ischemic stroke and its possible mechanism. We found that QHRD106 treatment alleviated brain injury after stroke via bradykinin (BK) receptor B2 (B2R) instead of BK receptor B1 (B1R). Mechanistically, QHRD106 reduced high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)-induced apoptosis and inflammation after ischemic stroke in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, we confirmed that QHRD106 reduced the level of acetylated HMGB1 and reduced the binding between heat shock protein 90 alpha family class A member 1 (HSP90AA1) and HMGB1, thus inhibiting the translocation and release of HMGB1. In summary, these findings indicate that QHRD106 treatment has therapeutic potential for cerebral ischemic stroke.
