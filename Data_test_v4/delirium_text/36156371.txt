36156371|a|Ferroptosis is a new type of programmed cell death that has excellent anti-tumor potential in different tumors. However, the research on ferroptosis in glioma is still incomplete. In this study, we aimed to revealed the relationship between ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) and glioma. We collected gene expression profiles of glioma patients from the TCGA and CGGA databases. All glioma samples were classified into five subtypes using the R software ConsensusClusterPlus. Subsequently, we performed single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) to explore the correlation between different subtypes and immune status and ferroptosis. Then co-expression modules were constructed via weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). A Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was conducted to analyze the potential biological functions of the genes in the modules. Finally, we identified 10 hub genes using the PPI network. The in vitro experiments were used to validate our predictions. We found that the expression level of IRF2 is positively correlated with the grade of glioma. The overexpression of IRF2 could protect glioma cells from ferroptosis and enhance the invasive and migratory abilities. Silence of IRF2 had the opposite effect. In conclusion, we demonstrated a novel ferroptosis-related signature for predicting prognosis, and IRF2 could be a potential biomarker for diagnosis and treatment in glioma.
