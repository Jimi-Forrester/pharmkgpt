35768624|t|Bioflocculant produced by Bacillus velezensis and its potential application in brewery wastewater treatment.
35768624|a|This study was designed to evaluate the potential of bioflocculant producing strains isolated from wastewater sludge. According to the Plackett-Burman design, the response surface revealed glucose, magnesium sulfate, and ammonium sulfate as critical media components of the nutritional source, whereas the central composite design affirmed an optimum concentration of the critical nutritional source as 16.0 g/l (glucose), 3.5 g/l magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4.7H2O), and 1.6 g/l ammonium sulfate ( (NH4)2SO4), yielding an optimal flocculation activity of 96.8%. Fourier Transformer Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis confirmed the presence of hydroxyl, carboxyl and methoxyl in the structure of the bioflocculant. Additionally, chemical analysis affirmed the presence of mainly a polysaccharide in the main backbone of the purified bioflocculant with no detection of protein. Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis affirmed the presence of chlorine, phosphorous, oxygen and chlorine as representatives of elemental composition. Thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis revealed over 60% weight was retained at a temperature range of 700  C. The purified bioflocculant remarkably removed chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand and turbidity in brewery wastewater. This study suggested that the bioflocculant might be an alternate candidate for wastewater treatment.
