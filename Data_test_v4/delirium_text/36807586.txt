36807586|a|Coronavirus disease secondary to infection by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID19 or C19) causes respiratory illness, as well as severe neurological symptoms that have not been fully characterized. In a previous study, we developed a computational pipeline for the automated, rapid, high-throughput and objective analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) rhythms. In this retrospective study, we used this pipeline to define the quantitative EEG changes in patients with a PCR-positive diagnosis of C19 (n = 31) in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Cleveland Clinic, compared to a group of age-matched PCR-negative (n = 38) control patients in the same ICU setting. Qualitative assessment of EEG by two independent teams of electroencephalographers confirmed prior reports with regards to the high prevalence of diffuse encephalopathy in C19 patients, although the diagnosis of encephalopathy was inconsistent between teams. Quantitative analysis of EEG showed distinct slowing of brain rhythms in C19 patients compared to control (enhanced delta power and attenuated alpha-beta power). Surprisingly, these C19-related changes in EEG power were more prominent in patients below age 70. Moreover, machine learning algorithms showed consistently higher accuracy in the binary classification of patients as C19 versus control using EEG power for subjects below age 70 compared to older ones, providing further evidence for the more severe impact of SARS-CoV-2 on brain rhythms in younger individuals irrespective of PCR diagnosis or symptomatology, and raising concerns over potential long-term effects of C19 on brain physiology in the adult population and the utility of EEG monitoring in C19 patients.
