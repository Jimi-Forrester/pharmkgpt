36333751|t|Effect of early stellate ganglion block in cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (BLOCK-CVS): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
36333751|a|INTRODUCTION: Stellate ganglion block has been reported to expand cerebral vessels and alleviate vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, the causal relationship between early stellate ganglion block and cerebral vasospasm prevention has not yet been established. The purpose of this study was to explore the effectiveness and safety of early stellate ganglion block as a preventive treatment for cerebral vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, blinded endpoint assessment superiority trial. A total of 228 patients will be randomized within 48 h of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage onset in a 1:1 ratio into two groups, one group receiving an additional e-SGB and the other group receiving only a camouflaging action before anesthesia induction in the operating room. The primary outcome is the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm within 14 days after aSAH. Further safety and efficacy parameters include the incidence of radiographic vasospasm, new cerebral infarction, postoperative delirium, and complications up to 90 days after surgery; postoperative cerebral hemodynamics; Mini-Mental State Examination score; modified Rankin scale score; and all-cause mortality up to 90 days after surgery. DISCUSSION: This is a randomized controlled trial to explore the effectiveness and safety of early stellate ganglion block as a preventive treatment to reduce cerebral vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. If the results are positive, it may provide a new direction for the prevention and treatment of cerebral vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered on Clincaltrials.gov on December 13, 2020 (NCT04691271).
