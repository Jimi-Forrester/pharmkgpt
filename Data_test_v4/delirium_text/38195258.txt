38195258|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Numerous prospective studies have examined sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) intake associated with weight gain or incident obesity. Because SSB accounts for only 33 % of added sugar (AS) intake, we investigated the associations of AS intake with change in weight and waist circumference and risk of developing obesity. METHODS AND RESULTS: At baseline (1985-86) Black and White women and men, aged 18-30 years, enrolled in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study and were followed for 30 years (2015-16). A diet history assessed dietary intake 3 times over 20 years. Multivariable linear regression evaluated the associations of change in weight (n = 3306) and waist circumference (n = 3296) across quartiles of AS, adjusting for demographics, lifestyle factors, and anthropometrics. Proportional hazards regression analysis evaluated the associations of time-varying cumulative AS intake with risk of incident obesity (n = 4023) and abdominal obesity (n = 3449), adjusting for the same factors. Over 30 years of follow-up, greater AS intake was associated with gaining 2.3 kg more weight (ptrend = 0.01) and 2.2 cm greater change in waist circumference (ptrend = 0.005) as well as increased risk of incident obesity (HR 1.28; 95 % CI: 1.08-1.53) and incident abdominal obesity (HR 1.27; 95 % CI:1.02-1.60). CONCLUSION: Our findings are consistent with recommendations from the 2020-2025 U S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans to limit daily AS intake.
