38166448|a|Uncovering the molecular changes at the site where Abeta is deposited plays a critical role in advancing the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, there is currently a lack of a suitable label-free imaging method with a high spatial resolution for brain tissue analysis. In this study, we propose a modified desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) method, called segmented temperature-controlled DESI (STC-DESI), to achieve high-resolution and high-sensitivity spatial metabolomics observation by precisely controlling desorption and ionization temperatures. By concentrating the spray plume and accelerating solvent evaporation at different temperatures, we achieved an impressive spatial resolution of 20 mum that enables direct observation of the heterogeneity around a single cell or an individual Abeta plaque and an exciting sensitivity that allows a variety of low-abundance metabolites and less ionizable neutral lipids to be detected. We applied this STC-DESI method to analyze the brains of transgenic AD mice and identified molecular changes associated with individual Abeta aggregates. More importantly, our study provides the first evidence that carnosine is significantly depleted and 5-caffeoylquinic acid (5-CQA) levels rise sharply around Abeta deposits. These observations highlight the potential of carnosine as a sensitive molecular probe for clinical magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis and the potential of 5-CQA as an efficient therapeutic strategy for Abeta clearance in the early AD stage. Overall, our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our STC-DESI method and shed light on the potential roles of these molecules in AD pathology, specifically in cellular endocytosis, gray matter network disruption, and paravascular Abeta clearance.
