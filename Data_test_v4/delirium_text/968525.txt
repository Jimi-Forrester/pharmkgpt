968525|t|Clinical comparison of isoflurance and halothane anesthetics.
968525|a|Isoflurane and halothane were compared in two similar groups of 100 patients each. Isoflurane compared favorably with halothane in producing adequate anesthesia in all our patients. Induction period was a little stormy when there was direct induction with isoflurane. Maintenance was excellent and recovery was good. Mean concentration necessary to induce anesthesia was 3.07% with isoflurane and 2.56% with halothane. Mean maintenance with isoflurane was 1.39%, compared to 1.40% with halothane. Less curare was required for relaxation when used with isoflurane than with halothane. This difference was not seen with pancuronium (Pavulon). Patient recovery was faster with isoflurane than with halothane. Incidence of delirium and shivering in the recovery period was similar for both agents. Incidence of nausea and vomiting was greater with isoflurane. Other clinical and biochemical postoperative comparisons did not show any significant differences between the two agents.
