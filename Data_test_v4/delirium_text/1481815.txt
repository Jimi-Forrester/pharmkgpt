1481815|t|Monozygotic twins concordant for late-onset probable Alzheimer disease with suspected Alzheimer disease in four sibs.
1481815|a|Probable Alzheimer disease (AD) is described in 79-year-old male twins with monozygosity confirmed by DNA examination. The first twin to be affected began to show signs of intellectual deterioration at age 70. In the other, onset was at age 72. Four of their living sibs (current age range = 75-92) are also suspected to have AD. The possible roles of genetic and environmental factors in the development of AD in this sibship are discussed.
