36769067|a|Astrocytes, a non-neuronal glial cell type in the nervous system, are essential for regulating physiological functions of the central nervous system. In various injuries and diseases of the central nervous system, astrocytes often change their phenotypes into neurotoxic ones that participate in pro-inflammatory responses (hereafter referred to as "immune functions"). Such astrocytic immune functions are not only limited to brain diseases but are also found in ocular neurodegenerative diseases such as glaucoma, a retinal neurodegenerative disease that is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. The eye has two astrocyte-lineage cells: astrocytes and Muller cells. They maintain the physiological environment of the retina and optic nerve, thereby controlling visual function. Dysfunction of astrocyte-lineage cells may be involved in the onset and progression of glaucoma. These cells become reactive in glaucoma patients, and animal studies have suggested that their immune responses may be linked to glaucoma-related events: tissue remodeling, neuronal death, and infiltration of peripheral immune cells. In this review, we discuss the role of the immune functions of astrocyte-lineage cells in the pathogenesis of glaucoma.
