35841311|t|Prevalence and Treatments of Movement Disorders in Prion Diseases: A Longitudinal Cohort Study.
35841311|a|BACKGROUND: Prion diseases cause a range of movement disorders involving the cortical, extrapyramidal, and cerebellar systems, and yet there are no large systematic studies of their prevalence, features, associations, and responses to commonly used treatments. OBJECTIVES: We sought to describe the natural history and pharmacological management of movement disorders in prion diseases. METHODS: We studied the serial examination findings, investigation results, and symptomatic treatment recorded for 700 patients with prion diseases and 51 mimics who had been enrolled onto the prospective longitudinal National Prion Monitoring Cohort study between 2008 and 2020. We performed an analysis to identify whether there were patterns of movement disorders associated with disease aetiology, PRNP codon 129 polymorphism, disease severity rating scales, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings. RESULTS: Gait disturbances, myoclonus, and increased tone are the most frequently observed movement disorders in patients with prion diseases. The typical pattern of early motor dysfunction involves gait disturbance, limb ataxia, impaired smooth pursuit, myoclonus, tremor, and increased limb tone. Disturbances of gait, increased tone, and myoclonus become more prevalent and severe as the disease progresses. Chorea, alien limb phenomenon, and nystagmus were the least frequently observed movement disorders, with these symptoms showing spontaneous resolution in approximately half of symptomatic patients. Disease severity and PRNP codon 129 polymorphism were associated with different movement disorder phenotypes. Antiepileptics and benzodiazepines were found to be effective in treating myoclonus. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the prevalence, severity, evolution, treatment, and associated features of movement disorders in prion diseases based on a prospective cohort study.   2022 The Authors.
