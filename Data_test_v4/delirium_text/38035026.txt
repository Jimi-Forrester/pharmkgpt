38035026|a|Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune pathology characterized by persistent synovial inflammation and gradually advancing bone destruction. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), as a family of zinc-containing enzymes, have been found to play an important role in degradation and remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM). MMPs participate in processes of cell proliferation, migration, inflammation, and cell metabolism. A growing number of persons have paid attention to their function in inflammatory and immune diseases. In this review, the details of regulation of MMPs expression and its expression in RA are summarized. The role of MMPs in ECM remodeling, angiogenesis, oxidative and nitrosative stress, cell migration and invasion, cytokine and chemokine production, PANoptosis and bone destruction in RA disease are discussed. Additionally, the review summarizes clinical trials targeting MMPs in inflammatory disease and discusses the potential of MMP inhibition in the therapeutic context of RA. MMPs may serve as biomarkers for drug response, pathology stratification, and precision medicine to improve clinical management of rheumatoid arthritis.
