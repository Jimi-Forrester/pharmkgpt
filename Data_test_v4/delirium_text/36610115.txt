36610115|a|BACKGROUND: Over-activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) is involved in sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Silibinin, a natural flavonoid gained from the seeds of Silybum marianum, exerts neuroprotective effects on sporadic AD models, but its impacts on NMDARs remain unknown. PURPOSE: To study silibinin's regulatory effects on NMDARs pathway in sporadic AD models. METHODS: MTT assay, western blotting, confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, RT-PCR, and siRNA transfection etc. were used for cellular and molecular studies. The direct interactions between silibinin and NMDAR subunits were evaluated by computational molecular docking, drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assay and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). Y maze test, novel objects recognition test and Morris water maze test were conducted to examine the learning and memory ability of rats. RESULTS: An in vitro AD model was established by treating HT22 murine hippocampal neurons with streptozotocin (STZ), as evidenced by the amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition and hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins. Silibinin shows protection of neurons against STZ-induced cell damage. It is noteworthy that STZ-induced cellular calcium influx is inhibited by silibinin-treatment, indicating the possible modulation of calcium channels. Studies on NMDARs, the most widely distributed calcium channel, by using molecular docking, DARTS and CESTA, reveal that the GluN2B subunit, but not GluN2A, is the potential target of silibinin. Further studies using the pharmacological agonist (NMDA) and the GluN2B-specific inhibitor (Ifenprodil) or siRNA, indicate that the protection by silibinin treatment from STZ-induced cytotoxicity is medicated through interference with GluN2B-containing NMDARs, followed by the upregulation of CaMKIIalpha/ BDNF/ TrkB signaling pathway and improved levels of synaptic proteins (SYP and PSD-95). The results in vivo using rats intracerebroventricularly injected with STZ (ICV-STZ), a well-established sporadic AD model, confirm that silibinin improves learning and memory ability in association with modulation of the GluN2B/CaMKIIalpha/ BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: Inhibiting over-activation of GluN2B-containing NMDARs is involved in the neuroprotective effect of silibinin on STZ-induced sporadic AD models.
