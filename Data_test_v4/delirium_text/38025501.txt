38025501|t|Orofacial Dyskinesia in Uremia in Polycystic Kidney Disease.
38025501|a|Uremic encephalopathy presenting as involuntary movements of the orofacial region is important to recognize because of reversibility seen with resolution of azotaemia though residual neurological dysfunction might persist. Neuroimaging is important part of diagnosis with typical lesions involving basal ganglia seen mostly in diabetic patients. Our case highlights a patient with non-diabetic uremic encephalopathy with facial dyskinesia which is rare with a lesion in unilateral lentiform nucleus and small white matter hyperintensities. Resolution following dialysis pointed to uraemia as aetiology.
