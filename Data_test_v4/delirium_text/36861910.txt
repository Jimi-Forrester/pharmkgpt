36861910|t|Improving outcomes in co-morbid diabetes and COVID-19: A quasi-experimental study.
36861910|a|BACKGROUND: High-risk people living with diabetes (PLWD) have increased risk for morbidity and mortality. During the first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) wave in 2020 in Cape Town, South Africa, high-risk PLWD with COVID-19 were fast-tracked into a field hospital and managed aggressively. This study evaluated the effects of this intervention by assessing the impact of this intervention on clinical outcomes in this cohort. METHODS: A retrospective quasi-experimental study design compared patients admitted pre- and post-intervention. RESULTS: A total of 183 participants were enrolled, with the two groups having similar demographic and clinical pre-Covid-19 baselines. Glucose control on admission was better in the experimental group (8.1% vs 9.3% [p = 0.013]). The experimental group needed less oxygen (p  0.001), fewer antibiotics (p  0.001) and fewer steroids (p = 0.003), while the control group had a higher incidence of acute kidney injury during admission (p = 0.046). The median glucose control was better in the experimental group (8.3 vs 10.0; p = 0.006). The two groups had similar clinical outcomes for discharge home (94% vs 89%), escalation in care (2% vs 3%) and inpatient death (4% vs 8%). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a risk-based approach to high-risk PLWD with COVID-19 may yield good clinical outcomes while making financial savings and preventing emotional distress.Contribution: We propose a risk-based approach to guide clinical management of high risk patients, which departs significantly from the current disease-based model. More research using randomised control trial methodology should explore this hypothesis.
