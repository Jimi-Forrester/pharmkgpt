29194309|t|Care of the Older Adult With Postoperative Delirium: An Interprofessional Simulation for Undergraduate Nursing Students.
29194309|a|Because of the expanding older adult population, undergraduate nursing students need to be introduced to the unique challenges of taking care of older adults. Using simulation to demonstrate some of these challenges allows these entry-level students to learn in a nonthreatening environment. By focusing on an older adult patient who is experiencing postoperative delirium in a simulation, students can practice not only how to complete a safety assessment but also effective communication skills with the patient, family, and members of the interprofessional health care team.
