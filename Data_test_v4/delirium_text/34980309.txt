34980309|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of bundle management strategy in early mobility of patients with mechanical ventilation. METHODS: Seventy-two mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) of Fenyang Hospital of Shanxi Province from December 2019 to June 2020 were enrolled. The patients were divided into routine nursing control group (routine control group) and early mobility bundle management group (bundle group), with 36 cases in each group. The routine control group received regular nursing, including monitoring vital signs, raising the head of the bed, turning over and buttoning the back every 2 hours, daily awakening, airway humidification, prevention of digestive tract ulcer, analgesia and sedation management, prevention of deep vein embolism, pipeline management, regular monitoring of blood gas analysis and electrolytes according to the changes of the condition, prevention of aspiration, prevention of bacterial colonization, correct hand hygiene, and so on. The bundle group implemented the cluster early mobility strategy based on routine nursing. Firstly, set up a professional team to execute the standards. The team determined the plan and implemented the 4-level mobility plan, companied with psychological intervention, decided the termination standard and quality control. The incidence of intensive care unit acquired weakness (ICU-AW), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), delirium, the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay were evaluated. RESULTS: Compared with the routine control group, the incidences of ICU-AW, VAP, and delirium in the bundle group were significantly lower (the incidence of ICU-AW: 36.11% vs. 69.44%, chi2 = 8.025, P = 0.005; the incidence of VAP: 8.33% vs. 30.56%, chi2 = 5.675, P = 0.017; the incidence of delirium: 5.56% vs. 36.11%, chi2 = 10.180, P = 0.001), the duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly shorter (days: 7.13+-1.34 vs. 10.46+-1.48, t = -10.145, P < 0.001), and the length of ICU stay was also significantly decreased (days: 9.03+-2.43 vs. 13.06+-3.63, t = -5.535, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of bundle management strategy of early mobility can promote the rehabilitation of mechanical ventilated patients, improve the prognosis and the quality of life. The effect is noticeable and it is worth popularizing.
