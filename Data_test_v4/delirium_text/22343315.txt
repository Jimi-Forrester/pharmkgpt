22343315|a|The deposition of beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) is commonly reported in the nasal cavity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, although the pathological significance of this finding is unknown. This study compared Abeta concentrations in the nasal area with those in the brain, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis identified Abeta deposits in the nasal epithelium of Tg2576 mice. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurements revealed a correlation between the content of Abeta42 in the nasal area and that in the brain, but not with that in the blood. These results suggest that the highly accessible nasal cavity could be a useful site for diagnostic analysis of AD based on Abeta content.
