29679539|t|Interactions between amyloid beta peptide and lipid membranes.
29679539|a|The presence of amyloid plaques in the brain is a typical characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid plaques are formed from the deposits of aggregated amyloid beta peptide (Abeta). The toxicity induced by Abeta aggregates is correlated with Abeta-membrane interactions. The mutual influences between aggregation and membranes are complicated and unclear. In recent years advanced experiments and findings are emerging to give us more detailed information on Abeta-membrane interactions. In this review, we mainly focus on the Abeta-membrane interactions and membrane-induced Abeta structures. The mechanism of Abeta-membrane interactions is also summarized, which provides insights into the prevention and treatment of AD.
