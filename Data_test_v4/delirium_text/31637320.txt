This study sought to determine the prevalence of specific medication-related problems detected in patients, seen after critical care discharge. DESIGN: Consecutive patients attending an intensive care unit (ICU) follow-up programme were included in this single-centre service evaluation. SETTING: Tertiary care regional centre in Scotland (UK). PARTICIPANTS: 47 patients reviewed after critical care discharge at an ICU follow-up programme. INTERVENTIONS: Pharmacists conducted a full medication review, including: medicines reconciliation, assessing the appropriateness of each prescribed medication, identification of any medication-related problems and checking adherence. MEASUREMENTS: Medication-related problems in patients following critical care discharge. Interventions and medication-related problems were systematically graded and risk factors were identified using an adapted version of the National Patient Safety Agency Risk Matrix. MAIN RESULTS: 69 medication-related problems were identified in 38 (81%) of the 47 patients. The most common documented problem was drug omission (29%). 64% of the medication-related problems identified were classified as either moderate or major. The number of pain medications prescribed at discharge from intensive care was predictive of medication-related problems (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.14 to 4.26, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Medication problems are common following critical care. Better communication of medication changes both to patients and their ongoing care providers may be beneficial following a critical care admission. In the absence of highly effective communication, a pharmacy intervention may contribute substantially to an intensive care rehabilitation or recovery programme.
