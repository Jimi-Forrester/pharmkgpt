19013651|a|The present study reports elevated levels of endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations in plasma from patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS) and Alzheimer's (AD) as compared to healthy controls. Levels of plasma LPS showed a significant positive correlation with degree of blood monocyte/macrophage activation in disease groups and was most elevated in patients with advanced sALS disease. There was a significant negative relationship between plasma LPS and levels of monocyte/macrophage IL-10 expression in sALS blood. These data suggest that systemic LPS levels and activated monocyte/macrophages may play significant roles in the pathogenesis of sALS.
