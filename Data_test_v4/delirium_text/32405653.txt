32405653|a|BACKGROUND: Geriatric patients are currently responsible for almost one third of all emergency hospital admissions. An increase of 50% is expected in the next decade. This age redistribution poses new challenges for inpatient care and discharge management. The requirements of an orthopedic trauma surgery clinic in the care of this patient group can be clarified with the help of this first collaboratively created geriatric orthopedic trauma surgery complex treatment unit of a university hospital. OBJECTIVE: What influence do age and delirium have on discharge management, length of inpatient stay and discharge destination in a geriatric cohort? MATERIAL AND METHODS: All patients who received inpatient treatment as part of the orthopedic trauma surgery geriatric complex treatment (GKB) between May 2017 and December 2019 were evaluated. An analysis of the demographics, length of inpatient stay, discharge destinations and evaluation of the Barthel index collected on admission and discharge, the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and the geriatric depression scale (GDS) were carried out. RESULTS: Out of 312 patients, 110 men and 193 women with a median age of 81 years, 77 patients (24.6%) showed delirium when enrolled in the GKB and 39 (12.5%) dementia. Older patients presented more often with delirium than younger people (p = 0.013), especially those aged 70-79 years (p = 0.037). Dementia patients suffered more frequently from postoperative delirium (p < 0.01). The mean hospital stay was 17.79 days (+-4.6 days). The GKB was regularly completed in 60.7% of all cases and 39.3% patients dropped out early. Patients with delirium were discharged significantly less often into their own home but into short-term care or nursing homes (p = 0.038). A general correlation between delirium development and the discharge destination was noticeable (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Patients with dementia are more likely to develop delirium postoperatively, which leads to an increase in the length of inpatient stay, an increase in treatment costs and more work for the discharge management team. In addition, the discharge to the patients' home is impaired by delirium, which means that the growing need for places in short-term care and nursing homes also creates socioeconomic burdens.
