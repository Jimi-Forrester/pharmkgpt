37855967|a|Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have durable and remarkable antimicrobial effects on pathogenic microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, in dental plaques. As such, they are widely added to dental restoration materials, including composite resins, denture bases, adhesives, and implants, to solve the problems of denture stomatitis, peri-implant inflammation, and oral infection caused by the long-term use of these dental restoration materials. However, AgNPs can be absorbed into the blood circulatory system through the nasal/oral mucosa, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and other pathways and then distributed into the lungs, kidneys, liver, spleen, and testes, thereby causing toxic injury to these tissues and organs. It can even be transported across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and continuously accumulate in brain tissues, causing injury and dysfunction of neurons and glial cells; consequently, neurotoxicity occurs. Other nanomaterials with antibacterial or remineralization properties are added to dental restoration materials with AgNPs. However, studies have yet to reveal the neurotoxicity caused by dental restoration materials containing AgNPs. In this review, we summarize the application of AgNPs in dental restoration materials, the mechanism of AgNPs in cytotoxicity and toxic injury to the BBB, and the related research on the accumulation of AgNPs to cause changes of neurotoxicity. We also discuss the mechanisms of neurotoxicity caused by AgNPs and the mode and rate of AgNPs released from dental restorative materials added with AgNPs to evaluate the probability of neurotoxic injury to the central nervous system (CNS), and then provide a theoretical basis for developing new composite dental restoration materials. Mechanism of neurotoxicity caused by AgNPs: AgNPs in the blood circulation enter the brain tissue after being transported across the BBB through transendothelial cell pathway and paracellular transport pathway, and continuously accumulate in brain tissue, causing damage and dysfunction of neurons and glial cells which ultimately leads to neurotoxicity. The uptake of AgNPs by neurons, astrocytes and microglia causes damage to these cells. AgNPs with non-neurotoxic level often increases the secretion of a variety of cytokines, up-regulates the expression of metallothionein in glial cells, even up-regulates autophagy and inflammation response to protect neurons from the toxic damage of AgNPs. However, the protective effect of glial cells induced by AgNPs exposure to neurotoxic levels is insufficient, which leads to neuronal damage and dysfunction and even neuronal programmed cell death, eventually cause neurotoxicity.
