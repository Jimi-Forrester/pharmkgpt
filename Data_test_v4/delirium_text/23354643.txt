23354643|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease is a neurodegenerative condition that affects cognitive, behavioral and global functioning of patients. Currently and due to the lack of conclusive biological testing, Alzheimer's disease diagnosis is based primarily on clinical criteria. Since its early diagnosis allows clinical interventions when neurological damage is relatively mild, the development of early detection tools has become a major topic of interest. In this article, we review the main neuro-biological and neuropsychological features of Alzheimer's disease, analyzing the use of biomarkers and neuropsychological testing for early detection.
