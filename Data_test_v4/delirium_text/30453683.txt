30453683|a|This paper describes a bioprocess to obtain omegas-6 and 9 from the hydrolysis of Acai (Euterpe oleracea Martius) and Buriti (Mauritia flexuosa) oils by lipases immobilized on octyl-sepharose. For this, oils and butters were initially selected as the carbon source which resulted in higher production of lipases in Beauveria bassiana and Fusarium oxysporum cultures. The carbon source that provided secretion of lipase by B. bassiana was Acai oil, and for F. oxysporum, Bacuri butter. Lipases obtained under these conditions were immobilized on octyl-sepharose, and both, the derivatives and the crude extracts were biochemically characterized. It was observed that the immobilization promoted an increase of stability in B. bassiana and F. oxysporum lipase activities at the given temperatures and pH. In addition, the immobilization promoted hyperactivation of B. bassiana and F. oxysporum lipase activities being 23.5 and 11.0 higher than free enzyme, respectively. The hydrolysis of Acai and Buriti oils by the derivatives was done in a biphasic (organic/aqueous) system, and the products were quantified in RP-HPLC. The results showed the potential of these immobilized lipases to obtain omegas-6 and 9 from Brazilian natural oils. This work may improve the enzymatic methodologies for obtaining foods and drugs enriched with fatty acids.
