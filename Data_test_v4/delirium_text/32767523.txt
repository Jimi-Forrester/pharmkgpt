32767523|a|AIM: Few studies have investigated sarcopenia in patients with cognitive impairment. However, identifying the characteristics and factors associated with sarcopenia in these patients may help to decrease the risk of falls, prevent disabilities, and maintain an independent life, all of which can affect the quality of life of both patient and caregiver. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate associated factors of sarcopenia in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 125 outpatients aged 65 to 89 years (mean age 79.5 +- 7.9 years) from January 2018 to December 2018. In addition to demographic characteristics, cognitive status, depressive mood, activities of daily living, body mass index (BMI), handgrip strength, gait speed, muscle mass, and serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (Vit D), haemoglobin (Hb), albumin and creatinine were assessed. Sarcopenia was defined based on the presence of low muscle mass and either low muscle strength or low physical performance. RESULTS: Overall, 29.6% of the patients had sarcopenia. The patients with sarcopenia were mostly male, significantly older, and had a lower BMI and lower levels of Vit D. The female patients with sarcopenia were more likely to have lower levels of Hb. Multiple logistic regression showed that sarcopenia was associated with BMI in both genders. The level of Vit D was associated with sarcopenia in the female patients, whereas age was associated with sarcopenia in the male patients. CONCLUSIONS: A low BMI may be a dementia-related risk factor for sarcopenia. The female patients with sarcopenia were more likely to have lower levels of Hb and Vit D. There may be different risk profiles for sarcopenia in men and women with Alzheimer's disease. Further studies are needed to devise different nutritional support for muscle weakness in patients with cognitive decline by gender.
