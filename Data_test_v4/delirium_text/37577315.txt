37577315|t|Advancements of ALK inhibition of non-small cell lung cancer: a literature review.
37577315|a|Background and Objective: The therapeutic landscape for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has evolved considerably in the last few years. The targeted drugs and molecular diagnostics have been developed together at a fast pace. This narrative review explores the evolution of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) targeting therapies from discovering the ALK protein, molecular tests, present clinical trial data and future perspectives. Since the body of evidence on lung cancer is growing daily, most oncologists need time to implement data in their daily practice. Methods: We developed a narrative review to provide up-to-date help in the clinical decision-making of ALK-altered NSCLC patients. In 2022, the authors reviewed PubMed's published pivotal randomized Phase 3 trial results. Key Content and Findings: The development of ALK inhibitors was a revolution that is still ongoing; second and third-generation ALK inhibitors provided more than 30 months of progression-free survival (PFS) and impressive "brain-control". Brigatinib provided a survival benefit for patients with baseline brain metastases (HR 0.43, 95% CI: 0.21-0.89), and Lorlatinib demonstrated intracranial response rates of 82%, with 71% of complete intracranial responses. Personalized medicine is the new paradigm, from performing broad genetic panels for diagnosis to individual targeted therapy or combinations of different targeted agents. Conclusions: In the future, performing broad molecular panels should be the standard of care in the front line and after each progression to detect arising resistance mechanisms. Longer PFS will substantially convert a deadly condition into an almost chronic disease in the following decades. Treatment sequencing will be the cornerstone for patient survival, and liquid biopsies may replace tissue biopsies.
