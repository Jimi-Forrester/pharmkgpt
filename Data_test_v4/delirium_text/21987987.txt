21987987|a|The aim of this study is to show what nurses from hospitalization units know about Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the demands of care for patients and their families. This is a descriptive and exploratory study with a qualitative approach. The data were collected through semistructured interviews. Data saturation occurred after interviewing eleven nurses in two private hospitals. Six categories emerged from the content analysis: AD characterization, risk factors, ways to diagnose, complications, treatment medication, patient and family care. It was observed that nurses have partial knowledge regarding AD, focusing their care actions only on the clinical change that caused admission. They recognize signs and symptoms but only show themselves as supporting assistants, instead of acting more autonomously in dealing with care needs and family support.
