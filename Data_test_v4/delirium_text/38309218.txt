38309218|t|A label-free high-throughput protein solubility assay and its application to Abeta40.
38309218|a|A major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of aggregated amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) in the brain. Here we develop a solubility assay for proteins and measure the solubility of Abeta40. In brief, the method utilizes 96-well filter plates to separate monomeric Abeta from aggregated Abeta, and the small species are quantified with the amine reactive dye o-phthalaldehyde (OPA). This procedure ensures that solubility is measured for unlabeled species, and makes the assay high-throughput and inexpensive. We demonstrate that the filter plates successfully separate fibrils from monomer, with negligible monomer adsorption, and that OPA can quantify Abeta peptides in a concentration range from 40 nM to 20 muM. We also show that adding a methionine residue to the N-terminus of Abeta1-40 decreases the solubility by <3-fold. The method will facilitate further solubility studies, and contribute to the understanding of the thermodynamics of amyloid fibril formation.
