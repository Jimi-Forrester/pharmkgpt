35163141|t|Neurobiological Highlights of Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatric Disorders.
35163141|a|This review is focused on several psychiatric disorders in which cognitive impairment is a major component of the disease, influencing life quality. There are plenty of data proving that cognitive impairment accompanies and even underlies some psychiatric disorders. In addition, sources provide information on the biological background of cognitive problems associated with mental illness. This scientific review aims to summarize the current knowledge about neurobiological mechanisms of cognitive impairment in people with schizophrenia, depression, mild cognitive impairment and dementia (including Alzheimer's disease).The review provides data about the prevalence of cognitive impairment in people with mental illness and associated biological markers.
