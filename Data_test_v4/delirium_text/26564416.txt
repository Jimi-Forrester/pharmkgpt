METHODS: Levels of amyloid protein beta (Abeta42, Abeta40) and phosphorylated Tau-protein (P-tau) in CSF and ratio of Abeta42/Abeta40 were tested in 5 cases with CAA dementia and 20 cases with Alzheimer's disease collected at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from December 2001 to March 2011. RESULTS: The levels of Abeta42, Abeta40, and P-tau in CSF and ratio of Abeta42/Abeta40 were (660.4 +- 265.2) ng/L, (7111.0 +- 1033.4) ng/L, (71.8 +- 51.5) ng/L, and 0.077 +- 0.033, respectively in CAA dementia and (663.6 +- 365.6) ng/L, (5115.0 +- 2931.1) ng/L, (47.7 +- 38.8) ng/L, and 0.192 +- 0.140, respectively in Alzheimer's disease patients. There were no statistically significant differences between CAA dementia and Alzheimer's disease in terms of these CSF biomarkers (all P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Measurements of CSF biomarkers may not be helpful in differential diagnosis of CAA and Alzheimer's disease.
