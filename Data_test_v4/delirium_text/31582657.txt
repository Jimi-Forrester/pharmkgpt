31582657|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and its prevention and treatment is a worldwide issue. Many natural components considered to be effective against AD have been identified. However, almost all clinical trials of these components for AD reported inconclusive results. We thought that multiple factors such as amyloid beta (Abeta) and tau progressed the pathology of AD and that a therapeutic effect would be obtained by using multiple active ingredients with different effects. Thus, in this study, we treated ferulic acid (FA), phosphatidylserine (PS) and curcumin (Cur) in combination or alone to APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice and evaluated cognitive function by Y-maze test. Consequently, only the three-ingredient group exhibited a significant improvement in cognitive function compared to the control group. In addition, we determined the amounts of Abeta, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), interleukin (IL)-1beta, acetylcholine and phosphorylated tau in the mouse brains after the treatment. In the two-ingredient (FA and PS) group, a significant decrease in IL-1beta and an increasing trend in acetylcholine were observed. In the Cur group, significant decreases in Abeta and phosphorylated tau and an increasing trend in BDNF were observed. In the three-ingredient group, all of them were observed. These results indicate that the intake of multiple active ingredients with different mechanisms of action for the prevention and treatment of AD.
