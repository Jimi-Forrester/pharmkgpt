25351583|t|Cost-benefit analysis of a delirium prevention strategy in the intensive care unit.
25351583|a|AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a delirium prevention strategy. BACKGROUND: A high prevalence has been reported for delirium after liver transplantation surgery in the intensive care unit (ICU). Delirium increases treatment costs because of treatment delays, prolonged hospital stays and other associated complications. Despite all those problems associated with delirium, a systemic prevention strategy does not exist yet. DESIGN: This study used an economic evaluation design by reviewing relevant medical records. METHODS: Study objects were 130 patients who were admitted to the ICU after liver transplantation surgery. After looking at the medical records of these patients, we divided them into two groups according to the application of the prevention strategy. This study analysed the costs and benefits of the prevention strategy between the groups. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of delirium was 35 3% in the prevention-care group and 51 6% in the usual-care group. A sum of $38 4 was invested for the prevention strategy in opposite to the expected total costs of $5578 for a probable treatment. Thus, the net benefit was $5539 6 with a benefit ratio of 145 3 CONCLUSIONS: A strategy is necessary for the delirium prevention of patients in the ICU to decrease the economic burden. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study demonstrated that a prevention strategy was cost-effective because of its low input costs. With low additional investment, it is expected that this prevention strategy will be more available to other patients in the future.
