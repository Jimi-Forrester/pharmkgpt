34752348|a|INTRODUCTION: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) through the use of biomarkers could assist in the implementation and monitoring of early therapeutic interventions, and has the potential to significantly modify the course of the disease. DEVELOPMENT: The classic cerebrospinal fluid and approved structural and functional neuroimaging biomarkers are of limited clinical application given their invasive nature and/or high cost. The identification of more accessible and less costly biomarkers, such as blood biomarkers, would increase their use in clinical practice. We review the available published evidence on the main blood biochemical biomarkers potentially useful for diagnosing AD. CONCLUSIONS: Blood biomarkers are more cost- and time-effective than CSF biomarkers. However, immediate applicability in clinical practice is relatively unlikely. The main limitations come from the difficulty of measuring and standardising thresholds between different laboratories and the failure to replicate results. Of all the molecules studied, apoptosis and neurodegeneration biomarkers and the biomarker panels obtained through "omics" approaches, such as isolated or combined metabolomics, offer the most promising results.
