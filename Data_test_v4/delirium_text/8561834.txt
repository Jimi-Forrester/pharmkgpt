8561834|t|Behavioral disturbance in dementia.
8561834|a|Fifty-seven subjects with moderate to severe dementia (49 with Alzheimer's disease) were rated twice, 8 weeks apart, using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Blessed Information-Memory-Concentration Test (BIMC), and the Stockton Geriatric Rating Scale (SGRC). Only three subjects lived at home; the rest were in long-stay hospital beds or nursing homes. For 29 subjects, the first rating coincided with their referral to a comprehensive geriatric psychiatry service. The main hypothesis, that the level of behavioral disturbance would correlate positively with the level of cognitive impairment, was strongly confirmed. This finding may reflect the severity of dementia in the study sample. The correlations between MMSE and BIMC scores were .87 at entry and .92 at exit, suggesting that the two measures were broadly equivalent, although both had marked floor effects. Test-retest reliability was high for all three measures. Overall, medication was of limited effectiveness in managing severe behavioral disturbance, highlighting the need for introducing effective behavioral programs.
