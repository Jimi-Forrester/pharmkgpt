35203217|t|Immediate Postoperative Analgesia of Nalbuphine-Ketamine Combination Compared with Ketamine Alone in Xylazine-Sedated Goats Undergoing Left Flank Laparotomy.
35203217|a|Goats have been used as animal models in research, and the need for achieving safer anesthesia for research or surgical intervention is gaining much attention. The objective of this study was to evaluate intraoperative effects and the immediate postoperative analgesia of nalbuphine-ketamine regimen in goats. Twenty clinically healthy adult female crossbred goats weighing 14 +- 2 kg were allocated randomly into each of two equally sized groups. All animals were sedated with intramuscular (IM) xylazine (0.07 mg/kg), then anesthesia was intravenously (IV) induced with ketamine alone (10 mg/kg) (XK group), or a combination of nalbuphine (0.5 mg/kg) and ketamine (5 mg/kg) (XNK group). Following induction, left flank laparotomy was performed and then sutured. The quality of anesthesia and immediate postoperative analgesia was evaluated. Immediate postoperative analgesia was assessed up to 5 h after standing, using a modified Unesp-Botucatu acute composite pain scale (USAPS). Serum cortisol, glucose, insulin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured at 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h, postoperatively (PO).&nbsp;The USAPS pain scores were significantly lower in the XNK compared to the XK group (p < 0.05). The XNK group exhibited a statistically significant difference in the level of serum cortisol at 1/2 and 1 h PO (p = 0.018 and 0.045, respectively) compared to the XK group. At 2, 4, 6 h PO, CRP significantly decreased (p = 0.023, 0.040 and 0.005, respectively) in the XNK compared to the XK group. Nalbuphine-ketamine produced an acceptable induction of anesthesia and recovery compared to ketamine. Recovery with nalbuphine-ketamine was faster and better quality. The USAPS pain scores were lower in nalbuphine-ketamine, indicating that this novel combination produces better postoperative pain control than ketamine alone.
