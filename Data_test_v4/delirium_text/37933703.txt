37933703|a|BACKGROUND: Examining the associations of social determinants of health (SDOH) with postoperative delirium in older adults will broaden our understanding of this potentially devastating condition. We explored the association between SDOH factors and incident postoperative delirium. METHODS: A retrospective study of a prospective cohort of patients enrolled from June 18, 2010, to August 8, 2013, across two academic medical centers in Boston, Massachusetts. Overall, 560 older adults age >=70 years undergoing major elective non-cardiac surgery were included in this analysis. Exposure variables included income, lack of private insurance, and neighborhood disadvantage. Our main outcome was incident postoperative delirium, measured using the Confusion Assessment Method long form. RESULTS: Older age (odds ratio, OR: 1.01, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.00, 1.02), income <20,000 a year (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.26), lack of private insurance (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.38), higher depressive symptomatology (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.04), and the Area Deprivation Index (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.04) were significantly associated with increased risk of postoperative delirium in bivariable analyses. In a multivariable model, explaining 27% of the variance in postoperative delirium, significant independent variables were older age (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00, 1.02), lack of private insurance (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02, 1.36), and depressive symptoms (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00, 1.03). Household income was no longer a significant independent predictor of delirium in the multivariable model (OR:1.02, 95% CI: 0.90, 1.15). The type of medical insurance significantly mediated the association between household income and incident delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of private insurance, a social determinant of health reflecting socioeconomic status, emerged as a novel and important independent risk factor for delirium. Future efforts should consider targeting SDOH factors to prevent postoperative delirium in older adults.
