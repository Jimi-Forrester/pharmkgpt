19001349|t|The first therapeutic game specifically designed and evaluated for Alzheimer's disease.
19001349|a|The first therapeutic game specifically developed for Alzheimer's disease was evaluated on an NIH grant. It was hypothesized that the game would have a positive influence on factors influencing quality of life (eg, mood, pleasure, interest in activities) and family comfort level in visiting. The study used a single group, within-participants, design, and 2 control conditions including a family visit as usual. The Observed Emotion Rating Scale for assessing individuals with Alzheimer's disease was administered with a questionnaire for the family to provide their own evaluation. Reduction of signs of depression/sadness using the game were statistically significant. An increase in patient pleasure was highly significant (P < .0001). Increases in patient interest, patient satisfaction, and family member satisfaction were all highly significant (P < .0001). The qualitative appeal of the game to family members was very high. The game provides a meaningful one-on-one intervention for individuals with advanced dementia.
