25210455|t|A positive correlation between serum amyloid beta levels and depressive symptoms among community-dwelling elderly individuals in Japan.
25210455|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid beta (Abeta) levels have been associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As depression is common before the onset of AD, serum Abeta levels could be associated with depressive symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum Abeta levels are associated with depressive symptoms and/or cognitive function in community-dwelling elderly individuals. METHODS: We examined the association between serum Abeta levels and depression among 419 Japanese community-dwelling elderly individuals aged 60 years and over. Subjects were divided into two subgroups: younger elderly between 60 and 69 years old and older elderly over 69 years old. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to assess cognitive function, and symptoms of depression were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The ability to perform activities of daily living was evaluated using the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology Index of Competence. Serum Abeta levels were measured with a human amyloid beta enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. RESULTS: After controlling for potential confounding variables, a multiple linear regression analysis showed that increased levels of serum Abeta40 and Abeta42 were associated with higher CES-D scores in the older elderly subgroup. Under the same condition, multiple regression showed that serum Abeta levels were not associated with MMSE scores among the total subjects, younger elderly, or older elderly. CONCLUSION: Serum Abeta levels were associated with depressive symptoms in community-dwelling elderly individuals. The present study indicates the possibility that serum Abeta may be involved in the development of late-onset depression.
