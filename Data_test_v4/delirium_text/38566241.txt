38566241|t|Association between increased systemic immune-inflammation index and postoperative delirium in older intertrochanteric fracture patients.
38566241|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), a novel inflammation index derived from the counts of circulating platelets, neutrophils and lymphocytes, has been studied in the treatment of acute cancer and ischemic stroke (AIS). However, the clinical value of the SII in postoperative delirium patients has not been further investigated. The purpose of our research was to study the incidence and preoperative risk factors for postoperative delirium (POD) and verify whether the SII could serve as a potential marker for POD in older intertrochanteric fracture patients. Finally, we created a novel nomogram for predicting POD in older patients with intertrochanteric fractures. METHODS: We enrolled elderly patients with intertrochanteric fractures who underwent proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) between February 2021 and April 2023. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were subsequently performed to confirm the risk factors and construct a nomogram model.Calibration curve and clinical decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to assess the model's fitting performance. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated for discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility. RESULTS: A total of 293 patients were eligible for inclusion in the study, 25.6% (75/293) of whom had POD. The POD patients had higher SII values than the non-POD patients. The SII was strongly correlated with POD in older intertrochanteric fracture patients, and the optimal cutoff value was 752.6 x 109. Multivariate analysis revealed that age, diabetes, total albumin, SII > 752.6 x 109 and a CRP > 20.25 mg/L were independent risk factors for POD patients. By incorporating these 5 factors, the model achieved a concordance index of 0.745 (95% CI, 0.683-0.808) and had a well-fitted calibration curve and good clinical application value. CONCLUSION: The SII is a simple and valuable biomarker for POD, and the new nomogram model can be used to accurately predict the occurrence of POD. They can be utilized in clinical practice to identify those at high risk of POD in older intertrochanteric fracture patients.
