35781601|a|Optical molecular imaging and image-guided theranostics benefit from special and specific imaging agents, for which aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) have been regarded as good candidates in many biomedical applications. They display a large Stokes shift, high quantum yield, good biocompatibility, and resistance to photobleaching. Neurological diseases are becoming a substantial burden on individuals and society that affect over 50 million people worldwide. It is urgently needed to explore in more detail the brain structure and function, learn more about pathological processes of neurological diseases, and develop more efficient approaches for theranostics. Many AIEgens have been successfully designed, synthesized, and further applied for molecular imaging and image-guided theranostics in neurological diseases such as cerebrovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, and brain tumor, which help us understand more about the pathophysiological state of brain through noninvasive optical imaging approaches. Herein, we focus on representative AIEgens investigated on brain vasculature imaging and theranostics in neurological diseases including cerebrovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, and brain tumor. Considering different imaging modalities and various therapeutic functions, AIEgens have great potential to broaden neurological research and meet urgent needs in clinical practice. It will be inspiring to develop more practical and versatile AIEgens as molecular imaging agents for preclinical and clinical use on neurological diseases.
