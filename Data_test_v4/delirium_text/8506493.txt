8506493|a|Physicians should question their elderly patients and those who know their life-styles and habits best (ie, family, friends, caretakers) regarding use of over-the-counter medications. Salicylates are commonly used by the elderly, and long-term unsupervised use may lead to salicylate toxicity that can cause delirium. In the southern United States, BC and Goody's Headache Powders are widely marketed and used, and their overuse can produce salicylate intoxication.
