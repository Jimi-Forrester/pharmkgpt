27341212|a|Mitochondrial dysfunction induced by mitochondria-related beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation is increasingly being considered a novel risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. The close relationship between chronic sleep restriction (CSR) and cortical Abeta elevation was confirmed recently. By assessing frontal cortical mitochondrial function (electron microscopy manifestation, cytochrome C oxidase concentration, ATP level, and mitochondrial membrane potential) and the levels of mitochondria-related Abeta in 9-month-old adult male C57BL/6J mice subjected to CSR and as an environmental control (CO) group, we aimed to evaluate the association of CSR with mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondria-related Abeta accumulation. In this study, frontal cortical mitochondrial dysfunction was significantly more severe in CSR mice compared with CO animals. Furthermore, CSR mice showed higher mitochondria-associated Abeta, total Abeta, and mitochondria-related beta-amyloid protein precursor (AbetaPP) levels compared with CO mice. In the CSR model, mouse frontal cortical mitochondrial dysfunction was correlated with mitochondria-associated Abeta and mitochondria-related AbetaPP levels. However, frontal cortical mitochondria-associated Abeta levels showed no significant association with cortical total Abeta and mitochondrial AbetaPP concentrations. These findings indicated that CSR-induced frontal cortical mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondria-related Abeta accumulation, which was closely related to mitochondrial dysfunction under CSR.
