38583014|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyse the incidence and influencing factors of delirium during recovery in urological postoperative patients undergoing sevoflurane anaesthesia. METHODS: The clinical data of patients undergoing sevoflurane anaesthesia in the urology surgery department in our hospital from January 2022 to December 2022 were retrospectively analysed. The incidence of delirium during the recovery period was recorded by using the Chinese version of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) for Severity of Delirium after surgery, and the patients were divided into occurrence and non-occurrence groups. Whether delirium occurred during recovery was determined through univariate analysis. In binary logistic regression analysis, the occurrence of emergence delirium was the dependent variable, and the variables with statistical differences in the univariate analysis were the independent variables. The influencing factors of emergence delirium in post-urological surgery patients who underwent sevoflurane anaesthesia were determined. RESULTS: Delirium during recovery occurred in 10 of 100 patients (10.00%). Odds ratio (OR) of age (OR = 1.445, p = 0.022), history of diabetes (OR = 1.798, p = 0.010), operation time (OR = 1.670, p = 0.008), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification (OR = 1.740, p = 0.006) and sevoflurane inhalation concentration (OR = 1.890, p = 0.001) are the influencing factors of postoperative delirium in urologic patients undergoing sevoflurane anaesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Age, history of diabetes, operation time, ASA classification and sevoflurane inhalation concentration are the influencing factors.
