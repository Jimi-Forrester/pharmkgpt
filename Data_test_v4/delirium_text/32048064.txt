32048064|a|INTRODUCTION: The presence of microembolic signals (MES) during the acute phase of stroke is poorly understood, and its role and clinical application in relation to risk stratification and prognosis in patients remain uncertain. We assessed the prevalence of spontaneous MES in acute stroke and their relationship with risk stratification, stroke recurrence, morbidity, and mortality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study conducted in the Stroke Unit. The MES presence was evaluated by transcranial Doppler (TCD) in patients with ischemic stroke within 48 h. The outcomes (risk stratification, morbidity, mortality, and recurrence of a stroke) were followed up for 6 months. The relationship between risk stratification and MES was obtained by odds ratios and that between MES and stroke recurrence, morbidity, and mortality using multiple logistic regression; considering statistical significance at P < 0.05. RESULTS: Of the 111 patients studied, 70 were men (63.1%) and 90 were white (81.1%), with a median age of 68 years. The MES frequency was 7%. There was a significant relationship between MES and symptomatic carotid disease (OR = 22.7; 95% CI 4.1-125.7; P < 0.001), a shorter time to monitoring (OR = 12.4; 95% CI  1.4-105.4; P = 0.02), and stroke recurrence (OR = 16.83; 95% CI 2.01-141; P = .009). DISCUSSION: It was observed that the stroke recurrence adjusted for prior stroke was higher and earlier among patients with MES detection. In conclusion, MES demonstrated a significant correlation with symptomatic carotid disease and a shorter DELAY until monitoring, and could be a predictor for the early recurrence of stroke in the long term.
