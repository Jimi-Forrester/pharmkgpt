33643182|t|Considering Biological Sex in Traumatic Brain Injury.
33643182|a|Published epidemiological studies of traumatic brain injury (TBI) of all severities consistently report higher incidence in men. Recent increases in the participation of women in sports and active military service as well as increasing awareness of the very large number of women who sustain but do not report TBI as a result of intimate partner violence (IPV) suggest that the number of women with TBI is significantly larger than previously believed. Women are also grossly under-represented in clinical and natural history studies of TBI, most of which include relatively small numbers of women, ignore the role of sex- and age-related gonadal hormone levels, and report conflicting results. The emerging picture from recent studies powered to detect effects of biological sex as well as age (as a surrogate of hormonal status) suggest young (i.e., premenopausal) women are more likely to die from TBI relative to men of the same age group, but this is reversed in the 6th and 7th decades of life, coinciding with postmenopausal status in women. New data from concussion studies in young male and female athletes extend this finding to mild TBI, since female athletes who sustained mild TBI are significantly more likely to report more symptoms than males. Studies including information on gonadal hormone status at the time of injury are still too scarce and small to draw reliable conclusions, so there is an urgent need to include biological sex and gonadal hormone status in the design and analysis of future studies of TBI.
