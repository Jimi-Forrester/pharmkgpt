28330544|a|Behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia are common. The symptoms include anxiety, depression, and psychosis, thus mimicking delirium. A thorough somatic examination, including current medication, is therefore very important before initiating any treatment. If behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia is established, first-line treatment is non-pharmacological addressing possible needs and psychosocial problems. Only if this treatment is insufficient, pharmacological treatment can be considered. Psychopharmacological treatment is often of little benefit and with significant side effects.
