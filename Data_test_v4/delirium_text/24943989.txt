24943989|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: N-truncated pyroglutamate (pGlu)-amyloid-beta [Abeta(3-40/42)] peptides are key components that promote Abeta peptide accumulation, leading to neurodegeneration and memory loss in Alzheimer's disease. Because Abeta deposition in the brain occurs in an activity-dependent manner, it is important to define the subcellular organelle for pGlu-Abeta(3-40/42) production by glutaminyl cyclase (QC) and their colocalization with full-length Abeta(1-40/42) peptides for activity-dependent, regulated secretion. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that pGlu-Abeta and QC are colocalized with Abeta in dense-core secretory vesicles (DCSV) for activity-dependent secretion with neurotransmitters. METHODS: Purified DCSV were assessed for pGlu-Abeta(3-40/42), Abeta(1-40/42), QC, and neurotransmitter secretion. Neuron-like chromaffin cells were analyzed for cosecretion of pGlu-Abeta, QC, Abeta, and neuropeptides. The cells were treated with a QC inhibitor, and pGlu-Abeta production was measured. Human neuroblastoma cells were also examined for pGlu-Abeta and QC secretion. RESULTS: Isolated DCSV contain pGlu-Abeta(3-40/42), QC, and Abeta(1-40/42) with neuropeptide and catecholamine neurotransmitters. Cellular pGlu-Abeta and QC undergo activity-dependent cosecretion with Abeta and enkephalin and galanin neurotransmitters. The QC inhibitor decreased the level of secreted pGlu-Abeta. The human neuroblastoma cells displayed regulated secretion of pGlu-Abeta that was colocalized with QC. CONCLUSIONS: pGlu-Abeta and QC are present with Abeta in DCSV and undergo activity-dependent, regulated cosecretion with neurotransmitters.
