34228317|t|Intervention of companion clowns in a special care unit: a 1-year pilot study.
34228317|a|AIMS: Our 1-year pilot study aims to compare Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSDs): number and frequency, globally an in sub-domains, and distress, of 20 residents with dementia, during periods with companion clown intervention and BPSDs during periods without companion clown intervention. METHODS: A duo of accompanying clowns intervened 24 times for a total of 72 h (two interventions of 3 h each per week for 4 weeks, 3 months of the year spaced 13 weeks apart) in the Special Care Unit. This unit was dedicated to residents with severe BPSDs. BPSDs were measured monthly by Health Care Professional using Neuro-Psychiatric Inventory (NPI). RESULTS: Baseline NPI total score of the 20 residents (10 women, mean age 76.9 years; standard deviation, SD 8.1, 70.6% with Alzheimer's disease) was 37.5 (SD =  +- 19.7). The total score of the NPI was not significantly different between the periods with the clowns (median total score at 63; 25p-75p = 57-67) and the periods without the clowns (59; 25p-75p = 43-76) (p = 0.08). Compared to the period without clowns, residents presented significantly fewer delusions, hallucinations, euphoria, aberrant motor behavior but significantly more depression, apathy, disinhibition and more appetite disorders (all p value < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed on the distress the symptoms caused on the HCP during periods with the clowns. CONCLUSION: Accompanying clowns may not significantly reduce the overall BPSD of the residents, but may have beneficial effects in some behavioral issues.
