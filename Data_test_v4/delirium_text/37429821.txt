37429821|t|Structure-Activity Relationships, Tolerability and Efficacy of Microtubule-Active 1,2,4-Triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines as Potential Candidates to Treat Human African Trypanosomiasis.
37429821|a|Tubulin and microtubules (MTs) are potential protein targets to treat parasitic infections and our previous studies have shown that the triazolopyrimidine (TPD) class of MT-active compounds hold promise as antitrypanosomal agents. MT-targeting TPDs include structurally related but functionally diverse congeners that interact with mammalian tubulin at either one or two distinct interfacial binding sites; namely, the seventh and vinca sites, which are found within or between alpha,beta-tubulin heterodimers, respectively. Evaluation of the activity of 123 TPD congeners against cultured Trypanosoma brucei enabled a robust quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model and the prioritization of two congeners for in vivo pharmacokinetics (PK), tolerability and efficacy studies. Treatment of T. brucei-infected mice with tolerable doses of TPDs 3 and 4 significantly decreased blood parasitemia within 24 h. Further, two once-weekly doses of 4 at 10 mg/kg significantly extended the survival of infected mice relative to infected animals treated with vehicle. Further optimization of dosing and/or the dosing schedule of these CNS-active TPDs may provide alternative treatments for human African trypanosomiasis.
