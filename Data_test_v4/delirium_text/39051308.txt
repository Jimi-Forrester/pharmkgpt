39051308|t|The Prevalence of ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction in Patients Presenting in the Emergency Service of Galati Hospital from 2015 to 2019.
39051308|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of cardiovascular emergencies and the relationships between these emergencies and the personal medical histories of patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is retrospective, observational, and longitudinal, spanning five years from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2019. Descriptive elements were observed and recorded to conduct statistical analysis on the cardiovascular characteristics of 723 patients transported by air and treated at the Emergency County Hospital of Galati, Romania. RESULTS: Cardiovascular disease is a complex condition that often originates in the heart and presents with a variety of symptoms. Deaths related to cardiovascular diseases outnumber cancer-related deaths in both men and women worldwide. The one-year mortality rate for patients admitted to the hospital with acute pulmonary edema can be as high as 40%. Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death and disability in the Western world and globally. CONCLUSIONS: The highest prevalence of cardiovascular diseases was noted in 2016, particularly among elderly men, who appear to be more affected by these conditions, while liver disease was minimal. In our study, the most prevalent cardiovascular disease was ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Gender plays a role in the risk of cardiovascular emergencies, with men being at a higher risk of developing life-threatening conditions. Additionally, there is a linear increase in risk with age for developing these pathologies.
