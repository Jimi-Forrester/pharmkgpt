33375461|t|Endothelial Dysfunction in Diabetes Is Aggravated by Glycated Lipoproteins; Novel Molecular Therapies.
33375461|a|Diabetes and its vascular complications affect an increasing number of people. This disease of epidemic proportion nowadays involves abnormalities of large and small blood vessels, all commencing with alterations of the endothelial cell (EC) functions. Cardiovascular diseases are a major cause of death and disability among diabetic patients. In diabetes, EC dysfunction (ECD) is induced by the pathological increase of glucose and by the appearance of advanced glycation end products (AGE) attached to the plasma proteins, including lipoproteins. AGE proteins interact with their specific receptors on EC plasma membrane promoting activation of signaling pathways, resulting in decreased nitric oxide bioavailability, increased intracellular oxidative and inflammatory stress, causing dysfunction and finally apoptosis of EC. Irreversibly glycated lipoproteins (AGE-Lp) were proven to have an important role in accelerating atherosclerosis in diabetes. The aim of the present review is to present up-to-date information connecting hyperglycemia, ECD and two classes of glycated Lp, glycated low-density lipoproteins and glycated high-density lipoproteins, which contribute to the aggravation of diabetes complications. We will highlight the role of dyslipidemia, oxidative and inflammatory stress and epigenetic risk factors, along with the specific mechanisms connecting them, as well as the new promising therapies to alleviate ECD in diabetes.
