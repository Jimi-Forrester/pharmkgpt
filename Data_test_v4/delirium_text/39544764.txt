39544764|a|OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the impact of intraoperative dexmedetomidine on myocardial injury markers (heart-type fatty acid binding protein [H-FABP], creatine kinase-mb [CK-MB], and cardiac troponin I [cTnI]) and postoperative delirium in patients undergoing heart valve replacement. METHODS: Clinical data from 160 cardiac patients who underwent heart valve replacement with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) between January 2019 and January 2024 were analyzed. Patients were divided into an observation group (n = 82) receiving dexmedetomidine and a control group (n = 78) without dexmedetomidine. After propensity score matching, both groups comprised 53 patients each. Outcome measures included myocardial injury markers, postoperative delirium incidence, and perioperative parameters. RESULTS: The observation group showed shorter postoperative recovery durations, reduced intraoperative sufentanil requirements, and lower myocardial injury markers 1 day postoperatively (all P < 0.001). No significant differences were found in midazolam dosages (all P > 0.05), while propofol and sufentanil dosages were lower in the observation group (both P < 0.001). The incidence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in the observation group (P = 0.014), with cardioversion time and propofol dosage identified as delirium risk factors. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine use during heart valve replacement surgery was associated with improved postoperative outcome, including reduced myocardial injury and lower postoperative delirium incidence. These findings suggest a potential role for dexmedetomidine in enhancing patient recovery, although further research is needed to explain its impact on postoperative delirium.
