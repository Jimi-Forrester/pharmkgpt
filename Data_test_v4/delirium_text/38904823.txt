38904823|a|BACKGROUND: Noise pollution in the operating room can have adverse effects on the physical and mental well-being of patients. Since the mid-20th century, music therapy has been increasingly used in clinical practice. Soothing music has a beneficial effect in maintaining the efficacy of intraoperative sedation and regulating patients' emotions. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of soothing music on the intraoperative management of patients undergoing tension-free herniorrhaphy. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 244 patients who underwent open tension-free herniorrhaphy under local anesthesia at the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from June 2019 to May 2021. According to the different included time periods, the hospital implemented soothing music management from June 2020 to May 2021, and 110 patients admitted during this period were classified as the study group. One hundred thirty-four patients who underwent clinical routine management from June 2019 to May 2020 were classified as the control group. The patients in the two groups received corresponding management modes during surgery. The perioperative indicators, stress response, anxiety, depression, and clinical efficacy of the two groups were analyzed. RESULTS: No significant differences in the operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative off-bed activity time, and hospitalization time between the two groups (P > 0.05). The study group exhibited lower postoperative cortisol (213.30 (203.40, 229.00) nmol/L) and anxiety (9.00 (7.00, 12.00) points) levels than the control group (246.85 (230.50, 258.40) nmol/L; 14.00 (12.00, 15.00) points) (P < 0.001). Moreover, no significant differences were noted in the norepinephrine and depression levels and the severity of illness, global improvement, and efficacy index scores between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Soothing music therapy, as a clinical auxiliary method, has a positive impact on the intraoperative management of patients undergoing open tension-free herniorrhaphy, leading to reduced cortisol levels and alleviation of anxiety.
