38136179|a|In this paper, the seeds and rinds of passion fruit, which are the agricultural waste of juice processing, were recycled to investigate their biological activities for sustainable use. De-oiled seed powders (S) were successively extracted by refluxing 95% ethanol (95E), 50E, and hot water (HW), respectively, to obtain S-95EE, S-50EE, and S-HWE. Dried rind powders were successively extracted by refluxing HW and 95E to obtain rind-HWE and rind-95EE, respectively. S-50EE and S-95EE showed the most potent extracts, such as anti-amyloid-beta1-42 aggregations and anti-acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and they exhibited neuroprotective activities against amyloid-beta25-35-treated or H2O2-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Scirpusin B and piceatannol were identified in S-95EE, S-50EE, and rind-HWE, and they showed anti-acetylcholinesterase activity at 50% inhibitory concentrations of 62.9 and 258.9 muM, respectively. Daily pretreatments of de-oiled seed powders and rind-HWE (600 mg/kg), S-95EE, and S-50EE (250 mg/kg) or scirpusin B (40 mg/kg) for 7 days resulted in improved learning behavior in passive avoidance tests and had significant differences (p < 0.05) compared with those of the control in scopolamine-induced ICR mice. The seeds and rinds of passion fruit will be recycled as materials for the development of functional foods, promoting neuroprotection and delaying the onset of cognitive dysfunctions.
