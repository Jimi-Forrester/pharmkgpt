35221605|a|The high spread rate, severe symptoms, psychological and neurological problems, and unavailability of effective medicines are the major factors making Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a massive threat to the world. It is thought that COVID-19 causes mild symptoms or mild infectious illness in children. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of serious complications such as the multisystem inflammatory syndrome. COVID-19 induces mild to severe neurological problems in children, such as stroke, encephalopathy, mild shortness of breath, and myalgia. The development of these conditions is associated with pro-inflammatory responses and cytokine storms, which alter the physiology of the blood-brain barrier and allow the virus to enter the brain. Despite the viral entry into the brain, these neurological conditions can also be caused indirectly by severe immune responses. In this article, we describe COVID-19 and the associated neurological and immunological complications in children.
