38507844|a|Endocannabinoid system plays a pivotal role in controlling neuroinflammation, and modulating this system may not only aid in managing symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Multiple sclerosis, Epilepsy, Central and Peripheral neuropathic pain, but also, have the potential to target these diseases at an early-stage. In the present study, six different pharmacophore hypotheses were generated from Cannabidiol (CBD)-Cannabinoid Receptor subtype-2 (CB2) and then Zinc database was screened for identification of hit molecules. Identified 215 hit molecules were subjected to preliminary screening with ADMET and drug likeness properties, and about 48 molecules were found with no violations and toxicity properties. In molecular docking studies, six compounds showed better binding energy than CBD and beta-caryophyllene (known inhibitor of CB2). These six molecules were designated as leads and subjected to re-docking with glide tool and Lead1 (ZINC000078815430) showed docking score of -9.877 kcal/mol, whereas CBD and beta-caryophyllene showed score of -9.664 and -8.499 kcal/mol, respectively. Lead1 and CBD were evaluated for stability studies with Desmond tool by molecular dynamic simulation studies. Lead1 showed better stability than CBD in all studied parameters such as RMSD, RMSF, SSE, Rg, SASA, etc. In MM-GBSA free energy calculations, DeltaGbinding energy of CB2-CBD complex and CB2-Lead1 were found to be -103.13+-11.19 and -107.94+-5.42 kcal/mol, respectively. Six lead molecules stated in the study hold promise with respect to CBD agonistic activity for treating and/or managing chronic conditions and can be explored as an alternative for early-stage cure, which has not yet been experimentally explored.
