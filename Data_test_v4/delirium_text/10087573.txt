10087573|a|OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: 106 patients (64.2% male and 35.8% female) who applied for a withdrawal treatment by phone call, were interviewed concerning the admission context with the aim to find out whether the admission regulations prevent patients from undergoing treatment. RESULTS: 72.6% of all patients were admitted as inpatients. The average waiting period was 8 days. 15.1% were known to have previously suffered from conclusions and 4.7% from delirium tremens; for these patients, the waiting period was significantly shorter. CONCLUSIONS: High-threshold admission is not an insurmountable difficulty. Waiting periods and soberness at admission are accepted. Setting up admission conditions is, on the one hand, justified, whereas on the other hand chronic patients are often not reached. Telephone contacts with patients willing to undergo treatment should be replaced by contacts in an outpatient setting.
