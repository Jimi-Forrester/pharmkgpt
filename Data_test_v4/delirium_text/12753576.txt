12753576|a|The purpose of the present paper was to determine the possible mechanism of delirium by using xenon-enhanced computed tomography to measure the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of the patients both during delirium and after improvement from delirium. The rCBF measurements of the frontal, temporal and occipital cortex during delirium ranged from 31.4 to 39.6 mL/100 g per min; the rCBF of the thalamus and basal ganglia ranged from 47.5 to 52.4 mL/100 g per min. After recovery from delirium the rCBF of both areas returned to normal. The findings that reduced rCBF during delirium becomes normal once delirium improves suggest that a possible cause of delirium may be the cerebral hypoperfusion.
