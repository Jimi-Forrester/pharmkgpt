39044986|a|Background: beta-thalassemia major is microcytic hypochromic anemia disorder inherited from parents, resulting from a mutation in the beta-globin locus. As a result, a quantitative defective hemoglobin synthesis and relative excess in alpha-globin is occurred. As such, frequent blood transfusion is required, that leads to iron overload. Iron overload results in several pathological complications, including cell death, tissue injury, organ dysfunction, and liver fibrosis. The present study examined the effectiveness of nigella Sativa and manuka honey combination or manuka honey alone to the conventional therapy (Deferasirox + blood transfusion) used for preventing and managing iron overload in pediatric beta-thalassemia major patients. Methods: One hundred sixty-five patients participated in this randomized, double-blind, standard therapy-controlled, parallel-design multisite trial. The patients were randomly allocated into three groups, receiving either 500 mg nigella sativa oil combined with manuka honey lozenge (344 mg) daily or manuka honey alone plus the conventional therapy for ten treatment months. Ferritin level, serum iron, transferrin saturation, total iron binding capacity, alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase were determined at baseline and month 10. Results: Eventually, serum ferritin and iron were decreased significantly in the nigella sativa + manuka honey group as compared with the control group. Other clinical parameters were significantly impacted. The level of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase were significantly decreased in the nigella sativa plus manuka honey group compared with the control group. Conclusion: Results showed that nigella sativa plus manuka honey was more effective than manuka alone or the conventional treatment alone in managing iron overload of beta-thalassemia major patients.
