36440267|t|Identification of hub genes of Parkinson's disease through bioinformatics analysis.
36440267|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease, and there is still a lack of effective diagnostic and treatment methods. This study aimed to search for hub genes that might serve as diagnostic or therapeutic targets for PD. All the analysis was performed in R software. The expression profile data of PD (number: GSE7621) was acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with PD were screened by the "Limma" package of the R software. Key genes associated with PD were screened by the "WGCNA" package of the R software. Target genes were screened by merging the results of "Limma" and "WGCNA." Enrichment analysis of target genes was performed by Gene Ontology (GO), Disease Ontology (DO), and Kyoto Enrichment of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Machine learning algorithms were employed to screen for hub genes. Nomogram was constructed using the "rms" package. And the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was plotted to detect and validate our prediction model sensitivity and specificity. Additional expression profile data of PD (number: GSE20141) was acquired from the GEO database to validate the nomogram. GSEA was used to determine the biological functions of the hub genes. Finally, RPL3L, PLEK2, PYCRL, CD99P1, LOC100133130, MELK, LINC01101, and DLG3-AS1 were identified as hub genes of PD. These findings can provide a new direction for the diagnosis and treatment of PD.
