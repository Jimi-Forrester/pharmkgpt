21388376|t|Proteomic study of the toxic effect of oligomeric Abeta1-42 in situ prepared from 'iso-Abeta1-42'.
21388376|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of neurodegenerative disorders even so the exact pathomechanism is still unclear. Recently, it is widely accepted that amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) toxicity is positively linked to Abeta oligomers, which may be responsible for the initiation of AD. For this reason, AD research requires well defined aggregation state and structure of Abeta. Precursor peptide 'iso-Abeta1-42' makes it possible to use Abeta1-42 with well- defined aggregation state for in vitro and in vivo experiments. The aim of this study was to identify protein expression changes from differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells after treatment with oligomeric Abeta1-42 prepared in situ from 'iso-Abeta1-42'. In our experiment, a cell viability assay revealed a strong and time-dependent toxic effect of oligomeric Abeta1-42 which was supported by dramatic morphological changes. Our proteomics study also revealed numerous significant protein expression changes (22 proteins down- and 25 proteins up-regulated) after comparison of the untreated and Abeta1-42-treated cell lysates by two-dimensional electrophoresis. From the functional classification of the identified proteins, we found deregulations of proteins involved in metabolic processes, cytoskeleton organisation and protein biosynthesis and a huge number of up-regulated stress proteins displayed oligomeric Abeta1-42-induced cell stress.
