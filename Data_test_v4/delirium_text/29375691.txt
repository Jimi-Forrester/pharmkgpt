29375691|a|Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and autophagy activation play important roles in the process of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The synergistic protective effects of Geniposide and ursodeoxycholic acid against cellular apoptosis caused by oxygen-glucose deprivation-reoxygenation (OGD/R) were investigated using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, flow cytometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and western blotting to examine cellular viability, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, mRNA and protein levels, respectively, in relation to ERS and autophagy. We found that pretreatment with Geniposide improved cellular viability. Moreover, treatment with a combination of Geniposide and Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) (GT) protected injured cells better than Geniposide alone. Further studies showed that the increase in cellular ROS levels, and the overexpression of mRNA and proteins related to OGD/R-induced ERS and autophagy, were both counteracted by GT. Our study indicates that the protective effects of GT on OGD/R-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells are associated with the inhibition of ERS and autophagy.
