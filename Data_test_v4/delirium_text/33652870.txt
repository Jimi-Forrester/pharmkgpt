33652870|t|Targeting Microglia-Synapse Interactions in Alzheimer's Disease.
33652870|a|In this review, we focus on the emerging roles of microglia in the brain, with particular attention to synaptic plasticity in health and disease. We present evidence that ramified microglia, classically believed to be "resting" (i.e., inactive), are instead strongly implicated in dynamic and plastic processes. Indeed, there is an intimate relationship between microglia and neurons at synapses which modulates activity-dependent functional and structural plasticity through the release of cytokines and growth factors. These roles are indispensable to brain development and cognitive function. Therefore, approaches aimed at maintaining the ramified state of microglia might be critical to ensure normal synaptic plasticity and cognition. On the other hand, inflammatory signals associated with Alzheimer's disease are able to modify the ramified morphology of microglia, thus leading to synapse loss and dysfunction, as well as cognitive impairment. In this context, we highlight microglial TREM2 and CSF1R as emerging targets for disease-modifying therapy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders.
