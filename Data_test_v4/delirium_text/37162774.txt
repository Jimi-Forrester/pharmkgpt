37162774|t|Peripheral Neuropathy Secondary to Ertapenem Administration for Treatment of Infectious Endocarditis.
37162774|a|Ertapenem is a widely used broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic active against most species of gram-negative and gram-positive aerobes and anaerobes with specific targeting of the Amp C extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. It is advantageous for its once-daily dosing via IM or IV administration and minimal side effect profile for the treatment of community-acquired infections. We report an 80-year-old man presenting with reversible peripheral neuropathy following the administration and subsequent discontinuation of ertapenem for the treatment of acute infectious endocarditis. It is especially notable that our patient had less severe (i.e., stage 3) chronic kidney disease as opposed to current literature which only presents similar findings with more advanced kidney disease (stage 4-5). Upon cessation of ertapenem administration, our patient recovered to his baseline motor and sensory status over a period of four days. We believe there to be value in reporting this case, as well as value in reevaluating the current recommendations for ertapenem dosing in those with kidney compromise.
