34102919|a|Cerebral hypoperfusion is thought to contribute to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, but the natural trajectory of cerebral perfusion in cognitively healthy adults has not been well-studied. This longitudinal study is consisted of 950 participants (40-89 years), who were cognitively unimpaired at their first visit. We investigated the age-related changes in cerebral perfusion, and their associations with APOE-genotype, biological sex, and cardiometabolic measurements. During the follow-up period (range 0.13-8.24 years), increasing age was significantly associated with decreasing cerebral perfusion, in total gray-matter (beta=-1.43), hippocampus (-1.25), superior frontal gyrus (-1.70), middle frontal gyrus (-1.99), posterior cingulate (-2.46), and precuneus (-2.14), with all P-values < 0.01. Compared with male-e4 carriers, female-e4 carriers showed a faster decline in global and regional cerebral perfusion with increasing age, whereas the age-related decline in cerebral perfusion was similar between male- and female-e4 non-carriers. Worse cardiometabolic profile (i.e., increased blood pressure, body mass index, total cholesterol, and blood glucose) was associated with lower cerebral perfusion at all the visits. When time-varying cardiometabolic measurements were adjusted in the model, the synergistic effect of sex and APOE-e4 on age-related cerebral perfusion-trajectories became largely attenuated. Our findings demonstrate that APOE-genotype and sex interactively impact cerebral perfusion-trajectories in mid- to late-life. This effect may be partially explained by cardiometabolic alterations.
