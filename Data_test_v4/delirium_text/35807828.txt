35807828|t|Bioavailability of Hesperidin and Its Aglycone Hesperetin-Compounds Found in Citrus Fruits as a Parameter Conditioning the Pro-Health Potential (Neuroprotective and Antidiabetic Activity)-Mini-Review.
35807828|a|Hesperidin and hesperetin are polyphenols that can be found predominantly in citrus fruits. They possess a variety of pharmacological properties such as neuroprotective and antidiabetic activity. However, the bioavailability of these compounds is limited due to low solubility and restricts their use as pro-healthy agents. This paper described the limitations resulting from the low bioavailability of the presented compounds and gathered the methods aiming at its improvement. Moreover, this work reviewed studies providing pieces of evidence for neuroprotective and antidiabetic properties of hesperidin and hesperetin as well as providing a detailed look into the significance of reported modes of action in chronic diseases. On account of a well-documented pro-healthy activity, it is important to look for ways to overcome the problem of poor bioavailability.
