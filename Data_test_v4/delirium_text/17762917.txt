17762917|a|The Alzheimer's disease neurotoxic amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide is derived from the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is the principal component of the senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. This mechanism by which A beta mediates neurotoxicity or neuronal dysfunction is not fully resolved. This review will outline some of the key determinants that modulate A beta's activity and the cellular pathways and mechanisms involved.
