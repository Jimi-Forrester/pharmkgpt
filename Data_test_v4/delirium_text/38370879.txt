38370879|t|2023 Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Insomnia in Adults - Brazilian Sleep Association.
38370879|a|Chronic insomnia disorder (simplified in this document as insomnia) is an increasingly common clinical condition in society and a frequent complaint at the offices of different areas of health practice (particularly Medicine and Psychology). This scenario has been accompanied by a significant evolution in treatment, as well as challenges in approaching patients in an appropriately way. This clinical guideline, coordinated by the Brazilian Sleep Association and the Brazilian Association of Sleep Medicine and counting on the active participation of various specialists in the area, encompasses an update on the diagnosis and treatment of insomnia in adults. To this end, it followed a structured methodology. Topics of interest related to diagnosis were written based on theoretical framework, evidence in the literature, and professional experience. As for the topics related to the treatment of insomnia, a series of questions were developed based on the PICO acronym (P - Patient, problem, or population; I - Intervention; C - Comparison, control, or comparator; O - Outcome). The work groups defined the eligible options within each of these parameters. Regarding pharmacological interventions, only the ones currently available in Brazil or possibly becoming available in the upcoming years were considered eligible. Systematic reviews were conducted to help prepare the texts and define the level of evidence for each intervention. The final result is an objective and practical document providing recommendations with the best scientific support available to professionals involved in the management of insomnia.
