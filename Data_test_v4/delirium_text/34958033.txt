However, the abnormal dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) in both white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) from the left and right hippocampus remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To explore the abnormal DFC within WM and GM from the left and right hippocampus across the different stages of AD. METHODS: Current study employed the OASIS-3 dataset including 43 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 71 pre-mild cognitive impairment (pre-MCI), and matched 87 normal cognitive (NC). Adopting the FMRIB's Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool, we obtained the left and right hippocampus mask. Based on above hippocampus mask as seed point, we calculated the DFC between left/right hippocampus and all voxel time series within whole brain. One-way ANOVA analysis was performed to estimate the abnormal DFC among MCI, pre-MCI, and NC groups. RESULTS: We found that MCI and pre-MCI groups showed the common abnormalities of DFC in the Temporal_Mid_L, Cingulum_Mid_L, and Thalamus_L. Specific abnormalities were found in the Cerebelum_9_L and Precuneus of MCI group and Vermis_8 and Caudate_L of pre-MCI group. In addition, we found that DFC within WM regions also showed the common low DFC for the Cerebellum anterior lobe-WM, Corpus callosum, and Frontal lobe-WM in MCI and pre-MCI group. CONCLUSION: Our findings provided a novel information for discover the pathophysiological mechanisms of AD and indicate WM lesions were also an important cause of cognitive decline in AD.
