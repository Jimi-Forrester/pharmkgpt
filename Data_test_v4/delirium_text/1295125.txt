1295125|t|[Comparison of tacrine hepatotoxicity in patients with Alzheimer disease or AIDS].
1295125|a|Previously used in Alzheimer disease Tacrine (THA): tetrahydroaminoacridine has shown a rise of hepatic transaminase enzyme activity (TEA) in 18% of patients for Summers and 19% for Ames. Although studies using THA from USA or Canada have noticed a rise of TEA in 30% of the patients, after a treatment course with French THA we also have noted a rise of TEA in 12% of the Alzheimer patients. However, these secondary effects yielded to the end of treatment. These studies have been done with THA from different origins and different associations. Summers, the Canadian group and the French one have used THA in association with lecithin, when american group study has been made with no additional product. Therefore we have initiated a trial with oral THA in AIDS patients. 52 patients with HIV infection (26 in the IVC1 group and 26 in IVC2 group) have been treated with the same THA as the one used for Alzheimer french group. The common dosage was 150 to 200 mg (3 to 4 of 50 mg dosing capsules per day). The THA has been synthetized such as having an over 99% pureness product. After a period of 260 months/patient no elevation of TEA has been noted in any patients of our group. These results observed in HIV advanced patients with this THA are discordant with the one observed in Alzheimer's study. The dosage used in AIDS is twice higher than the one used for Alzheimer which gives us credit to the lack of hepatic toxicity in HIV advanced patient after 7 months of treatment.
