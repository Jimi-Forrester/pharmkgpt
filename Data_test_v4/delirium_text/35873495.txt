35873495|t|A Comprehensive Analysis of Pyroptosis-Related lncRNAs Signature Associated With Prognosis and Tumor Immune Microenvironment of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.
35873495|a|Background: Globally, pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is a common and highly devastating gastrointestinal malignancy that seriously threatens human health. Pyroptosis refers to an emerging form of programmed cell death that has been discovered in recent years, and studies have demonstrated that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) may act as a moderator in the pyroptosis process of cancer cells. However, relevant explorations about lncRNAs and pyroptosis are still insufficient in PAAD. Therefore, our research is designed to make a comprehensive analysis of the potential values of pyroptosis-related lncRNAs in PAAD. Methods: By integrating the RNA-sequencing, somatic mutation, and copy number variation (CNV) datasets, as well as the clinicopathological features, we established and validated a risk signature based on pyroptosis-related lncRNAs, and comprehensively analyzed its clinical significance and the potential connection with the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Consequences: The genetic variation landscape displayed that the somatic mutations were rare while CNV changes were general and mainly concentrated on copy number amplification of these 52 pyroptosis-related genes. Subsequently, a risk signature consisting of 10 lncRNAs (TRAF3IP2-AS1, LINC00519, LINC01133, LINC02251, AC005332.6, AL590787.1, AC090114.2, TRPC7-AS1, MIR223HG, and MIR3142HG) was constructed and patients were divided into different subgroups according to the median risk score; patients with high-risk scores presented worse outcomes compared to those with low-risk scores in the training, testing, and entire cohorts. Furthermore, patients at low-risk scores possessed a higher infiltration abundance of immune cells compared with high-risk patients, which was consistent with the expression levels of lncRNAs between the high/low-risk groups. Drug sensitivity analysis showed that low-risk scores were related to anti-cancer agents like AICAR and Axitinib, whereas high-risk scores were connected with certain drugs such as AUY922. These results demonstrated that our risk signature could be used for prognosis prediction; additionally, it was also related to the TIME that might act as a potential indicator to instruct immunotherapeutic strategies. Conclusion: This work explored the significance of the risk model constructed by pyroptosis-related lncRNAs in prognosis prediction and its internal link with the immune microenvironment of PAAD. The results are expected to assist in the diagnosis, prognostic assessment, and management of patients with PAAD.
