35087161|a|The third isoform of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX3) is crucial for a physiological fine-tuning of the Ca2+ fluxes in excitable tissues. In this view, the NCX3 accounts for the aberrant Ca2+ influx seen during neuronal excitotoxicity, such as in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little is known about NCX3 regulation and functional properties. Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal (W. somnifera), a traditional indigenous plant widely recognized for having numerous medicinal values, was undertaken to determine its potential therapeutic benefit against aggregated Abeta1-42-induced NCX3 dysregulation and the thereof cognition impairment in 5xFAD mice. The undertaken sourced dried roots of authenticated W. somnifera physicochemical compositional tests satisfied standards of pharmacognostic quality, and further phytochemical analysis of the roots methanol extract revealed the roots constitute several antioxidants. Following an intra-gastric gavage administration of synthesized W. somnifera roots methanolic extract from postnatal day 30 (P30) to P75, in vivo cognitional studies and then neurochemical examinations of the NCX3 expression level, Abeta plaque deposition, and antioxidant activities in the AD-associated brain regions of 4-month-old 5xFAD mice suggests that the oxidative stress normalizing effects of W. somnifera constituents, operating on the NCX3, may have a therapeutic role in the improvement of cognition in AD.
