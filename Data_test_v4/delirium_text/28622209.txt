28622209|t|The "Forgotten" Treatment of Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium With Electroconvulsive Therapy: Successful Use in a Very Prolonged and Severe Case.
28622209|a|OBJECTIVE: Alcohol withdrawal delirium (AWD) is a notorious complication in alcohol withdrawal. Usually, the symptomatic treatment is efficacious; however, some patients show treatment resistance or a prolonged course of AWD. METHOD: We report the case of a patient with a prolonged and severest form of AWD. Even 11 weeks after admission, he received approximately 100 mg diazepam per week to manage the symptoms of withdrawal delirium. RESULTS: A treatment course of electroconvulsive therapy was initiated, which allowed a complete tapering off of benzodiazepines during electroconvulsive therapy without adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: The reported case might contribute to alternative approaches reserved for severest forms of prolonged AWD.
