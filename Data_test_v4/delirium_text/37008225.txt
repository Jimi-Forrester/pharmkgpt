37008225|t|A summary of the current diagnostic methods for, and exploration of the value of microRNAs as biomarkers in, sepsis-associated encephalopathy.
37008225|a|Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is an acute neurological deficit caused by severe sepsis without signs of direct brain infection, characterized by the systemic inflammation and disturbance of the blood-brain barrier. SAE is associated with a poor prognosis and high mortality in patients with sepsis. Survivors may exhibit long-term or permanent sequelae, including behavioral changes, cognitive impairment, and decreased quality of life. Early detection of SAE can help ameliorate long-term sequelae and reduce mortality. Half of the patients with sepsis suffer from SAE in the intensive care unit, but its physiopathological mechanism remains unknown. Therefore, the diagnosis of SAE remains a challenge. The current clinical diagnosis of SAE is a diagnosis of exclusion; this makes the process complex and time-consuming and delays early intervention by clinicians. Furthermore, the scoring scales and laboratory indicators involved have many problems, including insufficient specificity or sensitivity. Thus, a new biomarker with excellent sensitivity and specificity is urgently needed to guide the diagnosis of SAE. MicroRNAs have attracted attention as putative diagnostic and therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases. They exist in various body fluids and are highly stable. Based on the outstanding performance of microRNAs as biomarkers for other neurodegenerative diseases, it is reasonable to infer that microRNAs will be excellent biomarkers for SAE. This review explores the current diagnostic methods for sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). We also explore the role that microRNAs could play in SAE diagnosis and if they can be used to make the SAE diagnosis faster and more specific. We believe that our review makes a significant contribution to the literature because it summarizes some of the important diagnostic methods for SAE, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages in clinical use, and could benefit the field as it highlights the potential of miRNAs as SAE diagnostic markers.
