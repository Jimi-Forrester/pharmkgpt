38304020|t|Dose-response effects of exercise on mental health in community-dwelling older adults: Exploration of genetic moderators.
38304020|a|Background/Objective: (1) Examine the role of exercise intensity on mental health symptoms in a community-based sample of older adults. (2) Explore the moderating role of genetic variation in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) on the effects of exercise on mental health symptoms. Method: This study is a secondary analysis of a three-arm randomized controlled trial, comparing the effects of 6 months of high-intensity aerobic training vs. moderate-intensity aerobic training vs. a no-contact control group on mental health symptoms assessed using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS). The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and APOE epsilon4 carrier status were explored as genetic moderators of exercise effects on mental health symptoms. Results: The exercise intervention did not influence mental health symptoms. The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism did not moderate intervention effects on mental health symptoms. APOE epsilon4 carrier status moderated the effect of intervention group on perceived stress over 6 months, such that APOE epsilon4 carriers, but not non-carriers, in the high-intensity aerobic training group showed a decline in perceived stress over 6 months. Conclusions: APOE epsilon4 carrier status may modify the benefits of high-intensity exercise on perceived stress such that APOE epsilon4 carriers show a greater decline in stress as a result of exercise relative to non-APOE epsilon4 carriers.
