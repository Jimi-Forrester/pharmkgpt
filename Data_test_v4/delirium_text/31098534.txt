31098534|t|Older people with hip fracture transferred to intermediate care: outcomes in an integrated health and social care model.
31098534|a|Following surgery for hip fracture almost a quarter of patients do not return directly to their usual residence, using the resources within intermediate care and enablement. This was a retrospective cohort study involving 156 Salford residents admitted with hip fracture in 2015. Linked health data were collected on those discharged to intermediate care vs home in terms of readmissions, mortality, lengths of stay, delayed transfers of care, diagnoses of delirium and pre-existing forms of dementia. The median duration of the continuous care episode in the intermediate care cohort, inclusive of readmissions to hospital, was 52 days. There was a 26% (n=20) readmission rate from intermediate care. Readmission rates at 120 days were higher among those discharged to intermediate care vs home (OR 3.21, 95% CI 1.37-7.54, p=0.007) and among those with a form of dementia (OR 4.76, 95% CI 1.79-12.63, p=0.0017). Patients with delirium during their acute admission were more likely to be discharged to intermediate care (OR 5.43, 95% CI 2.36-12.47, p=0.0001) and were less likely to ultimately be discharged home (OR 6.40, 95% CI 2.25-18.21, p=0.0005), as were those with some form of dementia (OR 6.60, 95% CI 1.97-22.08, p=0.002). Measurement of the entire care episode demonstrates significant lengths of stay. Medium term readmission rates are higher in those discharged to intermediate care. Delirium and dementia are associated with higher readmission rates and lower rates of discharge to own home. It is imperative that a whole pathway approach to commissioning hip fracture services is established.
