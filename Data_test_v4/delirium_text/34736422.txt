34736422|t|Study protocol: understanding the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying delirium in older people undergoing hip fracture surgery.
34736422|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication of older people undergoing hip fracture surgery, which negatively affects clinical- and healthcare-related outcomes. Unfortunately, POD pathophysiology is still largely unknown, despite previous studies showing that neuroinflammation, neuroendocrine dysfunction, increased reactive oxidative stress (ROS), and endothelial dysfunctions may be involved. There is also evidence that many of the pathophysiological mechanisms which are involved in delirium are involved in sarcopenia too. This article describes the protocol of a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a larger one that will explore the pathophysiological mechanisms correlating POD with sarcopenia. We will analyse whether various biomarkers reflecting neuroinflammation, ROS, neuroendocrine disorders, and microvasculature lesions will be simultaneously expressed in in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and muscles of patients developing POD. METHODS: Two centres will be involved in this study, each recruiting a convenient sample of ten older patients with hip fracture. All of them will undergo a baseline Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment, which will be used to construct a Rockwood-based Frailty Index (FI). Blood samples will be collected for each patient on the day of surgery and 1 day before. Additionally, CSF and muscle fragments will be taken and given to a biologist for subsequent analyses. The presence of POD will be assessed in each patient every morning until hospital discharge using the 4AT. Delirium subtypes and severity will be assessed using the Delirium Motor Subtype Scale-4 and the Delirium-O-Meter, respectively. We will also evaluate the patient's functional status at discharge, using the Cumulated Ambulation Score. DISCUSSION: This study will be the first to correlate biomarkers of blood, CSF, and muscle in older patients with hip fracture.
