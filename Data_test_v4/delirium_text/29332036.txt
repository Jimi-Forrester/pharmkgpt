29332036|t|Relationships Between Lower Olfaction and Brain White Matter Lesions in Elderly Subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment.
29332036|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory impairment is reported in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is associated with hippocampal atrophy. In elderly people, dementia with AD neuropathology and white matter lesions (WML) is common. In this context, olfactory impairment could also depend on the presence of WML. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cross-sectional relationship between olfaction and WML in elderly subjects with MCI. METHODS: Consecutive subjects, >65 years old, diagnosed as MCI after a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment in an expert memory center, with a brain MRI performed within a year and without major depressive state, were included. Olfaction was assessed by the Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT). Two trained neuroradiologists, blind to cognitive and olfaction status, visually assessed hippocampal atrophy according to Scheltens' scale and WML according to Fazekas criteria. RESULTS: Seventy-five MCI subjects (mean age (SD) = 77.1 (6.2) years, 74.7% of women) were included. After adjustment for age and sex, factors associated with low BSIT scores were older age (p = 0.007), lower BMI (p = 0.08), lower MMSE score (p = 0.05), lower FCRST (p = 0.008), hippocampal atrophy (p = 0.04), periventricular WML (p = 0.007), and deep WML burden (p = 0.005). In multivariate analysis, severe deep WML (OR (95% CI) = 6.29 (1.4-35.13), p = 0.02) remained associated with low BSIT score independently from hippocampal atrophy. CONCLUSION: In elderly MCI subjects, low olfactory performances are associated with WML, whose progression may be slowed by vascular treatments. A longitudinal study to evaluate whether the progression of WML, hippocampal atrophy and low olfactory function, can predict accurately conversion from MCI to dementia is ongoing.
