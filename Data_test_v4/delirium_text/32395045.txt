32395045|t|The INDUSEM Position Paper on the Emerging Electronic Waste Management Emergency.
32395045|a|Electronic waste or e-waste is a serious and concerning issue globally. Exponential increase in the production of these instrument have created a man-made problem of e-waste; United Nations has called it as "tsunami of e-waste." Informal management and unsafe disposals have compounded the problem further. The hazardous chemicals, metals, and organic pollutants released from e-waste can lead to serious health consequences such as organ damage, genetic defects, neuropsychiatric illness, and cancer. Problem of e-waste is colossal and should be seen as major public health emergency. In India, use of electronic instrument has increased considerably with less focus on formal waste management and safe disposal. This has created a major health hazard. International health agencies, Indian Council of Medical Research, e-waste regulating bodies, academic institutes, and various government and non-government organizations should join hands together to effectively manage the problems of e-waste. Swacch Bharat Abhiyan started by the honorable Prime Minster should consider e-waste as the top most priority in terms of its safe management and disposal.
