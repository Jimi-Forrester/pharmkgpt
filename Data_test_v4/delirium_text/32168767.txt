32168767|t|Pharmacotechnical Development of a Nasal Drug Delivery Composite Nanosystem Intended for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment.
32168767|a|Direct nose-to-brain delivery has been raised as a non-invasive powerful strategy to deliver drugs to the brain bypassing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This study aimed at preparing and characterizing an innovative composite formulation, associating the liposome and hydrogel approaches, suitable for intranasal administration. Thermosensitive gel formulations were obtained based on a mixture of two hydrophilic polymers (Poloxamer 407, P407 and Poloxamer 188, P188) for a controlled delivery through nasal route via liposomes of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of potential interest for Alzheimer's disease. The osmolarity and the gelation temperature (T  sol-gel) of formulations, defined in a ternary diagram, were investigated by rheometry and visual determination. Regarding the issue of assays, a mixture composed of P407/P188 (15/1%, w/w) was selected for intranasal administration in terms of T  sol-gel and for the compatibility with the olfactory mucosal (280 +- 20 mOsmol, pH 6). Liposomes of API were prepared by the thin film hydration method. Mucoadhesion studies were performed by using mucin disc, and they showed the good natural mucoadhesive characteristics of in situ gel formulations, which increased when liposomes were added. The study demonstrated successful pharmacotechnical development of a promising API-loaded liposomes in a thermosensitive hydrogel intended for nasal Alzheimer's disease treatment.
