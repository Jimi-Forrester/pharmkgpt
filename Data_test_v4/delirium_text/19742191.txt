19742191|a|BACKGROUND: There is a need to develop specialised dementia care services in developing countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the existing infrastructure of a general hospital to start a weekly dementia clinic. RESULTS: We were able to support home-based care, even in patients with advanced disease. This new service gave us opportunity to train clinicians and researchers interested in dementia. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to start weekly dementia clinics using existing infrastructure in developing countries. Networking of such centres can generate a database capable of guiding service development.
