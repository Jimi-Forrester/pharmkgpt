38794209|t|NMDA Receptor Antagonists: Emerging Insights into Molecular Mechanisms and Clinical Applications in Neurological Disorders.
38794209|a|Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) include a range of chronic conditions characterized by progressive neuronal loss, leading to cognitive, motor, and behavioral impairments. Common examples include Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The global prevalence of NDs is on the rise, imposing significant economic and social burdens. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms underlying NDs remain incompletely understood, hampering the development of effective treatments. Excitotoxicity, particularly glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, is a key pathological process implicated in NDs. Targeting the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which plays a central role in excitotoxicity, holds therapeutic promise. However, challenges, such as blood-brain barrier penetration and adverse effects, such as extrapyramidal effects, have hindered the success of many NMDA receptor antagonists in clinical trials. This review explores the molecular mechanisms of NMDA receptor antagonists, emphasizing their structure, function, types, challenges, and future prospects in treating NDs. Despite extensive research on competitive and noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists, the quest for effective treatments still faces significant hurdles. This is partly because the same NMDA receptor that necessitates blockage under pathological conditions is also responsible for the normal physiological function of NMDA receptors. Allosteric modulation of NMDA receptors presents a potential alternative, with the GluN2B subunit emerging as a particularly attractive target due to its enrichment in presynaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors, which are major contributors to excitotoxic-induced neuronal cell death. Despite their low side-effect profiles, selective GluN2B antagonists like ifenprodil and radiprodil have encountered obstacles such as poor bioavailability in clinical trials. Moreover, the selectivity of these antagonists is often relative, as they have been shown to bind to other GluN2 subunits, albeit minimally. Recent advancements in developing phenanthroic and naphthoic acid derivatives offer promise for enhanced GluN2B, GluN2A or GluN2C/GluN2D selectivity and improved pharmacodynamic properties. Additional challenges in NMDA receptor antagonist development include conflicting preclinical and clinical results, as well as the complexity of neurodegenerative disorders and poorly defined NMDA receptor subtypes. Although multifunctional agents targeting multiple degenerative processes are also being explored, clinical data are limited. Designing and developing selective GluN2B antagonists/modulators with polycyclic moieties and multitarget properties would be significant in addressing neurodegenerative disorders. However, advancements in understanding NMDA receptor structure and function, coupled with collaborative efforts in drug design, are imperative for realizing the therapeutic potential of these NMDA receptor antagonists/modulators.
