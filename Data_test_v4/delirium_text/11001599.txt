11001599|t|Orbital and dorsolateral frontal perfusion defect associated with behavioral response to cholinesterase inhibitor therapy in Alzheimer's disease.
11001599|a|The authors retrospectively explored the behavioral and functional imaging profile of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients who respond to cholinesterase inhibitor therapy by using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and baseline [99mTc]HMPAO SPECT. Thirty AD patients were divided into three groups (Responders, Nonresponders, and Unchanged) based on their behavioral response to donepezil. Responders had significantly (P < or = 0.01) more pretreatment irritability, disinhibition (P < or = 0.05), and euphoria (P = 0.05) than Nonresponders and significantly lower lateral orbital frontal (P < 0.00001) and dorsolateral frontal (P < or = 0.0005) perfusion bilaterally. A pretreatment orbitofrontal syndrome may predict behavioral response to cholinesterase inhibitor therapy in AD.
