38463057|t|A clinical study on gastric cancer patients administered EN and PN versus PN alone in enhanced recovery after surgery.
38463057|a|Background and objectives: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) recommends avoiding enteral nutrition (EN) due to undesirable sequelae such as pulmonary aspiration and infections. Not using of EN in nongastric resections under ERAS pathways is often successful. However, parenteral nutrition (PN) alone followed by early postoperative oral feeding in gastric cancer patients, recommended by the ERAS guidelines, has unclear benefit and is only adopted after gastric resection. This study aimed to compute the postoperative outcomes of EN and PN compared to those of the ERAS-recommended nutritional pathway. Our secondary objective was to compare postoperative complications between the two groups. Materials and methods: Of 173 gastrectomy patients, 116 patients were in the combined group (EN and PN), whereas 57 patients were in the PN alone group. Statistical analysis was performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26.0.0 software. The data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, the independent sample t-test, or, in the case of several independent samples, by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Categorical data were analyzed by Pearson's chi2 test or Fisher's exact test. Results: The observed indices included C-reactive protein (CRP), platelet (PLT), white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), albumin, and PRE-albumin. The secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay (LOS), cost, incidence of pulmonary infection, and total incidence of infection. Conclusion: The combined mode of nutrition is feasible and is not associated with postoperative complications in gastric cancer patients under ERAS.
