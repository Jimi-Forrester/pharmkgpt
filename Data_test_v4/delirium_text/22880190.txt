22880190|t|[Review of recommendations and new diagnosis criteria for mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease].
22880190|a|The symptomatic predementia phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD), known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical and neuropsychological condition which defines the transitional state between normal aging and dementia, and is used as a clinical description of people at risk of developing AD. A review of the diagnostic criteria of MCI due to Alzheimer's disease was recently published by the Alzheimer's Association and the National Institute on Aging of the U.S. in order to ensure early diagnosis of the disease, useful for both clinical practice and clinical trials. The objectives of this paper are to review and analyze the revised diagnostic criteria for MCI due to Alzheimer's disease recently proposed, to compare with criteria for MCI available and to establish current strengths and limitations of the new proposal in clinical practice. The new diagnostic criteria for MCI due to AD have a radical importance since they are potentially applicable in the clinical or research protocols and in all clinical settings where such markers are available. They provide a useful, consistent and valuable tool to homogenize the subgroup of patients with MCI who already has AD in a predementia phase with inexorable progression to dementia by AD over the years.
