37109232|a|BACKGROUND: Autologous vein bypass provides excellent long-term results in critical limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI), but a substantial portion of patients have insufficient vein length. In limbs with two distal outflow vessels and limited vein length, a vascular prosthesis may be combined with autologous vein for a sequential composite bridge bypass (SCBB). Results regarding graft function, limb salvage and reinterventions are presented. METHODS: Between January 2010 and December 2019, 47 consecutive SCBB operations with a heparin-bonded PTFE-prosthesis and autologous vein were performed. Grafts were followed with a duplex scan with prospective documentation in a computerized vascular database. Retrospective analysis of graft patency, limb salvage and patient survival was performed. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 34 months (range 1-127 months). 30-day mortality was 10.6% and 5-year patient survival 32%. Postoperative bypass occlusion occurred in 6.4% and late occlusions or graft stenoses in 30%. Two prostheses developed late infection and seven legs were amputated. Primary, primary assisted, secondary patency and limb salvage rate were 54%, 63%, 66% and 85% after 5 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: SCBB patency and limb salvage were good despite a high early postoperative mortality. Combination of a heparin-bonded PTFE-prosthesis and autologous vein appears to be a valuable tool in CLTI in case of insufficient vein.
