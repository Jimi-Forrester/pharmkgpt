33354572|t|lncRNAs Are Involved in Sevoflurane Anesthesia-Related Brain Function Modulation through Affecting Mitochondrial Function and Aging Process.
33354572|a|Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in brain function modulation and neurodegenerative diseases. However, whether lncRNA regulations are involved in the mechanisms of perioperative neurocognitive disorders, especially in anesthesia-related brain dysfunction, remain unknown. Therefore, we explored the expression and regulation pattern profiles of lncRNAs in the hippocampus of aged rats after sevoflurane anesthesia. Three lncRNAs and 772 protein-coding genes were identified by microarray analysis and evidenced by in vitro and in vivo experiments as differentially expressed. Functional annotation and differentially expressed- (DE-) lncRNA-mRNA coexpression networks reveal that DE-lncRNAs are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, aging-related metabolism alterations, DNA damage, and apoptosis, as well as neurodegenerative features during sevoflurane anesthesia. These results suggest that lncRNAs play roles in general anesthesia-related brain function modulation during the perioperative context and provide insights into the lncRNA-related modulation mechanisms and targets.
