36245774|t|The Association of Oxidative Stress and Reactive Oxygen Species Modulator 1 (ROMO1) with Infertility: A Mini Review.
36245774|a|Infertility is one of the disorders that worries many couples around the world, although novel and molecular methods can be used to cure this disease in different stages. One of the factors that causes infertility in men and women is the increased oxidative stress within the cells, which can lead to damage in zygote formation. ROMO1 is one of the most important proteins in the production of reactive oxygen species. This protein can enhance oxidative stress in the cells and body through cellular pathways, such as TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB routes, which will eventually lead to many diseases, especially infertility. We engage several international databases by using keywords; ROMO1, Infertility, and Reactive Oxygen Species, and gained a great quantity of information about ROMO1, Infertility, and Oxidative Stress. Although not proven, it is hypothesized that ROMO1 might elevate oxidative stress by activating NF-kappaB pathway in the cells, furthermore, TNF-alpha can arouse ROMO1 that can end up with apoptosis and cell death, which consequently can have a lot of disturbing effects on the body, especially the reproductive system. To sum up, revealing the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms of ROMO1-dependent TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB pathways in the pathogenesis of infertility might find interesting therapeutic and management strategies for this disorder.
