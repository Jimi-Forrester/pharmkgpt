35634143|a|The influence of nutrition and environment on human health has been known for ages. Phytonutrients (7,000 flavonoids and phenolic compounds; 600 carotenoids) and pro-health nutrients-nutraceuticals positively add to human health and may prevent disorders such as cancer, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and dementia. Plant-derived bioactive metabolites have acquired an imperative function in human diet and nutrition. Natural phytochemicals affect genome expression (nutrigenomics and transcriptomics) and signaling pathways and act as epigenetic modulators of the epigenome (nutri epigenomics). Transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, miRNomics, and metabolomics are some of the main platforms of complete omics analyses, finding use in functional food and nutraceuticals. Now the recent advancement in the integrated omics approach, which is an amalgamation of multiple omics platforms, is practiced comprehensively to comprehend food functionality in food science.
