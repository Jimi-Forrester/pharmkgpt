39894710|a|Oversedation has adverse effects on critically ill patients. The Analgosedation and Delirium Committee of the FEPIMCTI (Pan-American and Iberian Federation of Critical Care Medicine and Intensive Care) conducted a cross-sectional study through a survey addressed to ICU physicians: PANDEMIC (Pan-American and Iberian Study on the Management of Analgosedation and Delirium in Critical Care [fepImCti]). HYPOTHESIS: Worsening of these practices in the course of the pandemic and that continued afterwards, with further oversedation. OBJECTIVES: Perception of analgosedation and delirium practices in Pan-American and Iberian ICUs before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and factors associated with persistent oversedation after the pandemic. Of the 1008 respondents, 25% perceived oversedation after the pandemic (95%CI 22.4-27.8). This perception was higher in South America (35.8%, P < .001). Main risk factor: habit acquired during the pandemic (adjusted OR [aOR] 3.16, 95%CI 2.24-4.45, P < .001). Main protective factor: delirium monitoring before the pandemic (aOR 0.70, 95%CI 0.50-0.98, P = .038). The factors identified in this study provide a basis for targeting future interventions.
