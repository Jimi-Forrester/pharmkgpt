9507194|a|The function of the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) is augmented by soluble IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R). We investigated cerebrospinal fluid sIL-6R concentrations in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to age-matched healthy subjects and individuals with at least one first degree relative with AD. We found a statistically significant decrease in sIL-6R levels in the AD group compared to controls. Complete analysis of the IL-6R complex seems crucial to better understand the impact of IL-6 in AD pathophysiology.
