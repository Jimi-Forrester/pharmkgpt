METHODS: The study was a randomized controlled, single-blinded trial with pre-and post-treatment and follow-up assessments conducted at the private hospital and home environment in PwAD. Seventy-five (N = 75) participants diagnosed with AD were enrolled, but sixty (N = 60) participants (mean age 77.8 years, standard deviation (SD) 6.7) were randomized as physical exercise group (PEG) (n = 20), physical exercise and cognitive stimulation group (PE + CSG) (n = 20) and control group (CG) (n = 20). Participants in PEG and PE + CSG performed an online supervised physical exercise program (SPEP) given biweekly for 12 weeks. Additionally, the cognitive stimulation (CS) program was offered for at least three or five days for 12 weeks for PE + CSG. No treatment was given for the CG. The primary outcome measures were cognition, balance, functional mobility (FM), upper extremity muscle strength (UEMS) and lower extremity muscle strength (LEMS), and quality of life (QoL). Furthermore, depression, basic activities of daily living (BADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) were measured secondarily. RESULTS: PE + CSG demonstrated significant improvement in cognition, balance, FM, UEMS, IADL and reduction in depression compared to the CG (p < 0.05). Besides, participants in the PE + CSG had statistically superior QoL and IADL than the PEG (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of CS to the SPEP was a safe and effective method to gain statistically significant improvements in cognition, balance, FM, UEMS, IADL, and reduction in depression in PwAD.
