36450714|a|Chronic hypoxia leads to irreversible cognitive impairment, primarily due to hippocampal neurodegeneration, for which the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. We administered hypoxia (13%) to C57BL mice for 1-14 days in this study. Chronic hypoxia for 7 or 14 d, but not 1 or 3 d, resulted in alpha-synuclein hyperphosphorylation at serine129 (alpha-Syn p-S129) and protein aggregation, hippocampal neurodegeneration, and cognitive deficits, whereas the latter could be prevented by alpha-synuclein knockdown or an administered short peptide competing at alpha-Syn S129. These results suggest that alpha-Syn p-S129 mediates hippocampal degeneration and cognitive impairment following chronic hypoxia. Furthermore, we found that chronic hypoxia enhanced ceramide catabolism by inducing hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2alpha and HIF-2alpha-dependent transcriptional activation of alkaline ceramidase 2 (Acer2). Thus, the enzymatic activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a specific phosphatase for alpha-syn, is inhibited, leading to the sustained induction of alpha-Syn p-S129. Finally, we found that intermittent hypoxic preconditioning protected against subsequent chronic hypoxia-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment by preventing alpha-Syn p-S129. These results proved the critical role of alpha-syn pathology in chronic hypoxia-afforded cognitive impairment and revealed a novel mechanism underlying alpha-syn hyperphosphorylation during chronic hypoxia. The findings bear implications in developing novel therapeutic interventions for chronic hypoxia-related brain disorders.
