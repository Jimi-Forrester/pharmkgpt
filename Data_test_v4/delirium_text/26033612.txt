26033612|a|BACKGROUND: Elderly patients undergoing gastrectomy are expected to be at high risk of postoperative complications. This retrospective multicenter cohort study assessed complications and long-term outcomes after gastrectomy for gastric cancer (GC). METHODS: A total of 993 patients with GC who had undergone gastrectomy were included, comprising 186 elderly patients (age >= 80 y, E group) and 807 nonelderly patients (age <= 79 y, NE group). Preoperative comorbidities, operative results, postoperative complications, and clinical outcomes were compared between the groups. RESULTS: Clavien-Dindo grade >=1 postoperative complications, pneumonia (P = 0.02), delirium (P < 0.001), and urinary tract infection (P < 0.001) were more common in the E group. Postoperative pneumonia was associated with mortality in this group (P < 0.001). Three patients (1.6%) died after surgery, each of whom had pneumonia. Severe postoperative complication was independently prognostic of overall (hazard ratio, 4.69; 95% confidence interval, 2.40-9.14; P < 0.001) and disease-specific (hazard ratio, 6.41; 95% confidence interval 2.92-14.1; P < 0.001) survival in the E group. CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients with GC, clinical outcomes are strongly associated with severe postoperative complications. Preventing such complications may improve survival.
