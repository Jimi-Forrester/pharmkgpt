39213078|a|Background: Delusional ideations, one of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs), are frequently shown in the long-term progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and comorbid with other NPSs including depression or agitation. Despite various types of delusional ideations, the comorbidity between each delusional ideation and depressive symptoms has not been discussed. Objective: The present cross-sectional study is aimed at testing the hypothetical mechanism of comorbid pattern in AD. Methods: Among 421 patients with AD, we analyzed the dataset of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness-Alzheimer's Disease to compare age, sex, racial type, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) depression score of between the presence and absence of each delusional ideation (delusion of persecution, theft, jealousy, abandonment, phantom boarder, Capgras syndrome, misidentification of place, or television sign). Next, with the stratification based on MMSE score of < or > = 15 points, we further explored association between delusional ideation and depressive symptom that was found significances in the primary analysis. Results: Among eight subtypes of delusional ideations, depression score was higher in those with persecution delusion or Capgras syndrome. Moreover, the Capgras syndrome was associated with presence of depression in severer global cognitive impairment status. Conclusions: As comorbid NPSs of delusional ideation in AD, depressive severity is associated with specific delusional subtype: persecution delusion and Capgras syndrome. Capgras syndrome may be attributable to severe cognitive impairment in addition to depressive symptom. The consideration of pathogenetic differences in the distinct delusional ideations may be helpful for clinicians to select the treatment strategy.
