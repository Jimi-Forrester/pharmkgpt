31723487|t|The Association Between Patient Visit Demographics and Opioid Analgesic Received in the Emergency Department.
31723487|a|INTRODUCTION: Minimal research has been conducted on the prescribing patterns of emergency room physicians. The opioid epidemic is a well-known public health crisis and increased knowledge of providers' tendencies to prescribe opioids over other analgesia may help to update guidelines, improve patient safety, and lower the amount of opioid diversion and death from overdose. The purpose of this study was to determine the association between patient visit demographics and prescribed opiate analgesics. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study analyzing adult patient visits that were seen in the emergency setting for acute pain including chest pain, back pain, abdominal pain, headache, face/tooth/ear, or musculoskeletal pain, utilizing the 2011-2016 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey Emergency Department Patient Record dataset. We analyzed the relationship between various patient visit characteristics and whether opiate analgesics were given or prescribed.  Results: Our study included 73,983 visits for pain, representing an estimated 407 million weighted visits over the study period. We found that those who received opiates were more likely to be female, 62.9% vs. 60.2% and more likely to be white, 74.2% vs. 71.3 %. Furthermore, visits that received opiates were more likely to be younger, have private insurance, and be in increased pain (all P-values = 0.000).  Conclusion: We found that certain patient visit characteristics - including being female, white, younger, and private insurance - were given opiates more in the emergency department. Females have been found to report more pain, the elderly have special considerations regarding pain medications (including the risk of delirium and drug-drug interactions), while insurance status may be confounded by age (Medicare being a large portion of government insurance). However, explanations for differences in prescription rates by race could not be easily discerned.
