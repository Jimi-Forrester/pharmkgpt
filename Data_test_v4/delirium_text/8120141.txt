8120141|t|Expression of MRP14, 27E10, interferon-alpha and leukocyte common antigen by reactive microglia in postmortem human brain tissue.
8120141|a|We have immunohistochemically investigated the localization of a panel of leukocyte-related molecules in postmortem human brain tissue from control subjects and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microglia constitutively express leukocyte common antigens (LCA) with CD45RB determinants. Depending on the state of activation, microglia become positive for the myeloid cell-specific calcium binding protein MRP14, LCA with CD45RO determinant, interferon-alpha, and an antigen recognized by monoclonal antibody 27E10. In AD lesions, these cells are activated in a manner consistent with a chronic inflammatory state. The results of this study have shown further parallels in protein expression between activated microglia and activated leukocytes of the myeloid lineage.
