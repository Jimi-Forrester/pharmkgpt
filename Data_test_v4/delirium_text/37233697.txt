37233697|a|20-Hydroxyecdysone (20E) is an arthropod hormone which is synthesized by some plants as part of their defense mechanism. In humans, 20E has no hormonal activity but possesses a number of beneficial pharmacological properties including anabolic, adaptogenic, hypoglycemic, and antioxidant properties, as well as cardio-, hepato-, and neuroprotective features. Recent studies have shown that 20E may also possess antineoplastic activity. In the present study, we reveal the anticancer properties of 20E in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. 20E displayed significant antioxidant capacities and induced the expression of antioxidative stress response genes. The RNA-seq analysis of 20E-treated lung cancer cells revealed the attenuation of genes involved in different metabolic processes. Indeed, 20E suppressed several enzymes of glycolysis and one-carbon metabolism, as well as their key transcriptional regulators-c-Myc and ATF4, respectively. Accordingly, using the SeaHorse energy profiling approach, we observed the inhibition of glycolysis and respiration mediated by 20E treatment. Furthermore, 20E sensibilized lung cancer cells to metabolic inhibitors and markedly suppressed the expression of Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) markers. Thus, in addition to the known beneficial pharmacological activities of 20E, our data uncovered novel antineoplastic properties of 20E in NSCLC cells.
