30045773|t|Critical role of FOXO3a in carcinogenesis.
30045773|a|FOXO3a is a member of the FOXO subfamily of forkhead transcription factors that mediate a variety of cellular processes including apoptosis, proliferation, cell cycle progression, DNA damage and tumorigenesis. It also responds to several cellular stresses such as UV irradiation and oxidative stress. The function of FOXO3a is regulated by a complex network of processes, including post-transcriptional suppression by microRNAs (miRNAs), post-translational modifications (PTMs) and protein-protein interactions. FOXO3a is widely implicated in a variety of diseases, particularly in malignancy of breast, liver, colon, prostate, bladder, and nasopharyngeal cancers. Emerging evidences indicate that FOXO3a acts as a tumor suppressor in cancer. FOXO3a is frequently inactivated in cancer cell lines by mutation of the FOXO3a gene or cytoplasmic sequestration of FOXO3a protein. And its inactivation is associated with the initiation and progression of cancer. In experimental studies, overexpression of FOXO3a inhibits the proliferation, tumorigenic potential, and invasiveness of cancer cells, while silencing of FOXO3a results in marked attenuation in protection against tumorigenesis. The role of FOXO3a in both normal physiology as well as in cancer development have presented a great challenge to formulating an effective therapeutic strategy for cancer. In this review, we summarize the recent findings and overview of the current understanding of the influence of FOXO3a in cancer development and progression.
