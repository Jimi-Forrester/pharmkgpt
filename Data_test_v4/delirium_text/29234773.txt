29234773|a|Methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) has been postulated to act as a catalytic antioxidant system involved in the protection of oxidative stress-induced cell injury. MsrA has recently turned attention in coupling with the neurodegenerative disorders and in particular with Alzheimer disease. In fact this neurodegenerative disorder depends to a deposit of beta amyloid a peptide with an oxidizable methionine in position 35 which is proved able to modulate the expression to MsrA in neuronal cells. Here, we firstly provided evidence that pretreatment with Resveratrol and Punicalagin (a potent antioxidant extracted from pomegranate), up-regulate the expression and enzymatic activity of MsrA in human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells with beta amyloid peptides. This effect determines a lowering of oxidative potential of the cells as demonstrated by the ROS measurement and a protective effect on cellular availability. Therefore we hypothesize a possible prevent role for these molecules in Alzheimer and in other neurodegenerative diseases.
