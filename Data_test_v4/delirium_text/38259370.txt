38259370|t|An Unusual Presentation of Delusional Companion Syndrome: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.
38259370|a|Delusional companion syndrome, an uncommon subtype of delusional misidentification syndrome, has no prior reported cases in patients with primary psychotic disorders. We report a case of delusional companion syndrome in the absence of any organic brain disease, stroke, or severe brain injury, in a young female with schizophrenia. The patient is a 29-year-old G3P3 female, with a history of schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, who, after recently losing custody of her children, presented to the pediatric emergency department for evaluation of her baby doll, which she believed to be her child because the doll wasn't eating or moving well. She became acutely agitated when providers declined to insert an IV line to hydrate the doll and required emergency treatment orders to de-escalate. The patient was admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit and treated with oral aripiprazole 10 mg, before transitioning to her previous treatment of aripiprazole lauroxil at an increased dose of 882 mg monthly. By the end of admission, the patient grasped that the doll was a toy that had never been alive. This case demonstrates how delusional companion syndrome can occur in young patients with primary psychotic disorders, without a causative neurological insult, and can be treated with antipsychotics. More studies are necessary to further explore the relationship between primary psychotic disorders and delusional companion syndrome.
