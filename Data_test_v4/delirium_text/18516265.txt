18516265|t|Rivastigmine in Alzheimer's disease: Cognitive function and quality of life.
18516265|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive loss of cognitive and functional abilities associated with various behavioral disturbances. Its impact on public health and society as a whole is devastating. Slowing of the cognitive impairment, and improvements in disease duration, self-sufficiency and behavioral disturbances represent the best outcomes of pharmacologic therapy. Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChE-I) have been shown to be effective in treating the cognitive, behavioral, and functional deficits of AD. Rivastigmine is a dual inhibitor of both acetylcholine esterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of acetylcholine. Although this drug has been shown to be beneficial in patients with AD, its benefits are limited and their long-term effectiveness has not been well demonstrated.
