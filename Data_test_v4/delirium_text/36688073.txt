36688073|a|Nowadays, nanozymes have not only been used as biosensors in the detection field, but also their application prospects in disease treatment have been explored. Numerous nanomaterials have similar catalytic activities such as peroxidase, oxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase, and they can be used for antibacterial, anticancer and antioxidant therapy. Although there have been many studies on the application of nanozymes in the therapeutic field, the current nanozyme-based systems often lack targeting and ignore the harm to the surrounding normal tissues. Although promising, the biosafety of nanomaterials has always been the concern of researchers. To improve the treatment effect and reduce toxic and side effects, precision treatment has become the key. At present, a few studies have modified targeted molecules on nanozymes to achieve precise targeting through specific interaction with surface overexpression factors of bacteria or cells. Combined with the catalysis of nanozymes, the targeted treatment of diseases can be achieved. This review summarizes the current research of nanozyme systems in targeted antibacterial, anticancer and antioxidant applications. At the same time, the challenges and development prospects of nanozyme-based targeted therapy system are summarized. It is expected that this work will provide new ideas and new directions for the precise treatment of nanozymes.
