37705779|a|With the ultimate goal of providing a novel platform able to inhibit bacterial adhesion, biofilm formation, and anticancer properties, cerium-doped hydroxyapatite films enhanced with magnetite were developed via spin-coating. The unique aspect of the current study is the potential for creating cerium-doped hydroxyapatite/Fe3O4 coatings on a titanium support to enhance the functionality of bone implants. To assure an increase in the bioactivity of the titanium surface, alkali pretreatment was done before deposition of the apatite layer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in conjunction with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and Fourier transform-infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to evaluate coatings. Coatings demonstrated good efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, with the latter showing the highest efficacy. In vitro bioactivity in simulated body fluid solution showed this material to be proficient for bone-like apatite formation on the implant surface. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was undertaken on intact coatings to examine the barrier properties of composites. We found that spin-coating at 4000 rpm could greatly increase the total resistance. After seeding with osteoblastic populations, Ce-HAP/Fe3O4 materials the adhesion and proliferation of cells. The heating capacity of the Ce-HAP/Fe3O4 film was optimal at 45  C at 15 s at a frequency of 318 kHz. Osseointegration depends on many more parameters than hydroxyapatite production, so these coatings have significant potential for use in bone healing and bone-cancer therapy.
