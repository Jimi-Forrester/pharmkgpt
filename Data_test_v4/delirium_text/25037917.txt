25037917|a|The incidence of cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease continues to increase unabated. While cures for such diseases have eluded investigators, progress is being made on alleviating certain symptoms of these diseases. Mouse knockouts of the proline transporter (PROT), a high affinity Na(+)/Cl(-)-dependent transporter, indicated its potential as a novel therapeutic target for cognition improvement. Herein we report our investigation into a novel class of PROT inhibitors.
