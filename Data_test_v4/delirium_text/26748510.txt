26748510|t|The Pathogenic Role of Ganglioside Metabolism in Alzheimer's Disease-Cholinergic Neuron-Specific Gangliosides and Neurogenesis.
26748510|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia with clinical symptoms that include deficits in memory, judgment, thinking, and behavior. Gangliosides are present on the outer surface of plasma membranes and are especially abundant in the nervous tissues of vertebrates. Ganglioside metabolism, especially the cholinergic neuron-specific gangliosides, GQ1balpha and GT1aalpha, is altered in mouse model of AD and patients with AD. Thus, alterations in ganglioside metabolism may participate in several events related to the pathogenesis of AD. Increased expressions of GT1aalpha may reflect cholinergic neurogenesis. Most changes in ganglioside metabolism occur in the specific brain areas and their lipid rafts. Targeting ganglioside metabolism in lipid rafts may represent an underexploited opportunity to design novel therapeutic strategies for AD.
