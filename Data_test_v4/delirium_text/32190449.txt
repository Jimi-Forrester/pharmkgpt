32190449|t|A Transesophageal Echocardiogram Finding: From Infection to Malignancy.
32190449|a|Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is illustrated by thrombi deposition on normal heart valves without the presence of bacteremia. It typically occurs in the setting of chronic debilitating diseases such as cancer or autoimmune disease. The pathogenesis involves an endothelial injury in the presence of a hypercoagulable state secondary to the effects of circulatory cytokines, which triggers platelet deposition. It usually forms on the upstream atrial surface of the mitral and tricuspid valves and the ventricular surface of the pulmonic and aortic valves and occurs most commonly in the fourth to eighth decades of life with no specific gender predisposition. These vegetations have a distinct morphology that varies from infective endocarditis (IE). Cerebrovascular lesions due to NBTE have a distinctive pattern of multiple, widely distributed small and large strokes on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We present a case of a 78-year-old man who was initially diagnosed as pneumonia and IE; he underwent a trans-esophageal echocardiogram (TEE), which revealed Libman-Sacks findings that have changed his diagnosis to lung cancer. We aim to highlight the characteristic TEE findings of NBTE to help clinicians search for underlying etiologies, including malignancies if NBTE is suspected.
