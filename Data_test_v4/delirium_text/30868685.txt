30868685|t|Osteopontin and phospho-SMAD2/3 are associated with calcification of vessels in D-CAA, an hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
30868685|a|In severe forms of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) pathology, vascular calcification has been observed in the cerebral cortex, both in vivo on MRI and CT, and post-mortem using histopathology. However, the pathomechanisms leading to calcification of CAA-laden arteries are unknown. Therefore, we investigated the correlation between calcification of cortical arterioles and several potential modulators of vascular calcification using immunohistochemistry in a unique collection of brain material of patients with a hereditary form of CAA, namely hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Dutch type (HCHWA-D or D-CAA). We show a topographical association of osteopontin (OPN) and TGFbeta signaling factor phospho-SMAD2/3 (pSMAD2/3) in calcified CAA vessel walls. OPN and pSMAD2/3 gradually accumulate in vessels prior to calcification. Moreover, we found that the vascular accumulation of Collagen 1 (Col1), OPN and pSMAD2/3 immunomarkers correlated with the CAA severity. This was independently of the vessel size, including capillaries in the most severe cases. We propose that calcification of CAA vessels in the observed HCHWA-D cases may be induced by extracellular OPN trapped in the fibrotic Col1 vessel wall, independently of the presence of vascular amyloid.
