11640951|a|Reactive glial cell properties could contribute to pathomechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease by favoring oxidative neuronal damage and beta-amyloid toxicity. A critical step is apparently reached when pathological glia activation is no longer restricted to microglia and includes astrocytes. By giving up their differentiated state, astrocytes may lose their physiological negative feed-back control on microglial NO production and even contribute to neurotoxic peroxynitrate formation. Another consequence is the impairment of the astrocyte-maintained extracellular ion homeostasis favoring excitotoxic damage. By the production of apolipoprotein-E, triggered by the microglial cytokine interleukine-1beta, reactive astrocytes could promote the transformation of beta-amyloid into the toxic form. A pharmacologically reinforced cAMP signaling in rat glial cell cultures depressed oxygen radical formation in microglia and their release of TNF-alpha and interleukine-1beta, feed-forward signals which mediate oxidative damage and secondary astrocyte activation. Cyclic AMP also favored differentiation and expression of a mature ion channel pattern in astrocytes improving their glutamate buffering. A deficient cholinergic signaling that increases the risk of pathological APP processing was compensated by an adenosine-mediated reinforcement of the second messenger calcium. A combination therapy with acetylcholine-esterase inhibitors together with adenosine raising pharmaca, therefore, may be used to treat cholinergic deficiency in Alzheimer's disease.
