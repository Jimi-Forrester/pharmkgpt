441205|t|[Serum creatine kinase activity in psychoses].
441205|a|This is a report of the initial results of determinations of the creatine kinase activity in the serum of forty psychiatric and twenty-five neurological patients. A determination of the creatine kinase activity made in the first days of an acute endogenous psychosis invariably showed an increase in creatine kinase which returned to normal values after eight to fourteen days. Patients with residual schizophrenia, conditions of acute excitation accompanying psychopathy, and abnormal personality or circumscribed paranoid development showed creatine activity in the range of normal values. Alcoholics with incipient or strongly marked delirium tremens showed normal creatine kinase activity in those cases where the situation was not complicated by additional traumata or other accompanying diseases.
