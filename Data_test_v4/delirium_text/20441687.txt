20441687|t|RAGE and Abeta immunoglobulins: relation to Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive function.
20441687|a|The immunoglobulins (IgGs) for beta amyloid (Abeta) and receptors for the advanced glycation end products (RAGE) have previously been shown to be related to memory and language measures in a mixed neurological sample of older adults. In this study, we examined group differences in Abeta and RAGE IgGs, as well as the relationship between both IgGs and cognitive performance in nondiabetic older adults with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found RAGE and Abeta levels to be elevated in some AD participants, leading to significant AD-control group differences. While there was an overall correlation between both IgG levels and global cognition across all three groups, this relationship was largely attributable to group differences in cognition, highlighted by considerable variability within groups in the relationship between IgG levels and cognition. While findings do not support a consistent relationship between cognition and either IgG, further research with larger samples is needed to better characterize cognitive differences between AD participants with high versus low Abeta and RAGE titers.
