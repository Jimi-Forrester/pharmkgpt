39337602|t|Nebulized Lipopolysaccharide Causes Delayed Cortical Neuroinflammation in a Murine Model of Acute Lung Injury.
39337602|a|Lung injury caused by respiratory infection is a major cause of hospitalization and mortality and a leading origin of sepsis. Sepsis-associated encephalopathy and delirium are frequent complications in patients with severe lung injury, yet the pathogenetic mechanisms remain unclear. Here, 70 female C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a single full-body-exposure with nebulized lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Neuromotor impairment was assessed repeatedly and brain, blood, and lung samples were analyzed at survival points of 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h after exposure. qRT-PCR revealed increased mRNA-expression of TNFalpha and IL-1beta 24 h and 48 h after LPS-exposure in the lung, concomitantly with increased amounts of proteins in bronchoalveolar lavage and interstitial lung edema. In the cerebral cortex, at 72 h and/or 96 h after LPS exposure, the inflammation- and activity-associated markers TLR4, GFAP, Gadd45b, c-Fos, and Arc were increased. Therefore, single exposure to nebulized LPS not only triggers an early inflammatory reaction in the lung but also induces a delayed neuroinflammatory response. The identified mechanisms provide new insights into the pathogenesis of sepsis-associated encephalopathy and might serve as targets for future therapeutic approaches.
