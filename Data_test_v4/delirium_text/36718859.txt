36718859|a|Tryptophan (TRP) is an essential amino acid catabolized mainly through the kynurenine pathway, and part of it is catabolized in the brain. The abnormal depletion of TRP and production of kynurenine (KYN) by two enzymes, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), have been linked to various neurological diseases. The ratio of TRP/KYN in plasma is a valuable measure for IDO/TDO activity and the prognosis of disease conditions. The 4-vinylphenylboronic acid (4-VPBA) was evaluated as a novel stationary phase for OT-CEC-MS/MS. TRP, KYN, and 3-hydroxykynurenine were separated using optimum conditions of 15 mM (NH4 )2 CO3 at pH 8 as a background electrolyte and 25 kV separation voltage on a 90 cm column. The usefulness of the 4-VPBA column for simple, fast, repeatable, and sensitive CEC-ESI-MS/MS application was demonstrated for the quantitation of TRP and KYN in the plasma of healthy human subjects and neuroinflammation subjects. The plasma sample was extracted on a zirconia-based ion-exchange cartridge for simultaneous protein precipitation and phospholipid removal. The method of standard addition, in combination with the internal standards approach, was used to prepare the calibration curve to overcome matrix matching and eliminate procedural errors. The developed quantitation method was validated according to FDA guidelines for sensitivity, accuracy, precision, and extraction recovery. The measured plasma level of TRP and KYN in healthy humans is aligned with the human metabolome database for the same two metabolites.
