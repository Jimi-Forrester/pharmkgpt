17992016|a|BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that magnesium, which specially affects the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor response to excitatory amino acids, may be a supportive therapeutic agent in Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between magnesium levels and the cognitive test results and clinical stages of the patients. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients (20 women, 17 men) and 34 controls were included in the study. The patients were staged according to Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). RESULTS: There was a significant difference for Mg levels according to GDS (p = 0.030). Similarly, Mg levels were different between patients with low and high CDR stages (p = 0.003). Mg levels were lower in the group whose MMSE scores were <20 than in those whose MMSE scores were >/=20. A negative correlation was found between Mg levels and GDS and CDR (respectively: r = -0.35, p = 0.033; r = -0.360, p = 0.029). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that there is a relationship between serum Mg levels and the degree of Alzheimer's disease and that the determination of the Mg level at various stages may provide valuable information in further understanding the progression and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
