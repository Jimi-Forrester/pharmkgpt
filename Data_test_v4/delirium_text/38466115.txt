38466115|a|Mild cognitive impairment plays a crucial role in predicting the early progression of Alzheimer's disease, and it can be used as an important indicator of the disease progression. Currently, numerous studies have focused on utilizing the functional brain network as a novel biomarker for mild cognitive impairment diagnosis. In this context, we employed a graph convolutional neural network to automatically extract functional brain network features, eliminating the need for manual feature extraction, to improve the mild cognitive impairment diagnosis performance. However, previous graph convolutional neural network approaches have primarily concentrated on single modes of brain connectivity, leading to a failure to leverage the potential complementary information offered by diverse connectivity patterns and limiting their efficacy. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel method called the graph convolutional neural network with multimodel connectivity, which integrates multimode connectivity for the identification of mild cognitive impairment using fMRI data and evaluates the graph convolutional neural network with multimodel connectivity approach through a mild cognitive impairment diagnostic task on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. Overall, our experimental results show the superiority of the proposed graph convolutional neural network with multimodel connectivity approach, achieving an accuracy rate of 92.2% and an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.988.
