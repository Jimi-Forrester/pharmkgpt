6707659|t|A comparison of changes in the nucleus basalis and locus caeruleus in Alzheimer's disease.
6707659|a|In 22 patients with Alzheimer's disease loss of neurons from the nucleus basalis of Meynert and locus caeruleus averaged 58% and 71% respectively with nucleolar volume being reduced by 30% in both. These changes were greater in those patients under 80 years of age and in such patients damage to the locus was more severe than that to the nucleus basalis. In older patients (over 80 years) changes were similar in extent in both regions.
