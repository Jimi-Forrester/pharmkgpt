34535545|a|Conversion of adenosine to inosine in RNA by ADAR enzymes, termed "RNA editing," is essential for healthy brain development. Editing is dysregulated in neuropsychiatric diseases, but has not yet been investigated at scale at the level of individual neurons. We quantified RNA editing sites in nuclear transcriptomes of 3055 neurons from six cortical regions of a neurotypical female donor, and found 41,930 sites present in at least ten nuclei. Most sites were located within Alu repeats in introns or 3' UTRs, and approximately 80% were cataloged in public RNA editing databases. We identified 9285 putative novel editing sites, 29% of which were also detectable in unrelated donors. Intersection with results from bulk RNA-seq studies provided cell-type and spatial context for 1730 sites that are differentially edited in schizophrenic brain donors, and 910 such sites in autistic donors. Autism-related genes were also enriched with editing sites predicted to modify RNA structure. Inhibitory neurons showed higher overall transcriptome editing than excitatory neurons, and the highest editing rates were observed in the frontal cortex. We used generalized linear models to identify differentially edited sites and genes between cell types. Twenty nine genes were preferentially edited in excitatory neurons, and 43 genes were edited more heavily in inhibitory neurons, including RBFOX1, its target genes, and genes in the autism-associated Prader-Willi locus (15q11). The abundance of SNORD115/116 genes from locus 15q11 was positively associated with editing activity across the transcriptome. We contend that insufficient editing of autism-related genes in inhibitory neurons may contribute to the specific perturbation of those cells in autism.
