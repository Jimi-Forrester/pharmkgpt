23352512|a|The use of water-soluble O-acyl isopeptides enabled us to investigate the biochemical properties of Abeta11-42 species, by preparing highly concentrated stock solutions after a pretreatment. Abeta11-42 and [Pyr(11)]Abeta11-42 showed comparable aggregation capability and cytotoxicity, suggesting that the pyroglutamate modification at Glu(11) does not have a crucial role in these events. However, given that Abeta11-42 is converted to [Pyr(11)]Abeta11-42 by a glutamyl cyclase in vivo, the potential aggregative and cytotoxic nature of [Pyr(11)]Abeta11-42 that was observed in the present study provides valuable insights into the pathological functions of pyroglutamate-modified Abeta species in Alzheimer's disease.
