32595110|a|BACKGROUND: Disturbance of consciousness (DOC) may develop in acute pancreatitis (AP). In clinical practice, it is known that DOC may worsen the patient's condition, but we have no exact data on how DOC affects the outcome of AP. METHODS: From the Hungarian Pancreatic Study Groups' AP registry, 1220 prospectively collected cases were analyzed, which contained exact data on DOC, included patients with confusion, delirium, convulsion, and alcohol withdrawal, answering a post hoc defined research question. Patients were separated to Non-DOC and DOC, whereas DOC was further divided into non-alcohol related DOC (Non-ALC DOC) and ALC DOC groups. For statistical analysis, independent sample t-test, Mann-Whitney, Chi-squared, or Fisher exact test were used. RESULTS: From the 1220 patients, 47 (3.9%) developed DOC, 23 (48.9%) cases were ALC DOC vs. 24 (51.1%) Non-ALC DOC. Analysis between the DOC and Non-DOC groups showed a higher incidence of severe AP (19.2% vs. 5.3%, p < 0.001), higher mortality (14.9% vs. 1.7%, p < 0.001), and a longer length of hospitalization (LOH) (Me = 11; IQR: 8-17 days vs. Me = 9; IQR: 6-13 days, p = 0.049) respectively. Patients with ALC DOC developed more frequently moderate AP vs. Non-ALC DOC (43.5% vs. 12.5%), while the incidence of severe AP was higher in Non-ALC vs. ALC DOC group (33.3% vs. 4.4%) (p < 0.001). LOH showed a tendency to be longer in Non-ALC DOC compared to ALC DOC, respectively (Me:13; IQR:7-20 days vs. Me:9.5; IQR:8-15.5 days, p = 0.119). CONCLUSION: DOC during AP is associated with a higher rate of moderate and severe AP and increases the risk of mortality.
