30046610|t|Electroacupuncture Improves Intestinal Dysfunction in Septic Patients: A Randomised Controlled Trial.
30046610|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) at "Zusanli" (ST36) and "Shangjuxu"(ST37) on reducing inflammatory reaction and improving intestinal dysfunction in patients with sepsis-induced intestinal dysfunction with syndrome of obstruction of the bowels Qi. METHODS: A total of 71 patients with sepsis-induced intestinal dysfunction with syndrome of obstruction of the bowels Qi were randomly assigned to control group (n=36) and treatment group (n=35). Patients in control group were given conventional therapies including fluid resuscitation, anti-infection, vasoactive agents, mechanical ventilation, supply of enteral nutrition, and glutamine as soon as possible. In addition to conventional therapies, patients in treatment group underwent 20 minutes of EA at ST36-ST37 twice a day for five days. At baseline, day 1, day 3, and day 7 after treatment, the plasma levels of procalcitonin (PCT), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), intestinal fatty acid-binding proteins (I-FABP), D-lactate, citrulline, and TCM quantitative score of intestinal dysfunction were measured and recorded, respectively. And days on mechanical ventilation (MV), length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU), and 28d mortality were recorded. RESULTS: During treatment, the plasma levels of PCT, TNF-alpha, I-FABP, D-lactate, and TCM quantitative score of intestinal dysfunction were declining in both groups, while the treatment group showed a significant decline (P<0.05). Plasma levels of citrulline were increasing in both groups, while the treatment group showed a significant increase (P<0.05). However, there were no significant differences in the days on MV, length of stay in ICU, and 28d mortality between two groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: EA at ST36-ST37 can reduce inflammatory reaction and has protective effects on intestinal function in patients with sepsis-induced intestinal dysfunction with syndrome of obstruction of the bowels Qi.
