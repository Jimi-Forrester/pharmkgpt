35987897|a|Enhanced Recovery After Cardiac Surgery (ERACS) is a multidisciplinary and multiprofessional treatment approach in cardiac surgery. Recently, a transfer and adaptation of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols from other disciplines, such as colorectal surgery, to cardiac surgery has been performed in different settings. First, prehabilitation programs have been established and investigated to improve patients' physical, psychological and nutritional status including treatment of preoperative anemia. Second, intraoperative therapeutic steps are described, such as infection reduction bundles, rigid sternal closure and guidance of perioperative anesthesia. For this, the use of short-acting agents, goal-directed fluid management and multimodal anesthesia are among the important measures. Third, early recovery and restoration of patient autonomy are achieved with early extubation and mobilization, efficient postoperative analgesia and diagnosis and treatment of delirium.The introduction of an ERACS protocol is a team effort requiring a protocol adapted to the institutional conditions and a willingness to perform a shift of culture in perioperative care. So far, the successful establishment of ERACS protocols in minimally invasive cardiac surgery has been reported and encourages the development of protocols of specific patient groups, such as pediatric cardiac surgery or left ventricular assist device implantation.
