24164929|a|BACKGROUND: To assess the relationship between regional neocortical atrophy and psychotic symptoms in adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Rates of change in regional neocortical atrophy as measured by longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging scans and the occurrence of psychotic symptoms and/or the long-term use of antipsychotic medications in 389 outpatients with MCI or AD in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. RESULTS: Atrophy rate of 3 specific neocortical regions, lateral frontal, lateral parietal, and anterior cingulate gyrus, was significantly associated with the onset of psychosis including delusions, agitation, wandering, and hallucinations and/or the need for chronic antipsychotic medications. Atrophy rate of the lateral frontal lobe correlated most significantly with onset of psychotic symptoms or need for chronic antipsychotic medications. CONCLUSIONS: Psychosis was associated with volume loss in specific regions of the lateral frontal and parietal lobes as well as anterior cingulate gyrus.
