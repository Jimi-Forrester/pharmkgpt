9085335|t|Methazolamide-induced delirium.
9085335|a|A 74-year-old man became delirious 2 days after beginning oral therapy with methazolamide. The delirium was manifested by intermittent psychosis, incontinence of bowel and bladder, lethargy, and disorientation. These symptoms continued for 25 days despite many changes in his drug regimen, and complete laboratory, urologic, and neurologic work-ups. The symptoms resolved completely within 1 week of discontinuing methazolamide. This is the first case reported of delirium associated with methazolamide not accompanied by a metabolic imbalance.
