30511419|t|GRK5 influences the phosphorylation of tau via GSK3beta and contributes to Alzheimer's disease.
30511419|a|G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) is a serine/threonine kinase whose dysfunction results in cognitive impairment and Alzheimer-like pathology, including tau hyperphosphorylation. However, the mechanisms whereby GRK5 influences tau phosphorylation remain incompletely understood. In the current study, we showed that GRK5 influenced the phosphorylation of tau via glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta). The activity of both tau and GSK3beta in the hippocampus was increased in aged GRK5-knockout mice, which is consistent with what occurs in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Furthermore, GRK5 regulated the activity of GSK3beta and phosphorylated tau in vitro. Regardless of changes of GRK5 protein levels, tau hyperphosphorylation remained reduced after GSK3beta activity was inhibited, suggesting that GRK5 may specifically influence tau hyperphosphorylation by modulating GSK3beta activity. Taken together, our findings suggest that GRK5 deficiency contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease by influencing the hyperphosphorylation of tau through the activation of GSK3beta.
