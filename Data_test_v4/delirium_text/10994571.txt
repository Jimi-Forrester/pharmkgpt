10994571|a|BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to review the clinical analyses regarding efficacy of the different drugs used in the treatment of Alzheimer, across distinct scales of measures in order out the progression of the Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Along with this an economic analysis of the health/social impact of this illness in the Basque Country has been carried out. METHODS: A selection and synthesis of the relevant scientific evidence was made by means of a bibliographical research in the main data bases (Medline, Embase, Cross, Iowa Drug Information System, Healthstar and The Cochrane Library). The value of the costs was carried out from a social perspective. During 1998 a health social costs analysis of this pathology was undertaken in the Basque Country, Spain, starting from a table of assumptions. RESULTS: ADAS and PDS are the only cognitive and functional scales developed and validated specifically for the AD. The drugs specifically prescribed for the AD (tacrine, donepezil, and revastigmine) contribute a slight benefit, whose clinical meaning is unknown. During 1998 the global cost of treating the AD in the Basque Country has been at least 55,858 million pesetas (US$ 360.5 millions dollars). The social cost (nursing homes, day centres, home help, help from family and friends) comes to represent 98.4% of this global cost. CONCLUSIONS: At the moment, there is not any effective drug in the treatment of the AD. The informal cost (help from family and friends) comes to represent 88.4% of the total social costs.
