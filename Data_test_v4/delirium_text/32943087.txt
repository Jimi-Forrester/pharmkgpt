32943087|t|BCMA-targeted immunotherapy for multiple myeloma.
32943087|a|B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a novel treatment target for multiple myeloma (MM) due to its highly selective expression in malignant plasma cells (PCs). Multiple BCMA-targeted therapeutics, including antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, and bispecific T cell engagers (BiTE), have achieved remarkable clinical response in patients with relapsed and refractory MM. Belantamab mafodotin-blmf (GSK2857916), a BCMA-targeted ADC, has just been approved for highly refractory MM. In this article, we summarized the molecular and physiological properties of BCMA as well as BCMA-targeted immunotherapeutic agents in different stages of clinical development.
