38773737|a|CONTEXT: The mechanisms of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Guizhi-Gancao Decoction (GGD) remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study explores the mechanisms of GGD against cardiac hypertrophy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Network pharmacology analysis was carried out to identify the potential targets of GGD. In vivo experiments, C57BL/6J mice were divided into Con, phenylephrine (PE, 10 mg/kg/d), 2-chloroadenosine (CADO, the stable analogue of adenosine, 2 mg/kg/d), GGD (5.4 g/kg/d) and GGD (5.4 g/kg/d) + CGS15943 (a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist, 4 mg/kg/d). In vitro experiments, primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) were divided into Con, PE (100 microM), CADO (5 microM), GGD (10-5 g/mL) and GGD (10-5 g/mL) + CGS15943 (5 microM). Ultrasound, H&E and Masson staining, hypertrophic genes expression and cell surface area were conducted to verify the GGD efficacy. Adenosine receptors (ADORs) expression were tested via real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. RESULTS: Network pharmacology identified ADORs among those of the core targets of GGD. In vitro experiments demonstrated that GGD attenuated PE-induced increased surface area (with an EC50 of 5.484 x 10-6 g/mL). In vivo data shown that GGD attenuated PE-induced ventricular wall thickening. In vitro and in vivo data indicated that GGD alleviated PE-induced hypertrophic gene expression (e.g., ANP, BNP and MYH7/MYH6), A1AR over-expression and A2aAR down-expression. Moreover, CADO exerts effects similar to GGD, whereas CGS15943 eliminated most effects of GGD. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the mechanism by which GGD inhibits cardiac hypertrophy, highlighting regulation of ADORs as a potential therapeutic strategy for HF.
