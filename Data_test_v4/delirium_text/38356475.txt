38356475|t|The HOPE4MCI study: A randomized double-blind assessment of AGB101 for the treatment of MCI due to AD.
38356475|a|INTRODUCTION: In addition to the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the presence of excess neural activity is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a prognostic indicator for progression of AD pathology and clinical/cognitive worsening in mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (MCI due to AD). The HOPE4MCI clinical study tested the efficacy of a therapeutic with demonstrated ability to normalize heightened neural activity in the hippocampus in a randomized controlled trial of 78 weeks duration in patients with MCI due to AD. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-four participants were randomized to placebo (n = 83) or AGB101 (n = 81), an extended-release formulation of low dose (220 mg) levetiracetam. The primary endpoint was the change in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes score (CDR-SB) comparing follow up at 18 months to baseline. The goal of the primary efficacy analysis was to estimate the difference between the AGB101 and placebo arms in the mean change of the primary endpoint. RESULTS: The mean change in CDR-SB was estimated to be 1.12 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66, 1.69) for the AGB101 arm and 1.22 (95% CI: 0.75, 1.78) for the placebo arm. The estimated difference between arms is -0.10 (95% CI: -0.85, 0.58), which was not statistically significant. In a prespecified analysis, the difference was -0.45 (95% CI: -1.43, 0.53) for ApoE-4 noncarriers and -0.10 (95% CI: -0.92, 0.72) for apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-4 carriers. DISCUSSION: The possibility that ApoE-4 carriers and noncarriers will respond differently to therapeutic intervention is consistent with recently reported findings from biologics and the present results show further testing of AGB101 in patients with MCI due to AD who are noncarriers of the ApoeE-4 allele is warranted. Conclusions from the HOPE4MCI study are limited primarily due to the small sample size and results can only be regarded as a guide to future research.
