39001884|a|Acquired brain injury is an urgent situation that requires rapid diagnosis and treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are required for accurate diagnosis. However, these methods are costly and require substantial infrastructure and specialized staff. Circulatory biomarkers of acute brain injury may help in the management of patients with acute cerebrovascular events and prevent poor outcome and mortality. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the development of potential biomarkers of brain damage to increase diagnostic possibilities. For this purpose, we searched the PubMed database of studies on the diagnostic potential of brain injury biomarkers. We also accessed information from Clinicaltrials.gov to identify any clinical trials of biomarker measurements for the diagnosis of brain damage. In total, we present 41 proteins, enzymes and hormones that have been considered as biomarkers for brain injury, of which 20 have been studied in clinical trials. Several microRNAs have also emerged as potential clinical biomarkers for early diagnosis. Combining multiple biomarkers in a panel, along with other parameters, is yielding promising outcomes.
