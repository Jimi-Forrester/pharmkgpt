30683112|a|BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the common cause of mortality in developed countries. The feasibility of whole-genome gene expression analysis to identify outcome-related genes and dysregulated pathways remains unknown. Molecular marker such as BNP, CRP and other serum inflammatory markers have got the notice at this point. However, these biomarkers exhibit elevated levels in patients with thyroid disease, renal failure and congestive heart failure. In this study, three groups of microarray data sets (GES66360, GSE48060, GSE29532) were collected from GEO, a total of 99, 52 and 55 samples, respectively. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to obtain a classifier which composed of related genes that best characterize the AMI. RESULTS: Here, this study obtained three groups of microarray data sets (GES66360, GSE48060, GSE29532) on AMI blood samples, a total of 99, 52 and 24 samples, respectively. In all, 4672 genes, 3185 genes, 3660 genes were identified in GSE66360, GSE48060, GSE60993 modules, respectively. We preformed WGCNA, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis on these three data sets, finding function enrichment of the differential expression gene on inflammation and immune response. Transcriptome analysis were performed in AMI patients at four time points compared to CAD patients with no history of MI, to determine gene expression profiles and their possible changes during the recovery from myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that three overlapping genes (FGFBP2, GFOD1 and MLC1) between two modules could be a potential use of gene biomarkers for the diagnose of AMI.
