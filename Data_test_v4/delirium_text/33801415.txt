33801415|t|Acute Phase Response and Non-Reproducible Elevated Concentrations with a High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I Assay.
33801415|a|High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) testing has enabled physicians to make earlier diagnostic and prognostic decisions in the hospital setting than previous cardiac troponin assays. Analytical improvements have permitted one to measure cardiac troponin precisely in the nanogram per litre (ng/L) range with hs-cTn assays which has resulted in fast 0/1-h and 0/2-h algorithms for ruling-in and ruling-out myocardial infarction. Although analytical interferences that affect the reporting of hs-cTn are uncommon, not all hs-cTn assays are designed the same nor have undergone the same clinical and analytical validations. Here, after investigating an initial case of discrepant hs-cTnI results, we report that patients with an acute phase response (e.g., patients with inflammatory or infectious illnesses) can yield high and non-reproducible results with the Ortho Clinical Diagnostics hs-cTnI assay. Compared to Abbott Diagnostics hs-cTnI, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics hs-cTnI assay misclassifies biochemical injury in approximately 10% of the population being assessed for myocardial injury with imprecise results in approximately half of this population (i.e., 5%). In conclusion, caution is warranted in interpreting Ortho Clinical Diagnostics hs-cTnI alone in patients being evaluated for myocardial injury, especially in patients whose primary presentation is related to an acute phase response and not an acute coronary syndrome symptom.
