36554537|t|Decision-Making concerning Involuntary Oral Care for Older Individuals with Dementia.
36554537|a|Many older individuals with dementia (OIWD) show care-resistant behavior for oral care. Providing care despite resistance is considered to be involuntary care. Although involuntary care should be minimized, in some OIWD it may be necessary to avoid health risks. This study aims to assess the attitudes of healthcare providers with regard to involuntary oral care provision for OIWD who show care-resistant behavior. An online questionnaire consisting of general questions and case specific questions was administered via social media and networking to individuals involved in the oral care of OIWD. A total of 309 participants were included in this study. The outcomes of the questionnaires were categorized per case. In all cases, a discrepancy was seen between the assessment of oral health problems as potentially harmful (range: 73.1-93.5%) and the willingness to provide involuntary care (range: 31.1-63.4%). Hence, many healthcare providers are aware of the subsequent potential health risks related to not providing care, but are still reluctant to provide involuntary oral care. Therefore, many OIWD who show care-resistant behavior potentially do not receive the necessary oral care they require.
