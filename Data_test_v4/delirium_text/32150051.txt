32150051|a|This study aimed to evaluate the risk of dementia after distal radius, hip, and spine fractures.Data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort were collected for the population >= 60 years of age from 2002 to 2013. A total of 10,387 individuals with dementia were matched for age, sex, income, region of residence, and history of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia with 41,548 individuals comprising the control group. Previous histories of distal radius, hip, and spine fractures were evaluated in both the dementia and control groups. Using ICD-10 codes, dementia (G30 and F00) and distal radius (S525), hip (S720, S721, and S722), and spine (S220 and S320) fractures were investigated. The crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of dementia in distal radius, hip, and spine fracture patients were analyzed using conditional logistic regression analyses. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to age, sex and region of residence.The adjusted ORs for dementia were higher in the distal radius, hip, and spine fracture group than in the non-fracture group (adjusted OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.10 -1.37, P < .001 for distal radius fracture; adjusted OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.48 - 1.83, P < .001 for hip fracture; adjusted OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.22 - 1.41, P < .001 for spine fracture). The results in subgroup analyses according to age, sex and region of residence were consistent.Distal radius, hip, and spine fractures increase the risk of dementia.
