29466703|a|One major pathophysiological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is senile plaques composed of amyloid beta (Abeta). In the amyloidogenic pathway, cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is shifted towards Abeta production and soluble APPbeta (sAPPbeta) levels. Abeta is known to impair synaptic function; however, much less is known about the physiological functions of sAPPbeta. The neurotrophic properties of sAPPalpha, derived from the non-amyloidogenic pathway of APP cleavage, are well-established, whereas only a few, conflicting studies on sAPPbeta exist. The intracellular pathways of sAPPbeta are largely unknown. Since sAPPbeta is generated alongside Abeta by beta-secretase (BACE1) cleavage, we tested the hypothesis that sAPPbeta effects differ from sAPPalpha effects as a neurotrophic factor. We therefore performed a head-to-head comparison of both mammalian recombinant peptides in developing primary hippocampal neurons (PHN). We found that sAPPalpha significantly increases axon length (p = 0.0002) and that both sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta increase neurite number (p < 0.0001) of PHN at 7 days in culture (DIV7) but not at DIV4. Moreover, both sAPPalpha- and sAPPbeta-treated neurons showed a higher neuritic complexity in Sholl analysis. The number of glutamatergic synapses (p < 0.0001), as well as layer thickness of postsynaptic densities (PSDs), were significantly increased, and GABAergic synapses decreased upon sAPP overexpression in PHN. Furthermore, we showed that sAPPalpha enhances ERK and CREB1 phosphorylation upon glutamate stimulation at DIV7, but not DIV4 or DIV14. These neurotrophic effects are further associated with increased glutamate sensitivity and CREB1-signaling. Finally, we found that sAPPalpha levels are significantly reduced in brain homogenates of AD patients compared to control subjects. Taken together, our data indicate critical stage-dependent roles of sAPPs in the developing glutamatergic system in vitro, which might help to understand deleterious consequences of altered APP shedding in AD patients, beyond Abeta pathophysiology.
