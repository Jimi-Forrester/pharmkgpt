34228265|t|A retrospective cohort study of risk factors and outcomes in older patients admitted to an inner-city geriatric unit in London during first peak of COVID-19 pandemic.
34228265|a|PURPOSE: Compared to younger patients, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical presentation in older people can be more heterogeneous and fatal. We aim to describe a cohort of older adults admitted in an inner-city London hospital during the first peak of the pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective observational study that enrolled older adults consecutively admitted into two geriatric wards with suspected or confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We collected socio-demographic data, comorbidities, symptoms at presentation and/or during admission, biochemical and radiological data and outcomes at 28 days. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-four patients were included, and 75% were > 80 years old. 19.5% of COVID-19 cases were judged to be hospital-acquired. More than half presented or developed typical symptoms, respiratory failure or fatigue. 46.8% were diagnosed with delirium, 24.2% with falls and dysphagia was present in 13.7%. The mortality rate was 29.8% and was higher among males, those > 80 years, patients with a higher grade of frailty, a history of dementia or chronic kidney disease, as well as those diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute kidney injury or hypernatremia. Independent predictors of mortality were male sex, age > 80 years, respiratory failure and hypernatremia. CONCLUSION: We have described a cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first UK peak of the global pandemic. We found that these patients had significant frailty with multiple comorbidities. There was a high mortality and increased dependency and greater social care need in survivors.
