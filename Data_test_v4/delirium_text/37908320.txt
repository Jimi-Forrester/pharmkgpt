37908320|t|Polyurethane Culture Substrates Enable Long-Term Neuron Monoculture in a Human in vitro Model of Neurotrauma.
37908320|a|Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cells can reproduce human-specific pathophysiology, patient-specific vulnerability, and gene-environment interactions in neurological disease. Human in vitro models of neurotrauma therefore have great potential to advance the field. However, this potential cannot be realized until important biomaterials challenges are addressed. Status quo stretch injury models of neurotrauma culture cells on sheets of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) that are incompatible with long-term monoculture of hiPSC-derived neurons. Here, we overcame this challenge in an established human in vitro neurotrauma model by replacing PDMS with a highly biocompatible form of polyurethane (PU). This substitution allowed long-term monoculture of hiPSC-derived neurons. It also changed the biomechanics of stretch injury. We quantified these changes experimentally using high-speed videography and digital image correlation. We used finite element modeling to quantify the influence of the culture substrate's thickness, stiffness, and coefficient of friction on membrane stretch and concluded that the coefficient of friction explained most of the observed biomechanical changes. Despite these changes, we demonstrated that the modified model produced a robust, dose-dependent trauma phenotype in hiPSC-derived neuron monocultures. In summary, the introduction of this PU film makes it possible to maintain hiPSC-derived neurons in monoculture for long periods in a human in vitro neurotrauma model. In doing so, it opens new horizons in the field of neurotrauma by enabling the unique experimental paradigms (e.g., isogenic models) associated with hiPSC-derived neurons.
