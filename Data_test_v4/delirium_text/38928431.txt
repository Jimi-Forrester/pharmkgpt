38928431|a|In orbital and ground-based experiments, it has been demonstrated that ionizing radiation (IR) can stimulate the locomotor and exploratory activity of rodents, but the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon remains undisclosed. Here, we studied the effect of combined IR (0.4 Gy gamma-rays and 0.14 Gy carbon-12 nuclei) on the locomotor and exploratory activity of rats, and assessed the sensorimotor cortex volume by magnetic resonance imaging-based morphometry at 1 week and 7 months post-irradiation. The sensorimotor cortex tissues were processed to determine whether the behavioral and morphologic effects were associated with changes in neurotrophin content. The irradiated rats were characterized by increased locomotor and exploratory activity, as well as novelty-seeking behavior, at 3 days post-irradiation. At the same time, only unirradiated rats experienced a significant decrease in the sensorimotor cortex volume at 7 months. While there were no significant differences at 1 week, at 7 months, the irradiated rats were characterized by higher neurotrophin-3 and neurotrophin-4 content in the sensorimotor cortex. Thus, IR prevents the age-associated decrease in the sensorimotor cortex volume, which is associated with neurotrophic and neurogenic changes. Meanwhile, IR-induced increases in locomotor activity may be the cause of the observed changes.
