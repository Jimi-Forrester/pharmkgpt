35601215|a|Introduction: Toxoplasmosis is one of the protozoan diseases caused by Toxoplasma gondii. This study is aimed at evaluating the seroprevalence and associated risk factors of Toxoplasma gondii infection in the population referred to rural and urban health care centers in Zahedan, southeast Iran. Methods: A total of 1,324 blood samples of patients referred to the health care centers were evaluated using the IgG Toxoplasma ELISA Kit, between October 2019 and August 2021. The obtained data were analyzed through univariable and multivariable regression models. Results: The seropositivity of Toxoplasma gondii infection was obtained at 18.8%. In the multivariable logistic regression model, risk factors including age group of 11-30 (OR = 3.25, 95% CI: 1.29-7.06), urban residency (OR = 4.36, 95% CI: 2.9-6.3), students (OR = 3.76, 95% CI: 1.88-4.53), and contact with cat (OR = 7.67, 95% CI: 4.76-12.36) were significantly associated with seropositivity to Toxoplasma gondii infection. Moreover, consumption of washed vegetables with salt or detergents decreases (OR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.09-0.23) the risk of Toxoplasma gondii infection. According to the results of the multivariable logistic regression, no significant association was observed between seropositivity to Toxoplasma gondii and other risk factors. Conclusion: The results of this study indicated significant seropositivity to Toxoplasma gondii infection in the population referred to rural and urban health care centers in Zahedan, Iran. Therefore, health programs should be considered for raising awareness regarding the risk factors for Toxoplasma gondii infection in this region.
