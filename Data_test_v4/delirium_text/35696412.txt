35696412|a|Septic patients commonly present with central nervous system (CNS) disorders including impaired consciousness and delirium. Today, the main mechanism regulating sepsis-induced cerebral disorders is believed to be neuroinflammation. However, it is unknown how another component of the CNS, the spinal cord, is influenced during sepsis. In the present study, we intraperitoneally injected mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to investigate molecular and immunohistochemical changes in the spinal cord of a sepsis model. After LPS administration in the spinal cord, pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA were rapidly and drastically induced. Twenty-four-hour after the LPS injection, severe neuronal ischemic damage spread into gray matter, especially around the anterior horns, and the anterior column had global edematous changes. Immunostaining analyses showed that spinal microglia were significantly activated and increased, but astrocytes did not show significant change. The current results indicate that sepsis induces acute neuroinflammation, including microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine upregulation in the spinal cord, causing drastic neuronal ischemia and white matter edema in the spinal cord.
