35889532|t|Involvement of Resveratrol against Brain Cancer: A Combination Strategy with a Pharmaceutical Approach.
35889532|a|A brain tumor (BT) is a condition in which there is growth or uncontrolled development of the brain cells, which usually goes unrecognized or is diagnosed at the later stages. Since the mechanism behind BT is not clear, and the various physiological conditions are difficult to diagnose, the success rate of BT is not very high. This is the central issue faced during drug development and clinical trials with almost all types of neurodegenerative disorders. In the first part of this review, we focus on the concept of brain tumors, their barriers, and the types of delivery possible to target the brain cells. Although various treatment methods are available, they all have side effects or toxic effects. Hence, in the second part, a correlation was made between the use of resveratrol, a potent antioxidant, and its advantages for brain diseases. The relationship between brain disease and the blood-brain barrier, multi-drug resistance, and the use of nanomedicine for treating brain disorders is also mentioned. In short, a hypothetical concept is given with a background investigation into the use of combination therapy with resveratrol as an active ingredient, the possible drug delivery, and its formulation-based approach.
