37656731|a|OBJECTIVE: In critically ill adults with delirium, biomarkers of systemic inflammation, astrocyte activation, neuroprotection, and systemic inflammation measured at one week of critical illness may be associated with mortality. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Intensive care unit (ICU). PATIENTS: 178 ICU patients with delirium, alive and remaining in ICU at one week. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Blood samples collected for a pair of previously published, negative, clinical trials were utilized. Samples were collected at study enrollment/ICU admission (Day 1 sample) and one week later (Day 8 sample), and analyzed for interleukins (IL)-6, 8, 10, Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF), S100 Binding Protein (S100B), Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-A) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP). Delirium, delirium severity, and coma were assessed twice daily using Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU), CAM-ICU-7, and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS), respectively. Mortality was assessed until discharge using the electronic medical record. Logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, severity of illness, comorbidities, sepsis, and randomization status, were used to assess the relationship among biomarkers and mortality. Higher IL-10 quartiles at day 8 were associated with increased odds of hospital mortality (IL-10: OR 2.00 95%CI: 1.1-3.65, p = 0.023). There was a significant interaction between day 1 and day 8 biomarker quartiles only for IL-6. Patients with IL-6 values in the first three quartiles on admission to the ICU that transitioned to higher IL-6 quartiles at day 8 had increased probability of hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: In this hypothesis-generating study, higher IL-6 and IL-10 quartiles at one week, and increase in IL-6 from day 1 to day 8 were associated with increased hospital mortality. Studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm the mechanisms for these observations.
