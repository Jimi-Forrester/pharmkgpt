15917099|a|Linkage studies suggest the presence of putative risk and/or age-at-onset genes for Alzheimer's disease on Chromosome 10. Recently, a genomic converging approach using a combination of linkage, expression and association studies has reported significant associations of the glutathione S-transferase omega 1 and 2 (GSTO1 and GSTO2) genes and possibly the protease serine 11 (PRSS11) gene on chromosome 10 with age-at-onset, but not risk, for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson disease. We investigated the association of the reported three polymorphisms in 990 sporadic late-onset AD cases (26% autopsy confirmed) and 735 controls. In our sample, we found no association either with age-at-onset in AD cases or with disease risk in the case-control cohort. However, haplotype analysis revealed a modest association of one haplotype with AD risk (p = 0.04). Additional markers in these genes need to be screened to explore their role in the etiology of AD.
