8718914|t|Sedation for symptom control in Japan: the importance of intermittent use and communication with family members.
8718914|a|We reviewed the circumstances surrounding the use of sedation for symptom control in a Japanese hospice. Of 143 inpatients, 69 (48.3%) received sedation and died an average 3.9 days after sedation was begun. Symptoms requiring sedation included dyspnea, pain, general malaise, agitation, and nausea. In 83% of cases, those symptoms were escalating as death approached. In about one-half of the cases, sedation was carried out intermittently until the patient died. Sedation was gained by such sedatives as midazolam, morphine, and haloperidol. Side effects included suppression of the respiratory and/or circulatory system in nine cases (in four cases it caused death), and delirium in one case; tolerance and dependence were also observed in two cases. We also examined the explanation to and understanding of the patients and their family members about sedation. This experience suggested the type of communication methods that are likely to be useful in Japan. It stresses the importance of intermittent use of sedation and communication with family members. We propose criteria for sedation to improve symptom control that would be acceptable in Japan.
