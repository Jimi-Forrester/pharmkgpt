28302384|t|The bridging integrator 1 Gene rs7561528 polymorphism contributes to Alzheimer's disease susceptibility in East Asian and Caucasian populations.
28302384|a|Genetic variants of the bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) at the rs7561528 single nucleotide polymorphism were implicated in increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in several case-control association studies. However, the studies have reported apparently conflicting results. Here, we searched the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. In total, 17,179 AD patients and 17,448 healthy controls (HCs) from 18 studies are included in the current study to examine the association between this polymorphism and AD risk. Significant associations of the SNP rs242557 with AD are found under allelic [A vs. G: odds ratio (OR)=0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.78, 0.96, P=0.006], dominant (AA+AG vs. GG: OR=0.87, 95% CI=0.77, 0.97, P=0.01), recessive (AA vs. AG+GG: OR=0.86, 95% CI=0.76, 0.98, P=0.21), homozygous (AA vs. GG: OR=0.86, 95% CI=0.76, 0.99, P=0.03) and heterozygous (AG vs. GG: OR=0.87, 95% CI=0.83, 0.92, P<0.00001) models in the pooled populations, under allelic (OR=0.77, 95% CI=0.65, 0.91, P=0.002), dominant (OR=0.75, 95% CI=0.63, 0.90, P=0.001) and heterozygous (OR =0.79, 95% CI=0.70, 0.88, P<0.0001) models in East Asian population, under heterozygous (OR=0.89, 95% CI=0.84, 0.94, P<0.0001) model in Caucasian population. The results of the current meta-analysis suggest that the rs7561528 A allele carriers may be a protective factor against susceptibility to AD under all the genetic models in the pooled populations and under allelic and dominant model in East Asian population, and individuals with A/G heterozygous genotype are not prone to suffer from AD in both Asians and Caucasians.
