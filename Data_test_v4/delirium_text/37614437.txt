37614437|t|Enhancement of neural regeneration as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease (Review).
37614437|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia worldwide, has gradually become a global health concern for society and individuals with the process of global ageing. Although extensive research has been carried out on AD, the etiology and pathological mechanism of the disease are still unclear, and there is no specific drug to cure or delay AD progression. The exploration of enhancing nerve regeneration in AD has gradually attracted increasing attention. In the current review, the existing therapeutic strategies were summarized to induce nerve regeneration which can increase the number of neurons, and improve the survival of neurons, the plasticity of synapses and synaptic activity. The strategies include increasing neurotrophic expression (such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor), inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (such as donepezil, tacrine, rivastigmine and galanthamine), elevating histone deacetylase levels (such as RGFP-966, Tasquinimod, CM-414 and 44B), stimulating the brain by physiotherapy (such as near-infrared light, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation) and transplanting exogenous neural stem cells. However, further evaluations need to be performed to determine the optimal treatment. The present study reviews recent interventions for enhancing adult neurogenesis and attempts to elucidate their mechanisms of action, which may provide a theoretical basis for inducing nerve regeneration to fight against AD.
