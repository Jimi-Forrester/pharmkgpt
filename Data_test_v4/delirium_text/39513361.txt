39513361|a|Radiotherapy (RT) remains a primary treatment modality for glioblastoma (GBM), but it induces cellular senescence and is strongly implicated in GBM progression and RT-related injury. Recently, eliminating senescent cells has emerged as a promising strategy for treating cancer and for mitigating radiation-induced brain injury (RBI). Here, we investigated the impact of all-trans retinoic acid (RA) on radiation-induced senescence. The findings of this study revealed that RA effectively eliminated astrocytes, which are particularly prone to senescence after radiation, and that the removal of senescence-associated secretory phenotype factor-producing astrocytes inhibited GBM cell proliferation in vitro. Moreover, RA-mediated clearance of senescent cells improved survival in GBM-bearing mice and alleviated radiation-induced cognitive impairment. Through RNA sequencing, we found that the AKT/mTOR/PPARgamma/Plin4 signaling pathway is involved in RA-mediated clearance of senescent cells. In summary, these results suggest that RA could be a potential senolytic drug for preventing GBM progression and improving RBI.
