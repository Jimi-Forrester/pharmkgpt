30177678|a|The analysis of the available databases related to HIV/AIDS confirms a paradigm shift in the patient's life expectancy: now HIV has become a chronic disease, so patients are aging. However, this advance is accompanied by a negative counterpart: due to the increase in the number of years of life gained, there is a prevalence of comorbidities greater than the general population and at an earlier age. Reducing the risk associated with all the comorbidities that the ageing patient with HIV/AIDS may develop, must now be a health objective; it must be added to the traditional objectives that until now were part of the strategy to reduce the impact of the HIV infection. In the specific case of women, it is also necessary to train peri and postmenopausal women to increase their skills and motivation to care for their health; It is also very important to examine the role that hormone replacement therapy can play in reducing their symptoms.
