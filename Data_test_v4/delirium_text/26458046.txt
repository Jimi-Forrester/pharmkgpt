26458046|a|Small heat-shock proteins, including alphaB-crystallin (alphaB), play an important part in protein homeostasis, because their ATP-independent chaperone activity inhibits uncontrolled protein aggregation. Mechanistic details of human alphaB, particularly in its client-bound state, have been elusive so far, owing to the high molecular weight and the heterogeneity of these complexes. Here we provide structural insights into this highly dynamic assembly and show, by using state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy, that the alphaB complex is assembled from asymmetric building blocks. Interaction studies demonstrated that the fibril-forming Alzheimer's disease Abeta1-40 peptide preferentially binds to a hydrophobic edge of the central beta-sandwich of alphaB. In contrast, the amorphously aggregating client lysozyme is captured by the partially disordered N-terminal domain of alphaB. We suggest that alphaB uses its inherent structural plasticity to expose distinct binding interfaces and thus interact with a wide range of structurally variable clients.
