36572791|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is considered one of the most diseases that much prevalent among elderly people all over the world. AD is an incurable neurodegenerative disease affecting cognitive functions and were characterized by progressive and collective functions deteriorating. Remarkably, early detection of AD is essential for the development of new and invented treatment strategies. As Dementia causes irreversible damage to the brain neurons and leads to changes in its structure that can be described adequately within the framework of multifractals. Hence, the present work focus on developing a promising and efficient computing technique to pre-process and classify the AD disease especially in the early stages using multifractal geometry to extract the most changeable features due to AD. Then, A machine learning classification algorithm (K-Nearest Neighbor) has been implemented in order to classify and detect the main four early stages of AD. Two datasets have been used to ensure the validation of the proposed methodology. The proposed technique has achieved 99.4% accuracy and 100% sensitivity. The comparative results show that the proposed classification technique outperforms is recent techniques in terms of performance measures.
