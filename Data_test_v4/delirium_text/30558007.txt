30558007|t|Associations of the ABCA1 gene polymorphisms with plasma lipid levels: A meta-analysis.
30558007|a|BACKGROUND: Studies on the associations of the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter A1 gene (ABCA1) rs2230806, rs2230808, and rs2066714 polymorphisms with plasma lipid levels have reported apparently conflicting findings. This meta-analysis aimed to clarify the relationships between the 3 polymorphisms and fasting lipid levels. METHODS: A comprehensive search of the literature was carried out by using the databases including Medline, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP. The studies that presented mean lipids and standard deviations or standard errors according to the rs2230806, rs2230808, and/or rs2066714 genotypes were examined and included. The random effects model was used. Standardized mean difference and 95% confidence interval were used to assess the differences in lipid levels between the genotypes. Heterogeneity among studies was tested by Cochran's chi-based Q-statistic, and Galbraith plots were used to detect the potential sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed by Begg's rank correlation test as well as funnel plots. RESULTS: Sixty-two studies (48,452 subjects), 12 studies (9853 subjects) and 14 studies (10,727 subjects) were identified for the rs2230806, rs2230808, and rs2066714 polymorphisms, respectively. A dominant model was used for all the polymorphisms in this meta-analysis. The A allele carriers of the rs2230806 polymorphism had higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (P <.001), and lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (P =.03) and triglycerides (TG) (P <.01) than the non-carriers. The A allele carriers of the rs2230808 polymorphism had higher levels of total cholesterol (TC) (P <.001) than the non-carriers. The G allele carriers of the rs2066714 polymorphism had higher levels of TC (P <.01) and HDL-C (P = .02) than the non-carriers. CONCLUSION: The ABCA1 rs2230806, rs2230808, and rs2066714 polymorphisms are significantly associated with plasma lipid levels in the present meta-analysis.
