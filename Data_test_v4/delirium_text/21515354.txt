21515354|a|beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta1-42)-induced learning and memory impairment in rats is believed to be associated with inflammation. Cytokine production is a key pathologic event in the progression of inflammatory processes. In this rat study, soybean isoflavones (SIF) was used to investigate it's protective effects on inflammation caused by beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta1-42), which is associated with learning and memory impairment in Alzheimer disease. We characterized the learning and memory ability. cytokine profiles of circulating interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the serum and the expression of Toll like receptor4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor-kappaB p65 (NF-kappaB p65) mRNA and protein in the brain tissue following intracerebroventricular administration of Abeta1-42 by miniosmotic pump for 14 days. The results showed that functional deficits of learning and memory in SIF treatment groups were significantly improved compared to the control group without SIF treatment in water maze test. The serum IL-1beta and TNF-alpha level were significantly increased, and the expressions of TLR4 and NF-kappaB p65 mRNA and protein in the brain were up-regulated, indicating inflammation response was initiated following administration of Abeta1-42. After intragastric pre-treatment with SIF, inflammatory cytokines was significantly reduced and also SIF reversed the Abeta1-42 induced up-regulation of TLR4 and NF-kappaB p65 mRNA and protein expression in the brain and expression of NF-kappaB p65 in nuclei. These results suggested that SIF reduced the cytokine cascade and inflammatory response induced by Abeta1-42 which could result in the improvement of spatial learning and memory ability impairment in the rats.
