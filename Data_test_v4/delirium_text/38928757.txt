38928757|a|This article provides an overview of the literature data on the role of liposomal structures and encapsulated substances in food technology and human nutrition. The paper briefly describes how liposomes are created and how they encapsulate food ingredients, which can either be individual compounds or plant extracts. Another very interesting application of liposomes is their use as antimicrobial carriers to protect food products from spoilage during storage. The encapsulation of food ingredients in liposomes can increase their bioavailability, which is particularly important for compounds with health-promoting properties but low bioavailability. Particular attention was paid to compounds such as phytosterols, which lower blood cholesterol levels but have very low absorption in the human body. In addition, consumer expectations and regulations for liposomes in food are discussed. To date, no in vivo human studies have been conducted to indicate which encapsulation methods give the best results for gastrointestinal effects and which food-added substances are most stable during food storage and processing. The paper identifies further lines of research that are needed before liposomes can be introduced into food.
