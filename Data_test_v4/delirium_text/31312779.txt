31312779|t|Treatment-Seeking Delay Among Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Women with Acute Myocardial Infarction.
31312779|a|Purpose: Women and minorities with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) often fail to recognize prodromal symptoms leading to delays in care. The objective of this study was to conduct a mixed method assessment of the impact of ethnicity on symptom description, recognition, and treatment-seeking behavior in Hispanic and non-Hispanic women before hospitalization for AMI. Methods: We explored differences in symptomatology, treatment-seeking behavior, and delay patterns among a convenience sample of 43 women diagnosed with AMI (17 Hispanic women, 26 non-Hispanic women) in seven rural and urban Colorado hospitals. We performed in-depth interviews to establish patterns (typologies) of treatment-seeking behaviors. Chart abstraction provided delay times as a function of ethnicity. Results: Most (28/43) women reported prodromal symptoms in the weeks before their index AMI. Overall, fewer Hispanic women presented within 24 h of symptom onset (3/18, 17% vs. 15/18, 83%, p<0.01). A typology of treatment-seeking behavior emerged: women who (1) recognized symptoms and promptly sought care; (2) did not recognize symptoms, yet promptly sought care; (3) recognized symptoms and promptly sought care, but providers misconstrued symptoms as noncardiac; and (4) misinterpreted symptoms due to an underlying chronic disease. Conclusion: Women and primary care providers often underappreciate prodromal AMI symptoms. Hispanic women are more likely to misinterpret ischemic symptoms and delay care, suggesting a need for tailored patient and provider education.
