21711064|t|Rivastigmine transdermal patch: a review of its use in the management of dementia of the Alzheimer's type.
21711064|a|Rivastigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is available as a transdermal patch (Exelon( ) patch, Rivastach( ) patch, Prometax( ) patch) for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Rivastigmine transdermal patch was effective, in terms of improving cognitive and global function, and generally well tolerated in patients with mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type in a large, well designed trial. Most adverse events associated with rivastigmine patch were mild to moderate in severity, with the patch generally better tolerated than oral rivastigmine, especially in terms of cholinergic gastrointestinal adverse events. The patch also had good skin adhesion and a favourable skin tolerability profile in this study, with most application-site reactions being mild in severity. Additionally, in a safety and tolerability study, rivastigmine patch, regardless of concomitant memantine therapy, was generally well tolerated in patients switching from oral donepezil therapy. Thus, current evidence suggests that rivastigmine transdermal patch is an effective treatment option for patients with Alzheimer's disease, with the potential for improving compliance and providing sustained clinical benefit because of its ease of use and generally favourable tolerability profile.
