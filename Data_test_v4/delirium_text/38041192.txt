38041192|a|BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is characterized by symptoms of delirium including hallucinations, impaired concentration, agitation, or coma and is associated with poor outcome in the early phase of sepsis. In addition, sepsis survivors often suffer from persisting memory deficits and impaired executive functions. Recent studies provide evidence that microglia are involved in the pathophysiology of SAE. METHODS: Here, we investigated whether pharmacological depletion of microglia using PLX5622 (1200 ppm or 300 ppm) in the acute phase of sepsis is able to prevent long-term neurocognitive decline in a male mouse model of polymicrobial sepsis or lipopolysaccharide-induced sterile neuroinflammation. Therefore, we performed the novel object recognition test at different time points after sepsis to address hippocampus-dependent learning. To further assess synapse engulfment in microglia, colocalization analysis was performed using high-resolution 3D Airyscan imaging of Iba1 and Homer1. We also investigated the effect of PLX5622 on acute astrocyte and chronic microglia proliferation in the hippocampus after sepsis induction using immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: High-dose application of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor PLX5622 (1200 ppm) seven days prior to sepsis induction lead to 70-80% microglia reduction but resulted in fatal outcome of bacterial sepsis or LPS induced inflammation. This is likely caused by severely compromised host immune response upon PLX5622-induced depletion of peripheral monocytes and macrophages. We therefore tested partial microglia depletion using a low-dose of PLX5622 (300 ppm) for seven days prior to sepsis which resulted in an increased survival in comparison to littermates subjected to high-dose CSF1R inhibiton and to a stable microglia reduction of ~ 40%. This partial microglia depletion in the acute stage of sepsis largely prevented the engulfment and microglia-induced stripping of postsynaptic terminals. In addition, PLX5622 low-dose microglia depletion attenuated acute astrogliosis as well as long-term microgliosis and prevented long-term neurocognitive decline after experimental sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that partial microglia depletion before the induction of sepsis may be sufficient to attenuate long-term neurocognitive dysfunction. Application of PLX5622 (300 ppm) acts by reducing microglia-induced synaptic attachement/engulfment and preventing chronic microgliosis.
