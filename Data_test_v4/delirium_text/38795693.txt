38795693|t|Borneol regulates meningeal lymphatic valve plasticity to clear Abeta aggregates in the prevention of AD-like symptoms.
38795693|a|BACKGROUND: Meningeal lymphatic vessels (mLVs) have great potential to be the therapeutic target for beta Amyloid protein (Abeta) clearing in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the regulatory methods of the mLVs are limited. The lymphatic valve, marked by FOXC2, is the fundamental structure for maintaining stable lymphatic drainage function. Preliminary evidence suggested that borneol (BO) as the classical phytochemicals could enhance the expression of FOXC2 in the mLVs of healthy mice. PURPOSE: This study aims to explore the regulatory ability of BO on lymphatic valves of mLVs in the AD model mice. STUDY DESIGN: We used the intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta42 oligomers to construct the AD-like symptoms model induced by toxic protein deposition. We administered BO nano micelles(BO-Ms) orally before and after to simulate the AD prevention and treatment strategy. METHODS: Herein, this study characterized the efficacy and pathways of BO-Ms for regulating mLVs in AD model by Rt-PCR, WB and confocal microscopy, and determined the effects of BO-Ms on Abeta clearance, behavior and safety of AD mice. RESULTS: The AD modeling process severely impaired the expression of lymphatic valves. However, after oral administering BO-Ms for prevention and treatment, an increase in the lymphatic valves of the transverse sinus was observed, which derived from the up-regulation of the transcription factor (FOXC2 and Akt) and the down-regulation of the transcription inhibitors (FOXO1 and PRDM1). Furthermore, the effects of BO-Ms on the lymphatic valves could enhance the lymphatic drainage of the mLVs in AD-like mice, promoting the clearance of toxicity aggregates, protecting neurons, and alleviating AD-like symptoms. Simultaneously, continuous oral BO-Ms for 30 days didn't show any significant organ toxicity. The most important thing was that the preventive effect of BO administration was superior to therapeutic administration in all data. CONCLUSION: In summary, our research indicated that BO is a promoter of lymphatic valve formation in the mLVs, and could prevent or repair damage caused by toxic Abeta42. BO was the only bioactive natural product with the ability to regulate mLVs valves. Thus, BO has the potential to become phytochemicals for alleviating AD symptoms by enhancing the drainage function of mLVs.
