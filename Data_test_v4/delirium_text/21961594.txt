21961594|t|Binding of the molecular chaperone alphaB-crystallin to Abeta amyloid fibrils inhibits fibril elongation.
21961594|a|The molecular chaperone alphaB-crystallin is a small heat-shock protein that is upregulated in response to a multitude of stress stimuli, and is found colocalized with Abeta amyloid fibrils in the extracellular plaques that are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. We investigated whether this archetypical small heat-shock protein has the ability to interact with Abeta fibrils in vitro. We find that alphaB-crystallin binds to wild-type Abeta(42) fibrils with micromolar affinity, and also binds to fibrils formed from the E22G Arctic mutation of Abeta(42). Immunoelectron microscopy confirms that binding occurs along the entire length and ends of the fibrils. Investigations into the effect of alphaB-crystallin on the seeded growth of Abeta fibrils, both in solution and on the surface of a quartz crystal microbalance biosensor, reveal that the binding of alphaB-crystallin to seed fibrils strongly inhibits their elongation. Because the lag phase in sigmoidal fibril assembly kinetics is dominated by elongation and fragmentation rates, the chaperone mechanism identified here represents a highly effective means to inhibit fibril proliferation. Together with previous observations of alphaB-crystallin interaction with alpha-synuclein and insulin fibrils, the results suggest that this mechanism is a generic means of providing molecular chaperone protection against amyloid fibril formation.
