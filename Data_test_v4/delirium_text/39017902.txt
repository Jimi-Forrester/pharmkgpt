39017902|a|PURPOSE: Obstructive sleep apnoea hypoventilation syndrome (OSAHS) is a common sleep disorder that affects multiple body systems, which in turn is closely associated with cognitive dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, oncological cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders. In recent years, non-coding RNA (ncRNA) has emerged as a new opportunity for biomarker discovery. We therefore discuss the research progress and potential role of ncRNAs in obstructive sleep apnea hypoventilation syndrome. METHODS: This review systematically searched relevant academic literature from PubMed, Web of Science and other databases. During the retrieval process, a combination of keywords such as "OSAHS", "ncRNA", "lncRNA", "miRAN", "circRNA" was used for search. RESULTS: Circulating ncRNA has good area under the ROC curve, sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of OSAHS, and has the potential to become a diagnostic marker for OSAHS, while several circulating ncRNAs or circulating ncRNAs in combination with other tests such as the Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Screening Scale have a higher value of application as a test for OSAHS. Further analyses revealed that many circulating ncRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in the serum of OSAHS patients with different very severities, a potential marker for predicting the severity of OSAHS, and that the ncRNA content of patients' serum also had a significant effect during CPAP therapy, suggesting that it may have potential for therapeutic monitoring. Meanwhile, serum ncRNAs from patients have been shown to be effective in the diagnosis of OSAHS complications such as hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, acute myocardial infarction and atherosclerosis. The expression of up- or down-regulated ncRNAs can regulate different signalling pathways, which in turn affects various OSAHS complications such as pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cognitive dysfunction, and is expected to become a new direction for the treatment of these complications. CONCLUSIONS: The changes in ncRNA expression in OSAHS patients are expected to be a novel biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of OSAHS, and can also be used as a potential biomarker for the combination of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and cognitive dysfunction in OSAHS. It is believed that the continuous progress of ncRNA-related research is expected to promote the early detection, diagnosis and treatment of OSAHS and its complications.
