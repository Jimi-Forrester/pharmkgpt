37915877|t|Nutmeg Intoxication: A Case Report.
37915877|a|Nutmeg intoxication is an uncommon precipitant of hyperactive delirium with severe agitation (HDSA) with anticholinergic properties that require a high index of suspicion for diagnosis. We present a case of a young adult who presented to the emergency department (ED) with HDSA. The patient was intubated and transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to increasing safety threats unresponsive to multimodal de-escalation. He ultimately self-extubated, reported excessive nutmeg ingestion, and was discharged home after a short period of observation. Improved detection and streamlined management pathways for nutmeg intoxication will minimize unnecessary invasive procedures and costs to the healthcare system.
