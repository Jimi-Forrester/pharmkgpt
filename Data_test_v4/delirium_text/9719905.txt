9719905|t|Psychosis associated with hypopituitarism.
9719905|a|Psychosis is one of many possible psychiatric disturbances associated with endocrinologic abnormalities. Previous reports linking psychosis with hypopituitarism have been limited. Furthermore, such reports suggested that the psychotic symptoms were more accurately part of a delirium. We report two patients with hypopituitarism who presented with psychotic symptoms, in the absence of an altered sensorium. They were assigned functional psychiatric diagnoses on initial presentation. Their symptoms abated after correction of underlying hormonal abnormalities. The evaluation and treatment of psychiatric disturbances associated with hypopituitarism are discussed.
