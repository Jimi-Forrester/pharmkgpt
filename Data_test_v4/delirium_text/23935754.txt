23935754|a|The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of the surface characteristics of nanoporous titanium oxide films, formed by anodization on Ti-24Nb-4Zr-8Sn (Ti2448) alloy, on the early adhesion of osteoblast-like MG-63 cells. Nanoporous titanium oxide films with two different pore sizes (30 and 90 nm) were formed by anodization in NH4F solution on Ti2448 alloy. The surface roughness of the nanoporous titanium oxide films was determined using a Surftest Formtracer and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Cell viability was evaluated at different time points using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. To investigate the regulatory mechanisms involved in the focal adhesion of osteoblasts to Ti2448 alloy, we quantified the expression levels of integrin beta1 and paxillin mRNAs on the nanoporous titanium oxide films during early osteoblast adhesion using real-time RT-PCR. Samples with a 30-nm nanoporous film exhibited a greater number of overlapping microporous structures with microprojections compared with the 90-nm nanoporous film samples. The MTT assay indicated that cell viability on the 30-nm nanoporous surface following 24 and 48 h of cell culture was higher than those observed on the unanodized control and 90-nm nanoporous surfaces. Integrin beta1 mRNA expression levels on the 30-nm nanoporous surface following cell culture for 48 h were also significantly higher compared with those on the unanodized control and 90-nm nanoporous surfaces. The results demonstrated that a 30-nm nanoporous titanium oxide film on Ti2448 alloy may provide the optimum bioactive implant surface for the initial adhesion of osteoblasts.
