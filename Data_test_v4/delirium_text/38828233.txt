38828233|a|Background and objective: Delirium is the most common neuropsychological complication among older adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and is often associated with a poor prognosis. This study aimed to construct and validate an interpretable machine learning (ML) for early delirium prediction in older ICU patients. Methods: This was a retrospective observational cohort study and patient data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. Feature variables associated with delirium, including predisposing factors, disease-related factors, and iatrogenic and environmental factors, were selected using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, and prediction models were built using logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), k-nearest neighbors and naive Bayes methods. Multiple metrics were used for evaluation of performance of the models, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, recall, F1 score, calibration plot, and decision curve analysis. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to improve the interpretability of the final model. Results: Nine thousand seven hundred forty-eight adults aged 65 years or older were included for analysis. Twenty-six features were selected to construct ML prediction models. Among the models compared, the XGBoost model demonstrated the best performance including the highest AUC (0.836), accuracy (0.765), sensitivity (0.713), recall (0.713), and F1 score (0.725) in the training set. It also exhibited excellent discrimination with AUC of 0.810, good calibration, and had the highest net benefit in the validation cohort. The SHAP summary analysis showed that Glasgow Coma Scale, mechanical ventilation, and sedation were the top three risk features for outcome prediction. The SHAP dependency plot and SHAP force analysis interpreted the model at both the factor level and individual level, respectively. Conclusion: ML is a reliable tool for predicting the risk of critical delirium in elderly patients. By combining XGBoost and SHAP, it can provide clear explanations for personalized risk prediction and more intuitive understanding of the effect of key features in the model. The establishment of such a model would facilitate the early risk assessment and prompt intervention for delirium.
