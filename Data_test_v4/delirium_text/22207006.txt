22207006|a|The assessment and management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be challenging, and ethical dilemmas often arise. Clinicians often perceive a disconnect between evidence-based guidelines and the challenges of treating BPSD in moderate to severe AD. Reconciliation of salient ethical issues can help bridge this disconnect. In view of the fact that AD is a progressive and ultimately fatal disease, and given that there are often competing considerations when managing BPSD in moderate to severe AD, we propose a palliative care approach that prioritizes the recognition of personhood and the preservation of dignity. We present case illustrations, discuss the concepts of dignity and personhood during palliative care in AD, and encourage the use of the bioethical grid in navigating complex clinical challenges.
