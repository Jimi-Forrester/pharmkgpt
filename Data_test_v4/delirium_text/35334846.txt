35334846|t|Guava Fruit and Acacia pennata Vegetable Intake Association with Frailty of Older Adults in Northern Thailand.
35334846|a|As Thailand moves toward an aging society, frailty has become a concern amongst northern Thai elderly. The causes of frailty are multifactorial and include genetic, environmental, and socio-economic factors; diet is of particular interest. A cross-sectional study was conducted from September to October 2017 to investigate what kind of diets normally consumed by 350 Thai elders were associated with frailty using a questionnaire and frailty determination by Fried's phenotype followed by phytochemical analyses of the diets. The multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated a significant positive association between certain foods and lower frailty. Guava fruit and Acacia pennata vegetable consumption had lower odds of frailty, which were 0.52 times (95% CI 0.28-0.96, p = 0.037) and 0.42 times (95% CI 0.21-0.83, p = 0.012) when adjusted for the potential confounders. The phytochemical analyses of guava fruit showed a significantly higher amount of total flavonoids (p < 0.001), total phenolic compounds (p = 0.002), and antioxidant capacity, including DPPH (p < 0.001), ABTS (p < 0.001), and FRAP (p = 0.002) when compared to those of banana. Acacia pennata vegetable contained a significantly higher amount of total phenolic compounds (p = 0.012) when compared to those of lettuce. These findings may assist in health promotion programs of frailty prevention by encouraging an increase in consumption of either guava fruit or Acacia pennata vegetable among Thai elderly.
