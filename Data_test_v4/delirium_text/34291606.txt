34291606|a|INTRODUCTION: Cadmium (Cd) is the most dangerous heavy metal that is becoming more widespread in nature as a result of industrial activities. One of the toxic effects of Cd on the body is its neurological effect. The mechanism of these effects has been attributed to the induction of oxidative stress. Ferulla plant has antioxidant properties. In the present study, the aim was to reduce the toxic effects of Cd on memory impairment in rats by through the consumption of Ferulla extract. MATERIALS & METHOD: Rats were randomly divided into five groups of six: (1) control group, (2) 300 muM cadmium exposure group, and three treatment groups with doses of (3) 100, (4) 300, and (5) 600 mg/kg.BW of F. Ferulla extract after Cd exposure. To induce neurotoxicity, Cd was daily injected peritoneally at a concentration of 300 muM in 1 ml of normal saline for a week. Next, for 3 weeks, the Cd group received 1 ml of normal peritoneal saline, and the treatment groups received F. Ferulla extract at concentrations of 100, 300, and 600 mg/kg.BW in 1 ml of normal saline daily for a week. At the end of the treatment period, a water maze was used to assess memory disorders. Malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione concentration (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity in nerve tissue were also measured. Morris water maze was also performed after intervention. RESULTS: Cd-induced neurotoxicity was shown in Cd groups. MDA, GSH, and GPX have a significant difference in comparison between the Cd and 300, 600 treated groups. MDA has a significant increase (p < 0.05), and GSH and GPX have a significant decrease (p < 0.05). The results of the Morris water maze showed that the Cd group spent either 300 or 600 more distances and time to find a place to escape, which was significant (p < 0.05) CONCLUSION: Cd exposure can induce neurotoxicity and disrupt learning and memory. On the other hand, Ferulla extract can improve learning and memory in Cd-induced neurotoxicity model via induced antioxidant defense system.
