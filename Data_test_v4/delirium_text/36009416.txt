36009416|a|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum biomarkers are critical for clinical decision making in neurological diseases. In cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), white matter hyperintensities (WMH) are an important neuroimaging biomarker, but more blood-based biomarkers capturing different aspects of CSVD pathology are needed. In 42 sporadic CSVD patients, we prospectively analysed WMH on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the biomarkers neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), chitinase3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1), Tau and Abeta1-42 in CSF and NfL and GFAP in serum. GFAP and CHI3L1 expression was studied in post-mortem brain tissue in additional cases. CSVD cases with higher serum NfL and GFAP levels had a higher modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and NIHSS score and lower CSF Abeta1-42 levels, whereas the CSF NfL and CHI3L1 levels were positively correlated with the WMH load. Moreover, the serum GFAP levels significantly correlated with the neurocognitive functions. Pathological analyses in CSVD revealed a high density of GFAP-immunoreactive fibrillary astrocytic processes in the periventricular white matter and clusters of CHI3L1-immunoreactive astrocytes in the basal ganglia and thalamus. Thus, besides NfL, serum GFAP is a highly promising fluid biomarker of sporadic CSVD, because it does not only correlate with the clinical severity but also correlates with the cognitive function in patients.
