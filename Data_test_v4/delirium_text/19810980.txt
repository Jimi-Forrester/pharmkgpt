19810980|a|Alterations have been demonstrated in membrane phospholipid metabolism in Alzheimer's disease. Alterations in membrane phospholipid metabolite levels have been observed by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy 4 years before onset of cognitive changes. Implications of phospholipid membrane changes in Alzheimer's disease are presented. Augmentation of brain levels of acetyl-l-carnitine, an endogenous molecule, may help to reverse membrane phospholipid changes in Alzheimer's disease. Neurobiological effects of acetyl-l-carnitine and potential molecular mechanisms of acetyl-l-carnitine activity are reviewed. Clinical trials of acetyl-l-carnitine indicate that it is well-tolerated and may be effective in younger Alzheimer's disease patients and may be an effective adjuvant treatment. Acetyl-l-carnitine may especially benefit those Alzheimer's disease patients with depressive disorders.
