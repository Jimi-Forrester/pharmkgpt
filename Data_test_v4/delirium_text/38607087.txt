38607087|t|Mitochondrial Permeability Transition, Cell Death and Neurodegeneration.
38607087|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are chronic conditions occurring when neurons die in specific brain regions that lead to loss of movement or cognitive functions. Despite the progress in understanding the mechanisms of this pathology, currently no cure exists to treat these types of diseases: for some of them the only help is alleviating the associated symptoms. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of most the neurodegenerative disorders. The fast and transient permeability of mitochondria (the mitochondrial permeability transition, mPT) has been shown to be an initial step in the mechanism of apoptotic and necrotic cell death, which acts as a regulator of tissue regeneration for postmitotic neurons as it leads to the irreparable loss of cells and cell function. In this study, we review the role of the mitochondrial permeability transition in neuronal death in major neurodegenerative diseases, covering the inductors of mPTP opening in neurons, including the major ones-free radicals and calcium-and we discuss perspectives and difficulties in the development of a neuroprotective strategy based on the inhibition of mPTP in neurodegenerative disorders.
