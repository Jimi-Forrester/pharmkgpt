36640353|t|Progressive development of melanoma-induced cachexia differentially impacts organ systems in mice.
36640353|a|Cachexia is a systemic wasting syndrome that increases cancer-associated mortality. How cachexia progressively and differentially impacts distinct tissues is largely unknown. Here, we find that the heart and skeletal muscle undergo wasting at early stages and are the tissues transcriptionally most impacted by cachexia. We also identify general and organ-specific transcriptional changes that indicate functional derangement by cachexia even in tissues that do not undergo wasting, such as the brain. Secreted factors constitute a top category of cancer-regulated genes in host tissues, and these changes include upregulation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE inhibition with the drug lisinopril improves muscle force and partially impedes cachexia-induced transcriptional changes, although wasting is not prevented, suggesting that cancer-induced host-secreted factors can regulate tissue function during cachexia. Altogether, by defining prevalent and temporal and tissue-specific responses to cachexia, this resource highlights biomarkers and possible targets for general and tissue-tailored anti-cachexia therapies.
