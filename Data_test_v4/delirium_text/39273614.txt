39273614|t|A Computational Approach in the Systematic Search of the Interaction Partners of Alternatively Spliced TREM2 Isoforms.
39273614|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, characterized by the pathological accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is increasingly recognized as playing a central role in Abeta clearance and microglia activation in AD. The TREM2 gene transcriptional product is alternatively spliced to produce three different protein isoforms. The canonical TREM2 isoform binds to DAP12 to activate downstream pathways. However, little is known about the function or interaction partners of the alternative TREM2 isoforms. The present study utilized a computational approach in a systematic search for new interaction partners of the TREM2 isoforms by integrating several state-of-the-art structural bioinformatics tools from initial large-scale screening to one-on-one corroborative modeling and eventual all-atom visualization. CD9, a cell surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell adhesion and migration, was identified as a new interaction partner for two TREM2 isoforms, and CALM, a calcium-binding protein involved in calcium signaling, was identified as an interaction partner for a third TREM2 isoform, highlighting the potential role of cell adhesion and calcium regulation in AD.
