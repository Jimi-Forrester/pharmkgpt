38908094|a|Dysfunction in mitochondrial maintenance and trafficking is commonly correlated with the development of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Thus, biomedical research has been dedicated to understanding how architecturally complex neurons maintain and transport their mitochondria. However, the systems that coordinate mitochondrial QC (quality control) dynamics and trafficking in response to neuronal activity and stress are less understood. Additionally, the degree of integration between the processes of mitochondrial trafficking and QC is unclear. Recent work indicates that mitochondrial motility modulators (i.e., anchors and tethers) help coordinate mitochondrial health by mediating distinct, stress-level-appropriate QC pathways following mitochondrial damage. This review summarizes current evidence supporting the role of two mitochondrial motility modulators, Syntaphilin and Mitofusin 2, in coordinating mitochondrial QC to promote neuronal health. Exploring motility modulators' intricate regulatory molecular landscape may reveal new therapeutic targets for delaying disease progression and enhancing neuronal survival post-insult.
