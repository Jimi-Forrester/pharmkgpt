20544501|t|Size matters: a study on naming and size knowledge in dementia of the Alzheimer type.
20544501|a|Category-specificity was longitudinally studied over a period of 12 months in seven Alzheimer disease patients, with two semantic tasks differing with respect to verbal processing demands: picture naming and a size ordering task. Items from each task were matched on all cognitive and psycholinguistic variables known to differ across domains (living-nonliving). Naming performance of patients was poorer than that of normal controls. Regarding category-specific effects, while naming performance of patients was parallel to that of normal controls, patients' performance with the size ordering task revealed a different scaling of living things while that of nonliving things mirrored performance of normal controls. This suggests that caution is needed when the picture naming task is exclusively used to document category-specific effects.
