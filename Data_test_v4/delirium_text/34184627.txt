34184627|t|Case of refractory delirious mania responsive to lithium.
34184627|a|Delirious mania is an uncommon condition that is challenging to diagnose and treat. More often seen in patients with a history of bipolar disorder, it frequently presents with prominent catatonic features and overlaps with other diseases in the catatonic spectrum, such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome and malignant catatonia. We present a case of delirious mania refractory to high doses of lorazepam, several antipsychotics and valproic acid, which responded dramatically to therapy with lithium after 26 days of minimal improvement with the other medications. The pathophysiology of delirious mania is reviewed, and the unique actions of lithium are discussed, highlighting possible reasons as to why lithium might offer advantages in the treatment of this disease.
