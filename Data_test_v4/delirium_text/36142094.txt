36142094|a|Since the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous researchers have made an effort to determine the molecular composition of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the exact pathomechanism through which the virus exerts such a devastating effect on the host/infected organism. Recent scientific evidence highlights the affinity of the virus towards ACE2 receptors, which are widespread in multiple human systems, including the central nervous system (CNS) and cerebral vessels. Such an affinity may explain endothelial dysfunction and damage that is observed in COVID-positive patients in histopathological studies, with subsequent dysregulation of the cerebral circulation leading to transient or acute cerebrovascular accidents. In this paper, we aimed to evaluate the effects of COVID-related hypoxemia and direct viral invasion on the cerebral circulation, with special respect to the postulated pathomechanism, vulnerable groups of patients, clinical course and outcomes, as well as diagnostic imaging findings.
