2292979|t|Hepatic aging as an etiological factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease.
2292979|a|Alzheimer's disease is a frequent cause of dementia in the elderly. The prevalence and incidence increase with aging. It is hypothesised that the age related decline in liver size and lysosomal function results in decreased clearance as well as decreased or altered proteolysis of the Alzheimer precursor protein, and results in the deposition of A4 protein in cerebral blood vessels and brain with congophilic angiopathy and senile/amyloid plaque formation.
