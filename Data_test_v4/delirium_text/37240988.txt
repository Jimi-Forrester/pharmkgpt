37240988|t|Long-Term Evaluation of Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome Post-Cataract Extraction.
37240988|a|The study aimed to examine the effect of cataract extraction on ophthalmologists' ability to detect pseudoexfoliation (PXF) syndrome. A total of 31 patients admitted for elective cataract surgery were enrolled in this prospective comparative study. Prior to surgery, patients underwent slit-lamp examination and gonioscopy conducted by experienced glaucoma specialists. Subsequently, patients were re-examined by a different glaucoma specialist and comprehensive ophthalmologists. Pre-operatively, 12 patients were diagnosed with PXF on the basis of a Sampaolesi line (100%), anterior capsular deposits (83%), and pupillary ruff deposits (50%). The remaining 19 patients acted as controls. All patients were re-examined 10-46 months post-operatively. Of the 12 patients with PXF, 10 (83%) were correctly diagnosed post-operatively by glaucoma specialists and 8 (66%) by comprehensive ophthalmologists. There was no statistically significant difference in PXF diagnosis. However, detection of anterior capsular deposits (p = 0.02), Sampaolesi lines (p = 0.04), and pupillary ruff deposits (p = 0.01) were significantly lower post-operatively. Diagnosis of PXF is challenging in pseudophakic patients as the anterior capsule is removed during cataract extraction. Therefore, PXF diagnosis in pseudophakic patients relies mainly on the presence of deposits at other anatomical sites, and careful attention to these signs is required. Glaucoma specialists may be more likely than comprehensive ophthalmologists to detect PXF in pseudophakic patients.
