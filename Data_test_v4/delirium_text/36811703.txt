36811703|t|Preoperative medical assessment for adult spinal deformity surgery: a state-of-the-art review.
36811703|a|INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to provide a state-of-the-art review regarding risk factors for perioperative complications in adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery. The review includes levels of evidence for risk factors associated with complications in ASD surgery. METHODS: Using the PubMed database, we searched for complications, risk factors, and adult spinal deformity. The included publications were assessed for level of evidence as described in clinical practice guidelines published by the North American Spine Society, with summary statements generated for each risk factor (Bono et al. in Spine J 9:1046-1051, 2009). RESULTS: Frailty had good evidence (Grade A) as a risk for complications in ASD patients. Fair evidence (Grade B) was assigned for bone quality, smoking, hyperglycemia and diabetes, nutritional status, immunosuppression/steroid use, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, and renal disease. Indeterminate evidence (Grade I) was assigned for pre-operative cognitive function, mental health, social support, and opioid utilization. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of risk factors for perioperative complications in ASD surgery is a priority for empowering informed choices for patients and surgeons and managing patient expectations. Risk factors with grade A and B evidence should be identified prior to elective surgery and modified to reduce the risk of perioperative complications.
