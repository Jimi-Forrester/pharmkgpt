37161795|a|Brain aging is a naturally occurring process resulting in the decline of cognitive functions and increased vulnerability to develop age-associated disorders. Fluctuation in lipid species is crucial for normal brain development and function. However, impaired lipid metabolism and changes in lipid composition in the brain have been increasingly recognized to play a crucial role in physiological aging, as well as in several neurodegenerative diseases. In the last decades, the role of sexual dimorphism in the vulnerability to develop age-related neurodegeneration has increased. However, further studies are warranted for detailed assessment to how age, sex and additional non biological factors may influence the lipid changes in brains. The aim of this work is to address the presence of sex differences in the brain lipid changes that occur along aging, and in the two most common age-related neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease). We included the studies that assessed lipid-related alterations in the brain of both humans and experimental models. Additionally, we explored the influence of sex on lipid-lowering therapies. We conclude that sex exerts a notable effect on lipid modifications occurring with age and neurodegeneration, and in the lipid-reducing interventions. Therefore, the application of sex as experimental variable is strongly encouraged for future research in the field towards precision medicine approach.
