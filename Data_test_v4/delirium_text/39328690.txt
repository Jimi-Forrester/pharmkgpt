39328690|t|A Scoping Review of Factor-Related Cognitive Impairment in Interstitial Lung Disease.
39328690|a|Understanding the risk factors for cognitive impairment in interstitial lung disease (ILD) can help guide disease management tailored to cognitive function. However, no review articles or randomized controlled trial articles have been found for cognitive impairment in ILD. This scoping review aimed to systematically map studies on factor-related cognitive impairment in ILD and organize current knowledge. Literature on cognitive impairment in ILD was retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, and EBSCO and manually searched using Google. Three researchers screened the relevant literature. Six studies were extracted: four were case-control studies; one was a cross-sectional study; and one was a prospective cohort study. The extracted literature lacked studies with a high level of evidence and only reported factor-related cognitive impairment in ILD, not risk factors. Factors related to cognitive impairment were carbon monoxide pulmonary diffusing capacity, FEV1/FVC, hospitalization for lung transplantation, delirium during hospitalization, apnea-hypopnea index and Epworth sleepiness scale scores, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, abnormal pulmonary artery pressure, hypoxemia, post-exercise arterial blood oxygen partial pressure and heart rate, and six-minute walk test results. This scoping review presents the current knowledge on the risk factors for cognitive dysfunction in ILD. The extracted literature did not include reports on the risk factors for cognitive impairment in ILD and was limited to reports on related factors. Building evidence on this topic is desirable for understanding the risk factors for cognitive impairment in patients with ILD.
