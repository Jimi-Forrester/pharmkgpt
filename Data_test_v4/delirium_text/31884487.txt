31884487|t|The Prevalence of Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
31884487|a|Dementia is a severe neurodegenerative disorder and it can be categorized into several subtypes by different pathogenic causes. We sought to comprehensively analyzed the prevalence of dementia from perspectives of geographic region (Asia, Africa, South America, and Europe/North America), age, and gender. We searched PubMed and EMBASE for relevant articles on dementia published from January 1985 to August 2019. In these studies, analyses were stratified by geographic region, age, and gender. Meta-regression was conducted to identify if there were significant differences between groups. We included forty-seven studies. Among the individuals aged 50 and over in the community, the pooled prevalence for all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia were 697 (CI95%: 546-864) per 10,000 persons, 324 (CI95%: 228-460) per 10,000 persons, and 116 (CI95%: 86-157) per 10,000 persons, respectively. In our study, the prevalence of all-type dementia in individuals aged 100 years and older (6,592 per 10,000 cases) is 244 times higher than in those aged 50-59 (27 per 10,000 cases). The number of people living with dementia approximately doubles every five years. The prevalence was greater in women than in men (788 cases versus 561 cases per 10,000 persons) in overall analysis. In individuals aged 60 to 69 years, AD prevalence in females was 1.9 times greater than that in males (108 cases versus 56 cases per 10,000 persons), while the prevalence of VaD was 1.8 times greater in males than in females (56 cases versus 32 cases per 10,000 persons). Prevalence rate was higher in Europe and North America than in Asia, Africa, and South America.
