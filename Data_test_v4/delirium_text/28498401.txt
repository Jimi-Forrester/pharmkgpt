28498401|a|Luteolin [2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-4-chromenone] is an active flavonoid compound from Lonicera japonica (Caprifoliaceae). Luteolin inhibits tumor cell proliferation, inflammatory and oxidative stress better, when compared with other flavonoids. In the present study, it was demonstrated that luteolin induces typical apoptosis in PC12 cells (derived from a pheochromocytoma of the rat adrenal medulla) accompanied by DNA fragmentation and formation of apoptotic bodies. In addition, luteolin regulates expression of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone binding immunoglobulin protein, activating ER stress sensors (eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha phosphorylation and X-box binding protein 1 mRNA splicing) and induced autophagy. The results indicated that luteolin induces the upregulation of the unfolded protein response pathway through the ER stress sensors, which helps as an influential regulator for the apoptosis pathway in PC12 cells. The results suggested that the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying luteolin-induced apoptosis may be useful in cancer therapeutics, chemoprevention and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.
