38777413|a|Vitamin D has been proposed as a potential strategy to mitigate age-related cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer's dementia, the predominant type of dementia. Rodent studies have provided insight into the potential mechanisms underlying the role of vitamin D in Alzheimer's disease and dementia. However, inconsistencies with respect to age, sex, and genetic background of the rodent models used poses some limitations regarding scientific rigor and translation. Several human observational studies have evaluated the association of vitamin D status with cognitive decline and dementia, and the results are conflicting. Randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation have included cognitive outcomes. However, most of the available trials have not been designed specifically to test the effect of vitamin D on age-related cognitive decline and dementia, so it remains questionable how much additional vitamin D will improve cognitive performance. Here we evaluate the strengths and limitations of the available evidence regarding the role of vitamin D in AD, cognitive decline, dementia.
