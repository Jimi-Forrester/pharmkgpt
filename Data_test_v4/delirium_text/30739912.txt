30739912|a|BACKGROUND: Carcinogenesis occurs in elastin-rich tissues and leads to local inflammation and elastolytic proteinase release. This contributes to bioactive matrix fragment (Matrikine) accumulation like elastin degradation products (EDP) stimulating tumour cell invasive and metastatic properties. We previously demonstrate that EDPs exert protumoural activities through Hsp90 secretion to stabilised extracellular proteinases. METHODS: EDP influence on cancer cell blebbing and extracellular vesicle shedding were examined with a videomicroscope coupled with confocal Yokogawa spinning disk, by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. The ribosomal protein SA (RPSA) elastin receptor was identified after affinity chromatography by western blotting and cell immunolocalisation. mRNA expression was studied using real-time PCR. SiRNA were used to confirm the essential role of RPSA. RESULTS: We demonstrate that extracellular matrix degradation products like EDPs induce tumour amoeboid phenotype with cell membrane blebbing and shedding of extracellular vesicle containing Hsp90 and proteinases in the extracellular space. EDPs influence intracellular calcium influx and cytoskeleton reorganisation. Among matrikines, VGVAPG and AGVPGLGVG peptides reproduced EDP effects through RPSA binding. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that matrikines induce cancer cell blebbing and extracellular vesicle release through RPSA binding, favouring dissemination, cell-to-cell communication and growth of cancer cells in metastatic sites.
