36380021|t|Death by TNF: a road to inflammation.
36380021|a|Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a central cytokine in inflammatory reactions, and biologics that neutralize TNF are among the most successful drugs for the treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune pathologies. In recent years, it became clear that TNF drives inflammatory responses not only directly by inducing inflammatory gene expression but also indirectly by inducing cell death, instigating inflammatory immune reactions and disease development. Hence, inhibitors of cell death are being considered as a new therapy for TNF-dependent inflammatory diseases.
