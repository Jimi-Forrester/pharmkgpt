38622408|t|Targeting aging and age-related diseases with vaccines.
38622408|a|Aging is a major risk factor for numerous chronic diseases. Vaccination offers a promising strategy to combat these age-related diseases by targeting specific antigens and inducing immune responses. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in vaccine-based interventions targeting these diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, type II diabetes, hypertension, abdominal aortic aneurysm, atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, fibrosis and cancer, summarizing current approaches for identifying disease-associated antigens and inducing immune responses against these targets. Further, we reflect on the recent development of vaccines targeting senescent cells, as a strategy for more broadly targeting underlying causes of aging and associated pathologies. In addition to highlighting recent progress in these areas, we discuss important next steps to advance the therapeutic potential of these vaccines, including improving and robustly demonstrating efficacy in human clinical trials, as well as rigorously evaluating the safety and long-term effects of these vaccine strategies.
