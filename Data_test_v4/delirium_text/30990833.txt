30990833|a|BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and food-responsive diarrhea (FRD) are common chronic enteropathies in dogs, of which the exact pathogenesis has not been fully understood. In people dyslipidemia has been reported in patients with IBD, and potential therapeutic benefits of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the treatment of IBD have been investigated. Studies on the phospholipid profile in dogs with IBD and FRD are still lacking. AIM: To investigate the systemic phospholipid profile of dogs with IBD or FRD and to evaluate possible differences in phospholipids before and after treatment. METHODS: The phospholipids in whole blood and EDTA plasma of 32 dogs diagnosed with either IBD (n = 16) or FRD (n = 16) were analyzed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) prior to and after initiation of treatment, which included an elimination diet enriched with PUFAs. RESULTS: A clear separation of the phospholipids between whole blood and plasma was demonstrated on principal component analysis plots. In addition to the type of specimen, treatment and disease severity were the most significant factors determining the variance of the phospholipid profile. An increase in lysolipids was observed after treatment. The phosphatidylcholine (PC) species changed from PC 38:4 before treatment to mainly lysophosphatidylcholine 18:0 after treatment. Furthermore, several differences in the abundance of individual phospholipids were identified between dogs with IBD and dogs with FRD and between treatment statuses using random forest analysis. CONCLUSION: Significant variances were identified in the phospholipid profiles of dogs with IBD and FRD. These were particularly determined by type of specimen used, disease severity and treatment status. After treatment, a shift of phospholipid species towards lysophosphatidylcholine 18:0 was observed. Future studies should further investigate the role of lipids in the pathophysiology of IBD and FRD as well as their potential therapeutic benefits.
