37995919|a|Alterations in subcortical brain structure volumes have been found to be associated with several neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. At the same time, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous common variants associated with brain structure. In this study, we integrate these findings, aiming to identify proteins, metabolites, or microbes that have a putative causal association with subcortical brain structure volumes via a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach. This method uses genetic variants as instrument variables to identify potentially causal associations between an exposure and an outcome. The exposure data that we analyzed comprised genetic associations for 2,994 plasma proteins, 237 metabolites, and 103 microbial genera. The outcome data included GWAS data for seven subcortical brain structure volumes including accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen, and thalamus. Eleven proteins and six metabolites were found to have a significant association with subcortical structure volumes, with nine proteins and five metabolites replicated using independent exposure data. We found causal associations between accumbens volume and plasma protease c1 inhibitor as well as strong association between putamen volume and Agouti signalling protein. Among metabolites, urate had the strongest association with thalamic volume. No significant associations were detected between the microbial genera and subcortical brain structure volumes. We also observed significant enrichment for biological processes such as proteolysis, regulation of the endoplasmic reticulum apoptotic signaling pathway, and negative regulation of DNA binding. Our findings provide insights to the mechanisms through which brain volumes may be affected in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders and point to potential treatment targets for disorders that are associated with subcortical brain structure volumes.
