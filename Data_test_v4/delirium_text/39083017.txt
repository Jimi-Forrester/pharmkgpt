39083017|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that has become an important public health problem of global concern, and the early diagnosis and etiological treatment of AD are currently the focus of research. In the course of clinical treatment, approved clinical drugs mainly serve to slow down the disease process by relieving patients' clinical symptoms. However, these drugs do not target the cause of the disease, and the lack of specificity of these drugs has led to undesirable side effects in treatment. Meanwhile, AD is mainly diagnosed by clinical symptoms and imaging, which does not have the advantage of early diagnosis. Nanozymes have been extensively investigated for the diagnosis and treatment of AD with high stability and specificity. Therefore, this review summarizes the recent advances in various nanozymes for AD diagnosis and therapy, including with peroxidase-like-activity gold nanozymes, iron nanozymes, superoxide dismutase-like- and catalase-like-activity selenium dioxide nanozymes, platinum nanozymes, and peroxidase-like palladium nanozymes, among others. A comprehensive analysis was conducted on the diagnostic and therapeutic characteristics of nanozyme therapy for AD, as well as the prospects and challenges of its clinical application. Our goal is to advance this emerging topic by building on our own work and the new insights we have learned from others. This review will assist researchers to quickly understand relevant nanozymes' therapeutic and diagnostic information and further advance the field of nanozymes in AD.
