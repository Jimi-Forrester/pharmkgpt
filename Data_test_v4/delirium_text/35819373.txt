35819373|t|Parkinson's Disease and the Criminal Justice System.
35819373|a|Parkinson's disease is the world's second most common neurodegenerative disorder, and its incidence is growing. This editorial reviews the current state of knowledge about Parkinson's disease, its causes, its treatment and the symptomatology that is relevant to the administration of criminal justice. It identifies that, in conjunction with comorbidities, the disease can result in unfitness to stand trial, soundly based pleas of insanity/mental impairment and, in particular, can have a significant effect on the sentencing of offenders. It argues that with the ageing of the modern jail population, the incidence of Parkinson's disease provides a strong justification for the creation of alternative health care approaches that can provide suitable custodial services for those with conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and a variety of forms of dementia.
