39417134|t|NIAGADS: A Comprehensive National Data Repository for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia Genetics and Genomics Research.
39417134|a|NIAGADS is the National Institute on Aging (NIA) designated national data repository for human genetics research on Alzheimer's Disease and related dementia (ADRD). NIAGADS maintains a high-quality data collection for ADRD genetic/genomic research and supports genetics data production and analysis. NIAGADS hosts whole genome and exome sequence data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) and other genotype/phenotype data, encompassing 209,000 samples. NIAGADS shares these data with hundreds of research groups around the world via the Data Sharing Service, a FISMA moderate compliant cloud-based platform that fully supports the NIH Genome Data Sharing Policy. NIAGADS Open Access consists of multiple knowledge bases with genome-wide association summary statistics and rich annotations on the biological significance of genetic variants and genes across the human genome. NIAGADS stands as a keystone in promoting collaborations to advance the understanding and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
