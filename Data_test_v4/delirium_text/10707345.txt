10707345|a|Aluminum, a known neurotoxic substance, has been suggested as a possible contributing factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Ground-water pollution by aluminum has been recently reported. In the current study groups of 5 male BALB/c mice were administered aluminum ammonium sulfate in drinking water ad libitum at 0, 5, 25, and 125 mg/L aluminum for 4 weeks. At the termination of aluminum exposure, their brains were removed and dissected into cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, midbrain, corpus striatum, and hypothalamus. The concentration of norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), serotonin (5-HT), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), were determined in each brain area. DA, DOPAC, and HVA levels were lower in the hypothalamus of aluminum-treated mice, most notably in the low-dose group, as compared with control. No marked alterations in NE, 5-HT, and 5-HIAA levels were detected in any brain region. Changes in the concentration of DA and its metabolites measured in the hypothalamus suggest an inhibition of DA synthesis by aluminum.
