35185514|t|Tract Specific White Matter Lesion Load Affects White Matter Microstructure and Their Relationships With Functional Connectivity and Cognitive Decline.
35185514|a|White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are associated with cognitive decline. Assessing the effect of WMH on WM microstructural changes and its relationships with structural and functional connectivity to multiple cognitive domains are helpful to better understand the pathophysiological processes of cognitive impairment. 65 participants (49 normal and 16 MCI subjects, age: 67.4 +- 8.3 years, 44 females) were studied at 3T. The WMHs and fifty fiber tracts were automatically segmented from the T1/T2-weighted images and diffusion-weighted images, respectively. Tract-profiles of WMH were compared with those of apparent fiber density (AFD). The relationship between AFD and tract connectivity (TC) was assessed. Functional connectivity (FC) between tract ends obtained from resting-state functional MRI was examined in relation to TC. Tract-specific relationships of WMH, TC and FC with a multi-domain neuropsychological test battery and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were also separately assessed by lasso linear regression. Indirect pathways of TC and FC between WMH and multiple cognitive measures were tested using the mediation analysis. Higher WMH loads in WM tracts were locally matched with the reduced AFD, which was related to decrease in TC. However, no direct relationship was found between TC and FC. Tract-specific changes on WMH, TC and FC for each cognitive performance may explain that macro- and microstructural and functional changes are associated differently with each cognitive domain in a fiber specific manner. In these identified tracts, the differences between normal and MCI for WMH and TC were increased, and the relationships of WMH, TC and FC with cognitive outcomes were more significant, compared to the results from all tracts. Indirect pathways of two-step (TC-FC) between WMH and all cognitive domains were significant (p < 0.0083 with Bonferroni correction), while the separated indirect pathways through TC and through FC were different depending on cognitive domain. Deterioration in specific cognitive domains may be affected by alterations in a set of different tracts that are differently associated with macrostructural, microstructural, and function changes. Thus, assessments of WMH and its associated changes on specific tracts help for better understanding of the interrelationships of multiple changes in cognitive impairment.
