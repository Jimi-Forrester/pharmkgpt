39416814|t|Dual-channel fluorescent sensor for rapid Cu2+ and Fe3+ detection: Enhanced sensitivity and selectivity with triazole-substituted acridinedione derivative.
39416814|a|The AR-2 sensor, derived from a triazole-substituted acridinedione, exhibits distinct responses to Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions. It shows fluorescence enhancement in the presence of Cu2+ ions and a reduction in fluorescence with Fe3+ ions. This sensor is distinguished by its high sensitivity, selectivity, rapid response time, reversibility, and broad operating pH range, with shallow detection limits for both ions. Structural and photophysical analyses of AR-2 were conducted using density functional theory (DFT) and various spectroscopic techniques. The binding modes and recognition mechanisms for Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions were elucidated through multiple experimental approaches. Additionally, AR-2 demonstrated efficacy in the rapid, visual detection of these ions via paper test strips and swab tests. It successfully identified Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions in real water and food samples, achieving notable recovery rates. The AR-2 sensor also excelled in fluorescence imaging, effectively visualizing iron and copper pools in seed sprouts.
