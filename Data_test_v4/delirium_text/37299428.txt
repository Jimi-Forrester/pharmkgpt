37299428|a|The aim of this study was to investigate associations between serum magnesium levels with insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in older adults. A total of 938 older outpatients were included in the study. Hypomagnesemia was defined as serum magnesium concentration below <1.6 mg/dL. Patients were divided into two groups: hypomagnesemia and normomagnesia (1.6-2.6 mg/dL). The Epworth Sleepiness Scale was implemented and scores of >=11 points were categorized as EDS. The Insomnia Severity Index was implemented and scores of >=8 indicated insomnia. The mean age was 81.1 +- 7.6 years. While the presence of EDS, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease were more common in the hypomagnesemia group than the normomagnesia group, Parkinson's disease was less common (p < 0.05). Hemoglobin and HDL cholesterol were lower, whereas HbA1c, triglyceride, and number of drugs used were higher in the hypomagnesemia group compared to the normomagnesia group (p < 0.05). In both univariate analysis and multivariate analysis adjusted for gender, age and all confounders, there were significant associations between hypomagnesemia and EDS [odds ratio (OR):1.7; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6-2.6, and OR: 1.9; 95%CI: 1.2-3.3, respectively (p < 0.05)]. There was no significant relationship between hypomagnesemia and insomnia (p > 0.05). The present study identified an association between hypomagnesemia and EDS in older adults. Therefore, it may be prudent to consider hypomagnesemia when evaluating older adults with EDS and vice versa.
