30997915|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, strongly related with age. It has been reported that genetic variants of the Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells-2 (TREM2), a cell-surface receptor expressed in microglial cells, greatly increase the risk of AD, thus suggesting an involvement of the microglia in the AD pathogenesis. The aim of this report is to provide an overview of the TREM2 and of its possible implication in the pathogenesis of AD.
