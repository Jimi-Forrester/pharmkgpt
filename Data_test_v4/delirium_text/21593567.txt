21593567|t|TNF and leptin tell essentially the same story in Alzheimer's disease.
21593567|a|Both tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and leptin are, independently, under investigation as the central mechanism for Alzheimer's disease. The wider literature provides every indication that both mediators are part of the same pathways thought to cause functional loss in this condition. This association, which has not been specifically addressed in the Alzheimer's disease literature, may be a useful link to expedite future study into the pathogenesis of this condition.
