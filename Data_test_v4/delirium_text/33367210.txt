33367210|t|Biomarker-Concordant Steroid Use in Critically Ill Patients with Pneumonia.
33367210|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the frequency and consequences of prescribing corticosteroids for pneumonia in a biomarker-concordant manner. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study of adults with pneumonia admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, between January 1, 2009, and June 30, 2014. Steroid use was "biomarker concordant" if given when C-reactive protein (CRP) was >=150 mg/L or withheld when CRP was <150 mg/L, and vice versa for biomarker discordant. RESULTS: Of 3481 ICU admissions with community-acquired pneumonia, 169 (4.9%) had CRPs measured within 48 hours of admission to the ICU. Steroid use in the ICU was biomarker concordant in 88 (52%) patients and biomarker discordant in 81 (48%) patients. Biomarker-concordant steroid use was associated with faster resolution of lung injury: median fraction of inspired oxygen on day 3 (0.4 [0.3, 0.5] vs 0.3 [0.21, 0.4], P=.005), day 4 (0.35 [0.3, 0.5] vs 0.28 [0.21, 0.38], P=<.001), and day 5 (0.30 [0.24, 0.45] vs 0.28 [0.21, 0.40], P=.03), and increased ICU (3.5; 95% CI, 0.5 to 6.4, P=.02), and hospital-free days (3.6; 95% CI, 0.4 to 6.8, P=.03) on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with community-acquired pneumonia, steroid use is rarely biomarker informed and often discordant with inflammatory biomarker levels. Biomarker-concordant steroid use was associated with a faster recovery of hypoxemia and increased ICU- and hospital-free days. Future well-designed prospective studies are justified to test the potential value of biomarker-concordant steroid therapy.
