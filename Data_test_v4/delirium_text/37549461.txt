This study explores the potential of Radix Stellariae, a traditional Chinese medicine, in treating AD. Utilizing transgenic C. elegans models of AD, we demonstrated that a 75% ethanol extract of Radix Stellariae (RSE) (at 50 microg/mL) effectively diminishes Abeta and Tau protein expression, and alleviates their induced impairments including paralysis, behavioral dysfunction, neurotoxicity, and ROS accumulation. Additionally, RSE enhances the stress resistance of C. elegans. Further investigations revealed that RSE promotes autophagy, a critical cellular process for protein degradation, in these models. We found that inhibiting autophagy-related genes negated the neuroprotective effects of RSE, suggesting a central role for autophagy in the actions of RSE. In PC-12 cells, we observed that RSE not only inhibited Abeta fibril formation but also promoted the degradation of AD-related proteins and reduced their cytotoxicity. Mechanistically, RSE was found to induce autophagy via modulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR and AMPK/mTOR signaling pathways. Importantly, inhibiting autophagy counteracted the beneficial effects of RSE on the clearance of AD-associated proteins. Moreover, we identified Dichotomine B, a beta-carboline alkaloid, as a key active constituent of RSE in mitigating AD pathology in C. elegans at concentrations ranging from 50 to 1000 microM. Collectively, our study presents novel discoveries that RSE alleviates AD pathology and toxicity primarily by inducing autophagy, both in vivo and in vitro. These findings open up new avenues for exploring the therapeutic potential of RSE and its active component, Dichotomine B, in treating neurodegenerative diseases like AD.
