24977125|t|Plasma brain-type natriuretic Peptide level following seizure and syncope: pilot study.
24977125|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To explore the clinical feasibility of plasma brain-type natriuretic peptide (proBNP) level to differentiate the two major causes of transient unconsciousness, seizure and vasovagal syncope (VVS) in adult patients. METHODS: ProBNP levels were evaluated within 24 hours following attack in patients who had experienced a transient episode of unconsciousness. For confirmatory diagnosis, clinical history was reviewed thoroughly and several work-ups including electroencephalography and cerebral imaging and tilt-table test, were performed in cases of putative VVS, as a part of routine clinical approaches. RESULTS: According to various relevant evaluations, 15 patients were diagnosed as seizure (age, 40.3+-13.8 years) and 12 patients were VVS (age, 38.1+-17.1 years). Plasma concentrations of pro-BNP were not different between two groups (p=0.714). Median level was 34.3 pg/mL (interquartile range: 12.9-91.1) in post-seizure group and 32.3 pg/mL (interquartile range 8.9-77.4) in post-VVS group. Additionally, it was not correlated with the sampling times within 24 hours after the episodes. CONCLUSIONS: The plasma level of pro-BNP has a limited clinical value in differentiating seizure and vasovagal syncope in adults. However, the more validated results with a large population should be sought in the future studies to confirm its value.
