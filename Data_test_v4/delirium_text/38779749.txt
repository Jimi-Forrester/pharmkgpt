38779749|a|BACKGROUND: Neurocognitive and psychiatric disorders have been proved that they can comorbid more often with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) than general population. However, the potential causal association between these disorders and iNPH has not been assessed. Thus, our study aims to investigate the causal relationship between them based on a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. METHODS: Random effects of the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method were conducted to obtain the causal association among the neurocognitive disorders, psychiatric disorders, and iNPH. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 12 neurocognitive and psychiatric disorders were downloaded via the OpenGWAS database, GWAS Catalog, and Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, whereas GWAS data of iNPH were obtained from the FinnGen consortium round 9 release, with 767 cases and 375,610 controls of European ancestry. We also conducted the sensitivity analysis in these significant causal inferences using weighted median model, Cochrane's Q test, MR-Egger regression, MR Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier detect and the leave-one-out analysis. RESULTS: For most of the neurocognitive and psychiatric disorders, no causal association was established between them and iNPH. We have found that iNPH (odds ratio [OR] = 1.030, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.011-1.048, p = .001) is associated with increased risk for schizophrenia, which failed in validation of sensitivity analysis. Notably, genetically predicted Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with increased risk of iNPH (OR = 1.256, 95% CI: 1.045-1.511, p = .015). CONCLUSION: Our study has revealed the potential causal effect in which PD associated with an increased risk of iNPH. Further study is warranted to investigate the association between PD and iNPH and the potential underlying mechanism.
