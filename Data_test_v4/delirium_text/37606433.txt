37606433|a|(1) Background: In this narrative review, we focus on neural autoantibodies in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a consequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 infection and persisting symptoms of post-COVID-19 syndrome with a psychiatric presentation. (2) Methods: Our methods include using the PubMed database to search for appropriate articles. (3) Results: We first describe the phenomenon of the psychiatric manifestation of COVID-19 in acute and persistent forms, associated with neural autoantibodies, often attributable to encephalopathy or encephalitis. We discuss the spectrum of neural autoantibodies in neuropsychiatric patients affected by COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 syndrome. Evidence from our research suggests that it is highly likely that neural autoantibody production is facilitated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that more neuropsychiatric patients than control subjects will present neural autoantibodies. (4) Conclusions: These observations support the hypothesis that acute and persisting forms of COVID-19 promote autoimmune diseases. Our patients therefore require comprehensive evaluation to avoid overlooking such autoantibody-associated psychiatric disorders associated with COVID-19.
