30700336|a|OBJECTIVE: Delirium is a frequent and severe complication of serious pediatric illness. Development of a nonpharmacologic approach to prevent pediatric delirium may improve short- and long-term outcomes in children and their families. In this brief report, we describe the development of a quality improvement project designed to methodically promote the family member's engagement, comforting, and orienting activities with their critically ill child to decrease delirium rates. METHOD: We created a developmentally specific Delirium Prevention Toolkit for families. In a feasibility pilot, March through June 2016, we offered the kit to 15 patients and their families. On discharge, families were asked to describe use of the toolkit and whether or not it was helpful for them. RESULTS: Twelve of 15 patients and families used various elements of the toolkit, particularly the headphones, music, and games; no one regularly used the blank journal. All reported that it was easy and helpful to have as support for their stay in the pediatric intensive care unit.Significance of resultsThis pilot demonstrated practicality of a nonpharmacologic delirium prevention toolkit in the pediatric intensive care unit, and satisfaction from patients and families.
