24360393|a|PURPOSE: It is assumed that there is a relation between light exposure and delirium incidence. The aim of our study was to determine the effect of prehospital light exposure on the incidence of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired delirium. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 3 ICUs in the Netherlands were analyzed retrospectively. Delirium was assessed with the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU. Daily light intensity data were obtained from meteorological stations in the vicinity of the 3 hospitals. The association between light intensity and delirium incidence was analyzed using logistic regression analysis adjusting for known covariates for delirium. RESULTS: Data of 3198 patients, aged (mean +- SD) 61.9 +- 15.3 years with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score 16.4 +- 6.6 were analyzed. Delirium incidence was 31.2% and did not vary significantly throughout the year. Twenty-eight-day preadmission photoperiod was highest in spring and lowest in winter; however, no association between light exposure and delirium incidence was found (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.99-1.00; P = 0.72). Furthermore, delirium was significantly associated with age, infection, use of sedatives, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, and diagnosis of neurological disease or trauma. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of delirium does not differ per season and prior sunlight exposure does not play a role of importance in the development of ICU-acquired delirium.
