35370651|t|Medication Use and Costs Among Older Adults Aged 90 Years and Older in Italy.
35370651|a|Older adults are often affected by multiple chronic conditions and experience geriatric syndromes that may affect the risk/benefit profile of medications. Little is known about the use of such medications in the older population. This article describes medication use and costs in Italian adults aged >=90 years. Data from the 2019 Pharmaceutical Prescriptions database, concerning data on medications reimbursed by the Italian National Health Service, were analyzed in terms of prevalence and amount of use expressed as defined daily dose/1,000 users (DDD/1,000 users/day), accounting for different age-groups and sex. All individuals aged >=90 years used at least one medication, with a mean number of 3128 DDD/1,000 users/day corresponding to an annual cost of 683 euros per user. Both use and costs linearly decreased with increasing age, with men accounting for a higher amount of DDD/1,000 users and costs than women across all age-groups. Antihypertensives (1330 DDD/1,000 inhabitants), antiplatelet agents (337 DDD/1,000 inhabitants), medications for peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux (328 DDD/1,000 inhabitants), and lipid-lowering agents (166 DDD/1,000 inhabitants) were the most frequently used medications. We observed a progressive decrease in the usage of the majority of medications with increasing age, with the exception of antibiotics and antipsychotics. Individuals aged >=90 years used a lower DDD/1,000 users, with an associated decrease in annual costs. The persistent use of preventive medications highlights the potential lack of awareness regarding medication rationalization and guidance for optimizing prescriptions. Our findings highlight the need for further initiatives to improve medications' appropriateness in these older age-groups.
