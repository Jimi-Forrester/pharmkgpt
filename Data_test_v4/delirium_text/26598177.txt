26598177|t|Perioperative Cognitive Protection-Cognitive Exercise and Cognitive Reserve (The Neurobics Trial): A Single-blind Randomized Trial.
26598177|a|PURPOSE: The Neurobics Trial is a single-blind, parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial. The main study objective is to compare effectiveness of preoperative cognitive exercise versus no intervention for lowering the incidence of postoperative delirium. Enrollment began March 2015 and is ongoing. METHODS: Eligible participants include patients older than 60 years of age scheduled for nonemergent, noncardiac, nonneurological surgery at our institution. Patients provide consent and are screened at our Outpatient Preoperative Assessment Clinic to rule out preexisting cognitive dysfunction, significant mental health disorders, and history of surgery requiring general anesthesia in the preceding 6 months. Participants meeting criteria are randomized to complete 1 hour daily of electronic tablet-based cognitive exercise for 10 days before surgery or no preoperative intervention. Compliance with the effective dose of 10 total hours of preoperative exercise is verified on return of the patient for surgery with time logs created by the software application and by patient self-reporting. After surgery, patients are evaluated for delirium in the postanesthesia recovery area, and then twice daily for the remainder of their hospitalization. Additionally, postoperative quality of recovery is assessed daily, along with pain scores and opiate use. More comprehensive cognitive assessments are completed just before discharge for baseline comparison, and quality of recovery is assessed via telephone interview 7, 30, and 90 days post-surgery. The primary outcome is the incidence of delirium during the postoperative hospitalization period. Randomization is computer generated, with allocation concealment in opaque envelopes. All postoperative assessments are completed by blinded study personnel. FINDINGS: The study is actively recruiting with 19 patients having provided consent to date, and a total of 264 patients is required for study completion; therefore, no data analysis is currently under way (www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT02230605). IMPLICATIONS: To our knowledge, the Neurobics Trial is the first randomized, controlled study to investigate the effectiveness of a significant preoperative cognitive exercise regimen for the prevention of delirium after noncardiac, nonneurological surgery in elderly patients.
