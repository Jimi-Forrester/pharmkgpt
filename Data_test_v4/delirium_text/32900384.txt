32900384|t|Risk of Parkinson's disease following gout: a population-based retrospective cohort study in Taiwan.
32900384|a|BACKGROUND: The progressive neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson disease (PD) is well-established as the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Associations between the sequential risk of PD and gout have been addressed in other studies, but findings have been inconclusive. Accordingly, we executed the present study with the purpose of assessing PD risk in patients with gout. METHODS: From Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified the data of patients newly diagnosed as having gout between January 1, 2000 and December 1, 2000. A cohort of patients without gout, matched for sex and age, was constructed for comparison. Hazard ratios (HRs) and the incidence rate of subsequent PD were calculated for both cohorts and separately for male and female groups. The gout and comparison cohorts consisted of 7900 patients each. RESULTS: The HR for PD was not significantly higher in the gout cohort compared with the control cohort (HR 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93-1.31, P = .268), even after adjustment for age, urbanization, monthly income, sex, and comorbidities. We did not observe gender differences in the gout-PD association (male: HR 1.01, 95% CI, 0.88-1.36, P = .400; female: HR 1.11, 95% CI, 0.84-1.46, P = .466). CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified that there was no protective effect of gout for the risk of PD in the Taiwanese population.
