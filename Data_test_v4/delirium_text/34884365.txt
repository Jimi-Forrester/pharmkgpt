34884365|t|Comparison of Outcomes between Minimally Invasive Lateral Approach Vertebral Reconstruction Using a Rectangular Footplate Cage and Conventional Procedure Using a Cylindrical Footplate Cage for Osteoporotic Vertebral Fracture.
34884365|a|The aim of the current study was to compare outcomes between lateral access vertebral reconstruction (LAVR) using a rectangular footplate cage and the conventional procedure using a cylindrical footplate cage in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OVF). We included 46 patients who underwent anterior-posterior combined surgery for OVF: 24 patients underwent LAVR (Group L) and 22 underwent the conventional procedure (Group C). Preoperative, postoperative, and 1- and 2-year follow-up X-ray images were used to measure local lordotic angle, correction loss, and cage subsidence (>2 mm in vertebral endplate depression). In anterior surgery, the operation time was significantly shorter (183 vs. 248 min, p < 0.001) and the blood loss was significantly less (148 vs. 406 mL, p = 0.01) in Group L than in Group C. In Group C, two patients had anterior instrumentation failure. Correction loss was significantly smaller in Group L than in Group C (1.9  vs. 4.9  at 1 year, p = 0.02; 2.5  vs. 6.5  at 2 years, p = 0.04, respectively). Cage subsidence was significantly less in Group L than in Group C (29% vs. 80%, p < 0.001). LAVR using a rectangular footplate cage is an effective treatment for OVF to minimize surgical invasiveness and postoperative correction loss.
