35135793|a|Kawasaki-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome related to SARS-CoV-2 infection is a well-described condition in children and adolescents (MIS-C) and now also in adults (MIS-A). We report a case of MIS-A in a previously well woman in her mid-30s who presented with vasopressor-dependent shock 2 weeks after initial recovery from suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, accompanied by fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, weakness, arthralgia, rash, cough and headache. Examination was notable for fever, tachycardia, hypotension, cervical lymphadenopathy, mucocutaneous involvement, neck stiffness, pansystolic murmur and bilateral crepitations. Inflammatory markers were elevated. Echocardiogram showed mitral regurgitation with preserved ejection fraction. She was treated with vasopressors, admitted to the intensive care unit and subsequently required invasive mechanical ventilation. Both PCR and antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 were positive. Treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin was initiated with rapid improvement in clinical condition and inflammatory markers. She has since made a full recovery with normal echocardiogram 8 months later.
