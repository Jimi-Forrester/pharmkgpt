36986742|a|We have already formulated solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) in which the combination of the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) and the antioxidant grape-seed-derived proanthocyanidins (grape seed extract, GSE) was supposed to be favorable for Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment. In fact, GSE supply would reduce the PD-related oxidative stress in a synergic effect with DA. Herein, two different methods of DA/GSE loading were studied, namely, coadministration in the aqueous phase of DA and GSE, and the other approach consisting of a physical adsorption of GSE onto preformed DA containing SLNs. Mean diameter of DA coencapsulating GSE SLNs was 187 +- 4 nm vs. 287 +- 15 nm of GSE adsorbing DA-SLNs. TEM microphotographs evidenced low-contrast spheroidal particles, irrespective of the SLN type. Moreover, Franz diffusion cell experiments confirmed the permeation of DA from both SLNs through the porcine nasal mucosa. Furthermore, fluorescent SLNs also underwent cell-uptake studies by using flow cytometry in olfactory ensheathing cells and neuronal SH-SY5Y cells, evidencing higher uptake when GSE was coencapsulated rather than adsorbed onto the particles.
