36837403|a|The frail, elderly population is often characterized by poor immunogenicity post COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. "Inflame-ageing" and "immune-senescence" are pathogenetic mechanisms that might explain this phenomenon. Complex interplay with cytokines and microbiota is also implicated in this inflammatory cascade. The abovementioned population, although very important from immunologic perspective, has barely been included in the mRNA vaccination clinical trials.
