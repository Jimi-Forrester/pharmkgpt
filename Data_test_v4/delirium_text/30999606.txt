30999606|t|Lipophilicity as a Central Component of Drug-Like Properties of Chalchones and Flavonoid Derivatives.
30999606|a|Lipophilcity is an important physico-chemical parameter that influences membrane transport and binding ability to action. Migration distance following complete elution of compounds was used to calculate different lipophilicity-related parameters. The aim of this study is to show that lipophilicity is a central component of thiazole chalcones and flavonoid derivatives regarding their drug-like properties. Experimental and computational methods were used. This study considers 44 previously synthesized compounds (thiazole chalcones, flavanones, flavones, 3-hydroxyflavones, and their acetylated derivatives). The concerned compounds have shown antitumoral hallmarks and antibacterial activity in vitro. The experimental method used to determine compounds' lipophilicity was the reverse-phase thin layer chromatography (RP-TLC). Lipophilicity related parameters-isocratic retention factor (RM), relative lipophily (RM0), slope (b), chromatographic hydrophobic index (phi0), scores of principal components (PC1/RM)-were determined based on reverse-phase chromatography results.
