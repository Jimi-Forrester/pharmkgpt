35213372|t|Associations Between Brainstem Volume and Alzheimer's Disease Pathology in Middle-Aged Individuals of the Framingham Heart Study.
35213372|a|The brainstem is among the first regions to accumulate Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related hyperphosphorylated tau pathology during aging. We aimed to examine associations between brainstem volume and neocortical amyloid-beta or tau pathology in 271 middle-aged clinically normal individuals of the Framingham Heart Study who underwent MRI and PET imaging. Lower volume of the medulla, pons, or midbrain was associated with greater neocortical amyloid burden. No associations were detected between brainstem volumes and tau deposition. Our results support the hypothesis that lower brainstem volumes are associated with initial AD-related processes and may signal preclinical AD pathology.
