METHODS: Specific pathogen-free (SPF) male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with SAD were randomly divided into six groups: sham-operated, model (intracerebroventricular injection of Streptozotocin, ICV-STZ), donepezil (0.92 mg/kg), XXD low-dose (7.61 g/kg(-1) x d(-1)), moderate-dose (15.21 g/kg(-1) x d(-1)), and high-dose (30.42 g/kg(-1) x d(-1)). Immunohistochemistry and western immunoblotting were used to detect the phosphorylation at Thr231 and Ser422 sites of tau protein. RESULTS: XXD different dose groups decreased to varying degrees the expression of phosphorylated tau at P-Thr231 and P-Ser422 sites in the hippocampus of SAD rats. No significant difference was found between the donepezil and model group. CONCLUSION: XXD may prevent SAD pathological progress by inhibiting hyperphosphorylation at the key sites of tau proteins.
