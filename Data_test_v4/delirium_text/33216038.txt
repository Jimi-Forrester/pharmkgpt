33216038|t|Association Between APOE Alleles and Change of Neuropsychological Tests in the Long Life Family Study.
33216038|a|BACKGROUND: The Long Life Family Study (LLFS) is a family based, prospective study of healthy aging and familial longevity. The study includes two assessments of cognitive function that were administered approximately 8 years apart. OBJECTIVE: To test whether APOE genotype is associated with change of cognitive function in older adults. METHODS: We used Bayesian hierarchical models to test the association between APOE alleles and change of cognitive function. Six longitudinally collected neuropsychological test scores were modelled as a function of age at enrollment, follow-up time, gender, education, field center, birth cohort indicator (<=1935, or >1935), and the number of copies of e2 or e4 alleles. RESULTS: Out of 4,587 eligible participants, 2,064 were male (45.0%), and age at enrollment ranged from 25 to 110 years, with mean of 70.85 years (SD: 15.75). We detected a significant cross-sectional effect of the APOEe4 allele on Logical Memory. Participants carrying at least one copy of the e4 allele had lower scores in both immediate (-0.31 points, 95% CI: -0.57, -0.05) and delayed (-0.37 points, 95% CI: -0.64, -0.10) recall comparing to non-e4 allele carriers. We did not detect any significant longitudinal effect of the e4 allele. There was no cross-sectional or longitudinal effect of the e2 allele. CONCLUSION: The APOEe4 allele was identified as a risk factor for poorer episodic memory in older adults, while the APOEe2 allele was not significantly associated with any of the cognitive test scores.
