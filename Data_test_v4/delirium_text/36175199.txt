36175199|a|Analyzing data from a large, nationally distributed group of Japanese hospitals, we found a dramatic decline in both inpatient and outpatient volumes over the three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan from February to December 2020. We identified three key reasons for this fall in patient demand. First, COVID-19-related hygiene measures and behavioral changes significantly reduced non-COVID-19 infectious diseases. Second, consultations relating to chronic diseases fell sharply. Third, certain medical investigations and interventions were postponed or cancelled. Despite the drop in hospital attendances and admissions, COVID-19 is said to have brought the Japanese health care system to the brink of collapse. In this context, we explore longstanding systematic issues, finding that Japan's abundant supply of beds and current payment system may have introduced a perverse incentive to overprovide services, creating a mismatch between patient needs and supply of health care resources. Poor coordination among medical providers and the highly decentralized governance of the health care system have also contributed to the crisis. In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Japanese health care system beyond COVID-19, it is essential to promote specialization and differentiation of medical functions among hospitals, to strengthen governance, and to introduce appropriate payment reform.
