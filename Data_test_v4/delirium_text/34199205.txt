34199205|t|Detection of Prions in Brain Homogenates and CSF Samples Using a Second-Generation RT-QuIC Assay: A Useful Tool for Retrospective Analysis of Archived Samples.
34199205|a|The possibilities for diagnosing prion diseases have shifted significantly over the last 10 years. The RT-QuIC assay option has been added for neuropsychiatric symptoms, supporting biomarkers and final post-mortem confirmation. Samples of brain homogenates used for final diagnosis, archived for many years, provide the possibility for retrospective studies. We used a second-generation RT-QuIC assay to detect seeding activity in different types of sporadic and genetic prion diseases in archival brain homogenates and post-mortem CSF samples that were 2 to 15 years old. Together, we tested 92 archival brain homogenates: 39 with definite prion disease, 28 with definite other neurological disease, and 25 with no signs of neurological disorders. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 97.4% and 100%, respectively. Differences were observed in gCJD E200K, compared to the sporadic CJD group. In 52 post-mortem CSF samples-24 with definite prion disease and 28 controls-we detected the inhibition of seeding reaction due to high protein content. Diluting the samples eliminated such inhibition and led to 95.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity of the assay. In conclusion, we proved the reliability of archived brain homogenates and post-mortem CSF samples for retrospective analysis by RT-QuIC after long-term storage, without changed reactivity.
