18976481|t|An unusual presentation of an unusual disease: infective endocarditis: a case report and review of the literature.
18976481|a| It is normal to have patients to present with agitation to the emergency department. The history could be suggestive of the diagnosis in most. When an apparently healthy young man comes to the hospital agitated, without any history of fever or trauma, it is not an easy one to diagnose. This is a case report of a 35 year old gentleman who presented with such a history and the final diagnosis turned out to be a usual disease. Hence any patient presenting with neurological manifestations as agitation, one should consider cardiac causes such as Infective Endocarditis if no other obvious cause is found initially.
