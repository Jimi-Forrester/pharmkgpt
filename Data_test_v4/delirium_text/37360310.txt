37360310|t|Research Progress of Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome.
37360310|a|Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a new infectious disease first discovered in Ta-pieh Mountains in central China in 2009. It is caused by a novel bunyavirus infection (SFTSV). Since the first discovery of SFTSV, there have been case reports and epidemiological studies on SFTS in several East Asian countries, such as South Korea, Japan, Vietnam and so on. With the rising incidence of SFTS and the rapid spread of the novel bunyavirus around the world, it is clear that the virus has a pandemic potential and may pose a threat to global public health in the future. Early studies have suggested that ticks are an important medium for the transmission of SFTSV to humans; in recent years, it has been reported that there is also human-to-human transmission. In endemic areas, potential hosts include a variety of livestock and wildlife. When people are infected with SFTV, the main clinical manifestations are high fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, gastrointestinal symptoms, liver and kidney function damage, and even MODS, with a mortality rate of about 10-30%. This article reviews the latest progress of novel bunyavirus, including virus transmission vector, virus genotypic diversity and epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestation and treatment.
