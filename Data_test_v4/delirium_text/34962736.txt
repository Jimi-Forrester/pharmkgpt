34962736|a|Introduction: The term "Post-intensive care syndrome" describe new impairments after critical illness, that worsen physical, cognitive, or mental health, and persist after acute care hospitalization. Methods: a bibliographic search was carried out using the Medline database. The search period was from 2012 to 2020 using keywords. Results: Emerging evidence suggests that there are significant and persistent physical, cognitive, and psychiatric morbidities among adult and pediatric survivors of critical illness. In this population it can also affect the "social health" sphere. The families of hospitalized patients often manifest psychological symptoms. For prevention and management there are various tools, the package of measures "ABCDEFGH", the conformation and organization of the health team, early mobilization and physical rehabilitation, nutritional contribution, environmental management, intensive care unit diaries and support between pairs. Conclusion: Each patient s situation is unique and the challenges they face may require different interventions. These should be studied to increase the available evidence in the pediatric population. We still do not have a specific instrument to monitor the syndrome in pediatrics or information on long-term sequelae in children.
