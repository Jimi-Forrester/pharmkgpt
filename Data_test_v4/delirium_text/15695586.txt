15695586|a|The recently developed ultrasensitive bio-barcode assay was used to measure the concentration of amyloid-beta-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), a potential soluble pathogenic Alzheimer's disease (AD) marker, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 30 individuals. ADDL concentrations for the subjects diagnosed with AD were consistently higher than the levels in the CSF taken from nondemented age-matched controls. Studies of ADDLs or for any other potential pathogenic AD markers in CSF have not been possible because of their low concentration in CSF (<1 pM). This study is a step toward a diagnostic tool, based on soluble pathogenic markers for the debilitating disease.
