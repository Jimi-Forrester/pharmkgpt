28879300|t|Current trends in intravenous sedative drugs for dental procedures.
28879300|a|Anxiety and phobia in dental procedures are common deterrents for patients visiting the dental care unit. For these individuals, procedural sedation may aid in completion of dental treatments. In most cases, the patients are conscious during sedation, thereby allowing spontaneous ventilation. Intravenous sedation (IVS) is widely used during dental treatment to relieve patient anxiety. IVS is the most effective route of administration to achieve this goal, but it requires advanced training, more than that provided during undergraduate education. During IVS, rapid onset, repetitive drug administration, easy titration, and rapid recovery from sedation can be achieved. However, conscious sedation during IVS can result in deep sedation that can cause respiratory and cardiovascular depression. Therefore, the characteristics of intravenous sedatives should be known. The purpose of this review is to discuss the characteristics and usage of intravenous sedatives currently used for dental procedures.
