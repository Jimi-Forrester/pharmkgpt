26209856|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common complication after cardiac surgery and may be as a result of inadequate cerebral perfusion. We studied delirium after cardiac surgery in relation to intraoperative hypotension (IOH). METHODS: This observational single-centre, cohort study was nested in a randomized trial, on a single intraoperative dose of dexamethasone vs placebo during cardiac surgery. During the first four postoperative days, patients were screened for delirium based on the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) for Intensive Care Unit on the intensive care unit, CAM on the ward, and by inspection of medical records. To combine depth and duration of IOH, we computed the area under the curve for four blood pressure thresholds. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between IOH and the occurrence of postoperative delirium, adjusting for confounding and using a 99% confidence interval to correct for multiple testing. RESULTS: Of the 734 included patients, 99 patients (13%) developed postoperative delirium. The adjusted Odds Ratio for the Mean Arterial Pressure <60 mm Hg threshold was 1.04 (99% confidence interval: 0.99-1.10) for each 1000 mm Hg(2) min(2) AUC(2) increase. IOH, as defined according to the other three definitions, was not associated with postoperative delirium either. Deep and prolonged IOH seemed to increase the risk of delirium, but this was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Independent of the applied definition, IOH was not associated with the occurrence of delirium after cardiac surgery.
