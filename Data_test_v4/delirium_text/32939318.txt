32939318|a|OBJECTIVE: Treatment of dyslipidemia lowers cardiovascular (CV) risk. Although statin use is a cornerstone therapy, many patients are not achieving their risk-specific low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals. The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies have been extensively studied as lipid-lowering therapy (LLT). Herein, we present an updated evidence-based review of the efficacy and safety of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of familial and non-familial hypercholesterolemia. METHODS: PubMed database was searched to review Phase III studies on PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies. Then, the US National Institutes of Health Registry and the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform were searched to identify and present the ongoing research. RESULTS: PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies were investigated for the treatment of dyslipidemia, as a single therapeutic agent or as an add-on therapy to the traditional LLT. They proved effective and safe in the treatment of familial and non-familial hypercholesterolemia, and in the prevention of adverse CV events. CONCLUSIONS: The use of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of dyslipidemia is currently recommended to achieve risk-specific LDL-C goal to reduce adverse CV events. Future results of the ongoing research might expand their clinical generalizability to broader patient populations.
