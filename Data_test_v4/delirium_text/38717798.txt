38717798|a|BACKGROUND: Apathy, depression, and anxiety are prevalent neuropsychiatric symptoms experienced by older adults. Early detection, prevention, and intervention may improve outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We aim to demonstrate the feasibility of deploying web-based weekly questionnaires inquiring about the behavioral symptoms of older adults with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, or early-stage dementia and to demonstrate the feasibility of deploying an in-home technology platform for measuring participant behaviors and their environment. METHODS: The target population of this study is older adults with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, or early-stage dementia. This is an observational, longitudinal study with a study period of up to 9 months. The severity of participant behavioral symptoms (apathy, depression, and anxiety) was self-reported weekly through web-based surveys. Participants' digital biomarkers were continuously collected at their personal residences and through wearables throughout the duration of the study. The indoor physical environment at each residence, such as light level, noise level, temperature, humidity, or air quality, was also measured using indoor environmental sensors. Feasibility was examined, and preliminary correlation analysis between the level of symptoms and the digital biomarkers and between the level of symptoms and the indoor environment was performed. RESULTS: At 13 months after recruitment began, a total of 9 participants had enrolled into this study. The participants showed high adherence rates in completing the weekly questionnaires (response rate: 275/278, 98.9%), and data collection using the digital technology appeared feasible and acceptable to the participants with few exceptions. Participants' severity of behavioral symptoms fluctuated from week to week. Preliminary results show that the duration of sleep onset and noise level are positively correlated with the anxiety level in a subset of our participants. CONCLUSIONS: This study is a step toward more frequent assessment of older adults' behavioral symptoms and holistic in situ monitoring of older adults' behaviors and their living environment. The goal of this study is to facilitate the development of objective digital biomarkers of neuropsychiatric symptoms and to identify in-home environmental factors that contribute to these symptoms.
