31096902|a|BACKGROUND: Exploration of microbes isolated from north western Himalayas for bioactive natural products. RESULTS: A strain of Trichoderma lixii (IIIM-B4) was isolated from Bacopa monnieri L. The ITS based rDNA gene sequence of strain IIIM-B4 displayed 99% sequence similarity with different Trichoderma harzianum species complex. The highest score was displayed for Hypocrea lixii strain FJ462763 followed by H. nigricans strain NBRC31285, Trichoderma lixii strain CBS 110080, T. afroharzianum strain CBS124620 and Trichoderma guizhouense BPI:GJS 08135 respectively. Position of T. lixii (IIIM-B4) in phylogenetic tree suggested separate identity of the strain. Microbial dynamics of T. lixii (IIIM-B4) was investigated for small peptides. Medium to long chain length peptaibols of 11 residue (Group A), 14 residue (Group B) and 17 residue (Group C) were identified using Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer. Optimization is undeniably a desideratum for maximized production of desirable metabolites from microbial strain. Here optimization studies were carried out on T. lixii (IIIM-B4) using different growth media through Intact Cell Mass Spectrometry (ICMS). A multifold increase was obtained in production of 11 residue peptaibols using rose bengal medium. Out of these, one of them named as Tribacopin AV was isolated and sequenced through mass studied. It was found novel as having unique sequence Ac-Gly-Leu-Leu-Leu-Ala-Leu-Pro-Leu-Aib-Val-Gln-OH. It was found to have antifungal activity against Candida albicans (25 mug/mL MIC). CONCLUSION: In this study, we isolated a strain of T. lixii (IIIM-B4) producing medium and long chain peptaibols. One of them named as Tribacopin AV was found novel as having unique sequence Ac-Gly-Leu-Leu-Leu-Ala-Leu-Pro-Leu-Aib-Val-Gln-OH, which had antifungal properties.
