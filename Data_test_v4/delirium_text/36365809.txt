36365809|t|Brain Age Prediction/Classification through Recurrent Deep Learning with Electroencephalogram Recordings of Seizure Subjects.
36365809|a|With modern population growth and an increase in the average lifespan, more patients are becoming afflicted with neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer's. Patients with a history of epilepsy, drug abuse, and mental health disorders such as depression have a larger risk of developing Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases later in life. Utilizing recordings of patients' brain waves obtained from the Temple University abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) corpus, deep leaning long short-term memory neural networks are utilized to classify and predict patients' brain ages. The proposed deep learning neural network model structure and brain wave-processing methodology leads to an accuracy of 90% in patients' brain age classification across six age groups, with a mean absolute error value of 7 years for the brain age regression analysis. The achieved results demonstrate that the use of raw patient-sourced brain wave information leads to higher performance metrics than methods utilizing other brain wave-preprocessing methods and outperforms other deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks.
