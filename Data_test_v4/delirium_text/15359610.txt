15359610|t|Apoptosis: a target for neuroprotection.
15359610|a|Accumulating evidence strongly suggests that apoptosis contributes to neuronal death in a variety of neurodegenerative contexts. Activation of the cysteine protease caspase 3 appears to be a key event in the execution of apoptosis in the central nervous system. As a result, mice null for caspase 3 display considerable neuronal expansion, usually resulting in death by the second week of life. Consistent with the proposal that apoptosis plays a central role in human neurodegenerative disease, caspase-3 activation has recently been observed in stroke, spinal cord trauma, head injury and Alzheimer's disease. Indeed, peptide-based caspase inhibitors prevent neuronal loss in animal models of head injury and stroke, suggesting that these compounds may be the forerunners of non-peptide small molecules that halt the apoptotic process implicated in these neurodegenerative disorders. The present review will summarise some of the recent data suggesting that apoptosis inhibitors may become a practical therapeutic approach for both acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions.
