37579537|t|Manganese level and cognitive decline in older adults with the APOE e4 allele: a preliminary study.
37579537|a|This study examined the relationship between serum manganese level and cognition, and the moderating effect of apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE4) on this relationship. A total of 164 non-demented participants underwent clinical assessments including serum manganese level and cognition [episodic memory score (EMS), non-memory score (NMS) for executive function/attention/language/ visuospatial skill, and total score (TS)]. Serum manganese x APOE4 interaction had a significant effect on EMS and TS. Serum manganese level was inversely associated with EMS and TS in APOE4-positive but not APOE4-negative participants. APOE4 should be considered a key component in Alzheimer's disease studies that included manganese imbalance as a risk factor.
