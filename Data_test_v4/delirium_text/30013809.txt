30013809|t|Weekend Admission of Intracapsular Femoral Neck Fractures Not Associated With a Greater Rate of Mortality or Morbidity.
30013809|a|INTRODUCTION: For a number of emergency conditions, admission over the weekend has been associated with rising morbidity and mortality rates. However, different studies have provided conflicting results regarding the increased rates of mortality and morbidity for patients with intracapsular femoral fracture who were admitted over the weekend, compared to weekdays. This study investigated the effect of weekend admissions on the surgical outcomes of patients with intracapsular femoral neck fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all the patients who were admitted to our level-II trauma center with an intracapsular femoral neck fracture between January 2009 and June 2011. Admission was classified as at the weekend if it took place between 18:00 pm on Friday until midnight on Sunday or on bank holidays. We compared the mortality rates within 30 days and 6 months after surgery for weekday and weekend admissions. Secondary outcomes considered included length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, and reoperation rates. Statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression models, which were adjusted for patient and surgical characteristics. RESULTS: In total, 315 patients met our inclusion criteria. The mean age of this group was 77.9 years (standard deviation +-13) and the female to male ratio was 5:2. The average follow-up period was 49 months. Under logistic regression analysis, weekend admission was not a significant independent risk factor for the 30-day mortality rate (odds ratio 1.85, 95% confidence interval, 0.74-4.62; P = .19). Seventy-seven patients admitted over the weekend were treated within 24 hours versus 125 patients for the weekday group (80.2% vs 57.9%; P = .005). There were no differences between the sample groups in relation to implant-related complications (24.9% vs 25.8%, respectively, P = .89) nor in relation to general complications (12% vs 18.6%, respectively, P = .06). The mean hospital stay of patients operated on during weekends or holidays was significantly shorter compared to patients operated on during weekdays (6.7 vs 8.5 days; P = .009). CONCLUSION: Patients with intracapsular femoral neck fractures who were admitted over the weekend at our trauma center did not have a higher risk of mortality or morbidity. Furthermore, temporary preoperative care provided over the weekend by an internal medical consultant can be safe and efficient even in the circumstances where there is a lack of dedicated geriatric support. The absence of an elective operating list at the weekend could be a potential factor in shortening waiting times for surgery for intracapsular femoral neck fracture at weekends and holidays.
