34204996|t|Olfactory Bulb Proteomics Reveals Widespread Proteostatic Disturbances in Mixed Dementia and Guides for Potential Serum Biomarkers to Discriminate Alzheimer Disease and Mixed Dementia Phenotypes.
34204996|a|The most common form of mixed dementia (MixD) is constituted by abnormal protein deposits associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) that coexist with vascular disease. Although olfactory dysfunction is considered a clinical sign of AD-related dementias, little is known about the impact of this sensorial impairment in MixD at the molecular level. To address this gap in knowledge, we assessed olfactory bulb (OB) proteome-wide expression in MixD subjects (n = 6) respect to neurologically intact controls (n = 7). Around 9% of the quantified proteins were differentially expressed, pinpointing aberrant proteostasis involved in synaptic transmission, nucleoside monophosphate and carbohydrate metabolism, and neuron projection regeneration. In addition, network-driven proteomics revealed a modulation in cell-survival related pathways such as ERK, AKT, and the PDK1-PKC axis. Part of the differential OB protein set was not specific of MixD, also being deregulated across different tauopathies, synucleinopathies, and tardopathies. However, the comparative functional analysis of OB proteome data between MixD and pure AD pathologies deciphered commonalities and differences between both related phenotypes. Finally, olfactory proteomics allowed to propose serum Prolow-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) as a candidate marker to differentiate AD from MixD phenotypes.
