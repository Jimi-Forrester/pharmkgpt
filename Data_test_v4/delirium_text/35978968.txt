35978968|t|Role of high mobility group box protein 1 in depression: A mechanistic and therapeutic perspective.
35978968|a|As a common and serious psychiatric disorder, depression significantly affects psychosocial functioning and quality of life. However, the mechanism of depression is still enigmatic and perplexing, which limits its precise and effective therapeutic methods. Recent studies demonstrated that neuroinflammation activation plays an important role in the pathophysiology of depression. In this respect, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) may be a possible signaling inducer of neuroinflammation and can be a potential mechanistic and therapeutic target for depression. Herein, we review recent studies on the mechanistic and therapeutic targets of HMGB1 in depression and propose potential perspectives on this topic.
