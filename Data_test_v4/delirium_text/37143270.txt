37143270|t|Traditional and Innovative Anti-seizure Medications Targeting Key Physiopathological Mechanisms: Focus on Neurodevelopment and Neurodegeneration.
37143270|a|Despite the wide range of compounds currently available to treat epilepsy, there is still no drug that directly tackles the physiopathological mechanisms underlying its development. Indeed, antiseizure medications attempt to prevent seizures but are inefficacious in counteracting or rescuing the physiopathological phenomena that underlie their onset and recurrence, and hence do not cure epilepsy. Classically, the altered excitation/inhibition balance is postulated as the mechanism underlying epileptogenesis and seizure generation. This oversimplification, however, does not account for deficits in homeostatic plasticity resulting from either insufficient or excessive compensatory mechanisms in response to a change in network activity. In this respect, both neurodevelopmental epilepsies and those associated with neurodegeneration may share common underlying mechanisms that still need to be fully elucidated. The understanding of these molecular mechanisms shed light on the identification of new classes of drugs able not only to suppress seizures, but also to present potential antiepileptogenic effects or "disease-modifying" properties.
