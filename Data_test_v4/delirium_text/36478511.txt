36478511|a|Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a group of pathological processes affecting small arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and small veins of the brain. It is one of the most common subtypes of cerebrovascular diseases, especially highly prevalent in elderly populations, and is associated with stroke occurrence and recurrence, cognitive impairment, gait disorders, psychological disturbance, and dysuria. Its diagnosis mainly depends on MRI, characterized by recent small subcortical infarcts, lacunes, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS), cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), and brain atrophy. While the pathophysiological processes of CSVD are not fully understood at present, inflammation is noticed as playing an important role. Herein, we aimed to review the relationship between plasma inflammatory biomarkers and the MRI features of CSVD, to provide background for further research.
