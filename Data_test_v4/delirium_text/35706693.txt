35706693|a|Background: Cognitive impairment (CI) is associated with prolonged hospital stays and increased complications; however, its role in symptom severity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among spine patients is unknown. We determined 1) prevalence of preoperative CI; 2) associations between CI and preoperative pain, disability, and HRQoL; and 3) association between CI and postoperative improvements in HRQoL. Methods: This is a prospective cohort study of 453 consecutive adult spine surgery patients between October 2019 and March 2021. We compared pain (Numeric Rating Scale, NRS), pain-related disability (Oswestry/Neck Disability Index, O/NDI), and HRQoL (PROMIS-29 profile, version 2.0) among participants having severe (PROMIS-29 Cognitive Abilities score <=30), moderate (31-35), or mild CI (36-40) or who were unimpaired (score >40), using analysis of variance. Likelihood of clinical improvement given the presence of any CI was estimated using logistic regression. All comparisons were adjusted for age, gender, comorbidity, and use of opioid medication during the last 30 days. Alpha=.05. Results: Eighty-five respondents endorsed CI (38 mild; 27 moderate; 20 severe). Preoperatively, those with CI had more severe back pain (p=.005) and neck pain (p=.025) but no differences in leg or arm pain. Those with CI had greater disability on ODI (p<.001) and NDI (p<.001) and worse HRQoL in all domains (all, p<.001). At 6 and 12 months postoperatively, those with CI were less likely to experience clinical improvement in disability and HRQoL (anxiety, pain interference, physical function, and satisfaction with ability to participant in social roles) (all, p<.05). Conclusions: CI was present in nearly 20% of spine patients before surgery and was independently associated with worse preoperative back and neck pain, disability, and HRQoL. Those with CI had approximately one-half the likelihood of achieving meaningful clinical improvement postoperatively. These results indicate a need to evaluate spine patients' cognitive impairment prior to surgery. Level of Evidence: III.
