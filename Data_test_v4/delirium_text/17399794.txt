17399794|a|The neurodegenerative diseases of adulthood, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), pose an enormous and growing public health burden. Although effective symptomatic treatments exist for PD, and, to a lesser extent, for AD, there is no therapy for these disorders which will forestall their progression. With the rise of the concept of programmed cell death (PCD) came the realization that even in the absence of complete knowledge of proximate causes neuroprotection may nevertheless be possible by targeting the pathways of PCD. One set of signaling pathways that have been implicated in cell death are the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. The possibility of blocking these pathways and thereby providing neuroprotection has recently been put to the test in a clinical trial of a mixed lineage kinase inhibitor in the treatment of PD. Unfortunately, this trial failed to demonstrate a protective effect. Based on considerations related to the implementation of the trial, it would be premature to conclude that inhibition of MAPK signaling is a failed strategy. In spite of these negative results, the MAPK and related kinase pathways retain their importance as potential targets in PD. In relation to pathogenesis, the discovery of mutations in the mixed lineage kinase (MLK)-like kinase leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) suggests a role for these kinases in regulating the viability of dopamine neurons. In relation to treatment, the survival signaling kinase Akt has been demonstrated in vivo to mediate striking neurotrophic and antiapoptotic effects. Thus, it is likely that therapeutic targets related to these kinase signaling pathways will emerge.
