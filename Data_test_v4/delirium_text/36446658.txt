36446658|a|INTRODUCTION: In June 2020, after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hospital-Based Liaison Geriatrics units and Primary Care nursing care units were created in the Community of Madrid to improve health care for residents in a coordinated manner. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the situation and the activity of the Hospital-Based Liaison Geriatrics units. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an electronic survey prepared and sent to the liaison geriatricians in March 2022, including the following sections: available resources, areas of health care, reasons for consultation, care interventions, research and teaching activity, profiles of residents attended and coordination with other health professionals at that time. A descriptive analysis of the data was performed. RESULTS: 100% of the existing Liaison Geriatrics units responded, describing essential differences in human resources, hours of care and volume of patients attended. Regarding the care activity of these units, they highlighted the telematic consultation, and the face-to-face assessment during hospitalization and in the emergency department. The main reasons for assessment were decision-making, acute pathology and geriatric syndromes; and the in-hospital drug management or orthoprosthetic aids among the interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the heterogeneity in the resources of the different Liaison Geriatric units, there is a similarity in their care activity and the use of telemedicine. It is common to request an assessment for decision-making, acute pathology or geriatric syndromes and interventions for managing in-hospital drugs and tests, orthoprosthetic aids and coordination with other specialists. Liaison Geriatrics units must continue leading quality health care coordinated with nursing homes, as well as continuity of care for residents.
