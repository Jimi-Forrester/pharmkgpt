39066200|t|Small Animal Models to Study Herpes Simplex Virus Infections.
39066200|a|Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) are two of the most prevalent human viruses worldwide. They are known to cause a variety of diseases including genital herpes, meningitis, encephalitis, cold sores and herpes stromal keratitis. The seropositive rate for HSV-1 is around 90%, whereas for HSV-2 it remains around 20-25% for the general adult population. The infections caused by these viruses remain difficult to study because a large proportion of infected individuals are asymptomatic. Furthermore, given the neurotropic characteristics of the virus, studies aimed at understanding the complex pathogenesis in humans is difficult. As a result, animal models have been developed to understand several characteristics of HSV biology, pathogenesis, disease and host responses to infection. These models are also commonly used as the first evaluation of new drugs and vaccines. There are several well-established animal models to study infection with HSV, including mice, guinea pigs and rabbits. Variables within the animal models depend on the species of animal, route of infection, viral strain, dosage, etc. This review aims at summarizing the most commonly used animal models to study HSV pathogenesis and therapies.
