20920220|a|BACKGROUND: The effects of intervention programs on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with hip fracture have not been well studied. We hypothesized that older patients with hip fracture who received our interdisciplinary intervention program would have better HRQOL than those who did not. METHODS: A randomized experimental design was used. Older patients with hip fracture (N = 162), 60 to 98 years old, from a medical center in northern Taiwan were randomly assigned to an experimental (n = 80) or control (n = 82) group. HRQOL was measured by the SF-36 Taiwan version at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge. RESULTS: The experimental group had significantly better overall outcomes in bodily pain (beta = 9.38, p = 0.002), vitality (beta = 9.40, p < 0.001), mental health (beta = 8.16, p = 0.004), physical function (beta = 16.01, p < 0.001), and role physical (beta = 22.66, p < 0.001) than the control group at any time point during the first year after discharge. Physical-related health outcomes (physical functioning, role physical, and vitality) had larger treatment effects than emotional/mental- and social functioning-related health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This interdisciplinary intervention program may improve health outcomes of elders with hip fracture. Our results may provide a reference for health care providers in countries using similar programs with Chinese/Taiwanese immigrant populations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01052636.
