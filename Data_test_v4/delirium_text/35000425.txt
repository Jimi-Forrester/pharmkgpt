35000425|t|Neuropathology of Vascular Brain Health: Insights From Ex Vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Histopathology Studies in Cerebral Small Vessel Disease.
35000425|a|Sporadic cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a major contributor to vascular cognitive impairment and dementia in the aging human brain. On neuropathology, sporadic SVD is characterized by abnormalities to the small vessels of the brain predominantly in the form of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and arteriolosclerosis. These pathologies frequently coexist with Alzheimer disease changes, such as plaques and tangles, in a single brain. Conversely, during life, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) only captures the larger manifestations of SVD in the form of parenchymal brain abnormalities. There appears to be a major knowledge gap regarding the underlying neuropathology of individual MRI-detectable SVD abnormalities. Ex vivo MRI in postmortem human brain tissue is a powerful tool to bridge this gap. This review summarizes current insights into the histopathologic correlations of MRI manifestations of SVD, their underlying cause, presumed pathophysiology, and associated secondary tissue injury. Moreover, we discuss the advantages and limitations of ex vivo MRI-guided histopathologic investigations and make recommendations for future studies.
