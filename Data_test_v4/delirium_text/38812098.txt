38812098|a|Neuropathological diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) relies on semiquantitative analysis of phosphorylated tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuritic plaques (NPs), without consideration of lesion heterogeneity in individual cases. We developed a deep learning workflow for automated annotation and segmentation of NPs and NFTs from AT8-immunostained whole slide images (WSIs) of AD brain sections. Fifteen WSIs of frontal cortex from 4 biobanks with varying tissue quality, staining intensity, and scanning formats were analyzed. We established an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven iterative procedure to improve the generation of expert-validated annotation datasets for NPs and NFTs thereby increasing annotation quality by >50%. This strategy yielded an expert-validated annotation database with 5013 NPs and 5143 NFTs. We next trained two U-Net convolutional neural networks for detection and segmentation of NPs or NFTs, achieving high accuracy and consistency (mean Dice similarity coefficient: NPs, 0.77; NFTs, 0.81). The workflow showed high generalization performance across different cases. This study serves as a proof-of-concept for the utilization of proprietary image analysis software (Visiopharm) in the automated deep learning segmentation of NPs and NFTs, demonstrating that AI can significantly improve the annotation quality of complex neuropathological features and enable the creation of highly precise models for identifying these markers in AD brain sections.
