39962603|a|BACKGROUND: Cancer is a disease causing abnormal cell proliferation, and can cause stress, anxiety, and emotional reactions in patients. Despite studies in Africa showing psychological distress in cancer patients, a systematic review on this topic has not yet been conducted. METHODS: To find papers, searches were conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, African Journal Online, and Google Scholar. This systematic review and meta-analysis encompassed fifteen primary articles from seven African countries that underwent assessment and inclusion. A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet was used to extract the data, which were then transferred to STATA version 14 for analysis. The statistical heterogeneity was evaluated by using Cochran's Q and I2 statistics. Egger regression tests and funnel plot analysis were employed to look for publication bias. A sensitivity analysis and a subgroup analysis were performed. RESULT: This systematic review and meta-analysis comprised a total of 1567 research participants from 15 different investigations. In Africa, 42.83% of cancer patients overall had a pooled prevalence of psychological distress (95% CI: 19.40, 66.27). Being a rural area (AOR = 2.30; 95% CI: 1.49 to 3.55), having no social support (AOR = 4.63; 95% CI: 2.18 to 9.86), being in stage II cancer (AOR = 2.72; 95% CI: 1.38 to 5.38), having a co-occurring chronic illness (AOR = 2.78; 95% CI: 1.34, 5.74), experiencing financial difficulties (AOR = 16.52; 3.56, 76.63), and experiencing difficult emotional life (AOR = 2.53; 1.07, 5.97) were associated with psychological distress. CONCLUSION: This study shows that there is a high prevalence of psychological distress among cancer patients in Africa. We have also found a significant relationship between psychological distress and rural living, a lack of social support, an advanced stage of the disease, coexisting medical conditions, financial problems, and emotional difficulties. Early detection to lessen psychological discomfort in this susceptible population is essential to reduce the burden of psychological distress among cancer patients.
