36980302|t|Biomarkers Assessing Endothelial Dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease.
36980302|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common degenerative disorder in the elderly in developed countries. Currently, growing evidence is pointing at endothelial dysfunction as a key player in the cognitive decline course of AD. As a main component of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the dysfunction of endothelial cells driven by vascular risk factors associated with AD allows the passage of toxic substances to the cerebral parenchyma, producing chronic hypoperfusion that eventually causes an inflammatory and neurotoxic response. In this process, the levels of several biomarkers are disrupted, such as an increase in adhesion molecules that allow the passage of leukocytes to the cerebral parenchyma, increasing the permeability of the BBB; moreover, other vascular players, including endothelin-1, also mediate artery inflammation. As a consequence of the disruption of the BBB, a progressive neuroinflammatory response is produced that, added to the astrogliosis, eventually triggers neuronal degeneration (possibly responsible for cognitive deterioration). Recently, new molecules have been proposed as early biomarkers for endothelial dysfunction that can constitute new therapeutic targets as well as early diagnostic and prognostic markers for AD.
