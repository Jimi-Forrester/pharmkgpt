32925035|t|Structural Change of Gut Microbiota in Patients with Post-Stroke Comorbid Cognitive Impairment and Depression and Its Correlation with Clinical Features.
32925035|a|BACKGROUND: Post-stroke comorbid cognitive impairment and depression (PSCCID) is a severe neuropsychiatric complication after acute stroke. Gut microbiota dysbiosis is associated with many psychiatric disorders. Alterations in the composition of gut microbiota may serve as a critical role in patients with PSCCID. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to characterize the microbial profiles of patients with PSCCID. METHOD: A total of 175 stroke patients were recruited in the study. The composition of gut bacterial communities of patients was determined by 16S ribosomal RNA Miseq sequencing, and Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States was used to demonstrate the functional alterations of gut microbiota. We further identified the characteristic gut microbiota of PSCCID using linear discriminant analysis effect size. RESULTS: Patients with PSCCID exhibited an increased abundance of Proteobacteria, including Gammaproteobacteria, Enterobacteriales, and Enterobacteriaceae, and a decreased abundance of several short-chain fatty acids-producing bacteria compared with non-PSCCID patients. The abundance of Gammaproteobacteria and Enterobacteriaceae showed negative correlations with the MoCA score. Moreover, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes results demonstrated the enriched orthologs of glycan biosynthesis and metabolism and decreased orthologs of amino acid metabolism in PSCCID patients. Importantly, the characteristic gut microbiota was identified and achieved an area under the curve of 0.847 between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In this study, we characterized the gut microbiota of PSCCID patients, and revealed the correlations of the altered gut microbiota with clinical parameters, which took a further step towards non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers for PSCCID from fecal samples.
