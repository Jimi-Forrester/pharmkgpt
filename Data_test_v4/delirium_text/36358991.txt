36358991|t|Repurposable Drugs That Interact with Steroid Responsive Gene Targets for Inner Ear Disease.
36358991|a|Corticosteroids, oral or transtympanic, remain the mainstay for inner ear diseases characterized by hearing fluctuation or sudden changes in hearing, including sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), Meniere's disease (MD), and autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED). Despite their use across these diseases, the rate of complete recovery remains low, and results across the literature demonstrates significant heterogeneity with respect to the effect of corticosteroids, suggesting a need to identify more efficacious treatment options. Previously, our group has cross-referenced steroid-responsive genes in the cochlea with published single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptome datasets to demonstrate that steroid-responsive differentially regulated genes are expressed in spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) and stria vascularis (SV) cell types. These differentially regulated genes represent potential druggable gene targets. We utilized multiple gene target databases (DrugBank, Pharos, and LINCS) to identify orally administered, FDA approved medications that potentially target these genes. We identified 42 candidate drugs that have been shown to interact with these genes, with an emphasis on safety profile, and tolerability. This study utilizes multiple databases to identify drugs that can target a number of druggable genes in otologic disorders that are commonly treated with steroids, providing a basis for establishing novel repurposing treatment trials.
