34875520|t|Imidazolylacetophenone oxime-based multifunctional neuroprotective agents: Discovery and structure-activity relationships.
34875520|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) possesses a complex pathogenetic mechanism. Nowadays, multitarget agents are considered to have potential in effectively treating AD via triggering molecules in functionally complementary pathways at the same time. Here, based on the screening (~1400 compounds) against neuroinflammation, an imidazolylacetophenone oxime ether (IOE) was discovered as a novel hit. In order to obtain SARs, a series of imidazolylacetophenone oxime derivatives were constructed, and their C=N bonds were confirmed as the Z configuration by single crystals. These derivatives exhibited potential multifunctional neuroprotective effects including anti-neuroinflammatory, antioxidative damage, metal-chelating, inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) properties. Among these derivatives, compound 12i displayed the most potent inhibitory activity against nitric oxide (NO) production with EC50 value of 0.57 muM 12i can dose-dependently suppress the expression of iNOS and COX-2 but not change the expression of HO-1 protein. Moreover, 12i exhibited evidently neuroprotective effects on H2O2-induced PC12 cells damage and ferroptosis without cytotoxicity at 10 muM, as well as selectively metal chelating properties via chelating Cu2+. In addition, 12i showed a mixed-type inhibitory effect on AChE in vitro. The structure-activity relationships (SARs) analysis indicated that dioxolane groups on benzene ring and rigid oxime ester can improve the activity. Parallel artificial membrane permeation assay (PAMPA) also verified that 12i can overcome the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Overall, this is the first report on imidazolylacetophenone oxime-based multifunctional neuroprotective effects, suggesting that this type of compounds might be novel multifunctional agents against AD.
