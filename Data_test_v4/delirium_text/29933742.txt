29933742|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic noise exposure is associated with neuroinflammation and gut microbiota dysregulation and increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Environmental hazards are also thought to be associated with genetic susceptibility factors that increase AD pathogenesis. However, there is limited experimental evidence regarding the link between chronic noise stress and microbiome-gut-brain axis alterations, which may be closely related to AD development. METHODS: The aim of the present study was to systematically investigate the effects of chronic noise exposure on the microbiome-gut-brain axis in the senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) strain. We established SAMP8 mouse models to examine the consequences of noise exposure on the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Hippocampal amyloid-beta (Abeta) assessment and the Morris water maze were used to evaluate AD-like changes, 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing analyses were used for intestinal flora measurements, and assessment of endothelial tight junctions and serum neurotransmitter and inflammatory mediator levels, as well as fecal microbiota transplant, was conducted to explore the underlying pathological mechanisms. RESULTS: Chronic noise exposure led to cognitive impairment and Abeta accumulation in young SAMP8 mice, similar to that observed in aging SAMP8 mice. Noise exposure was also associated with decreased gut microbiota diversity and compositional alterations. Axis-series studies showed that endothelial tight junction proteins were decreased in both the intestine and brain, whereas serum neurotransmitter and inflammatory mediator levels were elevated in young SAMP8 mice exposed to chronic noise, similar to the observations made in the aging group. The importance of intestinal bacteria in noise exposure-induced epithelial integrity impairment and Abeta accumulation was further confirmed through microbiota transplantation experiments. Moreover, the effects of chronic noise were generally intensity-dependent. CONCLUSION: Chronic noise exposure altered the gut microbiota, accelerated age-related neurochemical and inflammatory dysregulation, and facilitated AD-like changes in the brain of SAMP8 mice.
