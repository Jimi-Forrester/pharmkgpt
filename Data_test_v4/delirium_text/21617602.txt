21617602|a|There was a dearth in awareness and knowledge regarding pediatric delirium (PD) at the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The aim of this study is to highlight the most recent and up-to-date findings of current literature -by means of a systematic review (SR) method-, and to present the key issues and research questions. A SR of the literature published between 24 March 2009 and 10 March 2011. Eight new articles were identified which included (literature) reviews, journal commentaries, and observational studies. There still is a dearth of literature on PD, with also a variable level of evidence (1b - 5), especially in relation to critical illness. To be able to further clarify PD in the PICU, additional research questions are provided for future research.
