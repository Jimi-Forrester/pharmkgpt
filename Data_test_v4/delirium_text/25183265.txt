25183265|t|Site-2 protease responds to oxidative stress and regulates oxidative injury in mammalian cells.
25183265|a|Site-2 protease (S2P) is a membrane-embedded protease that site-specifically cleaves intramembrane transcription factors, a necessary step for their maturation. S2P is well known to regulate cholesterol biosynthesis and endoplasmic reticulum stress in mammalian cells. In this study, we hypothesized that S2P could be responsible for the regulation of cellular oxidative injury under oxidative stress. Wild type Chinese hamster ovary (WT CHO) cells and their mutant M19 cells with defective S2P gene were exposed to different oxidative stress conditions. Results showed that oxidative stress significantly up-regulated S2P expression in WT CHO cells. Notably, M19 cells had remarkably higher level of superoxide and elevated rates of cell death than WT CHO cells. The vulnerability to oxidative stress was reversed by the transfection of S2P gene but not rescued by exogenous supplement of cholesterol, oleate, and mevalonate, indicating that lack of S2P gene leads cells to be more vulnerable to oxidative stress. Furthermore, compared with WT CHO cells, M19 cells had higher nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity and lower paraoxonase-2 expression. Taken together, these results suggest that S2P can be a protease responding to oxidative stress and has the function of regulating cellular oxidative injury.
