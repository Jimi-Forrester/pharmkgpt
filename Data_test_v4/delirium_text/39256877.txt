39256877|t|Clinical, neuropathological, and molecular characteristics of rapidly progressive dementia with Lewy bodies: a distinct clinicopathological entity?
39256877|a|BACKGROUND: The term rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) with Lewy bodies (rpDLB) is used for DLB patients who develop a rapidly progressive neurological syndrome and have reduced survival. Here, we characterise the clinical, neuropathological, and molecular characteristics of a large rpDLB neuropathological series. METHODS: We included all RPD patients with a disease duration < 4 years submitted to our prion disease referral centre between 2003 and 2022 who showed Lewy body pathology (LBP) in limbic or neocortical stages as primary neuropathological diagnosis, had no systemic condition justifying the rapid deterioration and were previously neurologically unimpaired. Clinical features were retrieved and compared with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and rapidly progressive Alzheimer's disease (rpAD) cohorts. Neuropathological and genetic (whole exome sequencing, APOE genotyping, and C9orf72 repeat expansion analysis) characteristics of rpDLB patients were systematically investigated. We scored semi-quantitatively the LBP load and performed a alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn) RT-QuIC seeding amplification assay (SAA) on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and tenfold serially diluted brain homogenates from different brain areas in rpDLB patients and typical long-lasting Lewy body disease (LBD) with dementia patients as control group. RESULTS: RpDLB patients were older (p = 0.047) and presented more cognitive fluctuations (p = 0.005), visual hallucinations (p = 0.020), neuropsychiatric symptoms (p = 0.006) and seizures (p = 0.032), and fewer cerebellar (p < 0.001) and visual (p = 0.004) signs than CJD ones. Delirium onset was more common than in both CJD (p < 0.001) and rpAD (p = 0.008). Atypical LBD signs (pyramidal, myoclonus, akinetic mutism) were common. All tested patients were positive by CSF alphaSyn SAA. Concomitant pathologies were common, with only four cases showing relatively "pure" LBP. LBP load and alphaSyn seeding activity measured through alphaSyn RT-QuIC SAA were not significantly different between rpDLB patients and typical LBD. We found a likely pathogenic variant in GBA in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that: 1) rpDLB exhibits a distinct clinical signature (2) CSF alphaSyn SAA is a reliable diagnostic test; 3) rpDLB is a heterogeneous neuropathological entity that can be underlain by both widespread pure LBP, or multiple copathologies 4) rpDLB is likely not sustained by distinct alphaSyn conformational strains; 5) genetic defects may, at least occasionally, contribute to the poor prognosis in these patients.
