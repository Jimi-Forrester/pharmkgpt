35270853|t|Statistical Analysis and Kinematic Assessment of Upper Limb Reaching Task in Parkinson's Disease.
35270853|a|The impact of neurodegenerative disorders is twofold; they affect both quality of life and healthcare expenditure. In the case of Parkinson's disease, several strategies have been attempted to support the pharmacological treatment with rehabilitation protocols aimed at restoring motor function. In this scenario, the study of upper limb control mechanisms is particularly relevant due to the complexity of the joints involved in the movement of the arm. For these reasons, it is difficult to define proper indicators of the rehabilitation outcome. In this work, we propose a methodology to analyze and extract an ensemble of kinematic parameters from signals acquired during a complex upper limb reaching task. The methodology is tested in both healthy subjects and Parkinson's disease patients (N = 12), and a statistical analysis is carried out to establish the value of the extracted kinematic features in distinguishing between the two groups under study. The parameters with the greatest number of significances across the submovements are duration, mean velocity, maximum velocity, maximum acceleration, and smoothness. Results allowed the identification of a subset of significant kinematic parameters that could serve as a proof-of-concept for a future definition of potential indicators of the rehabilitation outcome in Parkinson's disease.
