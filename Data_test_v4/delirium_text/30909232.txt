30909232|t|Plasma Levels of Soluble AbetaPPbeta as a Biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease with Dementia.
30909232|a|Cost- and time-effective markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), reliable and feasible at the population level are urgently needed. Soluble amyloid-beta protein precursor beta (sAbetaPPbeta) in plasma has attracted scientific attention as a potential AD biomarker candidate. Here we report that plasma sAbetaPPbeta levels in patients with AD dementia and typical for AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker profiles (N = 33) are significantly lower (p < 0.01) than those of cognitively healthy elderly individuals without AD (N = 39), while CSF sAbetaPPbeta levels did not differ between the studied groups. This provides further evidence for the potential of sAbetaPPbeta in plasma as an AD biomarker candidate.
