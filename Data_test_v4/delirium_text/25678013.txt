25678013|t|Design, synthesis and evaluation of chromone-2-carboxamido-alkylbenzylamines as multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
25678013|a|A series of chromone-2-carboxamido-alkylbenzylamines were designed, synthesized and evaluated as multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The results showed that most of these compounds exhibited good multifunctional activities. Among them, compound 49 displayed excellent inhibitory potency toward acetylcholinesterase (AChE), moderate anti-oxidative activity, selective biometal chelating, and possessed good inhibitory effects on self-induced and Cu(2+)-induced Abeta aggregation. Both kinetic analysis of AChE inhibition and molecular modeling study indicated that 49 was a mixed-type inhibitor, binding simultaneously to the catalytic active site and peripheral anionic site of AChE. These results suggested that 49 might be a potential multifunctional agent for AD treatment.
