33576905|t|Targeting the purinergic pathway in breast cancer and its therapeutic applications.
33576905|a|Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequent cause of death among women, representing a global public health problem. Here, we aimed to discuss the correlation between the purinergic system and BC, recognizing therapeutic targets. For this, we analyzed the interaction of extracellular nucleotides and nucleosides with the purinergic receptors P1 and P2, as well as the influence of ectonucleotidase enzymes (CD39 and CD73) on tumor progression. A comprehensive bibliographic search was carried out. The relevant articles for this review were found in the PubMed, Scielo, Lilacs, and ScienceDirect databases. It was observed that among the P1 receptors, the A1, A2A, and A2B receptors are involved in the proliferation and invasion of BC, while the A3 receptor is related to the inhibition of tumor growth. Among the P2 receptors, the P2X7 has a dual function. When activated for a short time, it promotes metastasis, but when activated for long periods, it is related to BC cell death. P2Y2 and P2Y6 receptors are related to BC proliferation and invasiveness. Also, the high expression of CD39 and CD73 in BC is strongly related to a worse prognosis. The receptors and ectonucleotidases involved with BC become possible therapeutic targets. Several purinergic pathways have been found to be involved in BC cell survival and progression. In this review, in addition to analyzing the pathways involved, we reviewed the therapeutic interventions already studied for BC related to the purinergic system, as well as to other possible therapeutic targets.
