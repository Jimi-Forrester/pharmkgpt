36499491|t|Amyloid beta-Peptide Causes the Permanent Activation of CaMKIIalpha through Its Oxidation.
36499491|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques in the brain. They are composed of aggregated amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) misfolded into beta-sheets which are the cause of the AD memory impairment and dementia. Memory depends on the hippocampal formation and maintenance of synapses by long-term potentiation (LTP), whose main steps are the activation of NMDA receptors, the phosphorylation of CaMKIIalpha and the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor CREB. It is known that Abeta oligomers (oAbeta) induce synaptic loss and impair the formation of new synapses. Here, we have studied the effects of oAbeta on CaMKIIalpha. We found that oAbeta produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), that induce CaMKIIalpha oxidation in human neuroblastoma cells as we assayed by western blot and immunofluorescence. Moreover, this oxidized isoform is significantly present in brain samples from AD patients. We found that the oxidized CaMKIIalpha is active independently of the binding to calcium/calmodulin, and that CaMKIIalpha phosphorylation is mutually exclusive with CaMKIIalpha oxidation as revealed by immunoprecipitation and western blot. An in silico modelling of the enzyme was also performed to demonstrate that oxidation induces an activated state of CaMKIIalpha. In brains from AD transgenic models of mice and in primary cultures of murine hippocampal neurons, we demonstrated that the oxidation of CaMKIIalpha induces the phosphorylation of CREB and its translocation to the nucleus to promote the transcription of ARC and BDNF. Our data suggests that CaMKIIalpha oxidation would be a pro-survival mechanism that is triggered when a noxious stimulus challenges neurons as do oAbeta.
