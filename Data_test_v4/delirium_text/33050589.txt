33050589|t|Synergic Therapeutic Potential of PEA-Um Treatment and NAAA Enzyme Silencing In the Management of Neuroinflammation.
33050589|a|Inflammation is a key element in the pathobiology of neurodegenerative diseases and sees the involvement of different neuronal and non-neuronal cells as players able to respond to inflammatory signals of immune origin. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endogenous potent anti-inflammatory agent, in which activity is regulated by N-acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA), that hydrolyzes saturated or monounsaturated fatty acid ethanolamides, such as PEA. In this research, an in vitro study was performed on different neuronal (SH-SY5Y) and non-neuronal cell lines (C6, BV-2, and Mo3.13) subjected to NAAA enzyme silencing and treated with PEA ultra-micronized (PEA-um) (1, 3, and 10 muM) to increase the amount of endogenous PEA available for counteract neuroinflammation provoked by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 mug/mL) and interferon gamma (INF-gamma )(100 U/mL). Cell viability was performed by MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide) staining, suggesting a protective effect of PEA-um (3 and 10 muM) on all cell lines studied. Western Blot analysis for inflammatory markers (Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)) was carried out in control and NAAA-silenced cells, highlighting how the concomitant treatment of the neuronal and non-neuronal cells with PEA-um after NAAA genic downregulation is satisfactory to counteract neuroinflammation. These in vitro findings support the protective role of endogenous PEA availability in the neuronal field, bringing interesting information for a translational point of view.
