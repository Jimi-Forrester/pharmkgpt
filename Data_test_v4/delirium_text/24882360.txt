24882360|t|Interaction of Grb2 SH3 domain with UVRAG in an Alzheimer's disease-like scenario.
24882360|a|Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) is an adaptor protein which participates in trafficking pathways alongside its role in signaling. Proteins important for actin remodeling and cellular compartmentalization contain SRC Homology 3 (SH3) binding motifs that interact with Grb2. While studying the Grb2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD) interaction in Alzheimer's disease cell line models, it was seen that Grb2 colocalized to compartments that mature into autophagosomes. The entrapping of AICD in the Grb2 vesicles and its clearance via autophagosomes was a survival contrivance on the part of the cell. Here, we report that Grb2, when in excess, interacts with ultraviolet radiation resistance-associated gene protein (UVRAG) under excess conditions of AICD-Grb2 or Grb2. The N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 specifically interacts with UVRAG, unlike the C-terminal SH3 domain. This interaction helps to understand the role of Grb2 in the autophagic maturation of vesicles.
