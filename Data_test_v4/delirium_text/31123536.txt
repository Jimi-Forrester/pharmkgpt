31123536|a|Abnormal axonal transport of vesicles as well as organelles in a particular set of neurons is implicated in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Although various types of microfluidic multicompartmental devices with closed microchannels have been recently developed and widely used for axonal transport analysis, most of the existing devices are troublesome and time-consuming to handle, such as culture maintenances, sample collections, and immunocytochemistry. In this study, we overcome such inherent shortcomings by developing a novel open-type device that enables easy cell maintenance and sample collections. In our device, microgrooves instead of microchannels were directly fabricated on a glass substrate, thereby making possible a high-resolution optical observation. Compared with the conventional closed-type devices, our newly designed device allowed us to efficiently and precisely label the axonal acidic vesicles by fluorescent dyes, facilitating a high-throughput analysis of axonal vesicular transport. The present novel device, as a user-friendly and powerful tool, can be implemented in molecular and cellular pathogenesis studies on neurological diseases.
