37438762|a|BACKGROUND: Nuclear acetyl-CoA pools govern histone acetylation that controls synaptic plasticity and contributes to cognitive deterioration in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nuclear acetyl-CoA pools are generated partially from local acetate that is metabolized by acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2). However, the underlying mechanism of histone acetylation dysregulation in AD remains poorly understood. METHODS: We detected ACSS2 expression and histone acetylation levels in the brains of AD patients and 5 x FAD mice. When we altered ACSS2 expression by injecting adeno-associated virus into the dorsal hippocampus of 5 x FAD mice and replenished ACSS2 substrate (acetate), we observed changes in cognitive function by Morris water maze. We next performed RNA-seq, ChIP-qPCR, and electrophysiology to study molecular mechanism underlying ACSS2-mediated spatial learning and memory in 5 x FAD mice. RESULTS: We reported that ACSS2 expression and histone acetylation (H3K9, H4K12) were reduced in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of 5 x FAD mice. Reduced ACSS2 levels were also observed in the temporal cortex of AD patients. 5 x FAD mice exhibited a low enrichment of acetylated histones on the promoters of NMDARs and AMPARs, together with impaired basal and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, all of which were rescued by ACSS2 upregulation. Moreover, acetate replenishment enhanced ac-H3K9 and ac-H4K12 in 5 x FAD mice, leading to an increase of NMDARs and AMPARs and a restoration of synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in an ACSS2-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: ACSS2 is a key molecular switch of cognitive impairment and that targeting ACSS2 or acetate administration may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of intermediate or advanced AD. Nuclear acetyl-CoA pools are generated partly from local acetate that is metabolized by acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2). Model depicts that ACSS2 expression is downregulated in the brains of 5xFAD model mice and AD patients. Of note, ACSS2 downregulation mediates a reduction in ionotropic glutamate receptor expression through histone acetylation, which exacerbates synaptic plasticity impairment in AD. These deficits can be rescued by ACSS2 upregulation or acetate supplementation (GTA, an FDA-approved food additive), which may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for AD treatment.
