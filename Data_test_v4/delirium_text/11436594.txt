11436594|t|[The new poor expatriates in the third world].
11436594|a|This report describes four cases involving French expatriates who developed serious health problems while living destitute in Senegal. A 37-year-old man presented with embolism-like symptoms in relation with lung involvement due to spreading of untreated staphylococcal skin infection. A 64-year-old man was admitted for high output cardiac failure secondary to severe anemia caused by malnutrition. A 50-year-old man presented recurrent fever with loss of consciousness after successful treatment of neuromalaria and finally attributed to delirium tremens. A 25-year-old man was hospitalized with presumed meningoencephalitis that had been ongoing for two weeks. All four patients had been in Senegal for several months and had cut all ties to mainland France. Being jobless and homeless, they had been unable to obtain proper nutrition or medications. With minimal entry requirements and low-cost air travel, Senegal has been come a common sight-seeing destination and has developed a small but apparently growing population of destitute travelers. Alienation from the home community and resulting seclusion enhance clinical consequences and delay intervention by foreign service officials.
