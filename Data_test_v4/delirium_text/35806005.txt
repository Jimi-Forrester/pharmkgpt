35806005|t|Human IL12p80 Promotes Murine Oligodendrocyte Differentiation to Repair Nerve Injury.
35806005|a|Nerve injury of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system still poses a major challenge in modern clinics. Understanding the roles of neurotrophic factors and their molecular mechanisms on neuro-regeneration will not only benefit patients with neural damage but could potentially treat neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this study, we showed that human IL12 p40-p40 homodimer (hIL12p80) within PLA and PLGA conduits improved sciatic nerve regeneration in mice. As such, the group of conduits with NSCs and hIL12p80 (CNI) showed the best recovery among the groups in the sciatic functional index (SFI), compound muscle action potential (CMAP), and Rotarod performance analyses. In addition, the CNI group had a faster recovery and outperformed the other groups in SFI and Rotarod performance tests beginning in the fourth week post-surgery. Immunohistochemistry showed that the CNI group increased the diameter of the newly regenerated nerve by two-fold (p < 0.01). In vitro studies showed that hIL12p80 stimulated differentiation of mouse NSCs to oligodendrocyte lineages through phosphorylation of Stat3 at Y705 and S727. Furthermore, implantation using PLGA conduits (C2.0 and C2.1) showed better recovery in the Rotarod test and CMAP than using PLA conduits in FVB mice. In B6 mice, the group with C2.1 + NSCs + hIL12p80 (C2.1NI) not only promoted sciatic functional recovery but also reduced the rate of experimental autotomy. These results suggested that hIL12p80, combined with NSCs, enhanced the functional recovery and accelerated the regeneration of damaged nerves in the sciatic nerve injury mice. Our findings could further shed light on IL12's application not only in damaged nerves but also in rectifying the oligodendrocytes' defects in neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis.
