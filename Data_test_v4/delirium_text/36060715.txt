36060715|t|A multicentric exploratory study of behavioral and psychological symptom characteristics of dementia.
36060715|a|Background: Behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPS) are usually the expected consequences of dementia. BPS increases morbidity and burden, affects the quality of life, and impacts care costs. However, the symptom characteristics, clinical correlations, and symptom-specific clusters aiding the diagnosis are less well studied, especially in the Indian population. Materials and Methods: The present study examined the BPS clusters based on various cognitive and neuropsychiatric profiles in patients with dementia under a multicentric study in India. We did a cross-sectional assessment using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) and cognitive functions by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the severity of dementia using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale. In addition, all of the participants were evaluated on a structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Research Version for past or current psychiatric disorder(s). Results: We describe the various BPS clusters uniquely associated with the severity of dementia. Further, on linear regression analysis, we predicted three symptom clusters (anxiety, irritability, aberrant motor) in mild, two symptom clusters (disinhibition, agitation/aggression) in moderate and three symptom clusters (delusion, euphoria/elation, disinhibition) in severe dementia. Conclusion: The study provides insights into the various symptom characteristics and inter-relationship of BPS, which may benefit the clinician while assessing patients with dementia.
