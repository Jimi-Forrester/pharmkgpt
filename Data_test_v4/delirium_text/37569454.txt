37569454|t|Potential Role of Moesin in Regulating Mast Cell Secretion.
37569454|a|Mast cells have existed for millions of years in species that never suffer from allergic reactions. Hence, in addition to allergies, mast cells can play a critical role in homeostasis and inflammation via secretion of numerous vasoactive, pro-inflammatory and neuro-sensitizing mediators. Secretion may utilize different modes that involve the cytoskeleton, but our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating secretion is still not well understood. The Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin (ERM) family of proteins is involved in linking cell surface-initiated signaling to the actin cytoskeleton. However, how ERMs may regulate secretion from mast cells is still poorly understood. ERMs contain two functional domains connected through a long alpha-helix region, the N-terminal FERM (band 4.1 protein-ERM) domain and the C-terminal ERM association domain (C-ERMAD). The FERM domain and the C-ERMAD can bind to each other in a head-to-tail manner, leading to a closed/inactive conformation. Typically, phosphorylation on the C-terminus Thr has been associated with the activation of ERMs, including secretion from macrophages and platelets. It has previously been shown that the ability of the so-called mast cell "stabilizer" disodium cromoglycate (cromolyn) to inhibit secretion from rat mast cells closely paralleled the phosphorylation of a 78 kDa protein, which was subsequently shown to be moesin, a member of ERMs. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of moesin during the inhibition of mast cell secretion was on the N-terminal Ser56/74 and Thr66 residues. This phosphorylation pattern could lock moesin in its inactive state and render it inaccessible to binding to the Soluble NSF attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) and synaptosomal-associated proteins (SNAPs) critical for exocytosis. Using confocal microscopic imaging, we showed moesin was found to colocalize with actin and cluster around secretory granules during inhibition of secretion. In conclusion, the phosphorylation pattern and localization of moesin may be important in the regulation of mast cell secretion and could be targeted for the development of effective inhibitors of secretion of allergic and inflammatory mediators from mast cells.
