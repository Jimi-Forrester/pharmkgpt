11285697|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder. During the course of PD, most patients develop at least one psychiatric syndrome. Depression is the most frequent disorder and affects nearly half of all patients. The use of an increasing number of new drugs, in particular the dopaminergic agents, puts these patients at risk of developing both delirium and psychosis. This article summarizes the different psychiatric syndromes seen in PD and gives an account of the various treatment possibilities.
