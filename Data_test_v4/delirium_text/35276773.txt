35276773|t|Short-Term Therapeutic Adherence of Hospitalized Older Patients with Oropharyngeal Dysphagia after an Education Intervention: Analysis of Compliance Rates, Risk Factors and Associated Complications.
35276773|a|Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is associated with adverse outcomes that require a multidisciplinary approach with different strategies. Our aim was to assess the adherence of older patients to dysphagia management recommendations during hospitalization, after a specific nurse guided dysphagia education intervention and to identify short term complications of OD and their relationship with short-term adherence. We carried out a prospective observational study in an acute and an orthogeriatric unit of a university hospital over ten months with a one-month follow-up. Four hundred and forty-seven patients (mean age 92 years, 70.7% women) were diagnosed with dysphagia using Volume-Viscosity Swallow Test (V-VST). Compensatory measures and individualized recommendations were explained in detail by trained nurse. Therapeutic adherence was directly observed during hospital admission, after an education intervention, and self-reported after one-month. We also recorded the following reported complications at one month, including respiratory infection, use of antibiotics, weight loss, transfers to the emergency department, or hospitalization). Postural measures and liquid volume were advised to all patients, followed by modified texture food (95.5%), fluid thickeners (32.7%), and delivery method (12.5%). The in-hospital compliance rate with all recommendations was 37.1% and one-month after hospital discharge was 76.4%. Both compliance rates were interrelated and were lower in patients with dementia, malnutrition, and safety signs. Higher compliance rates were observed for sitting feeding and food texture, and an increase in adherence after discharge in the liquid volume and use of thickeners. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that adherence to recommendations during the month after discharge was associated with lower short-term mortality and complications (i.e., respiratory infection, use of antibiotics, weight loss, transfers to the emergency department, or hospitalization). One-third of our participants followed recommendations during hospitalization and three-quarters one month after admission, with higher compliance for posture and food texture. Compliance should be routinely assessed and fostered in older patients with dysphagia.
