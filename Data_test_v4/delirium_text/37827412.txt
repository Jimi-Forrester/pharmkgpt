37827412|t|Phenyl-quinoline derivatives as a lead structure of cholinesterase inhibitor endowed with potency to reduce the GSK-3beta level targeting Alzheimer's disease.
37827412|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to cognitive decline and memory loss. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for this condition, so there is a growing interest in developing new anti-AD agents. In this research project, a series of phenyl-quinoline derivatives were designed as potential anti-AD agents. These derivatives were substituted at two different positions on benzyl and phenyl rings. The structures of the derivatives were characterized using techniques such as IR spectroscopy, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and elemental analysis. During the in vitro screening, the derivatives were tested against both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). It was observed that most of the derivatives showed higher selectivity against BChE compared to AChE. Among the derivatives, analog 7n (with a methoxy group at R1 and a 4-bromine substituent at R2 exhibited the highest potency, with a 75-fold improvement in the activity compared to the positive control. Importantly, this potent analog demonstrated no toxicity at the tested concentration on SH-SY5Y cells, indicating its potential as a safe anti-AD agent. The level of GSK-3beta was also reduced after treatments with 7n at 50 muM. Overall, this study highlights the design and evaluation of phenyl-quinoline derivatives as promising candidates for developing novel anti-AD agents.
