39765855|a|The NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway is a potential therapeutic target for central nervous system diseases. This review emphasizes the role of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the therapeutic potential of Nrf2 activators such as dimethyl fumarate (DMF). DMF, initially administered for treating psoriasis, has demonstrated efficacy in multiple sclerosis and is metabolized to monomethyl fumarate, which may exert significant therapeutic effects. DMF activates the Nrf2-ARE pathway, and recent studies have indicated that its anti-inflammatory effects occur through Nrf2-independent mechanisms. Electrophilic Nrf2 activators, such as DMF, covalently bind to cysteine residues in proteins and modulate their function. We discuss the implications of cysteine residue modifications by DMF, which may cause both therapeutic benefits and potential off-target effects. Furthermore, we propose a chemical proteomics-based drug discovery approach to achieve desired therapeutic effects by selectively covalently modifying cysteines in target proteins. These findings advocate for a broader understanding of the Nrf2-independent mechanisms of electrophilic Nrf2 activators, thereby improving drug discovery strategies that target neurodegenerative diseases while minimizing toxicity.
