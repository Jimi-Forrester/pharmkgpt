36445369|a|Objective: To examine the effect of aging on postoperative neurocognitive decline (NCD) in cardiac surgery patients. Methods: Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft or open aortic valve replacement were administered the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status at preoperative, postoperative day (POD) 4, and 1 month. Blood samples were collected at preoperative, 6 hours postoperative, and POD 4. Plasma interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were quantified. Quality of life was measured with the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey. Data were analyzed using paired ratio and unpaired t tests with Welch's correction, and linear regression for cytokine levels. Results: NCD occurred in 15 patients (N = 33, 45.5%). Dichotomized at age extremes (<60 years; >=75 years), youngest patients had greater preoperative scores (P = .02) with lower scores by POD 4 (P = .03). There was no NCD in the oldest patients, and scores were not different between age groups on POD 4 (P = .08). Regression at 1 month showed NCD scores again declined by age (n = 15), with younger scores returning toward baseline (P = .008). Regression analyses showed decline by age at 6 hours postoperative and POD 4 in plasma CRP levels (P = .05 6 hours, P = .02 POD 4). Dichotomizing IL-6 levels by age (<70 years, >=70 years) demonstrated that levels were greater in younger versus older patients at 6 hours postoperative (P = .03), but not on POD 4. Conclusions: Younger patients tend to have better cognitive scores before surgery but scores at POD 4 are similar to those of older patients, with this trend disappearing at 1 month. IL-6 and CRP upregulation is greater in younger patients, suggesting that a robust perioperative inflammatory response may be associated with reduction in neurocognitive function, and this may be greater in younger versus older patients.
