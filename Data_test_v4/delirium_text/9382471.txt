9382471|a|Lewy bodies (LBs) are filamentous intraneuronal inclusions that are hallmark lesions of Parkinson's disease, and LBs have been shown, by immunohistochemistry, to contain cytoskeletal as well as other cellular proteins. Similar LBs also occur in the cortical neurons of a subset of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and cortical LBs are the predominant or sole lesions in the brains of patients with an AD-like dementia known as diffuse Lewy-body disease (DLBD). To gain insight into the biochemical composition of LBs, we generated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to LBs purified from the brains of patients with DLBD. Here, we describe three of these new mAbs (LB48, LB202, and LB204) that stained LBs by immunohistochemistry and recognized the medium molecular mass neurofilament (NF) protein in western blots. These results support the hypothesis that NF subunits are integral components of LBs. Continued efforts to clarify the composition of LBs are likely to lead to novel strategies for the antemortem diagnosis of LB disorders as well as to insight into the role LBs play in the degeneration of affected neurons in these disorders.
