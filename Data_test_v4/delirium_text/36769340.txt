36769340|t|Oxidative Stress and Aging as Risk Factors for Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease: The Role of the Antioxidant Melatonin.
36769340|a|Aging and neurodegenerative diseases share common hallmarks, including mitochondrial dysfunction and protein aggregation. Moreover, one of the major issues of the demographic crisis today is related to the progressive rise in costs for care and maintenance of the standard living condition of aged patients with neurodegenerative diseases. There is a divergence in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Still, a disturbed endogenous pro-oxidants/antioxidants balance is considered the crucial detrimental factor that makes the brain vulnerable to aging and progressive neurodegeneration. The present review focuses on the complex relationships between oxidative stress, autophagy, and the two of the most frequent neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Most of the available data support the hypothesis that a disturbed antioxidant defense system is a prerequisite for developing pathogenesis and clinical symptoms of ADs and PD. Furthermore, the release of the endogenous hormone melatonin from the pineal gland progressively diminishes with aging, and people's susceptibility to these diseases increases with age. Elucidation of the underlying mechanisms involved in deleterious conditions predisposing to neurodegeneration in aging, including the diminished role of melatonin, is important for elaborating precise treatment strategies for the pathogenesis of AD and PD.
