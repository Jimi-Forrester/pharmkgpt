32582835|a|INTRODUCTION: Composite scores based on psychometrically rigorous cognitive assessments are well suited for early diagnosis and disease monitoring. METHODS: We developed and cross-validated the Brain Health Assessment-Cognitive Score (BHA-CS), based on a brief computerized battery, in 451 cognitively normal (CN) and 399 cognitively impaired (mild cognitive impairment [MCI] or dementia) older adults. We investigated its long-term reliability and reliable change indices at longitudinal follow-up (N = 340), and the association with amyloid beta (Abeta) burden in the CN subgroup with Abeta positron emission tomography (N = 119). RESULTS: The BHA-CS was accurate at detecting cognitive impairment and exhibited excellent long-term stability. Reliable decline over one year was detected in 75% of participants with dementia, 44% with MCI, and 3% of CN. Among CN, the Abeta-positive group showed worse longitudinal performance on the BHA-CS compared to the Abeta-negative group. DISCUSSION: The BHA-CS is sensitive to cognitive decline in preclinical and prodromal neurodegenerative disease.
