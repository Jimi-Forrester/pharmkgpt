33477713|t|Postoperative Neurocognitive Disorders in Cardiac Surgery: Investigating the Role of Intraoperative Hypotension. A Systematic Review.
33477713|a|Perioperative neurocognitive disorders remain a challenging obstacle in patients after cardiac surgery, as they significantly contribute to postoperative morbidity and mortality. Identifying the modifiable risk factors and mechanisms for postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) and delirium (POD) would be an important step forward in preventing such adverse events and thus improving patients' outcome. Intraoperative hypotension is frequently discussed as a potential risk factor for neurocognitive decline, due to its significant impact on blood flow and tissue perfusion, however the studies exploring its association with POCD and POD are very heterogeneous and present divergent results. This review demonstrates 13 studies found after structured systematic search strategy and discusses the possible relationship between intraoperative hypotension and postoperative neuropsychiatric dysfunction.
