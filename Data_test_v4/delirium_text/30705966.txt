30705966|t|A Phase I-II Study Using Rexin-G Tumor-Targeted Retrovector Encoding a Dominant-Negative Cyclin G1 Inhibitor for Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.
30705966|a|Rexin-G is a replication-incompetent retroviral vector displaying a cryptic SIG-binding peptide for targeting abnormal Signature (SIG) proteins in tumors and encoding a dominant-negative human cyclin G1 construct. Herein we report on the safety and antitumor activity of escalating doses of Rexin-G in gemcitabine-refractory pancreatic adenocarcinoma, with one 10-year survivor. For the safety analysis (n = 20), treatment-related grade 1 adverse events included fatigue (n = 6), chills (n = 2), and headache (n = 1), with no organ damage and no DLT. No patient tested positive for vector-neutralizing antibodies, antibodies to gp70, replication-competent retrovirus (RCR), or vector integration into genomic DNA of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). For the efficacy analysis (n = 15), one patient achieved a complete response (CR), two patients had a partial response (PR), and 12 had stable disease (SD). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.7, 4.0, and 5.6 months at doses 0-I, II, and III, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) and 1-year OS rate at dose 0-I were 4.3 months and 0%, and at dose II-III they were 9.2 months and 33.3%. To date, one patient is still alive with no evidence of cancer 10 years after the start of Rexin-G treatment. Taken together, these data suggest that Rexin-G, the first targeted gene delivery system, is uniquely safe and exhibits significant antitumor activity, for which the FDA granted fast-track designation.
