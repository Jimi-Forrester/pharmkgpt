34769517|t|Focus on the Small GTPase Rab1: A Key Player in the Pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease.
34769517|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease. It is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the formation of large aggregates in the survival neurons called Lewy bodies, which mainly contain alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn). The cause of cell death is not known but could be due to mitochondrial dysfunction, protein homeostasis failure, and alterations in the secretory/endolysosomal/autophagic pathways. Survival nigral neurons overexpress the small GTPase Rab1. This protein is considered a housekeeping Rab that is necessary to support the secretory pathway, the maintenance of the Golgi complex structure, and the regulation of macroautophagy from yeast to humans. It is also involved in signaling, carcinogenesis, and infection for some pathogens. It has been shown that it is directly linked to the pathogenesis of PD and other neurodegenerative diseases. It has a protective effect against alpha-sigmapsinu toxicity and has recently been shown to be a substrate of LRRK2, which is the most common cause of familial PD and the risk of sporadic disease. In this review, we analyze the key aspects of Rab1 function in dopamine neurons and its implications in PD neurodegeneration/restauration. The results of the current and former research support the notion that this GTPase is a good candidate for therapeutic strategies.
