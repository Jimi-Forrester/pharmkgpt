37368609|t|Assessment of Anti-Alzheimer Pursuit of Jambolan Fruit Extract and/or Choline against AlCl3 Toxicity in Rats.
37368609|a|Jambolan fruit extract and choline were investigated for Aluminum tri chloride (AlCl3)-induced Alzheimer's disease in rats. Thirty-six male "Sprague Dawley" rats weighing (150 +- 10 g) were allocated into six groups; the first group was fed a baseline diet and served as a negative control. Alzheimer's disease (AD) was induced in Group 2 rats by oral administration of AlCl3 (17 mg/kg body weight) dissolved in distilled water (served as a positive control). Rats in Group 3 were orally supplemented concomitantly with both 500 mg/kg BW of an ethanolic extract of jambolan fruit once daily for 28 days and AlCl3 (17 mg/kg body weight). Group 4: Rivastigmine (RIVA) aqueous infusion (0.3 mg/kg BW/day) was given orally to rats as a reference drug concomitantly with oral supplementation of AlCl3 (17 mg/kg body weight) for 28 days. Group 5 rats were orally treated with choline (1.1 g/kg) concomitantly with oral supplementation of AlCl3 (17 mg/kg body weight). Group 6 was given 500 mg/kg of jambolan fruit ethanolic extract and 1.1 g/kg of choline orally to test for additive effects concurrently with oral supplementation of AlCl3 (17 mg/kg bw) for 28 days. Body weight gain, feed intake, feed efficiency ratio, and relative brain, liver, kidney, and spleen weight were calculated after the trial. Brain tissue assessment was analyzed for antioxidant/oxidant markers, biochemical analysis in blood serum, a phenolic compound in Jambolan fruits extracted by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and histopathology of the brain. The results showed that Jambolan fruit extract and choline chloride improved brain functions, histopathology, and antioxidant enzyme activity compared with the positive group. In conclusion, administering jambolan fruit extract and choline can lower the toxic impacts of aluminum chloride on the brain.
