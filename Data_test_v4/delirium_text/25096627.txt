25096627|a|Extracellular aggregates of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) are a hallmark in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. Recent findings suggest that Abeta is generated intracellularly and potential production sites include endosomes and trans-Golgi network. We determined the production of Abeta in subcellular fractions isolated from mouse brain. We found that a considerable amount of Abeta is produced at mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contact sites including outer mitochondrial membrane and mitochondria-associated ER membranes. Enhanced Abeta production at this site may disturb ER, mitochondrial and mitochondria-ER contact site function. This may be one key step in the cascade of events eventually leading to neurodegeneration in AD.
