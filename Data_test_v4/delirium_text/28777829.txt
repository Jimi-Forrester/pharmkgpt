28777829|t|Identification of an early transcriptomic signature of insulin resistance and related diseases in lymphomonocytes of healthy subjects.
28777829|a|Insulin resistance is considered to be a pathogenetic mechanism in several and diverse diseases (e.g. type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis) often antedating them in apparently healthy subjects. The aim of this study is to investigate with a microarray based approach whether IR per se is characterized by a specific pattern of gene expression. For this purpose we analyzed the transcriptomic profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in two groups (10 subjects each) of healthy individuals, with extreme insulin resistance or sensitivity, matched for BMI, age and gender, selected within the MultiKnowledge Study cohort (n = 148). Data were analyzed with an ad-hoc rank-based classification method. 321 genes composed the gene set distinguishing the insulin resistant and sensitive groups, within which the "Adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes" KEGG pathway was significantly represented, suggesting a pattern of increased intracellular cAMP and Ca2+, and apoptosis in the IR group. The same pathway allowed to discriminate between insulin resistance and insulin sensitive subjects with BMI >25, supporting his role as a biomarker of IR. Moreover, ASCM pathway harbored biomarkers able to distinguish healthy and diseased subjects (from publicly available data sets) in IR-related diseases involving excitable cells: type 2 diabetes, chronic heart failure, and Alzheimer's disease. The altered gene expression profile of the ASCM pathway is an early molecular signature of IR and could provide a common molecular pathogenetic platform for IR-related disorders, possibly representing an important aid in the efforts aiming at preventing, early detecting and optimally treating IR-related diseases.
