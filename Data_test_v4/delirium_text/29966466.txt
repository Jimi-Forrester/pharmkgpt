29966466|t|An Iceberg Phenomenon in Dementia: Pain.
29966466|a|BACKGROUND: Pain is one of the most frequent symptoms in older adults. It severely impairs quality of life, increases delirium risk, and may lead to progression of dementia. Assessment of pain performed by taking anamnesis from the patient is not reliable in patients with dementia due to cooperation and communication problems. The aim of this study was to assess pain and its consequences in patients with dementia. METHODS: Seventy-five nursing home residents with dementia were enrolled. After comprehensive geriatric assessment, presence of pain was asked to patients, and Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD), Discomfort Scale for Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type (DS-DAT), Pain Assessment for the Dementing Elderly (PADE), Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale, and Numeric Rating Scale tests were performed. RESULTS: Mean age was 81.1 (7.0), and 46.7% (n = 35) were female. Thirty-two percent of the patients were at early stage, 24% at moderate stage, and 44% at severe stage. Although the number of patients declaring pain was lower in moderate and severe stage, scores of PADE, PAINAD, and DS-DAT were significantly higher in severe stage showing the presence of pain ( P < .001). Furthermore, scores of PADE, PAINAD, and DS-DAT were negatively correlated with comprehensive geriatric assessment test scores. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that pain is not rare in patients with dementia, but they are not usually capable of expressing it, especially in the severe stage. Therefore, objective pain assessment scales developed for patients with dementia should be routinely used and management of pain should be done regarding the association of pain with other geriatric syndromes.
