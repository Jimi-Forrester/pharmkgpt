34302312|a|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a delirium prevention care protocol on pain, functional status, sleep quality and delirium prevention in patients with hip fractures. BACKGROUND: The development of delirium following hip fracture is common among older patients. According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 30% of delirium cases are preventable. The prevention of delirium, a multifactorial syndrome, can be achieved through a multicomponent care protocol that targets specific risk factors for delirium. DESIGN: A randomised controlled study was conducted according to the CONSORT 2010 guidelines. The Clinical Trial Registry number is NCT04188795. METHODS: A total of 84 patients were assigned to two groups by block randomisation. The intervention group (n = 41) received nursing care according to a protocol and the control group (n = 43) received standard nursing care. Study data were collected using the demographic information form, the Confusion Assessment Method-Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU), the Barthel Index, the Mini Nutritional Assessment-short form and the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ). The pain of the patients was assessed by using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 80.6 years (standard deviation 8.0; range 65.0- 97.5 years), and the percentage of the male patients were 36.3%. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups in terms of pain and functional status in the preoperative period, on the first postoperative day, or in the predischarge period (p > 0.05 for each). The sleep quality of patients in the intervention group was significantly better than in the control group for all three time measurements (p < 0.05 for each). While 15% of patients in the control group developed delirium, no patient in the intervention group developed delirium (x2 =6.486, p = 0.026). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a delirium prevention care protocol may reduce the incidence of delirium and improve sleep quality. RELEVANCE TO PRACTICE: The study highlighted that nurses can contribute to preventing patients' delirium using nonpharmacologic and independent nursing interventions.
