18537540|t|Structure-function implications in Alzheimer's disease: effect of Abeta oligomers at central synapses.
18537540|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the growing population of elderly people. A characteristic of AD is the accumulation of plaques in the brain of AD patients, and theses plaques mainly consist of aggregates of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). All converging lines of evidence suggest that progressive accumulation of the Abeta plays a central role in the genesis of Alzheimer's disease and it was long understood that Abeta had to be assembled into extracellular amyloid fibrils to exert its cytotoxic effects. This process could be modulated by molecular chaperones which inhibit or accelerate the amyloid formation. The enzyme Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) induces Abeta fibrils formation, forming a stable complex highly neurotoxic. On the other hand, laminin inhibit the Abeta fibrils formation and depolymerizate Abeta fibrils also. Over the past decade, data have emerged from the use of several sources of Abeta (synthetic, cell culture, transgenic mice and human brain) to suggest that intermediate species called Abeta oligomers are also injurious. Accumulating evidence suggests that soluble forms of Abeta are indeed the proximate effectors of synapse loss and neuronal injury. On the other hand, the member of the Wnt signaling pathway, beta-catenin was markedly reduced in AD patients carrying autosomal dominant PS-1. Also, neurons incubated with Abeta revealed a significant dose-dependent decrease in the levels of cytosolic beta-catenin an effect which was reversed in cells co-incubated with increasing concentrations of lithium, an activator of Wnt signaling pathway. Wnt signaling blocks the behavioural impairments induced by hippocampal injection of Abeta, therefore the activation of Wnt signaling protects against the Abeta neurotoxicity. Here we review recent progress about Abeta structure and function, from the formation of amyloid fibrils and some molecular chaperones which modulate the amyloidogenesic process to synaptic damage induce by Abeta oligomers.
