MATERIAL AND METHODS: A single-centre retrospective study comparing patients older and younger than age 85 on outcome. RESULTS: 190 patients underwent TAVR: 136 were aged 85 or younger (U85), 54 were older than 85 (O85). The U85 group had more men (U85: 71 [52.2%] vs O85: 19 [35.2%]; p = 0.034), a higher incidence of diabetes (U85: 36 [26.5%] vs O85: 3 [5.6%]; p = 0.001) and atrial fibrillation (U85: 35 [25.7%] vs O85: 5 [9.3%]; p = 0.03) and a higher body mass index (U85: 27.5 [+- 5.24] vs O85: 26 [+- 3.78]; p = 0.027). In the O85 group there was a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (O85: 50.28 [+- 15.32] ml/min vs U85: 65.25 [+- 29.97] ml/min; p = 0.012). There was no difference in 30-day mortality (U85: 6 [4.4%] vs O85: 3 [5.6%]) and 1-year mortality (U85 9 [6.6%] vs O85 3 [5.6%]) (p = 0.521). There was an equal amount of new onset permanent left bundle branch block (U85: 38 [27.9%] vs O85: 14 [25.9%]; p = 0.896) and permanent pacemaker implantation (U85: 28 [20.6%] vs O85: 28 [20.6%]; p = 0.748). There was no difference in bleeding events (p = 0.469), vascular complications (p = 0.195) or moderate/severe regurgitation (p = 0.972). The U85 group had a slightly longer admission duration (U85 6.29 [+- 5.289] days vs O85 5.98 [+- 3.328] days (p = 0.037)). CONCLUSION: TAVR in patients over 85 years of age has excellent outcome, comparable to those aged 85 and younger.
