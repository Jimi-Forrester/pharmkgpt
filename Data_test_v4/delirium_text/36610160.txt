36610160|a|BACKGROUND: Neurofibrillary tangles comprising hyperphosphorylated tau are vital factors associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The elimination or reduction of hyperphosphorylated and abnormally aggregated tau is a valuable measure in AD therapy. Esculentoside A (EsA), isolated from Phytolacca esculenta, exhibits pharmacotherapeutic efficacy in mice with amyloid beta-induced AD. However, whether EsA affects tau pathology and its specific mechanism of action in AD mice remains unclear. PURPOSE: To investigate the roles and mechanisms of EsA in cognitive decline and tau pathology in a triple transgenic AD (3 x Tg-AD) mouse model. METHODS: EsA (5 and 10 mg/kg) was administered via intraperitoneal injection to 8-month-old AD mice for eight consecutive weeks. Y-maze and novel object recognition tasks were used to evaluate the cognitive abilities of mice. Potential signaling pathways and targets in EsA-treated AD mice were assessed using quantitative proteomic analysis. The NFT levels and hippocampal synapse numbers were investigated using Gallyas-Braak silver staining and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. Western blotting and immunofluorescence assays were used to measure the expression of tau-associated proteins. RESULTS: EsA administration attenuated memory and recognition deficits and synaptic damage in AD mice. Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation proteomic analysis of the mouse hippocampus revealed that EsA modulated the expression of some critical proteins, including brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 3, galectin-1, and Ras-related protein 24, whose biological roles are relevant to synaptic function and autophagy. Further research revealed that EsA upregulated AKT/GSK3beta activity, in turn, inhibited tau hyperphosphorylation and promoted autophagy to clear abnormally phosphorylated tau. In hippocampus-derived primary neurons, inhibiting AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity through dorsomorphin could eliminate the effect of EsA, as revealed by increased tau hyperphosphorylation, downregulated activity AKT/GSK3beta, and blocked autophagy. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that EsA attenuates cognitive decline by targeting the pathways of both tau hyperphosphorylation and autophagic clearance in an AMPK-dependent manner and it shows a high reference value in AD pharmacotherapy research.
