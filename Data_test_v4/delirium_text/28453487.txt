28453487|a|We examined whether neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) interact with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (amyloid-beta42 [Abeta42], tau, phosphorylated tau181 [ptau181], tau/Abeta42, and ptau181/Abeta42) of Alzheimer's disease pathology to predict driving decline among cognitively-normal older adults (N = 116) aged >=65. Cox proportional hazards models examined time to receiving a rating of marginal or fail on the driving test. Age, education, and gender were adjusted in the models. Participants with more abnormal CSF (Abeta42, tau/Abeta42, ptau181/Abeta42) and NPS were faster to receive a marginal/fail on the road test compared to those without NPS. NPS interact with abnormal CSF biomarkers to impact driving performance among cognitively-normal older adults.
