37964308|a|OBJECTIVE: We designed a simplified total arch reconstruction (s-TAR) technique which could be performed under mild hypothermia (30-32  C) with distal aortic perfusion. This study aimed to compare its efficacy of organ protection with the conventional total arch reconstruction (c-TAR). METHODS: We reviewed the clinical data of 195 patients who had ascending aortic aneurysm with extended aortic arch dilation and underwent simultaneous ascending aorta replacement and TAR procedure between January 2018 and December 2022 in our center. 105 received c-TAR under moderate hypothermia (25-28  C) with circulatory arrest (c-TAR group); rest 90 received s-TAR under mild hypothermia (30-32  C) with distal aortic perfusion (s-TAR group). RESULTS: The s-TAR group demonstrated shorter CPB time, cross-clamp time and lower body circulatory arrest time compared with the c-TAR group. The 30-day mortality was 2.9% for the c-TAR group and 1.1% for the s-TAR group (P = 0.043). The mean duration of mechanical ventilation was shorter in the s-TAR group. Paraplegia was observed in 4 of 105 patients (3.8%) in the c-TAR group, while no such events were observed in the s-TAR group. The incidence of temporary neurologic dysfunction was significantly higher in the c-TAR group. The incidence of permanent neurologic dysfunction also showed a tendency to be higher in the c-TAR group, without statistical significance. Furthermore, the incidence of reoperation for bleeding were significantly lower in the s-TAR group. The rate of postoperative hepatic dysfunction and all grades of AKI was remarkably lower in the s-TAR group. The 3-year survival rate was 95.6% in the s-TAR group and 91.4% in the c-TAR group. CONCLUSIONS: s-TAR under mild hypothermia (30-32C) with distal aortic perfusion is associated with lower mortality and morbidity, offering better neurological and visceral organ protection compared with c-TAR.
