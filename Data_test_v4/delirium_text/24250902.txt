24250902|t|Evaluation of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in migraine.
24250902|a|BACKGROUND: Headache is one of the most disturbing symptoms with common neurological signs. Variations in optic nerve perfusion quality or retinal microcirculation may end up in ganglion cell damage in patients with migraine. METHODS: Sixty patients diagnosed with migraine and thirty normal individuals were evaluated in groups including migraine with aura, migraine without aura and controls. Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was measured using stratus optical coherence tomography (OCT ) and then was compared in case and control groups. RESULTS: RNFL thickness was only significantly thinner in nasal quadrant in migraineurs compared to the control group. Other parameters showed no difference between the two groups and besides there was no statistically difference between the two migraine subgroups. CONCLUSION: Given the significant difference in nasal quadrant RNFL thickness between the migraineurs and normal individuals, we might be able to defend the retinal blood flow decrease theory in migraine; however, multicentre studies with larger samples seem mandatory.
