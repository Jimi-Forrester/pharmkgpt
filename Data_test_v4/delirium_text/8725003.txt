8725003|t|Gene expression of ND4, a subunit of complex I of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, is decreased in temporal cortex of brains of Alzheimer's disease patients.
8725003|a|Gene expression of mitochondrial DNA-encoded ND4 in brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and age-matched controls was measured using Northern blot. The level of ND4 message in temporal cortex of control subjects was higher than in motor cortex, whereas the level of ND4 gene expression in temporal cortex of AD brains was decreased compared with that in temporal cortex of controls. A control probe showed no difference in expression between the two areas of AD and control brains. These and previous data suggest that neurons vulnerable to AD express higher levels of enzymes of oxidative phosphorylation than do spared neurons, and that this difference may promote selective neuronal vulnerability of AD.
