37605911|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore lumbar plexus nerve block combined with general anesthesia in elderly patients undergoing hip operation could improve analgesia effect, reduce consumption of analgesics, prevent inflammatory reaction, and avoid postoperative delirium(POD). METHODS: Totally 200 elderly patients underwent hip fracture surgery from February 2020 to September 2021 were selected and were divided into observation group and control group according to different anesthesia methods. There were 97 patients in observation group including 66 males and 33 females; aged (70.23+-6.60) years old;body mass index (BMI) was (23.13+-1.94) kg m-2;19 patients with hemi arthroplasty, 46 patients with total hip arthroplasty, and 32 patients with femur intertrochanteric fixation;treated with lumbar plexus block combined with general anesthesia. There were 94 patients in control group, including 66 males and 33 females;aged (68.80+-6.24) years old;BMI was (22.88+-1.85) kg m-2;14 patients with hemi arthroplasty, 39 patients with total hip arthroplasty, and 41 patients with femur intertrochanteric fixation;treated with only general anesthesia. Nine patients were separated due to the change of surgical protocol or chronic disease. The incidence of POD at 1, 2 and 3 days after surgery, mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score, visual analogue scale (VAS) in resting state, serum inflammatory factors levels [such as C-reactive protein(CRP), interleukin-1beta(IL-1beta), interleukin-6(IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha)] at 1 d before operation, 1 and 6 h after surgery, consumption of sufentanil between two groups were compared. RESULTS: The incidences of POD in observation group were lower than control group at 1, 2 and 3 days of operation (P<0.05), MMSE score in observation group was higher than that of control group (P<0.05), VAS in observation group was lower than that of control group (P<0.01). The incidences of POD decreased and MMSE score were increaed in both groups day by day (P<0.01). The levels of CRP, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in observation group were lower than that of control group at 1 h after operation (P<0.01). The levels of CRP, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in observation group were lower than that of control group at 6 h after operation (P<0.01), while no statisitical difference in IL-1beta between two groups(P>0.05). The consumption of sufentanil in observation group was lower than that of control group (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Compared with general anesthesia, lumbar plexus nerve block combined with general anesthesia for the operations of hip fracture in elderly patients has better analgesic effect, has advantages of slight inflammatory reaction, and could decrease consumption of opioid and incidence of POD.
