32630550|t|Nicotinamide Supplementation during the In Vitro Maturation of Oocytes Improves the Developmental Competence of Preimplantation Embryos: Potential Link to SIRT1/AKT Signaling.
32630550|a|Nicotinamide (NAM), the amide form of vitamin B3, plays pivotal roles in regulating various cellular processes including energy production and maintenance of genomic stability. The current study aimed at deciphering the effect of NAM, when administered during in vitro maturation (IVM), on the developmental competence of bovine preimplantation embryos. Our results showed that low NAM concentrations reduced the oxidative stress and improved mitochondrial profile, total cleavage and 8-16 cell stage embryo development whereas the opposite profile was observed upon exposure to high NAM concentrations (10 mM onward). Remarkably, the hatching rates of day-7 and day-8 blastocysts were significantly improved under 0.1 mM NAM treatment. Using RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence, the autophagy-related (Beclin-1 (BECN1), LC3B, and ATG5) and the apoptotic (Caspases; CASP3 and 9) markers were upregulated in oocytes exposed to high NAM concentration (40 mM), whereas only CASP3 was affected, downregulated, following 0.1 mM treatment. Additionally, the number of cells per blastocyst and the levels of SIRT1, PI3K, AKT, and mTOR were higher, while the inner cell mass-specific transcription factors GATA6, SOX2, and OCT4 were more abundant, in day-8 embryos of NAM-treated group. Taken together, to our knowledge, this is the first study reporting that administration of low NAM concentrations during IVM can ameliorate the developmental competence of embryos through the potential regulation of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and SIRT1/AKT signaling.
