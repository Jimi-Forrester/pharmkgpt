34219947|a|Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is defined by chronic widespread pain persisting for more than 3 months without an apparent physical cause. The prevalence of FMS peaks between 50 and 70 years old, and it can be difficult to diagnose and treat due to other comorbid conditions. Recent work has suggested that neurodegenerative conditions can be complicated by chronic pain. This case study presents four patients with FMS residing in nursing homes. In all four cases, with the progression of Alzheimer's disease, patients saw improvements in pain syndromes, albeit to different degrees, and marked improvements in mobility. All four patients also developed challenging behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia requiring psychotropic prescriptions.
