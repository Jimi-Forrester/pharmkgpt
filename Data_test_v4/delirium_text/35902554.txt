35902554|a|Depressed individuals are twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) as compared to controls. Brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition is believed to have a major role in AD pathogenesis but studies also suggest associations of Abeta dynamics and depression. The aim of this study was to test if plasma Abeta levels are longitudinally associated to late-life depression. We measured plasma levels of amyloid-beta1-40 (Abeta40) and amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta42) peptides longitudinally for three consecutive years in 48 cognitively intact elderly subjects with late-life major depressive disorder (LLMD) and 45 age-matched cognitively healthy controls. We found that the Abeta42/Abeta40 plasma ratio was significantly and steadily lower in depressed subjects compared to controls (p < 0.001). At screening, Abeta42/Abeta40 plasma did not correlate with depression severity (as measured with Hamilton Depression Scale) or cognitive performance (as measured with Mini-Mental State Examination) but was associated to depression severity at 3 years after adjustment for age, education, cognitive performance, and antidepressants use. This study showed that reduced plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio is consistently associated with LLMD diagnosis and that increased severity of depression at baseline predicted low Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio at 3 years. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings and examine if the consistently lower plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio in LLMD reflects increased brain amyloid deposition, as observed in AD subjects, and an increased risk for progressive cognitive decline and AD.
