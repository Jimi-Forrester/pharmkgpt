14557949|a|INTRODUCTION: The <<7- Minute Screen>> is a neurocognitive screening test for the detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients in primary care settings. It consists of 4 brief subtests (orientation, memory, visuoconstruction and verbal fluency) and provides a broader neuropsychological profile than other widely used screening tests, The aim of the present study was to study the usefulness of this screening test for the detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). METHODS: Thirty-two patients with probable AD (NINCDS-ADRDA criteria), 25 patients with MCI, and 35 healthy control subjects, matched for age and education, underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and the Rio-de-la-Plata version of the 7-Minute Screen. RESULTS. This test showed 93 % sensitivity and 97% specificity in detecting mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease MMSE<24), but it exhibited a substantially decreased sensitivity (28 %) in its ability to detect MCI in AD (MMSE >2 4 ). CONCLUSION: The screening batteries do not replace a m o re compre h e n s i ve neuro psychological assessment. Th ey are useful in detecting patients with mild dementia, but caution must be the rule when considering a diagnosis of MCI.
