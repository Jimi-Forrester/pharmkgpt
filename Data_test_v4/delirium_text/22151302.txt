22151302|a|BACKGROUND: delta-Catenin (CTNND2), which encodes a scaffold protein in humans, has been found in a few malignancies. However, the expression pattern and contribution of delta-catenin to astrocytoma progression are unclear. METHODS: We investigated delta-catenin expression in human astrocytoma samples and its function in astrocytoma cell lines using immunohistochemistry, siRNA knockdown, transfection, MTT, transwell migration and Rac1 pulldown techniques. RESULTS: delta-Catenin protein expression was detected in cytoplasm of astrocytoma cells by immunohistochemistry. Analysis showed that grade I astrocytoma (0%, 0/11) and glial cells from normal brain tissue exhibited negative staining. delta-Catenin expression was significantly higher in grade III-IV (35%, 29/84) compared to grade II astrocytoma cells (18%, 11/61); p < 0.01). In addition, CTNND2 overexpression promoted proliferation, invasion and Rac1 activity of U251 astrocytoma cells. Treatment of delta-catenin-transfected cells with a Rac1 inhibitor decreased Rac1 activity and invasion. delta-Catenin knockdown in U87 glioblastoma cell decreased cell proliferation, invasion and Rac1 activity. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that delta-catenin expression is associated with the malignant progression of astrocytoma and promotes astrocytoma cell invasion through upregulation of Rac1 activity. delta-Catenin expression levels may serve as a useful marker of the biological behavior of astrocytoma cells.
