38654881|t|Postoperative urinary retention (POUR): A narrative review.
38654881|a|Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) is defined as the inability to void in the presence of a full bladder after surgery. Complications include delirium, pain, prolonged hospitalization, and long-term altered bladder contractility. Comorbidities, type of surgery and anesthesia influence the development of POUR. The incidence varies between 5% and 70%. History and clinical examination, the need for bladder catheterization and ultrasonographic evaluation are three methods used to diagnose POUR. The prevention of POUR currently involves identifying patients with pre-operative risk factors and then modifying them where possible. Bladder catheterization is the standard treatment of POUR, however, further studies are necessary to establish patients who need a bladder catheter, bladder volume thresholds and duration of catheterization.
