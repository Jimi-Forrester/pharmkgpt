34472015|a|INTRODUCTION: While surgery is the primary treatment choice for intracranial meningiomas in young patients, surgery in elderly patients, especially those with pre-existing comorbidities, has been the subject of repeated discussion. This study investigated the postoperative risks and neurological benefits of meningioma surgery in elderly patients compared to young patients. METHODS: In total, 768 patients were included and divided into two main groups: group I (age: <= 64 years; 484 young patients) and group II (age: >= 65 years; 284 elderly patients). Group II was subdivided into: IIa (age: 65-69 years), IIb (age: 70-79 years); and IIc (age: >= 80 years). RESULTS: The total tumor resection rate was higher in the elderly cohort than in the young cohort (84.5 and 76.2%, respectively). 154 young patients (31.8%) and 132 elderly patients (46.5%) developed postoperative morbidities, with the three most common being bleeding (12.9%), cranial nerve disorder (10%) and CSF fistula (8.1%). Postoperative bleeding, palsy, speech disorder, pneumonia and renal insufficiency were dependent on age (r = 0.123, p = 0.001; r = 0.089, p = 0.014; r = 0.100, p = 0.006; r = 0.098, p = 0.007 and r = 0.084, p = 0.020) and presented more often in elderly patients. 6 young and 15 elderly patients died during the 17.4-year observation period. Most patients showed a significant improvement in postoperative KPS (p < 0.001), except those over 80 years old (p = 0.753). The KPS at the last follow-up was significantly improved in all patients (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Meningioma surgery is associated with a higher rate of postoperative complications in elderly patients than in young patients. Most elderly patients, similar to young patients, show a significant improvement in neurological status postoperatively.
