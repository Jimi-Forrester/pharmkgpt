38256128|a|Aberrant protein post-translational modification is a hallmark of malignant tumors. Lysine succinylation (Ksucc) plays a vital role in cell energy metabolism in various cancers. However, whether succinylation can be catalyzed by acetyltransferase p300 remains unclear. In this study, we unveiled that p300 is a "writer" for succinylation, and p300-mediated Ksucc promotes cell glycometabolism in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Specifically, our succinylome data revealed that EP300 deficiency leads to the systemic reduction of Ksucc, and 79.55% of the p300-succinylated proteins were found in the cytoplasm, which were primarily enriched in the carbohydrate metabolism process. Interestingly, deleting EP300 led to a notable decrease in Ksucc levels on several glycolytic enzymes, especially Phosphoglycerate Kinase 1 (PGK1). Mutation of the succinylated site of PGK1 notably hindered cell glycolysis and lactic acid excretion. Metabolomics in vivo indicated that p300-caused metabolic reprogramming was mainly attributed to the altered carbohydrate metabolism. In addition, 89.35% of LUAD patients exhibited cytoplasmic localization of p300, with higher levels in tumor tissues than adjacent normal tissues. High levels of p300 correlated with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis of LUAD patients. Briefly, we disclose the activity of p300 to catalyze succinylation, which contributes to cell glucose metabolic reprogramming and malignant progression of lung cancer.
