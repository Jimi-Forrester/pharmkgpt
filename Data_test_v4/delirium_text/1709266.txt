1709266|t|Cholinergic neuronal loss in the globus pallidus of Alzheimer disease patients.
1709266|a|Cholinergic neurons of the ventral pallidum and the dorsal pallidum (globus pallidus) were immunohistochemically investigated in patients suffering from Alzheimer disease (AD). Measurement of cholinergic neurons, stained with an antiserum against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), revealed that their number was significantly reduced in both the dorsal pallidum (37.5%) and the ventral pallidum (65%) of AD patients (n = 4) when compared to control subjects (n = 3). No shrinkage of these cells was observed. The number of immunostained neuropeptide Y-containing neurons in the same structures was not different in controls and AD patients, indicating that the loss of cholinergic neurons was selective. These results combined with previous reports give further information upon which specific subsets of cholinergic neurons degenerate in AD.
