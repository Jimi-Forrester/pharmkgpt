9494306|t|A survey of competencies and concerns in end-of-life care for physician trainees.
9494306|a|A survey was developed to explore physician trainee competencies and concerns surrounding end-of-life care. Thirty-one medical students, interns, and residents from the Department of Internal Medicine completed the survey in August 1996. The survey instrument found differing levels of competence/concern among medical students, interns, and residents. Self-reported competence increased with level of training. All trainees indicated the least comfort around discussions of hydration and feeding withdrawal. Both residents and interns indicated concern about potential illegality, breach of ethics or potential malpractice when reviewing eight currently legal and ethical end-of-life scenarios involving pain management or treatment withdrawal. Pain management, ethical issues, and delirium were the top three topics for which residents indicated an interest in future educational sessions. Results from the survey will be used to guide the development of educational initiatives that address trainee concerns. The competence/concern survey adds an important dimension to understanding how best to incorporate end-of-life education into residency training programs.
