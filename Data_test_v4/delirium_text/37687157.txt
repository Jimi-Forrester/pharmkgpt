37687157|t|Marine Plasmalogens: A Gift from the Sea with Benefits for Age-Associated Diseases.
37687157|a|Aging increases oxidative and inflammatory stress caused by a reduction in metabolism and clearance, thus leading to the development of age-associated diseases. The quality of our daily diet and exercise is important for the prevention of these diseases. Marine resources contain various valuable nutrients, and unique glycerophospholipid plasmalogens are found abundantly in some marine invertebrates, including ascidians. One of the major classes, the ethanolamine class (PlsEtn), exists in a high ratio to phospholipids in the brain and blood, while decreased levels have been reported in patients with age-associated diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Animal studies have shown that the administration of marine PlsEtn prepared from marine invertebrates improved PlsEtn levels in the body and alleviated inflammation. Animal and human studies have reported that marine PlsEtn ameliorates cognitive impairment. In this review, we highlight the biological significance, relationships with age-associated diseases, food functions, and healthcare materials of plasmalogens based on recent knowledge and discuss the contribution of marine plasmalogens to health maintenance in aging.
