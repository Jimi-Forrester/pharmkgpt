34923775|t|Altered executive control network connectivity in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.
34923775|a|OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine whether the static functional connectivity (FC) of the executive control network (ECN) and the temporal properties of dynamic FC states in the ECN can characterize the underlying nature of anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate (anti-NMDA) receptor encephalitis and their correlations with cognitive functions. METHODS: In total, 21 patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis past the acute stage and 23 healthy controls (HCs) underwent a set of neuropsychological tests and participated in a resting-state fMRI study to analyse the static FC of the ECN and the temporal properties of dynamic FC states in the ECN. In addition, correlation analyses were performed to determine the correlations between the FC metrics and cognitive performance. RESULTS: Patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis past the acute stage showed significant cognitive impairments compared to HCs. In accord with the results of neuropsychological tests, static intrinsic FC alterations and changed dynamic FC metrics of ECN were observed in the patients. Importantly, we observed significant correlations between altered ECN metrics and working memory, information processing speed, executive function performance in the patients. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that cognitive impairments in patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis past the acute stage are likely related to altered static and dynamic ECN connectivity. These observations may enhance our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive function in this population.
