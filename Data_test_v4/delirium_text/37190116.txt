37190116|t|The Functions and Phenotypes of Microglia in Alzheimer's Disease.
37190116|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide, but therapeutic strategies to slow down AD pathology and symptoms have not yet been successful. While attention has been focused on neurodegeneration in AD pathogenesis, recent decades have provided evidence of the importance of microglia, and resident immune cells in the central nervous system. In addition, new technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing, have revealed heterogeneous cell states of microglia in AD. In this review, we systematically summarize the microglial response to amyloid-beta and tau tangles, and the risk factor genes expressed in microglia. Furthermore, we discuss the characteristics of protective microglia that appear during AD pathology and the relationship between AD and microglia-induced inflammation during chronic pain. Understanding the diverse roles of microglia will help identify new therapeutic strategies for AD.
