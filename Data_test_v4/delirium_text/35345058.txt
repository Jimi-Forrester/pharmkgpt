35345058|a|BACKGROUND: To conduct a comprehensive comparison of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in Chinese people with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and analyse the factors of differences. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 93 EOAD and100 LOAD and their caregivers in China from November 2018 to May 2019. RESULTS: The total Neuropsychiatric Inventory score was significantly higher in LOAD. A higher level of agitation in EOAD was related to a lower quality of life of caregivers and the emotional expression of ignoring people with dementia. Higher euphoria scores in LOAD were associated with reduced negative coping by caregivers and reduced stability and predictability at home. CONCLUSION: The early identification and management of specific BPSD of EOAD and LOAD by family members and health professionals may improve the quality of care and life for people with dementia and that of caregivers.
