Due to the increase in life expectancy and to the ageing of the population, Alzheimer's has recently become an area of research of interest. The eating behaviour and nutrition of elderly people has some special characteristics which become particularly relevant during illness. An Alzheimer's patient suffers a progressive decay in their functional and physical abilities, and these renders them at high nutritional risk. Prevention, rapid intervention and ensuring an adequate nutritional intake is essential in each of the dementia stages. This paper reviews the most important nutrients influencing the development or worsening of dementia and the guidelines for food intake throughout the disease.
