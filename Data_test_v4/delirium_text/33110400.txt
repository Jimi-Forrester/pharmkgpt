33110400|t|Use of Processed Electroencephalography in the Clinical Setting.
33110400|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Processed electroencephalography (pEEG) is widely used in clinical practice. Few clinicians utilize the full potential of these devices. This brief review will address the improvements in patient management available from the utilization of all pEEG data. RECENT FINDINGS: Anesthesiologists easily learn to recognize raw pEEG patterns that are consistent with an appropriate level of hypnotic effect. Power distribution within the waveform can be displayed in a visual format that identifies signatures of the principal anesthetic hypnotics. Opinion on the benefit of pEEG data in the mitigation of postoperative neurological impairment remains divided. SUMMARY: Looking beyond the index number can aid clinical decision making and improve confidence in the benefits of this monitoring modality.
