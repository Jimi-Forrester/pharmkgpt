27687177|t|Safety of simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty using an extramedullary referencing system: results from 2098 consecutive patients.
27687177|a|INTRODUCTION: Simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been associated with a high risk of morbidity and mortality. The orthopedic surgeon must, therefore, decide whether bilateral simultaneous TKA is a safe operation to perform and endeavor to decrease the risk of serious complications or even death. METHODS: This retrospective review included 2098 consecutive patients who underwent bilateral simultaneous TKAs by the protocol used in our institution, including the use of extramedullary instruments to minimize medullary canal invasion and overlapping procedures for both knees to decrease operation time. RESULTS: The incidence rate of occurred complications was 0.33 % for symptomatic pulmonary embolism, 0.62 % for deep surgical infection requiring revision surgery, 0.05 % for 14-day mortality, 1.14 % for adverse cardiac events, and 0.76 % for postsurgical delirium within the 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our protocols, including the use of an extramedullary referencing system and overlapping procedures for both knees, may be considered to decrease the perioperative short-term morbidity and 14-day mortality rates in simultaneous bilateral TKA.
