37503333|a|Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease closely related to aging. Nevertheless, the role and mechanisms of aging in osteoarthritis remain unclear. This study aims to identify potential aging-related biomarkers in OA and to explore the role and mechanisms of aging-related genes and the immune microenvironment in OA synovial tissue. Methods: Normal and OA synovial gene expression profile microarrays were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and aging-related genes (ARGs) from the Human Aging Genomic Resources database (HAGR). Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Disease Ontology (DO), and Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) enrichment analysis were used to uncover the underlying mechanisms. To identify Hub ARDEGs with highly correlated OA features (Hub OA-ARDEGs), Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and machine learning methods were used. Furthermore, we created diagnostic nomograms and receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) to assess Hub OA-ARDEGs' ability to diagnose OA and predict which miRNAs and TFs they might act on. The Single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm was applied to look at the immune infiltration characteristics of OA and their relationship with Hub OA-ARDEGs. Results: We discovered 87 ARDEGs in normal and OA synovium samples. According to functional enrichment, ARDEGs are primarily associated with inflammatory regulation, cellular stress response, cell cycle regulation, and transcriptional regulation. Hub OA-ARDEGs with excellent OA diagnostic ability were identified as MCL1, SIK1, JUND, NFKBIA, and JUN. Wilcox test showed that Hub OA-ARDEGs were all significantly downregulated in OA and were validated in the validation set and by qRT-PCR. Using the ssGSEA algorithm, we discovered that 15 types of immune cell infiltration and six types of immune cell activation were significantly increased in OA synovial samples and well correlated with Hub OA-ARDEGs. Conclusion: Synovial aging may promote the progression of OA by inducing immune inflammation. MCL1, SIK1, JUND, NFKBIA, and JUN can be used as novel diagnostic biomolecular markers and potential therapeutic targets for OA.
