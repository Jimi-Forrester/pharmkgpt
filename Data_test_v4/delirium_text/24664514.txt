24664514|a|Understanding and manipulating amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation provide key knowledge and means for the diagnosis and cure of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the applications of Abeta-based aggregation systems. Here, we studied the formation of various Abeta aggregate structures with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and brain total lipid extract-based supported lipid bilayer (brain SLB). The roles of AuNPs and brain SLB in forming Abeta aggregates were studied in real time, and the structural details of Abeta aggregates were monitored and analyzed with the dark-field imaging of plasmonic AuNPs that allows for long-term in situ imaging of Abeta aggregates with great structural details without further labeling. It was shown that the fluid brain SLB platform provides the binding sites for Abeta and drives the fast and efficient formation of Abeta aggregate structures and, importantly, large Abeta plaque structures (>15 mum in diameter), a hallmark for AD, were formed without going through fibril structures when Abeta peptides were co-incubated with AuNPs on the brain SLB. The dark-field scattering and circular dichroism-correlation data suggest that AuNPs were heavily involved with Abeta aggregation on the brain SLB and less alpha-helix, less beta-sheet and more random coil structures were found in large plaque-like Abeta aggregates.
