39256076|t|The Year in Cardiothoracic Transplant Anesthesia: Selected Highlights From 2022 Part I: Lung Transplantation.
39256076|a|These highlights focus on the research in lung transplantation (LTX) that was published in 2022 and includes the assessment and optimization of candidates for LTX, donor optimization, the use of organs from donation after circulatory death, and outcomes when using marginal or novel donors; recipient factors affecting LTX, including age, disease, the use of extracorporeal life support; and special situations, such as coronavirus disease2019, pediatric LTX, and retransplantation. The remainder of the article focuses on the perioperative management of LTX, including the perioperative risk factors for acute renal failure (acute kidney injury); the incidence and management of phrenic nerve injury, delirium, and pain; and the postoperative management of hyperammonemia, early postoperative infections, and the use of donor-derived cell-free DNA to detect rejection.
