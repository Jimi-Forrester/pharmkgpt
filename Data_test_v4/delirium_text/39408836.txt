39408836|t|CAR-T-Cell Therapy for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: A Comprehensive Overview.
39408836|a|Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disorder characterized by the production of autoreactive B and T cells and cytokines, leading to chronic inflammation affecting multiple organs. SLE is associated with significant complications that substantially increase morbidity and mortality. Given its complex pathogenesis, conventional treatments for SLE often have significant side effects and limited efficacy, necessitating the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies. One promising approach is the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy, which has shown remarkable success in treating refractory hematological malignancies. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the current use of CAR-T-cell therapy in SLE.
