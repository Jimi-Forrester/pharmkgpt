27223596|t|Schizophrenia as a mimic of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia.
27223596|a|Recently, the diagnostic criteria for the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia were revised. Although these criteria offer a relatively high sensitivity, their specificity is yet unknown. We describe a 54-year-old woman fulfilling criteria for both late-onset schizophrenia and probable behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia. Following an initial presentation with psychosis, she developed progressive apathy, compulsiveness, and executive dysfunction. Moreover, bilateral frontotemporal hypometabolism was seen on [(18)F]fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. A post-mortem diagnosis of schizophrenia was established, given the clinical picture combined with the pathological exclusion of a neurodegenerative cause. Our case suggests that patients with other brain disorders may meet the current diagnostic criteria for probable frontotemporal dementia. Further clinicopathological validation of these criteria is needed to determine their exact specificity.
