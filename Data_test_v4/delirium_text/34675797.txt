34675797|t|Convergent Functional Changes of Default Mode Network in Mild Cognitive Impairment Using Activation Likelihood Estimation.
34675797|a|Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a transitional state between normal aging and dementia disorders, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD). The disruption of the default mode network (DMN) is often considered to be a potential biomarker for the progression from MCI to AD. The purpose of this study was to assess MRI-specific changes of DMN in MCI patients by elucidating the convergence of brain regions with abnormal DMN function. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Ovid, and Web of science for relevant articles. We identified neuroimaging studies by using amplitude of low frequency fluctuation /fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF/fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and functional connectivity (FC) in MCI patients. Based on the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm, we carried out connectivity modeling of coordination-based meta-analysis and functional meta-analysis. Results: In total, this meta-analysis includes 39 articles on functional neuroimaging studies. Using computer software analysis, we discovered that DMN changes in patients with MCI mainly occur in bilateral inferior frontal lobe, right medial frontal lobe, left inferior parietal lobe, bilateral precuneus, bilateral temporal lobe, and parahippocampal gyrus (PHG). Conclusions: Herein, we confirmed the presence of DMN-specific damage in MCI, which is helpful in revealing pathology of MCI and further explore mechanisms of conversion from MCI to AD. Therefore, we provide a new specific target and direction for delaying conversion from MCI to AD.
