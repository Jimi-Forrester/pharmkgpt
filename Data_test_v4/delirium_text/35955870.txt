35955870|t|diaPASEF Proteomics and Feature Selection for the Description of Sputum Proteome Profiles in a Cohort of Different Subtypes of Lung Cancer Patients and Controls.
35955870|a|The high mortality, the presence of an initial asymptomatic stage and the fact that diagnosis in early stages reduces mortality justify the implementation of screening programs in the populations at risk of lung cancer. It is imperative to develop less aggressive methods that can complement existing diagnosis technologies. In this study, we aimed to identify lung cancer protein biomarkers and pathways affected in sputum samples, using the recently developed diaPASEF mass spectrometry (MS) acquisition mode. The sputum proteome of lung cancer cases and controls was analyzed through nano-HPLC-MS using the diaPASEF mode. For functional analysis, the results from differential expression analysis were further analyzed in the STRING platform, and feature selection was performed using sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA). Our results showed an activation of inflammation, with an alteration of pathways and processes related to acute-phase, complement, and immune responses. The resulting sPLS-DA model separated between case and control groups with high levels of sensitivity and specificity. In conclusion, we showed how new-generation proteomics can be used to detect potential biomarkers in sputum samples, and ultimately to discriminate patients from controls and even to help to differentiate between different cancer subtypes.
