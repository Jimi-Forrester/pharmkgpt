39769270|t|Circadian Effects of Melatonin Receptor-Targeting Molecules In Vitro.
39769270|a|Circadian rhythms are important for maintaining homeostasis, from regulating physiological activities (e.g., sleep-wake cycle and cognitive performance) to cellular processes (e.g., cell cycle and DNA damage repair). Melatonin is a key regulator of circadian rhythms and exerts control by binding to melatonin receptor 1 (MT1), decreasing neuronal firing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Previous work studying effects of melatonin on circadian rhythms utilized in vivo models. Since MT1 is also expressed outside of the brain, it is important to study impacts of melatonin on circadian gene oscillations in vitro. We evaluated the effects of melatonin and an MT1 inverse agonist, UCSF7447, in U2OS circadian reporter cell lines, which facilitate detailed assessments of oscillatory changes. We report that cellular circadian rhythms are responsive to treatment with MT1-targeting molecules; their activities are not dependent upon the SCN. Corroborating in vivo data, both melatonin and UCSF7447 lengthened the periods of BMAL1 and PER2, and while melatonin delayed circadian phases, UCSF7447 advanced them. Compounds were also dosed at two different times, however this did not yield changes. Our findings indicate the importance of utilizing in vitro models and that the direct effects of melatonin likely go beyond the SCN and should be explored further.
