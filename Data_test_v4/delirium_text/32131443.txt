32131443|a|We designed and synthesized 1-pyrimidinyl-2-aryl-4, 6-dihydropyrrolo [3,4-d] imidazole-5(1H)-carboxamide derivatives as selective inhibitors of c-Jun-N-terminal Kinase 3 (JNK3), a target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Based on the compounds found in previous studies, a novel scaffold was designed to improve pharmacokinetic characters and activity, and compound 18a, (R)-1-(2-((1-(cyclopropanecarbonyl)pyrrolidin-3-yl)amino)pyrimidin-4-yl)-2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-4,6-dihydro pyrrolo [3,4-d]imidazole-5(1H)-carboxamide, showed the highest IC50 value of 2.69 nM. Kinase profiling results also showed high selectivity for JNK3 among 38 kinases, having mild activity against JNK2, RIPK3, and GSK3beta, which also known to involve in neuronal apoptosis.
