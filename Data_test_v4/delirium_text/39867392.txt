39867392|t|Tau Burden is Best Captured by Magnitude and Extent: Tau-MaX as a Measure of Global Tau.
39867392|a|Tau exhibits change in both spatial extent and density of pathology along the Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum with each aspect contributing to the overall burden of pathological tau. Nevertheless, studies using Tau PET have measured either magnitude using standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) or extent using number of Tau+ regions. We hypothesized that combining these two dimensions into a single measure of Magnitude and eXtent, Tau-MaX, would provide improved quantification of global tau burden as well as allowing for a region-agnostic measure of global tau burden that does not require a pre-specified region of interest (ROI) or meta-ROI. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed 18 F-flortaucipir PET scans from local and national consortium data (n=1077 participants total) and used Gaussian-mixture models for data from 64 brain regions, to define both tau positivity and magnitude. We examined cross-sectional and longitudinal change in Tau-MaX across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum and compared the association of Tau-MaX, magnitude, and extent with plasma p-tau 217 and global cognition. We also compared Tau-MaX using a global, region-agnostic approach to temporal lobe or Braak stage meta-ROIs. Whereas separate assessments of extent and magnitude across the disease spectrum found earlier increases in Tau spatial extent and later increases in magnitude, Tau-MaX was able to dynamically capture this shift demonstrating a stronger association with extent in the preclinical stage and a stronger association with magnitude in clinical stages. Global Tau-MaX differed between disease stages cross-sectionally and changed over time in all stages of disease. Further, Tau-MaX significantly improved associations with plasma p-tau 217 and global cognition compared to magnitude or extent alone. Finally, global measures of Tau-MaX performed similarly to meta-ROI measures of Tau-MaX. Together, these findings indicate that combining magnitude and extent provides a robust measure of global tau burden that changes throughout the disease course and is associated with blood-based biomarkers and cognition. This measure may be of particular use for disease staging, as well as serving as an outcome measure to monitor response to therapeutic intervention.
