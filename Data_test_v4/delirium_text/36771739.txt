36771739|t|Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis of the Orchid Species Oncidium sotoanum Reveals the Presence of Rare Bioactive C-Diglycosylated Chrysin Derivatives.
36771739|a|Plants are valuable sources of secondary metabolites with pharmaceutical properties, but only a small proportion of plant life has been actively exploited for medicinal purposes to date. Underexplored plant species are therefore likely to contain novel bioactive compounds. In this study, we investigated the content of secondary metabolites in the flowers, leaves and pseudobulbs of the orchid Oncidium sotoanum using an untargeted metabolomics approach. We observed the strong accumulation of C-diglycosylated chrysin derivatives, which are rarely found in nature. Further characterization revealed evidence of antioxidant activity (FRAP and DPPH assays) and potential activity against neurodegenerative disorders (MAO-B inhibition assay) depending on the specific molecular structure of the metabolites. Natural product bioprospecting in underexplored plant species based on untargeted metabolomics can therefore help to identify novel chemical structures with diverse pharmaceutical properties.
