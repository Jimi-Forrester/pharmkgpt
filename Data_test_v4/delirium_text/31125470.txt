31125470|a|BACKGROUND: Perioperative anxiety is common in pediatric patients undergoing surgery. AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine whether an infusion of dexmedetomidine prior to hernia repair in children provides better postoperative anxiety outcomes that a preoperative infusion of midazolam. METHODS: Ninety 6-11-year-old children, who were scheduled to undergo elective hernia repair, were enrolled for this double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Group D (n = 45) received an intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine (0.5 mug/kg) and Group M (n = 45) received an intravenous infusion of midazolam (0.08 mg/kg) in 20 mL of normal saline for 10 minutes before the induction of anesthesia. Pre- and postoperative scores on the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale were the main outcomes. Secondary outcomes included systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and postoperative pain measured on a visual analogue scale and patient satisfaction using a numerical rating scale. RESULTS: Postoperative anxiety in Group D was significantly lower than preoperative anxiety (2 hours postoperatively mean difference [95% CI]: 2.83 [0.87-4.79], P = 0.036, 4 hours postoperatively mean difference [95% CI]: 3.29 [1.39-5.20], P = 0.005). Preoperative and postoperative anxiety in Group M was similar. Anxiety scores in Group D were also significantly lower than anxiety in Group M 2 hours (mean difference [95% CI]: 1.89 [0.52-3.26], P = 0.01) and 4 hours (mean difference [95% CI]: 3.32 [1.98-4.66], P < 0.001) postoperatively. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were lower in Group D than in Group M after administration of sedative drugs until children left PACU (SBP mean difference [95% CI]: 13.87 [10.30-17.43], P < 0.001, DBP mean difference [95% CI]: 5.96[3.80-8.11], P < 0.001, HR mean difference [95% CI]: 10.36 [7.58-13.13], P < 0.001). Pain was also significantly lower in Group D than in Group M at 2 hours (median difference [95% CI]: 1 [0.26-1.34], P = 0.004), 4 hours (median difference [95% CI]: 1 [0.31-1.02], P = 0.003), and 1 day (median difference [95% CI]: 0 [0.22-0.76], P = 0.003) postoperatively. Patient satisfaction scores were significantly higher in Group D than in Group M 1 day (median difference [95% CI]: 0 [-0.83 to -0.24], P = 0.006) and somewhat higher 1 week (median difference [95% CI]: 0 [-0.67 to -0.04], P = 0.06) postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Compared with midazolam, a single preoperative intravenous dose of dexmedetomidine appears to provide better postoperative anxiolytic effects for children undergoing same-day surgery.
