32443659|t|Relationship between Performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination Sub-Items and Activities of Daily Living in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.
32443659|a|Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) subitems provide useful information about the cognitive status of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). If the relationship between MMSE subitems and activities of daily living (ADL) can be shown, the performance of sub-items can predict ADL status and may provide useful information for early ADL intervention. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between MMSE subitem scores and ADL. The study sample consisted of 718 patients with AD. Logistic regression analysis using the Physical Self-maintenance Scale (PSMS) and Lawton's Instrumental ADL (L-IADL) was performed with each of the subitems as the dependent variables and the MMSE subitem as the independent variable. As a result, the subitems of MMSE, which are strongly related to each item in PSMS differed (e.g., toilet: registration odds ratio 3.00, grooming: naming 3.66). In the case of L-IADL, most items were strongly associated with "writing" (e.g., shopping: odds ratio 4.29, laundry 3.83). In clinical practice, we often focus only on the total MMSE score in patients with AD. However, the relationship between each MMSE subitem and ADL suggested in this study may be useful information that can be linked to ADL care from the performance of the MMSE subitem.
