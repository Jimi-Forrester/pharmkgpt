12392262|a|An important element in the diagnostic approach to psychogeriatric patients is the neuropsychologic assessment. Most instruments have been developed in the United States or the United Kingdom, but their appropriateness for culturally different populations is still an open question. Validation studies in Greece revealed certain difficulties both for the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Cambridge Cognitive Examination for the Elderly. These results were probably due to the functional illiteracy of elderly people in Greece, the coexistence of mood disorders, restricted access to news over past decades, and low levels of cooperation between the subject and the examiner The need for a more suitable diagnostic instrument for this kind of population led to the development of the Epidemiological Dementia Index. Data from developing countries support the possibility that research results from Europe and the United States are not directly applicable to the whole world; thus, the need for data from non-English speaking countries is evergrowing. Our understanding of psychogeriatric disorders in the developing world is like an iceberg: The larger portion is hidden because of the lack of relevant data.
