21340210|a|BACKGROUND: The N-terminal fragment of pro-brain type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is an established biomarker for cardiac failure. OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of preoperative serum NT-proBNP on postoperative outcome and mid-term survival in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). METHODS: In 819 patients undergoing isolated CABG surgery preoperative serum NT-proBNP levels were measured. NT-proBNP was correlated with various postoperative outcome parameters and survival rate after a median follow-up time of 18 (0.5-44) months. Risk factors of mortality were identified using chi2, Mann-Whitney test, and Cox regression. RESULTS: NT-proBNP levels > 430 ng/ml and > 502 ng/ml predicted hospital and overall mortality (p < 0.05), with an incidence of 1.6% and 4%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed decreased survival rates in patients with NT-proBNP > 502 ng/ml (p = 0.001). Age, preoperative serum creatinine, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, low left ventricular ejection fraction and BNP levels >502 ng/ml were isolated as risk factors for overall mortality. Multivariate Cox regression analysis, including the known factors influencing NT-proBNP levels, identified NT-proBNP as an independent risk factor for mortality (OR = 3.079 (CI = 1.149-8.247), p = 0.025). Preoperative NT-proBNP levels >502 ng/ml were associated with increased ventilation time (p = 0.005), longer intensive care unit stay (p=0.001), higher incidence of postoperative hemofiltration (p = 0.001), use of intra-aortic balloon pump (p < 0.001), and postoperative atrial fibrillation (p = 0.031) CONCLUSION: Preoperative NT-proBNP levels > 502 ng/ml predict mid-term mortality after isolated CABG and are associated with significantly higher hospital mortality and perioperative complications.
