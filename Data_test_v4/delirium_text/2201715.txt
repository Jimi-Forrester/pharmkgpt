2201715|t|Neuropeptides and Alzheimer's disease.
2201715|a|Because of their putative roles as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and neuroregulators in the central nervous system, neuropeptides have been the focus of considerable research over the past two decades. There is evidence that alterations in the synaptic availability of particular neuropeptides occur in certain neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and affective disorders. Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting a sizable proportion of our aging population. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques in the central nervous system. Postmortem studies have provided evidence that several neuropeptide-containing neurons are pathologically altered in this disorder. The purpose of this article is to describe recent advances in neuropeptide biology with a focus on the role of neuropeptides in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
