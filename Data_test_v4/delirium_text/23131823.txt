23131823|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a brain disorder displaying a prevalence and impact in constant expansion. This expansive and epidemic behavior is concerning medical and public opinion while focusing efforts on its prevention and treatment. One important strategy to prevent this brain impairment is based on dietary changes and nutritional supplements, functional foods and nutraceuticals. In this review we discuss the potential contributions of shilajit and complex B vitamins to AD prevention. We analyze the status of biological studies and present data of a clinical trial developed in patients with mild AD. Studies suggest that shilajit and its active principle fulvic acid, as well as a formula of shilajit with B complex vitamins, emerge as novel nutraceutical with potential uses against this brain disorder.
