35233441|a|Objective: Changes to study protocols during longitudinal research may alter cognitive testing schedules over time. Unlike in prior Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) protocols, where testing occurred twice annually, participants enrolled in the ADNI-3 are no longer exposed to cognitive materials at 6 months. This may affect their 12-month performance relative to earlier ADNI cohorts, and potentially confounds data harmonization attempts between earlier and later ADNI protocols. Method: Using data from participants enrolled across multiple ADNI protocols, this study investigated whether test exposure during 6-month cognitive evaluation influenced scores on subsequent 12-month evaluation. Results: No interaction effects were observed between test exposure group and time at 12 months on cognitive performance. No improvements, and limited declines, were seen between baseline and 12-month follow-up scores on most measures. Conclusions: The 6-month testing session had minimal impact on 12-month performance in ADNI. Collapsing longitudinal data across ADNI protocols in future research appears appropriate.
