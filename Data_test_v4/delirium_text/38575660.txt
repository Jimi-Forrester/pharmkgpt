38575660|a|The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly impacted vulnerable groups, such as patients with dementia. We examined changes in mortality and loss to follow-up in patients with dementia using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service research database. Patients with dementia who visited a medical institution with a recorded dementia-related diagnostic code, including Alzheimer's disease, and who received anti-dementia medication between February 2018 and January 2020 were included in this study. We divided patients with dementia receiving anti-dementia medications into two cohorts: those newly diagnosed with dementia between February 2018 and January 2019 (n = 62,631) and those diagnosed between February 2019 and January 2020 (n = 54,494). Then, we conducted a one-year follow-up of their records, tracking the cohort diagnosed between February 2018 and January 2019 from February 2019 to January 2020, as well as the cohort diagnosed between February 2019 and January 2020 from February 2020 to January 2021. There was a significant increase in follow-up loss among patients newly diagnosed with dementia during the COVID-19 outbreak, from 42.04% in 2019 to 45.89% in 2020. Female sex, younger age, fewer comorbidities, diagnosis of dementia at the Department of Neurology or Psychiatry, and higher income were associated with decreased follow-up loss and mortality. This study highlights the importance of paying extra attention to patients with dementia receiving anti-dementia medications, particularly during pandemics, given their increased risk of loss to follow-up.
