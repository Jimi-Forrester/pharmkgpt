25374866|t|Beers criteria-based assessment of medication use in hospitalized elderly patients in southern Brazil.
25374866|a|BACKGROUND: Population aging has evolved gradually. Polypharmacy to control disease associated with age-related physiological changes increases the risk of adverse drug reactions, including drug interactions among the elderly population. OBJECTIVE: This study was intended to assess the medications used by the elderly population, aiming at identifying the potentially inappropriate medications according to the Beers Criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study on medical records to assess the use of medications by elderly patients admitted to the Hospital Nossa Senhora da Conceicao in 2011. The variables included gender, age, reasons for admission, comorbidities, and medications used by the elderly patients. RESULTS: In total, we reviewed 440 medical records. Patients were predominantly male (51.6%). The total number of medications used was 5904, with an average of 13.4 per person. The three most commonly used drugs were dipyrone, omeprazole, and metoclopramide. The most frequently used drugs according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification (ATC) system were those of the alimentary tract and metabolism, nervous system, and cardiovascular system. Of the 255 types of drugs used, 42 (16.4%) were included in the Beers list, and the three most often used were metoclopramide, ketoprofen, and aspirin. CONCLUSION: The number of medications used per patient was substantial, and potentially inappropriate medications according to the Beers Criteria were significant as well.
