32787944|a|BACKGROUND: Resident-to-resident elder mistreatment (R-REM) is defined as negative and aggressive physical, sexual, or verbal interactions between (long-term care) residents that in a community setting would likely be construed as unwelcome and have high potential to cause physical and/or psychological harm and distress. R-REM has been established as a serious problem that has a negative impact on the safety, physical well-being, and quality-of-life of residents living in nursing homes. Although there are no in-depth studies, there is evidence that it is prevalent in assisted living residences and associated with a variety of person, environmental, and facility characteristics. The authors conducted the first systematic, prospective study of resident-to-resident elder mistreatment in nursing homes and developed an intervention for direct care staff to enhance knowledge of R-REM and increase reporting and resident safety by reducing falls and associated injuries. The study aim was to examine the effects of this intervention in assisted living residences. The primary distal outcome is falls and injuries, and the key process outcomes are staff knowledge and reporting. METHODS: Twelve larger licensed assisted living residences with special care dementia units in two New York State regions will be enrolled on a rolling basis and randomized to intervention or usual care. Data derived from five sources, (1) resident interviews, (2) staff informants, (3) observational data, (4) chart, and (5) incident/accident report data, will be collected at baseline and 6 and 12 months with respect to 1050 residents (750 "downstate" and 300 "upstate"). The intervention is three training modules delivered on-site after baseline data collection for front line staff on all shifts in facilities randomized to the intervention. Modules relate to recognition, management, and reporting of resident-to-resident elder mistreatment. DISCUSSION: Given the movement toward alternative congregate living arrangements for older individuals with significant comorbidities, including cognitive impairment; it is critical to enhance resident safety measured by falls, accidents, and injuries and staff knowledge related to recognition, reporting, and treatment of resident-to-resident aggressive and related negative interactions in such settings. This project is important in developing approaches for ameliorating and preventing R-REM in assisted living residences and enhancing resident safety and quality of life.
