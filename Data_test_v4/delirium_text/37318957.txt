37318957|t|The Emerging Role of Raman Spectroscopy as an Omics Approach for Metabolic Profiling and Biomarker Detection toward Precision Medicine.
37318957|a|Omics technologies have rapidly evolved with the unprecedented potential to shape precision medicine. Novel omics approaches are imperative toallow rapid and accurate data collection and integration with clinical information and enable a new era of healthcare. In this comprehensive review, we highlight the utility of Raman spectroscopy (RS) as an emerging omics technology for clinically relevant applications using clinically significant samples and models. We discuss the use of RS both as a label-free approach for probing the intrinsic metabolites of biological materials, and as a labeled approach where signal from Raman reporters conjugated to nanoparticles (NPs) serve as an indirect measure for tracking protein biomarkers in vivo and for high throughout proteomics. We summarize the use of machine learning algorithms for processing RS data to allow accurate detection and evaluation of treatment response specifically focusing on cancer, cardiac, gastrointestinal, and neurodegenerative diseases. We also highlight the integration of RS with established omics approaches for holistic diagnostic information. Further, we elaborate on metal-free NPs that leverage the biological Raman-silent region overcoming the challenges of traditional metal NPs. We conclude the review with an outlook on future directions that will ultimately allow the adaptation of RS as a clinical approach and revolutionize precision medicine.
