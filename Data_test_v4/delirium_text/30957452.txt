30957452|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of cluster needling at the scalp points on the expression of choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) and choline cholinesterase (AchE). METHODS: A total of 60 Wistar rats were randomized into a sham-operation group, a model group, a medication group and a cluster needling group, 15 rats in each one. In the model group, the medication group and the cluster needling group, the models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) were established by the orienteering injection with Abeta1-42 in the bilateral hippocampal CA1 in the rats. In the sham-operation group, the distilled water was injected in bilateral hippocampus of rats. In the medication group, the lavage with aricept was adopted for the basic treatment, once a day, for 4 weeks consecutively. In the cluster needling group, on the base of the treatment as the medication group, the cluster needling at the scalp points was adopted, once a day, 6 times a week, for 4 weeks totally. In the sham-operation group and the model group, the normal feeding was provided. After intervention, the learning and memory ability was measured with Morris water maze in the rats of each group. The changes in the hippocampal gross structure were observed with HE staining. The changes in the positive expressions of hippocampal ChAT and AchE were determined with the immunohistochemical method. RESULTS: Compared with the sham-operation group, the escape latency was prolonged and the percentage of the second quadrant and the frequency of platform leaping were reduced in the rats of the model group (all P<0.01). Compared with the model group, the escape latency was shortened and the percentage of the second quadrant and the frequency of platform leaping were increased in the rats of the cluster needling group and the medication group (P<0.05, P<0.01). Compared with the medication group, the escape latency was shortened and the percentage of the second quadrant and the frequency of platform leaping were increased in the rats of the cluster needling group (all P<0.05). Compared with the sham-operation group, the expression of ChAT was decreased and that of AchE increased in the model group (both P<0.01). Compared with the model group, the difference was not significant in ChAT expression (P>0.05) and the expression of AchE was reduced (P<0.05) in the medication group; the expression of ChAT was increased (P<0.05) and that of AchE decreased (P<0.01) in the cluster needling group. Compared with the medication group, the expression of ChAT was increased and that of AchE decreased in the cluster needling group (both P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The effect mechanism of cluster needling at the scalp points on AD could be related to the up-regulation of ChAT expression and down-regulation of AchE expression in the hippocampus. The combined treatment with the cluster needling and aricept achieves the better therapeutic effect on AD.
