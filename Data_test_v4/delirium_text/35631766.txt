35631766|a|Dioscorea caucasica Lipsky is a tertiary relict endemic plant naturally growing in the western part of the trans-Caucasus regions; it has adapted and successfully grows in the temperate region of the Baltic countries. Information about its phytochemical composition and bioactivities is rather scarce. This study reports the results of the identification of 41 compounds in D. caucasica leaf and tuber hydroethanolic extracts using UPLC-QTOF/MS. Organic acids were found in both extracts; hydroxycinnamates and flavonoids were the main phytochemicals in the leaves, while steroidal glycosides, fatty acids (mainly hydroxylated) and carbohydrates were found in the tubers. Leaf extracts inhibited enzymes in a dose-dependent manner and were remarkably stronger inhibitors of physiologically important enzymes, namely alpha-amylase (48.6% at 480 microg/mL), alpha-glucosidase (IC50 = 41.99 and 47.95 microg/mL with and without 0.1 M Na2CO3), acetylcholinesterase (45.85% at 100 microg/mL) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (IC50 = 829.7 microg/mL), most likely due to the presence of some quantified polyphenolic antioxidants. The mode of inhibition of alpha-glucosidase and acetylcholinesterase was assessed via kinetic studies based on Lineweaver-Burk inhibition plots. Leaf and tuber extracts acted as mixed-type and competitive inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase, respectively; the leaf extract demonstrated an uncompetitive inhibition mode of acetylcholinesterase. It is expected that this new knowledge of D. caucasica will serve for its valorization in developing new health beneficial ingredients for functional foods and nutraceuticals.
