33755764|a|PURPOSE: Visceral and renal artery aneurysms (VAA, RAA) are very rare pathologies. Both surgical and endovascular therapies are discussed as therapeutic options for ruptured and non-ruptured aneurysm repair; we describe our experience in the open and endovascular management of these entities. METHODS: Retrospective database analysis of 60 treated VAA and RAA in 59 patients between 1994 and 2020. Outcome data was descriptively analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-seven aneurysms were surgically treated and 23 interventionally. In the total study cohort, we observed a mortality of 1.7% and a morbidity of 18.6%. One major complication occurred. The morbidity was higher after surgical repair in ruptured and non-ruptured cases. The mean aneurysm diameter was 30.5 +- 15.6 mm. Patients with hepatic or pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysms presented more often in the stage of rupture, without differences in aneurysm size. The length of hospital stay after endovascular repair was significantly shorter compared to open surgical treatment (7.2 +- 6.9 days versus 11.8 +- 6.7 days, p = 0.014), but only in elective cases. Primary technical success was significantly better in patients that underwent surgical repair in an intention to treat analysis (100% versus 79.3%). The mean follow-up of the cohort was 53.5 months (range 3-207 months). CONCLUSION: Elective endovascular therapy and open surgery of VAA and RAA are safe procedures with a good periprocedural and long-term outcome. Surgical revascularization showed a better primary technical success but was associated with longer length of hospital stays.
