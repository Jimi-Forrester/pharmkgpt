METHODS: A total of 36 SD rats were randomly divided into a blank group, a model group and an electroacupuncture (EA) group, 12 rats in each group. The AD like rat model was established by 8-week continuous intraperitoneal injection of D-galactose (120 mg kg-1 d-1) in the model group and the EA group. The rats in the EA group were intervened with EA at "Baihui" (GV 20) and "Zusanli" (ST 36), continuous wave, 5 Hz in frequency, 1 mA in intensity, 20 min each intervention, once a day, for 8 weeks. After the intervention, the spatial learning-memory ability was evaluated by the Morris water maze test. The expression levels of NLRP3, Caspase-1 and IL-1beta protein in hippocampus were detected by Western blot method. The number of activated MG in hippocampus was detected by immunofluorescence labeling method. RESULTS: Compared with the blank group, the average escape latency was prolonged (P<0.01), the number of platform crossing was reduced (P<0.01), and the exploration time of target quadrant was shortened (P<0.01) in the model group. Compared with the model group, the average escape latency was shortened (P<0.01), the number of platform crossing was increased (P<0.01), and the exploration time of target quadrant was prolonged (P<0.01) in the EA group. Compared with the blank group, the expression levels of NLRP3, Caspase-1, IL-1beta protein in hippocampus were increased (P<0.01), and the number of activated MG was increased (P<0.01) in the model group. Compared with the model group, the expression levels of NLRP3, Caspase-1, IL-1beta protein in hippocampus were decreased (P<0.01), and the number of activated MG was decreased (P<0.05) in the EA group. CONCLUSION: Pretreatment of acupuncture could prevent and treat the learning-memory dysfunction in AD like rats, and its mechanism may be related to the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammatsome related protein and MG activation.
