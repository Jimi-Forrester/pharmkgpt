36448043|t|Central Adiponectin Signaling - A Metabolic Regulator in Support of Brain Plasticity.
36448043|a|Brain plasticity and metabolism are tightly connected by a constant influx of peripheral glucose to the central nervous system in order to meet the high metabolic demands imposed by neuronal activity. Metabolic disturbances highly affect neuronal plasticity, which underlies the prevalent comorbidity between metabolic disorders, cognitive impairment, and mood dysfunction. Effective pro-cognitive and neuropsychiatric interventions, therefore, should consider the metabolic aspect of brain plasticity to achieve high effectiveness. The adipocyte-secreted hormone, adiponectin, is a metabolic regulator that crosses the blood-brain barrier and modulates neuronal activity in several brain regions, where it exerts neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties. Moreover, adiponectin has been shown to improve neuronal metabolism in different animal models, including obesity, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. Here, we aim at linking the adiponectin's neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties with its main role as a metabolic regulator and to summarize the possible mechanisms of action on improving brain plasticity via its role in regulating the intracellular energetic activity. Such properties suggest adiponectin signaling as a potential target to counteract the central metabolic disturbances and impaired neuronal plasticity underlying many neuropsychiatric disorders.
