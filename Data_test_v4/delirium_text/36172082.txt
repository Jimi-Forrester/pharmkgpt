36172082|t|The Impact of Morning Surgery or Afternoon Surgery on Postoperative Sleep Quality and Melatonin Levels of Elderly Patients: A Prospective, Randomized Study.
36172082|a|Objective: Postoperative sleep disturbance after surgery is not conducive to the recovery of patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of the timing of surgery (morning vs afternoon) on the postoperative sleep quality of elderly patients and to analyze the relationship between the timing of surgery and the change in the melatonin level. Methods: Sixty patients who received hip surgery were randomly assigned to the Morning Group (Group M) or the Afternoon Group (Group A). The sleep quality was assessed by the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire. Before and after surgery, the nocturnal urine was collected over a 12-h period, and the 6-sulfatoxymelatonin concentration was measured. Also, the incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) was observed. Results: On the first and second nights after surgery, the sleep quality scores of the patients in Group A were greater than those in Group M, and there was no difference in the sleep quality scores between the two groups on the third night after surgery (P=0.000, P=0.002, P>0.05, respectively). In addition, the urine 6-sulphatoxymelatonin concentration was found to be greater in Group A than in Group M on the first night of surgery (P=0.00). Both the postoperative sleep quality scores and urine 6-sulphatoxymelatonin concentration were significantly less than those before surgery (P=0.00, P=0.00). Conclusion: The postoperative sleep quality scores and melatonin levels of elderly patients who received hip surgery under general anesthesia were significantly less than those of the patients before surgery. Furthermore, the short-term sleep quality of the patients who received surgery in the afternoon was better than that of the patients who received surgery in the morning. This difference may be related to the short-term change of the melatonin level after surgery.
