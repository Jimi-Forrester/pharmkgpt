9378447|a|The atypical antipsychotic clozapine has been reported to be effective in otherwise refractory psychoses. This, and its low potential for inducing extrapyramidal side effects and tardive dyskinesia, predestines this drug for the treatment of psychotic disorders in late life. However, not much is known about the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of clozapine in the treatment of aged patients. There are some studies and reports available about clozapine in the treatment of psychosis in patients suffering from dementia, schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, which are reported here. They give some evidence that even low doses of clozapine are effective in controlling psychotic symptoms in the elderly. To avoid side effects, patient-specific factors and changes of pharmacokinetics in the elderly have to be considered. However, side effects including sedation, delirium, posturnal hypotension and the risk of agranulocytosis in particular limits the use of clozapine in elderly patients.
