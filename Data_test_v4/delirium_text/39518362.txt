39518362|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this review is to highlight the new advance of predictive and explainable artificial intelligence for neuroimaging applications. METHODS: Data came from 30 original studies in PubMed with the following search terms: "neuroimaging" (title) together with "machine learning" (title) or "deep learning" (title). The 30 original studies were eligible according to the following criteria: the participants with the dependent variable of brain image or associated disease; the interventions/comparisons of artificial intelligence; the outcomes of accuracy, the area under the curve (AUC), and/or variable importance; the publication year of 2019 or later; and the publication language of English. RESULTS: The performance outcomes reported were within 58-96 for accuracy (%), 66-97 for sensitivity (%), 76-98 for specificity (%), and 70-98 for the AUC (%). The support vector machine and the convolutional neural network registered the best performance (AUC 98%) for the classifications of low- vs. high-grade glioma and brain conditions, respectively. Likewise, the random forest delivered the best performance (root mean square error 1) for the regression of brain conditions. The following factors were discovered to be major predictors of brain image or associated disease: (demographic) age, education, sex; (health-related) alpha desynchronization, Alzheimer's disease stage, CD4, depression, distress, mild behavioral impairment, RNA sequencing; (neuroimaging) abnormal amyloid-beta, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, cortical thickness, functional connectivity, fractal dimension measure, gray matter volume, left amygdala activity, left hippocampal volume, plasma neurofilament light, right cerebellum, regional homogeneity, right middle occipital gyrus, surface area, sub-cortical volume. CONCLUSION: Predictive and explainable artificial intelligence provide an effective, non-invasive decision support system for neuroimaging applications.
