37697324|t|Effect of the clinical decision assessment system on clinical outcomes of delirium in hospitalized older adults: study protocol for a pair-matched, parallel, cluster randomized controlled superiority trial.
37697324|a|BACKGROUND: Prompt recognition of delirium is the first key step in its proper management. A previous study has demonstrated that nurses' delirium screening using the usual paper version assessment tool has no effect on clinical outcomes. Clinical decision assessment systems have been demonstrated to improve patients' adherence and clinical outcomes. Therefore, We developed a clinical decision assessment system (3D-DST) based on the usual paper version (3-min diagnostic interview for CAM-defined delirium), which was developed for assessing delirium in older adults with high usability and accuracy. However, no high quality evidence exists on the effectiveness of a 3D-DST in improving outcomes of older adults compared to the usual paper version. METHODS: A pair-matched, open-label, parallel, cluster randomized controlled superiority trial following the SPIRIT checklist. Older patients aged 65 years or older admitted to four medical wards of a geriatric hospital will be invited to participate in the study. Prior to the study, delirium prevention and treatment interventions will be delivered to nurses in both the intervention and control groups. The nurses in the intervention group will perform routine delirium assessments on the included older patients with 3D-DST, while the nurses in the control group will perform daily delirium assessments with the usual paper version. Enrolled patients will be assessed twice daily for delirium by a nurse researcher using 3D-DST. The primary outcome is delirium duration. The secondary outcomes are delirium severity, incidence of delirium, length of stay, in-hospital mortality, adherence to delirium assessment, prevention, and treatment of medical staff. DISCUSSION: This study will incorporate the 3D-DST into clinical practice for delirium assessment. If our study will demonstrate that 3D-DST will improve adherence with delirium assessment and clinical outcomes in older patients, it will provide important evidence for the management of delirium in the future.
