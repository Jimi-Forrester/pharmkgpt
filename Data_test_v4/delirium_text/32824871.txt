32824871|t|The Needs and Utilization of Long-Term Care Service Resources by Dementia Family Caregivers and the Affecting Factors.
32824871|a|This study was to evaluate the utilization of long-term care service resources by caregivers of patients with dementia (PWD) and to determine affecting factors. In this cross-sectional study, a total of 100 dyads were enrolled and caregivers responded to the questionnaires. We found 40% of caregivers not using any care resources. Between those caregivers using and not-using care resources, we found differences (p < 0.05) in their health status and living conditions; the difference (p < 0.05) was also found in patients' behavior and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). The frequency of BPSD (OR = 1.045, p = 0.016, 95% CI = 1.001-1.083) and the living conditions (OR = 3.519, p = 0.007, 95% CI = 1.414-8.759) were related to their use of care resources. Particular BPSDs, such as anxiety or restlessness, throwaway food, aggressive behavior, tearing of clothes, and sexual harassment of patients were related to the caregivers' use of care resources (p < 0.01). Health professionals have to evaluate the patients' BPSD and identify the caregivers' essential needs. Individualized medical care and BPSD-related care resources should be provided for patients and caregivers for taking off their care burden and improving patient care.
