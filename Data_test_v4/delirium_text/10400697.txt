10400697|a|Our early study indicates that intracellular Abeta1-42 aggregates are resistant to degradation and accumulate as an insoluble residue in lysosomes, where they alter the normal catabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to cause the accumulation of insoluble APP and amyloidogenic fragments. In this study, we examined whether the addition of exogenous Abeta1-42 also leads to the accumulation of newly synthesized intracellular Abeta. Here we describe that newly synthesized Abeta, especially Abetan-42, is generated from metabolically labeled APP and accumulates in the insoluble fraction of cell lysates after Abeta1-42 treatment. These results suggest that intracellular Abeta may derive from a solid phase, intracellular pathway. In contrast to the pathway that primarily produces secreted Abeta1-40, the solid-phase intracellular pathway preferentially produces Abetan-42 with ragged amino termini. Biochemical studies and amino acid sequencing analyses indicate that these intracellular Abeta also share the same types of Abeta structures that accumulate in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients, suggesting that a significant fraction of the amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease may arise by this solid-phase pathway.
