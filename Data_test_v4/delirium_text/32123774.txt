32123774|t|Design biodegradable Zn alloys: Second phases and their significant influences on alloy properties.
32123774|a|Alloying combined with plastic deformation processing is widely used to improve mechanical properties of pure Zn. As-cast Zn and its alloys are brittle. Beside plastic deformation processing, no effective method has yet been found to eliminate the brittleness and even endow room temperature super-ductility. Second phase, induced by alloying, not only largely determines the ability of plastic deformation, but also influences strength, corrosion rate and cytotoxicity. Controlling second phase is important for designing biodegradable Zn alloys. In this review, knowledge related to second phases in biodegradable Zn alloys has been analyzed and summarized, including characteristics of binary phase diagrams, volume fraction of second phase in function of atomic percentage of an alloying element, and so on. Controversies about second phases in Zn-Li, Zn-Cu and Zn-Fe systems have been settled down, which benefits future studies. The effects of alloying elements and second phases on microstructure, strength, ductility, corrosion rate and cytotoxicity have been neatly summarized. Mg, Mn, Li, Cu and Ag are recommended as the major alloying elements, owing to their prominent beneficial effects on at least one of the above properties. In future, synergistic effects of these elements should be more thoroughly investigated. For other nutritional elements, such as Fe and Ca, refining second phase is a matter of vital concern.
