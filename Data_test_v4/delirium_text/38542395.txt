38542395|a|Mitochondria are involved in multiple aspects of neurodevelopmental processes and play a major role in the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to neuro-degenerative diseases. Fragile-X-related disorders (FXDs) are genetic conditions that occur due to the dynamic expansion of CGG repeats of the FMR1 gene encoding for the RNA-binding protein FMRP, particularly expressed in the brain. This gene expansion can lead to premutation (PM, 56-200 CGGs), full mutation (FM, >200 CGGs), or unmethylated FM (UFM), resulting in neurodegeneration, neurodevelopmental disorders, or no apparent intellectual disability, respectively. To investigate the mitochondrial mechanisms that are involved in the FXD patients, we analyzed mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics in fibroblasts derived from patients. Donut-shaped mitochondrial morphology and excessive synthesis of critical mitochondrial proteins were detected in FM, PM, and UFM cells. Analysis of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in situ reveals lower respiration in PM fibroblasts. Importantly, mitochondrial permeability transition-dependent apoptosis is sensitized to reactive oxygen species in FM, PM, and UFM models. This study elucidated the mitochondrial mechanisms that are involved in the FXD phenotypes, and indicated altered mitochondrial function and morphology. Importantly, a sensitization to permeability transition and apoptosis was revealed in FXD cells. Overall, our data suggest that mitochondria are novel drug targets to relieve the FXD symptoms.
