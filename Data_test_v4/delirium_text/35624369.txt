35624369|a|Studies have shown that exposure to dichlorophenols (DCPs) and their precursors might have potential neurotoxicity, which may be related to low cognitive function, but there are few large-scale, representative population data to explore the association between DCP exposure and cognitive function. We aimed to examine the relationship between urinary DCPs and cognitive function in the US older people. A total of 952 participants >= 60 years old from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in two cycles (2011-2014) were enrolled. The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease Word Learning subtest (CERAD W-L), the Animal Fluency test (AFT), and the Digit Symbol Substitution test (DSST) were used to assess cognition. Multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) were used to evaluate the relationship between DCP exposure and cognitive function. A positive association between 2,5-DCP and the risk of bad performance of DSST was observed (P for trend = 0.024) after adjusting for the covariates. Compared to the lowest quartile, OR of DSST for the highest quartile of 2,5-DCP was 1.72 (95%CI:1.03-2.87, P = 0.039). There were no significant associations between DCPs and the other tests. The RCS plot showed an inverted J-shaped relationship between 2,5-DCP, 2,4-DCP, and the DSST score. The inflection points for the curves were found at 1.531 mug/L and 0.230 mug/L, respectively. On the right side of the inflection points, the DSST score dropped sharply. In subgroup analysis, those under 70 years old, smokers, and alcohol drinkers had a higher risk of bad performance in DSST when exposed to 2,5-DCP. The higher concentration of urinary DCPs is associated with a lower score of DSST in the US older people.
