38321520|t|Associations between cardiometabolic multimorbidity and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathology in cognitively intact adults: the CABLE study.
38321520|a|BACKGROUND: Cardiometabolic multimorbidity is associated with an increased risk of dementia, but the pathogenic mechanisms linking them remain largely undefined. We aimed to assess the associations of cardiometabolic multimorbidity with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology to enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms linking cardiometabolic multimorbidity and AD. METHODS: This study included 1464 cognitively intact participants from the Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and LifestylE (CABLE) database. Cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) are a group of interrelated disorders such as hypertension, diabetes, heart diseases (HD), and stroke. Based on the CMD status, participants were categorized as CMD-free, single CMD, or CMD multimorbidity. CMD multimorbidity is defined as the coexistence of two or more CMDs. The associations of cardiometabolic multimorbidity and CSF biomarkers were examined using multivariable linear regression models with demographic characteristics, the APOE epsilon4 allele, and lifestyle factors as covariates. Subgroup analyses stratified by age, sex, and APOE epsilon4 status were also performed. RESULTS: A total of 1464 individuals (mean age, 61.80 years; age range, 40-89 years) were included. The markers of phosphorylated tau-related processes (CSF P-tau181: beta = 0.165, P = 0.037) and neuronal injury (CSF T-tau: beta = 0.065, P = 0.033) were significantly increased in subjects with CMD multimorbidity (versus CMD-free), but not in those with single CMD. The association between CMD multimorbidity with CSF T-tau levels remained significant after controlling for Abeta42 levels. Additionally, significantly elevated tau-related biomarkers were observed in patients with specific CMD combinations (i.e., hypertension and diabetes, hypertension and HD), especially in long disease courses. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of cardiometabolic multimorbidity was associated with tau phosphorylation and neuronal injury in cognitively normal populations. CMD multimorbidity might be a potential independent target to alleviate tau-related pathologies that can cause cognitive impairment.
