8919305|a|Perturbation of the neuronal cytoskeleton represents an integral feature of neurofibrillary tangles which are characteristic neuropathological findings seen in Alzheimer's disease. Microtubule associated protein tau (tau) is considered to be the major component of these lesions although neurofilament proteins also are present. The present study explores the formation of intraneuronal tau and neurofilament protein aggregates using intracisternal administration of aluminum maltolate to rabbits. The time course of the formation of these aggregates and subsequent phosphorylation have been investigated by immunohistochemical methods using a panel of monoclonal antibodies, with quantitation of the staining by image analysis. Neurofilament proteins begin to aggregate by day 1 following aluminum maltolate injection on day 0. Increases in non-phosphorylated neurofilament proteins are observed first, with phosphorylated epitopes being recognized by day 3. Tau follows a similar pattern in that non-phosphorylated epitopes appear to precede phosphorylation. The monoclonal antibody Alz-50 which recognizes a phosphorylation-independent epitope of tau in Alzheimer's disease paired helical filaments, demonstrates positivity in the aluminum maltolate-treated rabbits by day 3. Other tau monoclonal antibodies which recognize phosphorylated tau in paired helical filaments (AT8 and PHF-1) show positive immunostaining on days 6-8. These results indicate that intraneuronal aggregation of cytoskeletal proteins can be initiated by factors other than phosphorylation. However, phosphorylation occurring as a secondary event probably contributes to stabilization of the aggregates.
