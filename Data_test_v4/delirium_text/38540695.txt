38540695|t|Upsetting the Balance: How Modifiable Risk Factors Contribute to the Progression of Alzheimer's Disease.
38540695|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting nearly one in nine older adults in the US. This number is expected to grow exponentially, thereby increasing stress on caregivers and health systems. While some risk factors for developing AD are genetic, an estimated 1/3 of AD cases are attributed to lifestyle. Many of these risk factors emerge decades before clinical symptoms of AD are detected, and targeting them may offer more efficacious strategies for slowing or preventing disease progression. This review will focus on two common risk factors for AD, metabolic dysfunction and sleep impairments, and discuss potential mechanisms underlying their relationship to AD pathophysiology. Both sleep and metabolism can alter AD-related protein production and clearance, contributing to an imbalance that drives AD progression. Additionally, these risk factors have bidirectional relationships with AD, where the presence of AD-related pathology can further disrupt sleep and worsen metabolic functioning. Sleep and metabolism also appear to have a bidirectional relationship with each other, indirectly exacerbating AD pathophysiology. Understanding the mechanisms involved in these relationships is critical for identifying new strategies to slow the AD cascade.
