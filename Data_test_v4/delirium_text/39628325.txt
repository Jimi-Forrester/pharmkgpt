39628325|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressiveneurodegenerative condition is marked by extensive damage in the brain and dementia. Among the pathological hallmarks of AD is beta-amyloid (Abeta). Production of toxic Abeta oligomers production and accumulation in the brain is among the characteristic features of the disease. The abnormal accumulation Abeta is initiated by the catalytic degradation of Amyloid Precursor Proteins (APP) by Beta Amyloid Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1) to generate insoluble amyloid plaques. The abnormal proteins are mitochondrial poison which disrupt the energy production and liberate excessive free radicals causing neuronal damage and mutations. Consequently, targeting Abeta-associated pathways has become a focus in the pursuit of developing effective AD treatments. An obstacle faced by many medications used to treat neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) is the restricted permeability across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Unfortunately, no anti-amyloid drug is clinically approved till now. Recent advancements in nanotechnology have provided a possible solution for delivering medications to specific targets. By integrating natural products with nano-medicinal approaches, it is possible to develop novel and highly efficient therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AD.
