34859237|a|Neurocognitive function (NCF) deficits are common in patients with brain metastases, occurring in up to 90% of cases. NCF deficits may be caused by tumor-related factors and/or treatment for the metastasis, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. In recent years, strategies to prevent negative impact of treatments and ameliorate cognitive deficits for patients with brain tumors have gained momentum. In this review, we report on research that has established the efficacy of preventative and rehabilitative therapies for NCF deficits in patients with brain metastases. Surgical strategies include the use of laser interstitial thermal therapy and intraoperative mapping. Radiotherapy approaches include focal treatments such as stereotactic radiosurgery and tailored approaches such as hippocampal avoidant whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Pharmacologic options include use of the neuroprotectant memantine to reduce cognitive decline induced by WBRT and incorporation of medications traditionally used for attention and memory problems. Integration of neuropsychology into the care of patients with brain metastases helps characterize cognitive patterns, educate patients and families regarding their management, and guide rehabilitative therapies. These and other strategies will become even more important for long-term survivors of brain metastases as treatment options improve.
