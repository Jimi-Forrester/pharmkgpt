31293110|a|BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to identify the effects of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on non-renal manifestations in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: The study population comprised 439 SLE patients from the Korean Lupus Network registry who were followed up annually and completed the baseline survey and two follow-up visits from 2014 to 2018. Disease activity, laboratory markers, and clinical manifestations including mucocutaneous lesions, arthritis, serositis, neurological disorders, and hematologic/immunologic abnormalities were assessed. All variables by group (MMF and non-MMF) effects with time (baseline, 1st follow-up, and 2nd follow-up) were analyzed by generalized estimation equation. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients were treated with MMF. There was significant difference in frequencies of malar rash, arthritis, renal disorder, and hematologic disorder between MMF and non-MMF groups in total SLE patients. In subgroup analysis of hematologic abnormalities in total patients, frequency of leukopenia was significantly different between the two groups during follow-up (P = 0.001), but frequencies of hemolytic anemia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia were not. In addition, frequencies of leukopenia in patients without lupus nephritis were significantly decreased in MMF group compared to non-MMF group (P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: This study showed that MMF might be a beneficial treatment for hematologic abnormalities, especially leukopenia, in SLE.
