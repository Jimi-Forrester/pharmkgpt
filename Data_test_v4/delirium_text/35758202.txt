35758202|t|Fish and human health: an umbrella review of observational studies.
35758202|a|Fish represents one of the most important dietary sources of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are known to be associated with various health benefits. This study aimed to systematically review existing meta-analyses of observational studies exploring the association between fish intake and various health outcomes. A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted to retrieve a total of 63 studies. Evidence was deemed as possible for the association between higher fish intake and decreased risk of the acute coronary syndrome, liver cancer, and depression, and limited for other outcomes (including age-related macular degeneration, Alzheimer's disease, heart failure, all-cause and coronary heart disease mortality, total and ischaemic stroke) due to heterogeneity between results and potential otherwise inexplicable confounding factors. In conclusion, results from epidemiological studies support the mechanistic effects associated with omega-3 fatty acids from high fish consumption, but evidence needs to be further corroborated with more reliable results.
