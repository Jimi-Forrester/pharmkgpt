35204266|a|The rhizome of Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge (AA, family Liliaceae) is a famous and frequently used herbal drug in the traditional medicine of Northeast Asia, under vernacular name "zhimu". A. asphodeloides has been used as an anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, anti-platelet aggregation, anti-depressant, and anti-diabetic agent in traditional Chinese medicine. We examined the antioxidant, anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and anti-alpha-glucosidase activities of various solvent extracts and the main bioactive compounds from the rhizome of A. asphodeloides. Acetone extract exhibited comparatively high antioxidant activities by 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging, and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. A water extract exhibited relatively strong antioxidant activity by superoxide radical scavenging test. Furthermore, dichloromethane, chloroform, and n-hexane extracts showed significant anti-alpha-glucosidase activities. Finally, ethanol and dichloromethane extracts exhibited relatively strong AChE inhibitory activity. HPLC analysis was used to examine and compare various solvent extracts for their compositions of isolates. We isolated four major chemical constituents and analyzed their antioxidant, anti-alpha-glucosidase, and AChE inhibitory activities. The bioactivity assays showed that mangiferin displayed the most potential antioxidant activities via FRAP, ABTS, DPPH, and superoxide assays and also exhibited the most effective anti-AChE and anti-alpha-glucosidase activities among all the isolates. The present study suggests that A. asphodeloides and its active extracts and components are worth further investigation and might be expected to develop as a candidate for the treatment or prevention of oxidative stress-related diseases, AChE inhibition, and hyperglycemia.
