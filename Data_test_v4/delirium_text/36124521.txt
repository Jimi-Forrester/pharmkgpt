36124521|t|Noise Pollution in Intensive Care Unit: A Hidden Enemy affecting the Physical and Mental Health of Patients and Caregivers.
36124521|a|Background: Noise in intensive care units (ICUs) has always been a problem, but noise above the recommended range affects not only the patient but staff as well. It is clear that some noise in the ICU is inevitable, but exceeding the normal range brings various physiologic and psychologic changes, which directly affect health. This review presents a synthesis of noise sources in the ICU and the potential interventions designed to attenuate noise and protect patients. Materials and Methods: An extensive literature search, using electronic databases such as MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Research gate to understand the noise in ICU, effects of noise, and noise reduction interventions were undertaken. Results: Findings were such as noise enhances the release of cortisol, increases oxygen consumption, increases sleep disturbances, increases the need for analgesia and sedation, and disrupts circadian rhythm. Many studies reported that measurement was always higher despite implementing noise reduction interventions. Conclusions: ICU survivors always recall their memories, and for them, ICU admission becomes a negative experience for life. However, the sustainability of any single intervention did not show awe-inspiring results, whereas a bundle kind of interventions did show some effects. However, high-quality evidence demonstrating the benefit of any intervention on patient outcomes is still lacking.
