37789429|a|PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined methylprednisolone (MP) and tranexamic acid (TXA) in promoting accelerated rehabilitation following total hip arthroplasty (THA). We further investigated effective strategies for rapid rehabilitation post-THA. METHODS: Conducted as a randomized controlled trial involving 80 patients, the study allocated subjects into two groups. The control group received saline and TXA, whereas the experimental group was administered with an additional dose of MP. Several clinical parameters, including markers of inflammation, pain, nausea, and coagulation factors, were meticulously assessed in both groups. RESULTS: It was observed that the group receiving the MP + TXA treatment showcased significant reductions in postoperative levels of CRP and IL-6, as well as an alleviation in pain scores. Furthermore, this group demonstrated lower incidences of postoperative nausea and fatigue, facilitating enhanced hip joint mobility. Interestingly, this group did exhibit blood glucose fluctuations within the first 24 h postoperatively. However, there was no notable difference between the groups concerning transfusion rate, postoperative hospital stay duration, and coagulation profile, and no severe complications were reported. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the combined administration of MP and TXA can appreciably enhance postoperative recovery, by reducing inflammatory markers, alleviating pain, reducing nausea and fatigue, and improving hip mobility, without leading to an increased risk of severe perioperative complications. This highlights the potential role of this combined therapy in facilitating improved postoperative patient experiences.
