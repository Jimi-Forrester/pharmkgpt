38867718|t|Changes in the levels of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein and the correlation with outcomes in severe traumatic brain injury patients.
38867718|a|Purpose: Glial fibrillary acidic protein serves as a biomarker indicative of astroglial injury, particularly following instances of severe traumatic brain injury. This study aims to evaluate variations in serum glial fibrillary acidic protein levels within the first 3 days and their correlation with outcomes in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Subjects and methods: Thirty-nine patients with severe traumatic brain injury were enrolled in the study. Their blood samples were collected at six distinct time points: T0 (upon admission), T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5 (6-, 12-, 24-, 48-, and 72-h post-admission, respectively). The blood samples were run for the quantification of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein levels and other biochemical tests. All patients were closely watched and the outcomes at discharge were evaluated. Results: Glial fibrillary acidic protein levels tend to increase gradually from the time of admission to 48 h post-admission and then decrease at 72 h post-admission. Glial fibrillary acidic protein T2 is correlated with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, lactate, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II score and outcome. Glial fibrillary acidic protein max correlated with lactate, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II score, and outcome. Glasgow Coma Score at admission and glial fibrillary acidic protein T2 (OR = 1.034; p = 0.025), T3 (OR = 1.029; p = 0.046), T4 (OR = 1.006; p = 0.032), T5 (OR = 1.012; p = 0.048) and glial fibrillary acidic protein max (OR = 1.005; p = 0.010) were independent factors that have significant prognostic value in mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. The predictive model in predicting mortality had the highest area under the curve based on glial fibrillary acidic protein T2 and Glasgow Coma Score T0 with an area under the curve of 0.904 and p < 0.001. In the multivariable regression model, glial fibrillary acidic protein max was associated with Glasgow score (p < 0.001; VIF = 1.585), lactate T0 (p = 0.024; VIF = 1.163), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (p = 0.037; VIF = 1.360), and Rotterdam score (p = 0.044; VIF = 1.713). Conclusion: Glial fibrillary acidic protein levels tend to increase gradually from the time of admission to 48 h post-admission then decreases at 72 h post-admission. Glial fibrillary acidic protein T2, T3, T4, T5, and glial fibrillary acidic protein max were independent factors with significant prognostic mortality values in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.
