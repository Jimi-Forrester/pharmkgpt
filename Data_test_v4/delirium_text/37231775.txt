37231775|a|OBJECTIVES: Older adults commonly take benzodiazepines (BZDs) that may have long-term adverse cognitive effects. We investigated whether BZD use was related to developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia in cognitively normal older adults in the community. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A population-based cohort (n = 1959) of adults aged 65 and over, recruited from communities of low socioeconomic status. MEASUREMENTS: BZD use, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, sleep difficulties, and APOE genotype. DESIGN: We examined time from study entry to MCI (CDR = 0.5) and time from study entry to dementia (CDR >= 1) in participants who were cognitively normal at baseline (CDR = 0). We used survival analysis (Cox model), adjusted for age, sex, education, sleep, anxiety, and depression. For all the models, we included an interaction term between BZD use and APOE*4. RESULTS: Taking BZDs was significantly associated with higher risk of developing MCI, but not of developing dementia. The effect was not affected by APOE genotype. CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based sample of cognitively normal older adults, BZD use is associated with developing MCI, but not dementia. BZD use may be a potentially modifiable risk factor for MCI.
