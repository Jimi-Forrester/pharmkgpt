20810758|a|Dementia is a highly prevalent problem causing considerable disability and mortality and exacting great costs to individuals, their families, and society. The 4 most common neurodegenerative disorders that cause dementia-Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and dementia in Parkinson disease-have different underlying etiologies and pathogenetic mechanisms. There is a great need for early diagnostic markers; functional brain imaging may therefore assist in the detection and differential diagnosis of dementia due to neurodegenerative diseases. Functional imaging such as PET allows in vivo imaging of functional brain activity indicating cerebral blood flow and cerebral glucose metabolism, and PET allows imaging of neurotransmitter activity, including that of the cholinergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic systems. New PET neuroimaging tracers are being developed for detecting pathologic parameters such as amyloid plaque and microglial activity. The development of molecular imaging is important for early diagnosis of dementia, selection of patients for therapies, and evaluation of therapies.
