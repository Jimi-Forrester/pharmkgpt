39403775|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common form, accounting for 60-70% of 55 million dementia cases. Even though the precise pathophysiology of AD is not completely understood, clinical trials focused on antibodies targeting aggregated forms of beta amyloid (Abeta) have demonstrated that reducing amyloid plaques can arrest cognitive decline in patients in the early stages of AD. In this study, we provide an overview of current research and innovations for controlled release from nano-biomaterial-assisted chimeric antigen receptor macrophage (CAR-M) therapeutic strategies targeted at AD. Nano-bio materials, such as iron-oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), can be made selectively (Hp-Hb/mannose) to bind and take up Abeta plaques like CAR-M cells. By using nano-bio materials, both the delivery and stability of CAR-M cells in brain tissue can be improved to overcome the barriers of the BBB and enhance therapeutic effects. By enhancing the targeting capabilities and stability of CAR-M cells, mRNA-loaded nano-biomaterials can significantly improve the efficacy of immunotherapy for plaque reduction in AD. This novel strategy holds promise for translating preclinical successes into clinical applications, potentially revolutionising the management of AD.
