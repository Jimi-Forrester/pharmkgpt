37957567|t|Association between intraoperative mean arterial pressure variability and postoperative delirium after hip fracture surgery: a retrospective cohort study.
37957567|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication in elderly patients after hip fracture surgery. Our study was to investigate whether intraoperative mean arterial pressure variability (MAPV) was associated with POD in elderly patients after hip fracture surgery. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, patients aged 65 years and older undergoing hip fracture surgery were included. The correlation between MAPV and POD was investigated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Covariate-related confounding effects were eliminated with propensity score matching (PSM) analysis. Then, a subgroup analysis was conducted to further examine the associations between MAPV and POD. RESULTS: Nine hundred sixty-three patients with a median age of 80 years (IQR: 73-84) were enrolled. POD occurred in 115/963 (11.9%) patients within 7 days after surgery. According to multivariate regression analysis, MAPV > 2.17 was associated with an increased risk of POD (OR: 2.379, 95% CI: 1.496-3.771, P < 0.001). All covariates between the two groups were well balanced after PSM adjustment. A significant correlation between MAPV and POD was found in the PSM analysis (OR: 2.851, 95% CI: 1.710-4.746, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: An increased intraoperative MAPV may be a predictor for POD.
