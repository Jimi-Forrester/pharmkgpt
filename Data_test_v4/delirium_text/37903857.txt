37903857|t|A randomized, clinical trial investigating the use of a digital intervention to reduce delirium-associated agitation.
37903857|a|We aimed to determine if a novel digital therapeutic intervention could reduce agitation and unscheduled medication use in an adult delirious acute care population. Delirious participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive standard of care plus a single 4-hour exposure to the digital intervention "MindfulGarden", which uses a screen-based delivery to display a nature landscape with dynamic adjustment of screen content in response to movement and sound or standard of care only. Between March 2021 and January 2022, 73 participants were enrolled with 70 completing the trial protocol and included in the final analysis with a mean age of 61 years and 68% being male (35 intervention, 35 control). Mean RASS was significantly lower across the 4-hour study period in the intervention arm 0.3 (0.85) vs 0.9 (0.93), p = 0.01. Exposure to a nature-based dynamic digital intervention showed benefits in agitation reduction.
