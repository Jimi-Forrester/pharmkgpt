18995165|a|Family caregivers were interviewed to describe their caregiving experience with their older relatives who were afflicted with Alzheimer's disease at home. Three elements were identified to contribute toward a caregiving career: (a) good prior relationships between caregivers and care recipients, (b) positive interpretations of the relative's condition, and (c) utilization of resources. Some caregivers were identified as high risk: husbands caring for their wives and daughters-in-law caring for their mothers-in-law. Specific interventions for these subgroup caregivers are in order.
