35017906|t|Drug Repurposing for Tooth Regeneration: The Promising Premises.
35017906|a|Drug repurposing which identifies new therapeutic use(s) for drugs currently in use is a brand-new avenue of research interest worldwide. It circumvents the high-end monetary and time investment usually associated with contemporary drug discoveries. In the field of dentistry, recent studies in drug repurposing focuses in attaining dentin repair or reduction of bone resorption associated with apical periodontitis. Metformin, an anti-diabetic drug has shown pro-osteogenic properties. Aspirin a known anti-inflammatory agent with anticoagulant action is found to modulate the differentiation of dental pulp cells. The significant role of glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibitors in activating the Wnt/-beta cat signaling pathway of mesenchymal pulp stem cells may pave the way to the pharmacological treatment of dental caries in near future. It is to be noted here that further preclinical and clinical studies are warranted for the regular therapeutic use of these potential drugs in clinical dentistry.
