36614153|t|Role and Dysregulation of miRNA in Patients with Parkinson's Disease.
36614153|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative synucleinopathy that has a not yet fully understood molecular pathomechanism behind it. The role of risk genes regulated by small non-coding RNAs, or microRNAs (miRNAs), has also been highlighted in PD, where they may influence disease progression and comorbidities. In this case-control study, we analyzed miRNAs on peripheral blood mononuclear cells by means of RNA-seq in 30 participants, with the aim of identifying miRNAs differentially expressed in PD compared to age-matched healthy controls. Additionally, we investigated the pathways influenced by differentially expressed miRNAs and assessed whether a specific pathway could potentially be associated with PD susceptibility (enrichment analyses performed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tools). Overall, considering that the upregulation of miRNAs might be related with the downregulation of their messenger RNA targets, and vice versa, we found several putative targets of dysregulated miRNAs (i.e., upregulated: hsa-miR-1275, hsa-miR-23a-5p, hsa-miR-432-5p, hsa-miR-4433b-3p, and hsa-miR-4443; downregulated: hsa-miR-142-5p, hsa-miR-143-3p, hsa-miR-374a-3p, hsa-miR-542-3p, and hsa-miR-99a-5p). An inverse connection between cancer and neurodegeneration, called "inverse comorbidity", has also been noted, showing that some genes or miRNAs may be expressed oppositely in neurodegenerative disorders and in some cancers. Therefore, it may be reasonable to consider these miRNAs as potential diagnostic markers and outcome measures.
