34535634|a|Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is one of the most common forms of malignancy in the Western world. Accumulating evidence indicates that colon carcinogenesis is tightly controlled by tumour-associated immune cells and stromal cells, which can either stimulate or suppress CRC cell growth and survival, mainly via the production of cytokines. Interleukin-34 (IL-34), a cytokine known to regulate mainly monocyte/macrophage survival and function, is highly produced within the CRC microenvironment by several cell types, including cancer cells, tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and regulates the pro-tumoural functions of such cells. In this article, we summarize the available data supporting the multiple effects of IL-34 in human CRC.
