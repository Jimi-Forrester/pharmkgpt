10643818|t|Final common pathways in neurodegenerative diseases: regulatory role of the glutathione cycle.
10643818|a|Attempts to unify diverse mechanisms of neurotoxicity have led to the concept of final common pathways which characterize frequently occurring cellular responses to disruption of homeostasis. The clinical presentation and common patho-biochemistry of reactive oxygen intermediates of Guam's disease have suggested that such pathways may be operative in three major neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer's dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. A candidate-signaling pathway in this regard is characterized by the cascade arachidonic acid/HPETE/*OH/cGMP followed by activation of cGMP-dependent kinase and phosphorylation of NF-kB proteins and possibly CREB. This sequence may lead to apoptosis as well as long-term potentiation and memory and constitutes a biochemical correlate to excitotoxicity. The predominant control of *OH release from HPETE, a checkpoint in this pathway, is exerted by the glutathione cycle, a central biochemical process that is also intimately associated with the synthesis of the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA and is connected to energy metabolism. Modifications in the activity of the glutathione cycle may provide treatment options.
