36232882|t|An Integrative Analysis of Identified Schizophrenia-Associated Brain Cell Types and Gene Expression Changes.
36232882|a|Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe mental disorder that may result in hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking. How each cell type in the brain contributes to SCZ occurrence is still unclear. Here, we leveraged the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bulk RNA-seq data, then used the RNA-seq deconvolution algorithm CIBERSORTx to generate SCZ brain single-cell RNA-seq data for a comprehensive analysis to understand SCZ-associated brain cell types and gene expression changes. Firstly, we observed that the proportions of brain cell types in SCZ differed from normal samples. Among these cell types, astrocyte, pericyte, and PAX6 cells were found to have a higher proportion in SCZ patients (astrocyte: SCZ = 0.163, control = 0.145, P.adj = 4.9 x 10-4, effect size = 0.478; pericyte: SCZ = 0.057, control = 0.066, P.adj = 1.1 x 10-4, effect size = 0.519; PAX6: SCZ = 0.014, control = 0.011, P.adj = 0.014, effect size = 0.377), while the L5/6_IT_CAR3 cells and LAMP5 cells are the exact opposite (L5/6_IT_Car3: SCZ = 0.102, control = 0.108, P.adj = 0.016, effect size = 0.369; LAMP5: SCZ = 0.057, control = 0.066, P.adj = 2.2 x 10-6, effect size = 0.617). Next, we investigated gene expression in cell types and functional pathways in SCZ. We observed chemical synaptic transmission dysregulation in two types of GABAergic neurons (PVALB and LAMP5), and immune reaction involvement in GABAergic neurons (SST) and non-neuronal cell types (endothelial and oligodendrocyte). Furthermore, we observed that some differential expression genes from bulk RNA-seq displayed cell-type-specific abnormalities in the expression of molecules in SCZ. Finally, the cell types with the SCZ-related transcriptomic changes could be considered to belong to the same module since we observed two major similar coordinated transcriptomic changes across these cell types. Together, our results offer novel insights into cellular heterogeneity and the molecular mechanisms underlying SCZ.
