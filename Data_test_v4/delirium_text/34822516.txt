34822516|t|Untapped Potential of Marine-Associated Cladosporium Species: An Overview on Secondary Metabolites, Biotechnological Relevance, and Biological Activities.
34822516|a|The marine environment is an underexplored treasure that hosts huge biodiversity of microorganisms. Marine-derived fungi are a rich source of novel metabolites with unique structural features, bioactivities, and biotechnological applications. Marine-associated Cladosporium species have attracted considerable interest because of their ability to produce a wide array of metabolites, including alkaloids, macrolides, diketopiperazines, pyrones, tetralones, sterols, phenolics, terpenes, lactones, and tetramic acid derivatives that possess versatile bioactivities. Moreover, they produce diverse enzymes with biotechnological and industrial relevance. This review gives an overview on the Cladosporium species derived from marine habitats, including their metabolites and bioactivities, as well as the industrial and biotechnological potential of these species. In the current review, 286 compounds have been listed based on the reported data from 1998 until July 2021. Moreover, more than 175 references have been cited.
