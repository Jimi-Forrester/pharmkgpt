36604624|t|Deep medullary veins: a promising neuroimaging marker for mild cognitive impairment in outpatients.
36604624|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mild cognitive impairment is an age-dependent pre-dementia state caused by varied reasons. Early detection of MCI helps handle dementia. Vascular factors are vital for the occurrence of MCI. This study investigates the correlation between deep medullary veins and multi-dimensional cognitive outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 73 participants with MCI and 32 controls were enrolled. Minimum Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment were used to examine the global cognitive function, and different cognitive domains were measured by specific neuropsychological tests. MRI was used to assess the visibility of the DMV and other neuroimage markers. RESULTS: DMV score was statistically significantly higher in the MCI group compared with the control group (P = 0.009) and independently related to MCI (P = 0.007). Linear regression analysis verified that DMV score was linearly related to global cognition, memory, attention, and executive function after adjusting for cerebrovascular risk factors. CONCLUSION: DMV score was independently related to the onset of MCI, and correlates with overall cognition, memory, attention, and executive function in outpatients.
