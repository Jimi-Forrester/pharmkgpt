38674911|t|Analysis of the Association between Protein Intake and Disability-Adjusted Life Year Rates for Alzheimer's Disease in Japanese Aged over 60.
38674911|a|With advancements in medical technology, the structure of disease is shifting from acute illnesses to chronic conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Consequently, there is an escalating need for evaluations that discourse on the potential effects on healthy life years, as well as disease onset. We aimed to evaluate the associations with AD disability-adjusted life year (AD-DALY) rates and protein intake by sex and age group. For the analysis, we used representative values for males and females in their 60s and aged over 70, extracted from the public dataset of the Global Burden of Disease Study and the National Health and Nutrition Survey in Japan, covering the years 1990 to 2019. In order to evaluate the association between AD-DALY rates and protein intake, we analyzed correlations and stratified multiple regression models. Additionally, we simulated alterations in AD-DALY rates associated with changes in protein intake by utilizing stratified multiple regression models. AD-DALY rates and protein intake indicated significant negative correlations across all sex and age groups. In stratified multiple regression models, significant associations were found between higher protein intake and lower AD-DALY rates in females. In the simulation, when protein intake was increased to 1.5 g/kg/day, AD-DALY rates decreased by 5-9 percent compared with 2019. However, the association between intake of animal and plant protein and AD-DALY rates were found to vary based on sex and age group. The present study suggests the possibility to improve AD-DALY rates by increasing population average protein intake levels in a recommended range.
