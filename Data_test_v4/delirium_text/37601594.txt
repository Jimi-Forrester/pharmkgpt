37601594|t|Efficient and stereoselective synthesis of sugar fused pyrano[3,2-c]pyranones as anticancer agents.
37601594|a|A highly stereoselective, efficient and facile route was achieved for the synthesis of novel and biochemically potent sugar fused pyrano[3,2-c]pyranone derivatives starting from inexpensive, naturally occurring d-galactose and d-glucose. First, beta-C-glycopyranosyl aldehydes were synthesized from these d-hexose sugars in six steps, with overall yields 41-55%. Next, two different 1-C-formyl glycals were synthesized from these beta-C-glycopyranosyl aldehydes by treatment in basic conditions. The optimization of reaction conditions was carried out following reactions between 1-C-formyl galactal and 4-hydroxycoumarin. Next, 1-C-formyl galactal and 1-C-formyl glucal were treated with nine substituted 4-hydroxy coumarins at room temperature (25  C) in ethyl acetate for ~1-2 h in the presence of l-proline to obtain exclusively single diastereomers of pyrano[3,2-c]pyranone derivatives in excellent yields. Four compounds were found to be active for the MCF-7 cancer cell line. The MTT assay, apoptosis assay and migration analysis showed significant death of the cancer cells induced by the synthesized compounds.
