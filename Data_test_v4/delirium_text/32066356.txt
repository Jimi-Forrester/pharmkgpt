32066356|t|A Chronological Review of Potential Disease-Modifying Therapeutic Strategies for Alzheimer's Disease.
32066356|a|Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that has become a worldwide health problem. This pathology has been classically characterized for its affectation on cognitive function and the presence of depositions of extracellular amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) composed of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. To this day, no effective treatment has been developed. Multiple strategies have been proposed over the years with the aim of finding new therapeutic approaches, such as the sequestration of Abeta in plasma or the administration of anti-inflammatory drugs. Also, given the significant role of the insulin receptor in the brain in the proper maintenance of cognitive function, drugs focused on the amelioration of insulin resistance have been proposed as potentially useful and effective in the treatment of AD. In the present review, taking into account the molecular complexity of the disease, it has been proposed that the most appropriate therapeutic strategy is a combinatory treatment of several drugs that will regulate a wide spectrum of the described altered pathological pathways.
