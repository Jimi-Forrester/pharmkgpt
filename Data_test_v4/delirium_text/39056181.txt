39056181|t|Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Colchicine Aryl/Alkyl Amine Hybrids as Potential Noncytotoxic Cholinesterase Inhibitors: Identification of SBN-284 as a Dual Inhibitor of Cholinesterases and NLRP3 Inflammasome.
39056181|a|Colchicine, one of the oldest anti-inflammatory natural products still used clinically, inhibits NF-kappaB signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Despite its cytotoxicity and narrow therapeutic range, colchicine continues to intrigue medicinal chemists exploring its anti-inflammatory potential. This study aimed to investigate the colchicine scaffold for its role in Alzheimer's disease by targeting neuroinflammation and cholinesterases. Molecular docking revealed that colchicine's hydrophobic trimethoxyphenyl framework can potentially bind to the peripheral anionic site of cholinesterases. Hybrid structures combining colchicine with aryl/alkyl amines were designed to bind both peripheral and catalytic sites of cholinesterases. We describe here the design, synthesis, and in vitro cytotoxicity evaluation of these colchicine-aryl/alkyl amine hybrids, along with their in silico interactions with the cholinesterase active site gorge. Nontoxic analogs demonstrating strong cholinesterase binding affinity were further evaluated for their anticholinesterase and antineuroinflammatory activities. The colchicine-donepezil hybrid, SBN-284 (3x), inhibited both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase as well as the NLRP3 inflammasome complex at low micromolar concentrations. It achieved this through noncompetitive inhibition, occupying the active site gorge and interacting with both peripheral and catalytic anionic sites of cholinesterases. Analog 3x was shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and exhibited no toxicity to neuronal cells, primary macrophages, or epithelial fR2 cells. These findings highlight the potential of this lead compound for further preclinical investigation as a promising anti-Alzheimer agent.
