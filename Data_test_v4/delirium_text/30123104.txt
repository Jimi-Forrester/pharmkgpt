30123104|t|The Adenosinergic Signaling: A Complex but Promising Therapeutic Target for Alzheimer's Disease.
30123104|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in elderly people. AD is characterized by a progressive cognitive decline and it is neuropathologically defined by two hallmarks: extracellular deposits of aggregated beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides and intraneuronal fibrillar aggregates of hyper- and abnormally phosphorylated Tau proteins. AD results from multiple genetic and environmental risk factors. Epidemiological studies reported beneficial effects of caffeine, a non-selective adenosine receptors antagonist. In the present review, we discuss the impact of caffeine and of adenosinergic system modulation on AD, in terms of pathology and therapeutics.
