34616111|a|Quercetin, a type of flavonoid, is believed to reduce age-related cognitive decline. To elucidate its potential function, we carried out a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparative clinical trial involving 24-week continuous intake of quercetin-rich onion compared to quercetin-free onion as a placebo. Seventy healthy Japanese individuals (aged 60 to 79 years old) were enrolled in this study. We examined the effect of quercetin-rich onion (the active test food) on cognitive function using the Mini-Mental State Examination, Cognitive Assessment for Dementia iPad version, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Nursing Home version. The Mini-Mental State Examination scores were significantly improved in the active test food group (daily quercetin intake, 50 mg as aglycone equivalent) compared to the placebo food group after 24 weeks. On the Cognitive Assessment for Dementia iPad version for emotional function evaluation, we found that the scores of the active test food group were significantly improved, suggesting that quercetin prevents cognitive decline by improving depressive symptoms and elevating motivation. On the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Nursing Home version, we found significant effects on reducing the burden on study partners. Taking all the data together, we concluded that 24-week continuous intake of quercetin-rich onion reduces age-related cognitive decline, possibly by improving emotional conditions. Clinical trial register and their clinical registration number: This study was registered with UMIN (approval number UMIN000036276, 5 April 2019).
