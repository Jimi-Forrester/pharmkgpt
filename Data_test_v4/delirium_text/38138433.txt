38138433|a|Biotransformation of ursonic acid (1) by two fungal strains Aspergillus ochraceus CGMCC 3.5324 and Aspergillus oryzae CGMCC 3.407 yielded thirteen new compounds (4, 5, 7-10, and 13-19), along with five recognized ones. The structural details of new compounds were determined through spectroscopic examination (NMR, IR, and HR-MS) and X-ray crystallography. Various modifications, including hydroxylation, epoxidation, lactonization, oxygen introduction, and transmethylation, were identified on the ursane core. Additionally, the anti-neuroinflammatory efficacy of these derivatives was assessed on BV-2 cells affected by lipopolysaccharides. It was observed that certain methoxylated and epoxylated derivatives (10, 16, and 19) showcased enhanced suppressive capabilities, boasting IC50 values of 8.2, 6.9, and 5.3 muM. Such ursonic acid derivatives might emerge as potential primary molecules in addressing neurodegenerative diseases.
