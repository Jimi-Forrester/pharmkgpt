31208432|t|Change in the cause of inpatient mortality after arthroplasty: a retrospective study.
31208432|a|BACKGROUND: Although arthroplasty has been proved to be a safe and effective procedure, data regarding inpatient mortality rates associated with arthroplasty in China is unclear. We aimed to investigate the inpatient mortality rate after arthroplasty and the determinants of mortality at our center to ensure improved perioperative management. METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients who underwent arthroplasty at our center. Clinical data of mortality patients were collected. The incidence and the causes of inpatient mortality after arthroplasty were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 4176 total knee arthroplasties, 2164 total hip arthroplasties, and 1031 femoral head replacements were performed. A rapid growth in surgery volume was observed, and more than 50% of the surgeries were performed in the last 5 years. The overall inpatient mortality rate is 0.3%; however, the mortality rate even decreased in the last 5 years. The cause of death changed over time. Pneumonia has become the leading cause of death in the past 5 years instead of cardiovascular complications. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroplasty is a safe and effective procedure associated with a relatively low inpatient mortality in China. And inpatient mortality does not increase as the growing surgery volume due to improvement of perioperative management. However, patients presenting with risk factors and those undergoing non-elective procedures demonstrated a relatively high incidence of postoperative complications, particularly pneumonia.
