25691455|a|Sox2 is a component of the core transcriptional regulatory network which maintains the totipotency of the cells during embryonic preimplantation period, the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells, and the multipotency of neural stem cells. This maintenance is controlled by internal loops between Sox2 and other transcription factors of the core such as Oct4, Nanog, Dax1, and Klf4, downstream proteins of extracellular ligands, epigenetic modifiers, and miRNAs. As Sox2 plays an important role in the balance between stem cells maintenance and commitment to differentiated lineages throughout the lifetime, it is supposed that Sox2 could regulate stem cells aging processes. In this review, we provide an update concerning the involvement of Sox2 in neurogenesis during normal aging and discuss its possible role in Alzheimer's disease.
