34659125|t|Predictive Modeling of MAFLD Based on Hsp90alpha and the Therapeutic Application of Teprenone in a Diet-Induced Mouse Model.
34659125|a|Background and Aims: The heat shock protein (Hsp) 90alpha is induced by stress and regulates inflammation through multiple pathways. Elevated serum Hsp90alpha had been found in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA, also called teprenone) is a terpenoid derivative. It was reported to induce Hsp and alleviate insulin resistance. We aimed to evaluate the Hsp90alpha as a biomarker in predicting metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and define the therapeutic effects of geranylgeranylacetone for the disease. Methods: A clinical study was conducted to analyze the elements associated with Hsp90alpha, and a predictive model of MAFLD was developed based on Hsp90alpha. The histopathological correlation between Hsp90alpha and MAFLD was investigated through a diet-induced mouse model. Furthermore, GGA was applied to the mouse model. Results: Serum Hsp90alpha was increased in patients with MAFLD. A positive linear relationship was found between age, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), MAFLD, and serum Hsp90alpha. Meanwhile, a negative linear relationship with body mass index (BMI) was found. A model using Hsp90alpha, BMI, HbA1c, and ALT was established for predicting MAFLD. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was 0.94 (95% CI 0.909-0.971, p = 0.000). The sensitivity was 84.1%, and the specificity was 93.1%. In vitro experiments, GGA induced Hsp90alpha in steatosis cells. In the mice model, Hsp90alpha decreased in the GGA treatment group. Hepatic steatosis, inflammation, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance were improved in the GGA-treated group. Serum Hsp90alpha was positively correlated with steatohepatitis activity according to hepatic histopathology. Conclusions: Serum Hsp90alpha was elevated in MAFLD, and a positive correlation between serum Hsp90alpha and the grade of activity of steatohepatitis was observed. The model using BMI, HbA1c, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) had a good value to predict MAFLD. The findings also revealed the effectiveness of GGA in the treatment of MAFLD.
