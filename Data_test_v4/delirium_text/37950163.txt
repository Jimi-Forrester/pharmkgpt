37950163|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative neurocognitive disorder (pNCD) is common after surgery. Exposure to anaesthetic drugs has been implicated as a potential cause of pNCD. Although several studies have investigated risk factors for the development of cognitive impairment in the early postoperative phase, risk factors for pNCD at 3 months have been less well studied. The aim of this study was to identify potential anaesthesia-related risk factors for pNCD at 3 months after surgery. METHODS: We analysed data obtained for a prospective observational study in patients aged >= 65 years who underwent surgery for excision of a solid tumour. Cognitive function was assessed preoperatively and at 3 months postoperatively using 5 neuropsychological tests. Postoperative NCD was defined as a postoperative decline of >= 25% relative to baseline in >= 2 tests. The association between anaesthesia-related factors (type of anaesthesia, duration of anaesthesia, agents used for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia and analgesia, the use of additional vasoactive medication, depth of anaesthesia [bispectral index] and mean arterial pressure) and pNCD was analysed using logistic regression analyses. Furthermore, the relation between anaesthesia-related factors and change in cognitive test scores expressed as a continuous variable was analysed using a z-score. RESULTS: Of the 196 included patients, 23 (12%) fulfilled the criteria for pNCD at 3 months postoperatively. A low preoperative score on Mini-Mental State Examination (OR, 8.9 [95% CI, (2.8-27.9)], p < 0.001) and a longer duration of anaesthesia (OR, 1.003 [95% CI, (1.001-1.005)], p = 0.013) were identified as risk factors for pNCD. On average, patients scored higher on postoperative tests (mean z-score 2.35[+- 3.13]). CONCLUSION: In this cohort, duration of anaesthesia, which is probably an expression of the complexity of the surgery, was the only anaesthesia-related predictor of pNCD. On average, patients' scores on cognitive tests improved postoperatively.
