36766964|t|The Intersection of Health Rehabilitation Services with Quality of Life in Saudi Arabia: Current Status and Future Needs.
36766964|a|Quality of life (QoL) is essential for maintaining a healthy, balanced lifestyle, especially among individuals with chronic diseases. Saudi Arabia (SA) launched a health sector transformation program as part of the nationwide Vision 2030 initiative to ensure the sustainable development of efficient healthcare services, aiming to improve health by increasing well-being and QoL. More investigation into the current status of health rehabilitation services provided to individuals with chronic diseases and future needs to optimize services and improve QoL is needed. This was narratively discussed by experts from different health rehabilitation services in SA. Comprehensive health rehabilitation services including orthopedic, occupational, cardiac, pulmonary, critical care, perioperative, hearing and speech, substance use disorders, and vocational rehabilitation services were addressed. Health rehabilitation services in SA, as in other countries, are suboptimal for individuals in health rehabilitation programs. To optimize the QoL of individuals with chronic diseases, health rehabilitation services should be tailored based on the unique requirements of each service and its serving patients. The shared need to improve health rehabilitation services includes the adoption of home-based and telehealth services, the integration of multi-governmental sectors, the empowerment and allocation of health rehabilitation specialists, public awareness campaigns, policy legislation and guideline development, and the implementation of a long-term follow-up system. This review is one of the first to address the intersection of health rehabilitation services and QoL in SA; urgent and holistic actions are paramount to address the pressing need to optimize SA's health rehabilitation services. The experts' recommendations in this study may be applicable to other countries' health systems, as health rehabilitation services are not well optimized globally.
