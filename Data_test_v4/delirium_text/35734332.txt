35734332|a|Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic caused a major disruption to healthcare system. A year after COVID-19 outbreak, the question remains to what extent the lockdowns changed the volume of non-infected patients who were admitted to the Neurologic Department (ND). To determine the impact of the pandemic s first year on a tertiary ND. Methods: non-infected patients admitted to ND between March 2020 and February 2021 were examined. A control group was generated for the same time interval starting from March 2019. Primary outcomes were the number of patients presenting with neurologic complaint who were admitted to the hospital and the diagnosis type. Secondary outcomes were hospitalization length and patients  outcome. Results: overall, 816 patients (49.4% females) were admitted during the predetermined periods. Median age was 55 years. Median length of hospitalization was six days. We observed a 47.2% reduction in our department s admissions during pandemic (n=282). None of the examined variables (type of neurologic diagnosis, age, gender, hospitalization length and outcome) changed significantly during pandemic. However, the number of patients admitted during the pandemic with a diagnosis categorized as "other" was statistically significant lower compared to the year before COVID-19 (p=0.007). Hospitalization length was associated only with patients  age. Conclusion: our study examined for the first-time the consequences of the first year of COVID-19 pandemic on ND admissions. COVID-19 outbreak resulted in decreased admissions. Delays in seeking medical consultation for urgent or undiagnosed neurologic conditions require rigorous long-term monitoring to fully understand the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients with neurologic diseases.
