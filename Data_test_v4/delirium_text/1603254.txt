1603254|a|An inner city population of people over 65 years of age was screened using Short CARE in 1987. Eight percent were identified as having possible cognitive impairment and 4.7% as probable pervasive dementia, from the scores on two scales of this interview. A detailed clinical reassessment of these subjects identified by screening, suggested a rate of clinical dementia at 6.1%, 3.1% meeting the criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease. Two and a half years later, 72% have been rescreened using Short CARE. Fifteen percent of the population had died, 7% moved away and 6% were not available for interview. Thirty-five (5.9%) of the subjects rescreened appeared, from their scores on the two scales, to be new cases of dementia, giving a possible annual incidence rate of 2.6%. The annual incidence rate of probable pervasive dementia was 1.4%. These subjects are now in the process of having a detailed clinical diagnostic assessment. The medical records of those who had died between the two screens are being checked for evidence of dementia, so that more precise incidence rates can be calculated.
