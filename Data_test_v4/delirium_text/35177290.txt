35177290|t|MicroRNAs in Alzheimer's disease: Potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.
35177290|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, with cognitive decline as the primary clinical feature. According to epidemiological statistics, 50 million people worldwide are currently affected by Alzheimer's disease. Although new drugs such as aducanumab have been approved for use in the treatment of AD, none of them have reversed the progression of AD. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small molecule RNAs that exert their biological functions by regulating the expression of intracellular proteins, and differential abundance and varieties are found between the central and peripheral tissues of AD patients and healthy controls. This article will summarise the changes of miRNAs in the AD process, and the potential role of diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets in AD will be explored.
