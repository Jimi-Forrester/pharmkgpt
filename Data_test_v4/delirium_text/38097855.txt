38097855|a|The association between depression and dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD), remains an active area of research. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between a history of depression and biomarkers of AD and CVD in patients with dementia in a clinical setting. A total of 126 patients from the University Health Network (UHN) Memory Clinic with comprehensive clinical evaluations, including neuropsychological testing and medical examinations, were included. Lumbar puncture was performed to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for biomarker analysis, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained to assess white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden. The presence of depression was determined through medical records. The study findings did not reveal significant differences between participants with and without a history of depression in terms of AD biomarkers, WMH burden, neurofilament light chain levels, cognitive scores, age of symptom onset, disease duration, or vascular risk scores. Logistic regression analysis did not indicate a meaningful predictive value of these variables for depression status. This clinical study contributes to our understanding regarding the association between depression and AD/CVD biomarkers in patients with cognitive impairment. Further research is needed to elucidate the complex relationship between depression and dementia and to explore the potential mechanisms linking depression, AD, and CVD.
