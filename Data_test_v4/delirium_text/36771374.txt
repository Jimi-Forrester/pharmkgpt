36771374|a|The Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels is reported to have medicinal properties, but its benefits on age-related neurological changes have not been previously explored. In the current study, after phytochemical analysis of the pulp of Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels fruit (Sy. cmi), young BALB/c mice have been supplemented with its 5, 15, and 30% dilution for 16 months, followed by behavioral experimentation and biochemical evaluation of isolated brains. The Sy. cmi has been found enriched with phenols/flavonoids while the occurrence of nine phytocompounds has been identified through GC-MS analysis. Further, Sy. cmi supplementation has caused significant (p < 0.05) protection from anxiety-like behavior in aged mice, and they have explored open, illuminated, and exposed areas of open field, light/dark, and an elevated plus maze, respectively. Furthermore, these animals have shown improved cognitive abilities as their percent (%) spontaneous alteration and novelty preference are significantly greater in T-maze and Y-maze and familiarity/novelty recognition tests. Further, Sy. cmi-supplemented mice remember the aversive stimuli zone and escape box location in passive avoidance and Barnes maze tests, and their brains have low levels of malondialdehyde and acetylcholinesterase with elevated antioxidant enzymes. The outcomes have provided scientific insight into the beneficial effects of Sy. cmi on age-associated amnesia that might be attributed to antioxidant and anticholinergic effects exerted by phytocompounds (caryophyllene, humulene, beta-Farnesene, and phytol) owned by Syzygium cumini.
