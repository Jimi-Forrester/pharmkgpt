35600167|t|Pheniramine induced supraventricular tachycardia resistant to adenosine: A case report and review.
35600167|a|Cardiac toxicity is a very seldom documented side effect of Pheniramine. Although second-generation antihistamines such as terfenadine and astemizole have been linked to cardiac injury, the incidence of SVT after Pheniramine treatment on adult clinical dose is currently unknown. In this case, we present a 22-year-old girl who developed adenosine-resistant supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) after being given pheniramine due to a bean allergy. It is crucial to know that symptomatic SVT could occur with therapeutic doses of pheniramine. This case highlights the importance of a comprehensive drug evaluation in emergency situations to identify the underlying etiologies and prompt treatment commencement. It also emphasizes the significance of assessing and choosing acute drugs for each patient admitted to the emergency unit to ensure the start of a newer medication if necessary.
