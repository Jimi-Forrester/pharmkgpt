33212810|t|Gene Modified CAR-T Cellular Therapy for Hematologic Malignancies.
33212810|a|With advances in the understanding of characteristics of molecules, specific antigens on the surface of hematological malignant cells were identified and multiple therapies targeting these antigens as neoplasm treatments were developed. Among them, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, which got United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for relapsed/refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) as well as for recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) within the past five years, and for r/r mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) this year, represents one of the most rapidly evolving immunotherapies. Nevertheless, its applicability to other hematological malignancies, as well as its efficacy and persistence are fraught with clinical challenges. Currently, more than one thousand clinical trials in CAR T-cell therapy are ongoing and its development is changing rapidly. This review introduces the current status of CAR T-cell therapy in terms of the basic molecular aspects of CAR T-cell therapy, its application in hematological malignancies, adverse reactions during clinical use, remaining challenges, and future utilization.
