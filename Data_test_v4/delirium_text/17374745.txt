17374745|a|Cholinergic receptors (AChR) are reported altered in brains from schizophrenic patients, and a growing body of evidence suggests that muscarinic receptor agonists exhibit antipsychotic potential. Centrally acting selective muscarinic receptor agonists are currently not available for clinical use, but acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, which indirectly stimulate AChR by blocking the breakdown of acetylcholine by AChE, are widely used in the clinic against Alzheimer's disease. AChE inhibitors have been reported to exhibit antipsychotic efficacy in Alzheimer's disease patients, and these compounds have also been investigated as adjunctive treatment to antipsychotic medication in schizophrenic patients with varying results. However, monotherapy with AChE inhibitors in schizophrenic patients has not been evaluated. We wanted to investigate the antipsychotic potential of the AChE inhibitor galantamine, which also allosterically potentiates nicotinic receptor stimulation. To this end, we investigated its ability to antagonize d-amphetamine-induced psychotic-like behavior in extrapyramidal side effects (EPS)-primed Cebus monkeys. Galantamine inhibited d-amphetamine-induced unrest, arousal, and stereotypy. Side effects such as emesis, sedation, and EPS were minor or not existing. The results indicate that AChE inhibitors have antipsychotic potentials and suggest that clinical trials investigating antipsychotic effects of AChE inhibitors as monotherapy would be of interest.
