The findings showed that the issues identified were comparable with those found in other parts of the UK. Over three quarters of the carers in the sample were women, and most were caring for a relative. Only a minority of carers mentioned dementia or Alzheimer's disease explicitly, but over half spoke of such problems as forgetfulness or confusion. Most carers felt well supported by family and neighbours. Levels of formal service provision were low, but most carers seemed to receive assistance that they needed. It is suggested that there is a need to develop a role for dementia care specialists. 31 references.
