26838997|t|Gene Therapy Strategies for Alzheimer's Disease: An Overview.
26838997|a|Key neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. The mechanisms underlying these neuropathological changes remain unclear. So far, research on AD therapy has had limited success in terms of symptomatic treatments although it has also had several failures for disease-modifying drugs. Gene transfer strategies to the brain have contributed to evaluate in animal models many interesting tracks, some of which should deserve clinical applications in AD patients in the future.
