29037336|t|Neuropsychiatry: Towards a Philosophy of Praxis.
29037336|a|Neuropsychiatry is a specialized clinical, academic and scientific discipline with its field located in the borderland territory between neurology and psychiatry. In this article, we approach the theoretical definition of neuropsychiatry, and in order to address the practical aspects of the discipline, we describe the profile of a neuropsychiatric liaison service in the setting of a large hospital for neurological diseases in a middle-income country. An audit of consecutive in-patients requiring neuropsychiatric assessment at the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery of Mexico is reported, comprising a total of 1212 patients. The main neurological diagnoses were brain infections (21%), brain neoplasms (17%), cerebrovascular disease (14%), epilepsy (8%), white matter diseases (5%), peripheral neuropathies (5%), extrapyramidal diseases (4%), ataxia (2%), and traumatic brain injury and related phenomena (1.8%). The most frequent neuropsychiatric diagnoses were delirium (36%), depressive disorders (16.4%), dementia (14%), anxiety disorders (8%), frontal syndromes (5%), adjustment disorders (4%), psychosis (3%), somatoform disorders (3%), and catatonia (3%). The borderland between neurology and psychiatry is a large territory that requires the knowledge and clinical skills of both disciplines, but also the unique expertise acquired in a clinical and academic neuropsychiatry program.
