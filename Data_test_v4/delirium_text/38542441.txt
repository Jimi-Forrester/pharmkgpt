38542441|t|The Impact of Sample Storage on Blood Methylation: Towards Assessing Myelin Gene Methylation as a Biomarker for Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.
38542441|a|One of the major challenges in multiple sclerosis (MS) is to accurately monitor and quantify disability over time. Thus, there is a pressing need to identify new biomarkers for disease progression. Peripheral blood DNA methylation has been demonstrated to be an easily accessible and quantifiable marker in many neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether methylation patterns that were previously determined in chronic inactive white matter lesions of patients with progressive MS are also reflected in the blood, and whether the latter can serve as a biomarker for disease progression in MS. While our initial analysis revealed differences in the blood methylation state of important myelin-related genes between patients with progressive MS and controls, these findings could not be validated in other independent patient cohorts. Subsequent investigation suggests that sample storage can selectively influence DNA methylation patterns, potentially hindering accurate epigenetic analysis. Therefore, sample storage time should be taken into consideration during the initial sample selection stage in biomarker studies.
