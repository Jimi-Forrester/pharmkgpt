32435162|t|Chest Trauma: Current Recommendations for Rib Fractures, Pneumothorax, and Other Injuries.
32435162|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides an overview of the common and important chest injuries that the anesthesiologist may encounter in patients following trauma including blunt injury, pneumothorax, hemothorax, blunt aortic injury, and blunt cardiac injury. RECENT FINDINGS: Rib fractures are frequently associated with chest injury and are associated with significant pain and other complications. Regional anesthesia techniques combined with a multimodal analgesic strategy can improve patient outcomes and reduce complications. There is increasing evidence for paravertebral blocks for this indication, and the myofascial plane blocks are a popular emerging technique. Recent changes to recommended management of tension pneumothorax are also described. SUMMARY: Chest trauma is commonly encountered, and anesthesiologists have the potential to significantly improve morbidity and mortality in this group of patients.
