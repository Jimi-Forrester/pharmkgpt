38304130|a|The most common aging-related neurodegenerative disorder is Alzheimer's disease (AD), of which the main symptom is memory disturbance. Though the mechanism of AD pathogenesis is not fully defined, abnormal aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques and tau have been considered as key factors and main histological hallmarks of the disease. Astrocyte is responsible for the control of cells and the environment around brain and spinal cord cells. Astrocytes have been implicated with AD. However, the exact function of astrocytes in AD has not been established. In this study, we investigated the regulation of astrocytes in the AD model using primary cultures. We have demonstrated that oligomerized Abeta is toxic to neurons and can induce cell death in primary cultures. In the primary cultures containing neurons and astrocytes, amyloid beta uptake was observed in both neurons and astrocytes. To verify if the uptake of amyloid beta in astrocytes is dependent on neurons, we separated and cultured primary astrocytes with no neurons. Amyloid uptake was still observed in this pure astrocyte culture, suggesting that the uptake of amyloid beta is a neuron-independent function of astrocytes. Astrocyte activation was observed in both pure and mixed cultures. Taken together, our data suggest that astrocyte is activated by oligomerized Abeta and uptakes it, which is independent of neurons.
