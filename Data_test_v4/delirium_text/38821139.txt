38821139|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: This review explores the link between Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and diabetes-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD). It emphasizes the shared pathophysiological links and mechanisms between the two conditions, focusing on reduced insulin levels and receptors, impaired glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative damage in AD-affected brains-paralleling aspects of T2DM. The review suggests AD as a "diabetes of the brain," supported by cognitive enhancement through antidiabetic interventions. It focuses on the traditionally used Indian herbs as a means to manage both conditions while addressing developmental challenges. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study explores the DM-AD connection, reviewing medicinal herbs with protective potential for both ailments, considering traditional uses and developmental challenges. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studied research, reviews, and ethnobotanical and scientific data from electronic databases and traditional books. RESULTS: The study analyzes the pathophysiological links between DM and AD, emphasizing their interconnected factors. Eight Ayurvedic plants with dual protective effects against T2DM and AD are thoroughly reviewed with preclinical/clinical evidence. Historical context, phytoconstituents, and traditional applications are explored. Innovative formulations using these plants are examined. Challenges stemming from phytoconstituents' physicochemical properties are highlighted, prompting novel formulation development, including nanotechnology-based delivery systems. The study uncovers obstacles in formulating treatments for these diseases. CONCLUSION: The review showcases the dual potential of chosen medicinal herbs against both diseases, along with their traditional applications, endorsing their use. It addresses formulation obstacles, proposing innovative delivery technologies for herbal therapies, while acknowledging their constraints. The review suggests the need for heightened investment and research in this area.
