35164216|t|Metabolic Features of Brain Function with Relevance to Clinical Features of Alzheimer and Parkinson Diseases.
35164216|a|Brain metabolism is comprised in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Since the brain primarily relies on metabolism of glucose, ketone bodies, and amino acids, aspects of these metabolic processes in these disorders-and particularly how these altered metabolic processes are related to oxidative and/or nitrosative stress and the resulting damaged targets-are reviewed in this paper. Greater understanding of the decreased functions in brain metabolism in AD and PD is posited to lead to potentially important therapeutic strategies to address both of these disorders, which cause relatively long-lasting decreased quality of life in patients.
