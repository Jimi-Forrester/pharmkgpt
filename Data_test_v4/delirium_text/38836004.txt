38836004|t|Research hotspots and trends of microRNAs in spinal cord injury: a comprehensive bibliometric analysis.
38836004|a|Background: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a nervous system disease leading to motor and sensory dysfunction below the injury level, and can result in paralysis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a key role in SCI treatment, and related research provides insights for SCI diagnosis and treatment. Bibliometrics is an important tool for literature statistics and evaluation, objectively summarizing multidimensional information. This study comprehensively overviews the field through bibliometric analysis of miRNA and SCI research, providing contemporary resources for future collaboration and clinical treatment. Materials and methods: In this study, we searched the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) database. After careful screening and data import, we extracted annual publications, citation counts, countries, institutions, authors, journals, highly cited articles, co-cited articles, keywords, and H-index. Bibliometrics and visualization analyses employed VOSviewer, CiteSpace, the R package "bibliometrix," and online analytic platforms. Using Arrowsmith, we determined miRNA-SCI relationships and discussed potential miRNA mechanisms in SCI. Results: From 2008 to 2024, the number of related papers increased annually, reaching 754. The number of yearly publications remained high and entered a period of rapid development. Researchers from 50 countries/regions, 802 institutions, 278 journals, and 3,867 authors participated in the field. Currently, China has advantages in the number of national papers, citations, institutions, and authors. However, it is necessary to strengthen cooperation among different authors, institutions, and countries to promote the production of important academic achievements. The research in the field currently focuses on nerve injury, apoptosis, and gene expression. Future research directions mainly involve molecular mechanisms, clinical trials, exosomes, and inflammatory reactions. Conclusion: Overall, this study comprehensively analyzes the research status and frontier of miRNAs in SCI. A systematic summary provides a complete and intuitive understanding of the relationship between SCI and miRNAs. The presented findings establish a basis for future research and clinical application in this field.
