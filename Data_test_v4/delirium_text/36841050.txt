36841050|t|Design, synthesis, and evaluation of hydrazones as dual inhibitors of ryanodine receptors and acetylcholinesterases for Alzheimer's disease.
36841050|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) implicates neuronal loss, plaque and neurofibrillary tangle formation, and disturbed neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis, which leads to severe dementia, memory loss, as well as thinking and behavioral perturbations that could ultimately lead to death. Calcium dysregulation and low acetylcholine levels are two main mechanisms implicated in Alzheimer's disease progression. Simultaneous inhibition of calcium oscillations (store overload-induced Ca2+ release [SOICR]) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by a single molecule may bring a new breath of hope for AD treatment. Here, we described some dantrolene derivatives as dual inhibitors of the ryanodine receptor and AChE. Two series of acylhydrazone/sulfonylhydrazone derivatives with aromaticgroup were designed and synthesized. In this study, the target compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit SOICR and AChE in vitro, using dantrolene and donepezil as positive controls. Compound 22a exhibited excellent and balanced inhibitory potency against SOICR (inhibition (%) = 90.1, IC50 = 0.162 muM) and AChE (inhibition (%) = 93.5, IC50 = 0.372 muM). Docking simulations showed that several preferred compounds could bind to the active sites of both the proteins, further validating the rationality of the design strategy. Potential therapeutic effects in AD were evaluated using the Barnes maze and Morris water maze tests, which demonstrated that compound 22a significantly improved memory and cognitive behavior in AD model mice. Moreover, it was also found that compound 22a could enhance synaptic strength by measuring hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in brain slices. These results suggested that the introduction of a sulfonyl-hydrazone scaffold and aromatic substitution to dantrolene derivatives provided a useful template for the development of potential chemical entities against AD.
