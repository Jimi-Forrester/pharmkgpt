34844738|t|Applications of covalent organic frameworks and their composites in the extraction of pesticides from different samples.
34844738|a|Pesticides are used extensively in a wide range of applications and due to their high rate of consumption, they are ubiquitous in the different media and samples like environment, water sources, air, soil, biological materials, wastes (liquids, solids or sludges), vegetables and fruits, where they can persist for long periods. Pesticides often have hazardous side effects and can cause a range of harmful diseases like Parkinson, Alzheimer, asthma, depression and anxiety, cancer, etc, even at low concentrations. To this end, extraction, pre-concentration and determination of pesticides from various samples presents significant challenges caused by sample complexity and the low concentrations of them in many samples. Often, direct extraction and determination of pesticides are impossible due to their low concentrations and the complexity of samples. The main goals of sample preparation are removing interfering species, pre-concentrating target analyte/s and converting the analytes into more stable forms (when needed). The most popular approach is solid-phase extraction due to its simplicity, efficiency, ease of operation and low cost. This method is based on using a wide variety of materials, among which covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can be identified as an emerging class of highly versatile materials exhibiting advantageous properties, such as a porous and crystalline structure, pre-designable structure, high physical and chemical stability, ease of modification, high surface area and high adsorption capacity. The present review will cover recent developments in synthesis and applications of COFs and their composites for extraction of pesticides, different synthesis approaches of COFs, possible mechanisms for interaction of COFs-based adsorbents with pesticides and finally, future prospects and challenges in the fabrication and utilization of COFs and their composites for extraction of pesticides.
