32970160|a|BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is one of the most frequent causes of neurocognitive impairment in intensive care patients. It is associated with increased hospital mortality and poor long-term neurocognitive outcome. To date there are no evidence-based recommendations for the diagnostics and neuromonitoring of SAE. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the current clinical practice of diagnostics and neuromonitoring of SAE on intensive care units (ICU) in Germany. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on available literature focusing on SAE, a questionnaire consisting of 26 items was designed and forwarded to 438 members of the Scientific Working Group for Intensive Care Medicine (WAKI) and the Scientific Working Group for Neuroanesthesia (WAKNA) as an online survey. RESULTS: The total participation rate in the survey was 12.6% (55/438). A standardized diagnostic procedure of SAE was reported by 21.8% (12/55) of the participants. The majority of participants preferred delirium screening tools (50/55; 90.9%) and the clinical examination (49/55; 89.1%) to detect SAE. Brain imaging (26/55; 47.3%), laboratory/biomarker determination (15/55; 27.3%), electrophysiological techniques (14/55; 25.5%) and cerebrospinal fluid examination (12/55; 21.8%) are less frequently performed. The follow-up examination of SAE is most frequently performed by a clinical examination (45/55; 81.8%). Neuromonitoring techniques, such as continuous electroencephalography (31/55; 56.4%), transcranial doppler sonography (31/55; 56.4%) and near-infrared spectroscopy (18/55, 32.7%) are not frequently used. We observed statistically significant differences between the theoretically attributed importance and clinical practice. The great majority of respondents (48/55; 87.3%) endorse the development of guidelines containing recommendations for diagnostics and neuromonitoring in SAE. DISCUSSION: This explorative survey demonstrated a great heterogeneity in diagnostics and neuromonitoring of SAE in German ICUs. Uniform concepts have not yet been established but are desired by the majority of study participants. Innovative biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury in blood and cerebrospinal fluid as well as electrophysiological and brain imaging techniques could provide valuable prognostic information on the neurocognitive outcome of patients and would thus be a useful addition to the clinical assessment of ICU patients with SAE.
