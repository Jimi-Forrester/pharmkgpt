35449023|a|BACKGROUND: Body mass index was intimately associated with islet function, which was affected by various confounding factors. Among all methods of statistical analysis, Mendelian randomization best ruled out bias to find the causal relationship. In the present study, we explored the relationship between 13 East Asian body mass index-related genes reported previously and islet function using the Mendelian randomization method. METHODS: A total of 2892 participants residing in northern China were enrolled. Anthropological information, such as sex, age, drinking status, smoking status, weight, height and blood pressure, was recorded for all participants. Fasting glucose and insulin were detected, and the insulin sensitivity index was calculated. 13 single nucleotide polymorphismss in East Asian body mass index -related genes were analysed with the ABI7900HT system. RESULTS: Five genetic locus mutations, CDKAL1, MAP2K5, BDNF, FTO and SEC16B, were found to be associated with body mass index and were used to estimate the genetic risk score. We found that the genetic risk score was negatively associated with the insulin sensitivity index. Even after adjusted of confounding factors, the relationship showed statistical significance. A subsequent interaction effect analysis suggested that the negative relationship between the genetic risk score and insulin sensitivity index no longer existed in the nondrinking population, and smokers had a stronger negative relationship than nonsmokers. CONCLUSION: We found a negative causal relationship between body mass index-related genetic locus mutations and insulin resistance, which might be increased by acquired lifestyle factors, such as drinking and smoking status.
