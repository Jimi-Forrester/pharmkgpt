17475957|t|Comparison of regional brain volume and glucose metabolism between patients with mild dementia with lewy bodies and those with mild Alzheimer's disease.
17475957|a|UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was to investigate regional differences between morphologic and functional changes in patients with mild dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) compared with those with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Twenty patients with very mild DLB (mean age, 74.5 y; mean Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score, 24.0), 20 patients with very mild AD (mean age, 74.1 y; mean MMSE score, 24.0), and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (normal controls [NC]) underwent both (18)F-FDG PET and 3-dimensional spoiled gradient echo MRI. Fully automatic volumetry of the MRI data was used to obtain whole brain, hippocampal, occipital, and striatal volumes, which were compared with the results of a similar analysis of glucose metabolic data. RESULTS: In DLB patients, volumetric data indicated a significant volume decrease in the striatum, whereas (18)F-FDG PET showed significant glucose metabolic reductions in the temporal, parietal, and frontal areas--including in the occipital lobe--compared with those in the NC group. In contrast, in AD patients, both the hippocampal volume and glucose metabolism were significantly decreased, whereas the occipital volume and metabolism were preserved. CONCLUSION: Comparison of very mild DLB and AD revealed different morphologic and metabolic changes occurring in the medial temporal lobes and the occipital lobe, demonstrating characteristic pathophysiologic differences between these 2 diseases.
