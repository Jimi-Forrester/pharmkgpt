36310205|t|A Validated Method to Prepare Stable Tau Oligomers.
36310205|a|There is growing evidence that tau oligomers are a major pathological species in a number of tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease. However, it is still unclear what exact mechanisms underlie tau oligomer-mediated dysfunction. Studies of tau oligomers in vitro are limited by the high propensity for aggregation and consequent changes in the aggregation state of the produced tau samples over time. In this protocol, we provide a step-by-step description of a validated method for producing stable and structurally characterized oligomers of tau that can be used in biochemical, cellular, and animal model studies to evaluate mechanisms of action of tau in tauopathies.
