34382380|a|Pregabalin is a drug that can cause psychiatric symptoms via pregabalin withdrawal. Prior reports on pregabalin withdrawal have mainly focused on cases with pregabalin dependence or abuse, and little attention has been paid to patients who are prescribed regular doses of pregabalin. Herein, we report three cases of pregabalin withdrawal in patients without psychiatric disorders, taking regular doses of pregabalin, who developed psychiatric symptoms such as insomnia and anxiety after abrupt discontinuation of pregabalin. In addition, we conducted a systematic review of six case reports (previous studies) of pregabalin withdrawal under regular doses of pregabalin. Among the six cases, three patients had no comorbid mental or substance use disorders, the dose of pregabalin ranged from 150 to 600 mg/d, and the duration of pregabalin use ranged from a few weeks to many years. Of these six cases of pregabalin withdrawal, five had psychopathological symptoms, three had vegetative symptoms, and three had neurologic and physical complications. We concluded that since pregabalin withdrawal can occur even with regular doses and short-term use, clinicians must carefully reduce pregabalin doses when reducing or discontinuing treatment, paying close attention to withdrawal symptoms. Our case series sheds light on the scant evidence from previous research on physical dependence in patients who are taking regular doses of pregabalin. Furthermore, our cases were also valuable in demonstrating that pregabalin withdrawal can occur even after a relatively short period of 2 months.
