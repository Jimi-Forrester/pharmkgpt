38926843|a|The dried rattan stem of the Fibraurea Recisa Pierre plant contains the active ingredient known as fibrauretine (FN). Although it greatly affects Alzheimer's disease (AD), the mechanism of their effects still remains unclear. Proteomics and transcriptomics analysis methods were used in this study to determine the mechanism of FN in the treatment of AD. AD model is used through bilateral hippocampal injection of Abeta1-40. After successful modeling, FN was given for 30 days. The results showed that FN could improve the cognitive dysfunction of AD model rats, reduce the expression of Abeta and P-Tau, increase the content of acetylcholine and reduce the activity of acetylcholinesterase. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enriched differentially expressed genes and proteins are involved in signaling pathways including metabolic pathway, AD, pathway in cancer, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, and cAMP signaling pathway. Transcriptomics and proteomics sequencing resulted in 19 differentially expressed genes and proteins. Finally, in contrast to the model group, after FN treatment, the protein expressions and genes associated with the PI3K-AKT pathway were significantly improved in RT-qPCR and Western blot and assays. This is consistent with the findings of transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. Our study found that, FN may improve some symptoms of AD model rats through PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.
