34737114|a|The objective of this study was to improve effectiveness of resveratrol (RES) through brain targeting by the intranasal olfactory mucosa for the treatment Alzheimer's disease (AD). To attain this, chitosan coated bilosomes (non ionic surfactant vesicles stabilized by bile salts, loaded with RES and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) were prepared and incorporated into sodium alginate/PVP wafers. In vitro characterization of bilosomes including colloidal characteristics, entrapment efficiency and in vitro release was carried out. Hydration capacity, porosity percentage, morphology and in vitro release for selected wafer formulation were also investigated. Particle size of selected bilosomes, CS coated bilosome and SPION bilosomes was 208, 238 and 243 nm, respectively and they provided sustained RES release for 24 h. Both formulations were loaded in wafers and intra-nasally administered in mice with lipopolysaccharide induced AD model. Neurobehavioral tests, AD markers analysis, RT-PCR, western blotting and histopathological evaluation of the dissected brains were carried out. Results revealed the superiority of SPION bilosomes over conventional bilosomes and RES suspension in improving cognitive and memory functions, reduction of pro-inflammatory markers levels and down regulation of expression of NF-kappaB and P38. This may be attributed to enhanced RES therapeutic effects upon nanoencapsulation, loading into wafers, nasal administration and enhanced targeting the application of an external magnetic field.
