34098525|a|OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the value of resting-state EEG source biomarkers to characterize mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects with an Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile and to track neurodegeneration throughout the AD continuum. We further applied a resting-state functional MRI (fMRI)-driven model of source reconstruction and tested its advantage in terms of AD diagnostic accuracy. METHODS: Thirty-nine consecutive patients with AD dementia (ADD), 86 amnestic MCI, and 33 healthy subjects enter the EEG study. All ADD subjects, 37 out of 86 MCI patients and a distinct group of 53 healthy controls further entered the fMRI study. MCI subjects were divided according to the CSF phosphorylated tau/beta amyloid-42 ratio (MCIpos: >= 0.13, MCIneg: < 0.13). Using Exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA), EEG lobar current densities were estimated at fixed frequencies and analyzed. To combine the two imaging techniques, networks mostly affected by AD pathology were identified using Independent Component Analysis applied to fMRI data of ADD subjects. Current density EEG analysis within ICA-based networks at selected frequency bands was performed. Afterwards, graph analysis was applied to EEG and fMRI data at ICA-based network level. RESULTS: ADD patients showed a widespread slowing of spectral density. At a lobar level, MCIpos subjects showed a widespread higher theta density than MCIneg and healthy subjects; a lower beta2 density than healthy subjects was also found in parietal and occipital lobes. Evaluating EEG sources within the ICA-based networks, alpha2 band distinguished MCIpos from MCIneg, ADD and healthy subjects with good accuracy. Graph analysis on EEG data showed an alteration of connectome configuration at theta frequency in ADD and MCIpos patients and a progressive disruption of connectivity at alpha2 frequency throughout the AD continuum. CONCLUSIONS: Theta frequency is the earliest and most sensitive EEG marker of AD pathology. Furthermore, EEG/fMRI integration highlighted the role of alpha2 band as potential neurodegeneration biomarker.
