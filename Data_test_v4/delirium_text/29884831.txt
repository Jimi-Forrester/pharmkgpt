29884831|a|Blood brain barrier (BBB) cells play key roles in the physiology and pathology of the central nervous system (CNS). BBB dysfunction is implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The BBB consists of capillary endothelial cells, pericytes encircling the endothelium and surrounding astrocytes extending their processes towards it. Although there have been many attempts to develop in vitro BBB models, the complex interaction between these cell types makes it extremely difficult to determine their individual contribution to neurotoxicity in vivo. Thus, we developed and optimised an in vitro multicellular co-culture model within the Kirkstall Quasi Vivo System. The main aim was to determine the optimal environment to culture human brain primary endothelial cells, pericytes and astrocytes whilst maintaining cellular communication without formation of a barrier in order to assess the contribution of each cell type to the overall response. As a proof of concept for the present system, the effects of amyloid-beta 25-35 peptide (Abeta25-35), a hallmark of AD, were explored. This multicellular system will be a valuable tool for future studies on the specific roles of individual BBB cell type (while making connection with each other through medium) in CNS disorders as well as in cytotoxicity tests.
