39549093|a|Sepsis-associated encephalopathy is a common neurological complication of sepsis that is characterized by neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis, which results in cognitive impairments in septic survivors. Despite numerous treatment options for this condition, none of them are definite. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the impact of morin, a flavone known for its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, against lipopolysaccharides-induced sepsis-associated encephalopathy in albino mice for 7 days. Mice were divided into 4 groups: Negative control, morin, septic, and septic morin-treated mice. Sepsis was induced by a single injection of lipopolysaccharides (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), morin (50 mg/kg b. wt.) was given orally, starting from 5 h after sepsis induction, then daily for 4 other days. Morin ameliorated septic structural and functional alternations as manifested by improving the survival rate, the behavioral functions, in addition to preserving and protecting the brain tissue. This was accompanied with the augmentation of the total antioxidant capacity, as well as the suppression of tissue levels of the lipid peroxidation marker malondialdehyde, apoptosis (cleaved-caspase-3), glial fibrillary acidic protein, and the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor. In conclusion, morin has a promising ameliorative effect to counteract the sepsis-associated encephalopathy via its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and to prevent the associated cognitive impairments.
