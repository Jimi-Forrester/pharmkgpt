37193432|t|A Rare Case Report of Acute Neurologic Sequelae in a Young Primigravida With Recent COVID Pneumonia.
37193432|a|Post-infectious neurological sequelae, particularly in the pediatric population, are a rarely observed and under-explored complication of COVID-19. Few case reports exist detailing severe neurological sequelae following acute infection with COVID-19, such as encephalopathy, stroke, and coma. This case report details the diagnosis and treatment of a 16-year-old primigravida with no past medical history who presented to the emergency department with rhythmic tremors, urinary incontinence, and generalized weakness two weeks following initial COVID-19 diagnosis with admission for pneumonia and sepsis. Vital signs were remarkable for tachycardia and normotension. Shortly following admission, she experienced generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity. Neurologic evaluation was remarkable for electroencephalogram with frontally predominant generalized periodic discharges and magnetic resonance imaging of the head showing bilateral parafalcine restricted diffusion. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis and magnetic resonance imaging of the spine were unremarkable. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome and an anterior cerebral artery stroke. Throughout the patient's recovery, she demonstrated incoherent, delirious, and disinhibited behavior that resolved within several days. She was ultimately discharged to a skilled rehabilitation facility with follow-up in a neurology clinic.
