37873754|t|Changes in cardiac-driven perivascular fluid movement around the MCA in a pharmacological model of acute hypertension detected with non-invasive MRI.
37873754|a|Perivascular spaces mediate a complex interaction between cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue that may be an important pathway for solute waste clearance. Their structural or functional derangement may contribute to the development of age-related neurogenerative conditions. Here, we employed a non-invasive low b-value diffusion-weighted ECG-gated MRI method to capture perivascular fluid movement around the middle cerebral artery of the anaesthetised rat brain. Using this method, we show that such MRI estimates of perivascular fluid movement directionality are highly sensitive to the cardiac cycle. We then show that these measures of fluid movement directionality are decreased in the angiotensin-II pharmacological model of acute hypertension, with an associated dampening of vessel pulsatility. This translational MRI method may, therefore, be useful to monitor derangement of perivascular fluid movement associated with cardiovascular pathologies, such as hypertension, in order to further our understanding of perivascular function in neurology.
