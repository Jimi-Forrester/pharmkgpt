29125117|a|Alzheimer's disease(AD) is a chronic degenerative disease of the nervous system,and the pathological change of AD is the formation of senile plaques containing amyloid beta(Abeta) and the neurofibrillary tangles. AD patients and animal models exhibit the over activation of microglia(MG) and astrocytes,causing neuroinflammation,leading to neuron death. Inhibition of MG activity can alleviate Abeta plaques. A growing number of studies have found that neuroinflammation is involved in the development and progression of AD. This article reviews the role of neuroinflammation induced by MG,astrocytes,T lymphocyte,and monocyte-derived macrophages in the mechanism of AD.
