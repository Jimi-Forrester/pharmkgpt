35556151|a|INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Overactive bladder (OAB) affects up to 43% of women. Treatment ranges from lifestyle modification to invasive therapies. Nearly 75% of patients report using the internet to gain health information creating a need for interpretable, online resources. This study is aimed at evaluating the readability of online resources for OAB treatment in the US population. METHODS: Google and Bing were queried regarding "sacral neuromodulation," "peripheral tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS)," and "bladder botox." The first 20 results from each search engine were assessed, representing over 90% of accessed search results. Websites were categorized as institutional/reference, commercial, nonprofit, or personal. The Gunning fog (GF), Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG), and Dale-Chall (DC) validated readability scores were used to assess results. RESULTS: Sacral neuromodulation yielded 27 eligible results. The associated mean readability scores correlated with levels of college senior (GF), high school junior (SMOG), and college level (DC). PTNS yielded 31 eligible results. The associated mean readability scores correlated with levels of college senior (GF), high school senior (SMOG), and college level (DC). Bladder botox yielded 17 eligible results. The associated mean readability scores correlated with levels of college sophomore (GF), high school junior (SMOG), and college level (DC). There was no difference between the therapies regarding readability. Sixty-one percent of websites were institutional/reference, 24% were commercial, 13% were nonprofit, and 2% were personal. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of reading comprehension are required by the general US population to understand OAB information obtained through the internet. These findings highlight a need for simplification of online resources pertaining to OAB.
