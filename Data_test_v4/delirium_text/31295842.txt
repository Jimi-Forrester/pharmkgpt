31295842|a|The use of food supplements or functional food has significantly increased in the past decades, especially to compensate both the modern lifestyle and the food shortages of the industrialized countries. Despite food supplements are habitually intended to correct nutritional deficiencies or to support specific physiological functions, they are often combined with common drug therapies to improve the patient's health and/or mitigate the symptoms of many chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cystic fibrosis, cancer, liver and gastrointestinal diseases. In recent years, increased attentions are given to the patient's diet, and the use of food supplements and functional food rich in vitamins and antioxidants plays a very important role in the treatment and prevention of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Natural compounds, phytochemicals, vitamins, and minerals can prevent, delay, or alleviate the clinical symptoms of PD in contrast to some of the main physiopathological mechanisms involved in the development of the disease, like oxidative stress, free radical formation, and neuroinflammation. The purpose of this review is to collect scientific evidences which support the use of specific biomolecules and biogenic elements commonly found in food supplements or functional food to improve the clinical framework of patients with PD.
