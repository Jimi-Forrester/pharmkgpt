35545977|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: Older adults, especially in isolation and with cognitive decline/dementia, can become more anxious and stressed during the quarantine. All these symptoms negatively affect the psycho-physical health of their caregivers. This study aimed to synthesize the current evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on caregivers' mental health. METHODS: A rapid systematic review was conducted using the following databases: Pubmed/Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, and PsycInfo (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020215485). The 'PRISMA' flow chart guided the selection of articles. The search was entirely performed up to September 15th, 2021. RESULTS: The narrative synthesis has brought out two main themes that represent the current debate in literature: "Family caregivers COVID-19 related stress", and "(Mal)adaptive strategies to the "new" normality". CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an evidence synthesis of the negative mental health impact experienced by caregivers of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.
