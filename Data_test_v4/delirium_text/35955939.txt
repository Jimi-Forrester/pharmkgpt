35955939|a|Dexmedetomidine (Dex), widely used as a sedative in surgical procedures and intensive care units, induces sympatholytic, anxiolytic, analgesic, and sedative effects. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is routinely observed in postoperative care following surgery and general anesthesia. The NLRP3 inflammasome complex plays a critical role in innate immune response by detecting pathogenic microorganisms and activating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Although there are numerous protective effects of Dex among the neurological diseases, specific mechanisms including NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation via oxidative stress response in a POCD model are not fully understood. Here, we investigated whether Dex exhibits neurocognitive effects through the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in a POCD mouse model using a neurobehavioral test and ELISA analysis. We also confirmed the level of oxidative stress-related response in the in vitro system in the POCD model. Furthermore, we evaluated the NLRP3 inflammasome complex by immunoprecipitation analysis. In summary, the results of the present study indicated that Dex showed a neuroprotective effect in the POCD model by reducing oxidative stress response through NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation.
