33578953|t|Preoperative Cognitive Impairment and the Prevalence of Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Cancer Patients-A Prospective Observational Study.
33578953|a|Preoperative cognitive impairment (PCI) in cancer patients includes a broad spectrum of neurocognitive changes produced by complex interplay of patient, tumoural and treatment-related factors. Reduced preoperative cognitive reserve can favour the emergence of postoperative delirium (POD). The study aims to document PCI prevalence and to assess the relationship with POD in elderly cancer patients. The prospective observational study included consecutive patients scheduled for elective surgery; PCI was assessed with Mini-Cog test and defined at a score <= 3, POD was screened using Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC) and defined at a score >= 2. Data on education, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, preoperative medications, substance use, comorbidities, sensorial deficits, surgery and anaesthesia type, anaesthetic drugs, Mini-Cog score, postoperative pain, Nu-DESC were collected. In total, 131 patients were enrolled, mean age 72.1 +- 5.9 years. PCI prevalence was 51.9% (n = 68). POD prevalence was 19.8% (n = 26), with significantly higher value in PCI patients (27.9% vs. 11.1%, p = 0.016). In multivariate analysis, Mini-Cog score <= 3 (OR = 2.6, p = 0.027), clock draw (OR: 2.9, p = 0.013), preoperative renal dysfunction (OR = 2.6, p = 0.012), morphine (OR = 2.7, p = 0.007), metoclopramide (OR = 6.6, p = 0.006), and high pain score (OR = 1.8, p = 0.018) had a significant association with POD development. In this sample of elderly patients, PCI had a high prevalence and predicted the emergence of POD. Incorporating Mini-Cog test into the preoperative evaluation of onco-geriatric patients seems valuable and feasible.
