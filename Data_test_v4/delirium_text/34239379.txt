34239379|a|Background: The incidence of myocarditis in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unknown; however, increasing evidence links COVID-19 to cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, fulminant myocarditis, and cardiac death. We present a case of suspected COVID-19-induced myopericarditis and discuss the diagnostic implications, pathophysiology, and management. Case Report: A 72-year-old female was admitted to the hospital with acute on chronic respiratory failure in the setting of COVID-19. The next day, she developed pressure-like retrosternal chest pain. Laboratory findings revealed elevated cardiac enzymes and inflammatory markers consistent with myocardial injury. Electrocardiogram revealed diffuse ST segment elevations without reciprocal changes, concerning for myopericarditis. Transthoracic echocardiography showed new findings of severely reduced left ventricular (LV) systolic function, with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. Her hospital course was further complicated by cardiogenic shock that required treatment in the intensive care unit with vasopressors and inotropes. During the next few days, she had almost full recovery of her LV function, with EF improving to 50%. However, her clinical status deteriorated, likely the result of a bowel obstruction. She was transitioned to comfort care at the request of her family, and she died shortly after. Conclusion: This case highlights diagnostic and therapeutic challenges that physicians may encounter when managing acute cardiac injury in the setting of COVID-19. The multiple mechanisms of COVID-19-related myocardial injury may influence the approach to diagnosis and treatment.
