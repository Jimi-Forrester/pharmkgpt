21418518|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the aggregation and deposition of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in the brain. Soluble Abeta oligomers are thought to be toxic. To investigate the predominant species of Abeta protein that may play a role in AD pathogenesis, we performed biochemical analysis of AD and control brains. Sucrose buffer-soluble brain lysates were characterized in native form using blue native (BN)-PAGE and also in denatured form using SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. BN-PAGE analysis revealed a high-molecular weight smear (>1000 kD) of Abeta(42) -positive material in the AD brain, whereas low-molecular weight and monomeric Abeta species were not detected. SDS-PAGE analysis, on the other hand, allowed the detection of prominent Abeta monomer and dimer bands in AD cases but not in controls. Immunoelectron microscopy of immunoprecipitated oligomers and protofibrils/fibrils showed spherical and protofibrillar Abeta-positive material, thereby confirming the presence of high-molecular weight Abeta (hiMWAbeta) aggregates in the AD brain. In vitro analysis of synthetic Abeta(40) - and Abeta(42)  preparations revealed Abeta fibrils, protofibrils, and hiMWAbeta oligomers that were detectable at the electron microscopic level and after BN-PAGE. Further, BN-PAGE analysis exhibited a monomer band and less prominent low-molecular weight Abeta (loMWAbeta) oligomers. In contrast, SDS-PAGE showed large amounts of loMWAbeta but no hiMWAbeta(40)  and strikingly reduced levels of hiMWAbeta(42) . These results indicate that hiMWAbeta aggregates, particularly Abeta(42)  species, are most prevalent in the soluble fraction of the AD brain. Thus, soluble hiMWAbeta aggregates may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD either independently or as a reservoir for release of loMWAbeta oligomers.
