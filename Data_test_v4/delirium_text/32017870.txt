32017870|t|Nanoemulsions for targeting the neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Prion's.
32017870|a|Neurodegenerative diseases need the drugs to be delivered right inside the brain to maximizing the therapeutic effects. This can be achieved by use of novel targeted delivery systems such as nanoemulsions. Nanoemulsions (NE) are nano-sized emulsions that are manufactured for enhancing the delivery of drugs to the targeted site and minimize adverse effects and toxic reactions. Looking into the advanced pharmaceutical applications of NE, the present review gives an insight to the understanding of the application of NE in NDs like AD, PD and Prion's disease. The review also touches upon the pathophysiology of these ND diseases to have a clear understanding of the molecular aspects of the disease. Finally, the review sets a standpoint of nanoemulsion's significance in the treatment therapy of ND besides the drawbacks associated with the current drug therapy in NDs.
