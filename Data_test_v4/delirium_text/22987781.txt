22987781|t|Characterization of plasma beta-secretase (BACE1) activity and soluble amyloid precursor proteins as potential biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.
22987781|a|Reduction in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta42 (Abeta42) and elevation in total tau and phospho-thr181 tau consistently differentiate between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-matched control subjects. In contrast, CSF beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme activity (BACE1) and soluble amyloid precursor proteins alpha and beta (sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta) are without consistent patterns in AD subjects. Plasma sampling is much easier, with fewer side effects, and is readily applied in primary care centers, so we have developed and validated novel plasma BACE activity, sAPPbeta, and sAPPalpha assays and investigated their ability to distinguish AD from age-matched controls. Plasma BACE activity assay was sensitive and specific, with signal being immunodepleted with a specific BACE1 antibody and inhibited with a BACE1-specific inhibitor. Plasma sAPPbeta and sAPPalpha assays were specific, with signal diluting linearly, immunodepleted with specific antibodies, and at background levels in APP knockout mice. In rhesus monkeys, BACE1 but not gamma-secretase inhibitor led to significant lowering of plasma sAPPbeta with concurrent elevation of plasma sAPPalpha. AD subjects showed a significant increase in plasma BACE1 activity, sAPPbeta, sAPPalpha, and Abeta42 (P < 0.001) compared with age-matched controls. In conclusion, plasma BACE activity and sAPP endpoints provide novel investigative biomarkers for AD diagnosis and potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers for secretase inhibitor studies.
