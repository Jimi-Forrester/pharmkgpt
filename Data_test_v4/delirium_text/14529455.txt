14529455|a|In addition to synapse loss, neurofibrillary tangles, and neurodegeneration, oxidative stress and amyloid beta-peptide [Abeta] deposition are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease [AD] brain. Our laboratory coupled these two characteristics of AD into a comprehensive model to account for the synapse loss and neurodegeneration in AD brain. This model combines much of the extant studies on AD and is based on oxidative stress associated with amyloid beta-peptide. This review presents evidence in support of this model and provides insight into the molecular basis of this devastating dementing disorder.
