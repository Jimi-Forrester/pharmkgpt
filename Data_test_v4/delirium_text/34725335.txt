34725335|a|Over the last 20 years, the efforts to develop new therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD) have focused not only on the improvement of symptomatic therapy for motor and non-motor symptoms but also on the discovering of the potential causes of PD, in order to develop disease-modifying treatments. The emerging role of dysregulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the onset and progression of PD, as well as of other neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), renders the targeting of this signaling an attractive therapeutic opportunity for curing this brain disorder. The natriuretic peptides (NPs) atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), are cardiac and vascular-derived hormones also widely expressed in mammalian CNS, where they seem to participate in numerous brain functions including neural development/differentiation and neuroprotection. We recently demonstrated that ANP affects the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway possibly through a Frizzled receptor-mediated mechanism and that it acts as a neuroprotective agent in in vitro models of PD by upregulating this signaling. Here we provide further evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of this class of natriuretic hormones. Specifically, we demonstrate that all the three natriuretic peptides are neuroprotective for SHSY5Y cells and primary cultures of DA neurons from mouse brain, subjected to neurotoxin insult with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) for mimicking the neurodegeneration of PD, and these effects are associated with the activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Moreover, ANP, BNP, CNP are able to improve and accelerate the dopaminergic differentiation and maturation of hiPSCs-derived neural population obtained from two differed healthy donors, concomitantly affecting the canonical Wnt signaling. Our results support the relevance of exogenous ANP, BNP, and CNP as attractive molecules for both neuroprotection and neurorepair in PD, and more in general, in NDs for which aberrant Wnt signaling seems to be the leading pathogenetic mechanism.
