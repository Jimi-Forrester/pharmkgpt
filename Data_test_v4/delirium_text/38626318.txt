38626318|a|INTRODUCTION: Carcinoid tumors are rare neuroendocrine tumors; about 5% of patients develop the carcinoid syndrome. We present the case of a patient with carcinoid syndrome undergoing cardiac surgery. CASE REPORT: A 74-year-old patient with carcinoid heart disease and hepatic metastases underwent double valve replacement and CABG. The patient was on octreotide therapy and antihypertensive medication. An octreotide infusion was commenced perioperatively. Pharmaceutical agents that could potentially precipitate histamine release or exacerbate catecholamine secretion and carcinoid crises were avoided. Postoperatively, recovery was complicated by atrial fibrillation, chest infection, pleural effusions, acute kidney injury and delirium. DISCUSSION: Hepatic metastases cause systemic hormones' secretion, which cause a carcinoid crisis. Perioperative administration of octreotide is used, while vigilance is required to differentiate between hemodynamic effects related to the operation or disease specific factors. CONCLUSION: No carcinoid crisis was evident perioperatively. High vigilance with appropriate monitoring, aggressive management combined with meticulous choice of pharmaceutical agents led to this outcome.
