39337067|t|Efficacy of Postoperative Oral Nutritional Supplements in Geriatric Hip Fracture Patients Undergoing Total Hip Arthroplasty.
39337067|a|Background/Objectives: Geriatric hip fracture patients have an increased risk of malnutrition. Proper nutritional supply in the perioperative period is very important for their recovery. Oral nutritional supplements (ONSs) are recommended in geriatric hip fracture patients to improve dietary intake and prevent complications. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of postoperative ONSs after total hip arthroplasty in geriatric hip fracture patients. Methods: A retrospective study of elderly patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty for hip fracture was conducted. Data from patients who received ONSs postoperatively until hospital discharge (ONS group, n = 69) were compared with patients who did not receive ONSs (control group, n = 168). Laboratory test results, including serum protein and albumin levels, length of hospital stay, and the incidence of postoperative medical complications of the two groups, were analyzed. Results: Preoperative serum protein and albumin levels were significantly higher in the control group (p = 0.002 and p = 0.010, respectively). However, the degree of decline for both protein and albumin levels was significantly less in the ONS group (p < 0.001 for both). Serum albumin levels were significantly higher in the ONS group at postoperative two-week follow-up (p = 0.006). The length of hospital stay was shorter in the ONS group (p < 0.001). The incidence of postoperative delirium was significantly higher in the control group (p = 0.007). Conclusions: In geriatric hip fracture patients, postoperative ONSs can improve postoperative nutritional status, shorten the length of hospital stay, and reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium.
