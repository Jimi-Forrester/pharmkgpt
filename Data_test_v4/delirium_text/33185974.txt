33185974|t|Perceptions of current occupational therapy practice with older adults experiencing delirium.
33185974|a|OBJECTIVES: To describe the perceptions of Australian occupational therapists of their role, knowledge and skills in enabling older adults with delirium to participate in meaningful occupations. METHODS: This is a mixed-methods cross-sectional study. Participants (n = 91) completed an online survey, with quantitative data analysed descriptively and qualitative data subjected to content analysis. RESULTS: Occupational therapists had good general delirium knowledge, but less understanding of specific risk factors. Participants asserted the importance of occupational therapy assessment and treatment for older people experiencing delirium and generally felt confident or somewhat confident in their skills. While all participants provided collaborative care with multidisciplinary team members, only a minority thought colleagues had a satisfactory knowledge of the occupational therapy role with delirium. CONCLUSION: Currently, the role of occupational therapy with older people experiencing delirium remains emerging rather than established, and there are many opportunities for further research and development in this practice area.
