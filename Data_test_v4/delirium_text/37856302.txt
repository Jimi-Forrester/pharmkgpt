37856302|a|PURPOSE: To identify patient characteristics and perioperative factors associated with non-home patient discharges and the impact of current delirium nursing interventions on discharge disposition, especially non-home dispositions. METHODS: A retrospective pilot chart review was conducted using electronic health records from five networked hospitals in the Mountain West region of the US. The sample comprised 75 randomly selected patients aged 65 or older who screened positive for delirium during hospitalization. Relationships between patient characteristics, nursing interventions, and discharge dispositions were analyzed using chi-square tests and logistic regression. RESULTS: Most participants (69.3%) were discharged to non-home facilities. Delayed urinary catheter removal was a significant nursing intervention factor. Patients with delayed urinary catheter removal were at increased risk of being discharged to a non-home setting compared with those with early urinary catheter removal (aOR: 14.11, P = .010). Preoperative hypoalbuminemia and surgery durations exceeding 60 minutes were associated with non-home dispositions. CONCLUSION: Delayed urinary catheter removal, surgery duration greater than 1 hour, and preoperative hypoalbuminemia increased the likelihood of non-home discharge placement for older adults who experience postoperative delirium.
