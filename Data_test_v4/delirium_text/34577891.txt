34577891|a|Background and Objectives: Type 2 diabetes is one of the common chronic diseases in the elderly. It is thought that long-term complications of type 2 diabetes will negatively affect the quality of life in elderly individuals. It is possible that geriatric syndromes, especially frailty syndrome, are associated with diabetic complications, too. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of macrovascular and microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes on frailty and other geriatric syndromes. In addition, the effect of these complications on quality of life was also reviewed. Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study for four months. Comprehensive geriatric assessment tests were done on all patients. The Fried frailty index (FFI) was used for the evaluation of frailty syndrome. We assessed malnutrition by mini nutritional assessment short-form (MNA-SF), and Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition criteria (GLIM). The EWGSOP 2 criteria were used for the diagnosis of sarcopenia. Quality of life (QoL) was evaluated using the short form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. Data analysis was done by SPSS version 22. Results: 237 females and 142 males with a mean age of 71.7 +- 6.1 years were included in the study. The frequency of macrovascular and microvascular complications was 41.4% and 68.1%, respectively. Frailty was found to be associated with macrovascular complications (p = 0.003). Handgrip strength, skeletal muscle mass index, and gait speed were decreased in the presence of macrovascular complications (p = 0.043, p < 0.001, p < 0.001). QoL was also decreased in patients with macrovascular complications (p = 0.003). Nutritional status and handgrip strength were negatively affected in patients with diabetic neuropathy (p = 0.019, p = 0.014). Polypharmacy was also found to be associated with macrovascular complications (p < 0.001, p < 0.001). Macrovascular complications were 2.5 times more common in malnourished patients according to GLIM and 3.2 times more common in patients with decreased gait speed. Conclusion: In this study, we observed that both macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes increase susceptibility to geriatric syndromes in elderly individuals. It could be useful to conduct prospective studies in which we can compare the effectiveness of treatment methods on this subject.
