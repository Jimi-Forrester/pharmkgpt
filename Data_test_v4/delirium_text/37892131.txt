37892131|t|Neonatal Maternal Separation Induces Sexual Dimorphism in Brain Development: The Influence on Amino Acid Levels and Cognitive Disorders.
37892131|a|Repeated maternal separation (MS) is a useful experimental model in rodents for studying the long-term influence of early-life stress on brain neurophysiology. In our work, we assessed the effect of repeated MS (postnatal day (PND)1-21, 180 min/day) on the postnatal development of rat brain regions involved in memory using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1HMRS) for tissue volume and the level of amino acids such as glutamate, aspartate, glutamine, glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the hippocampus. We assessed whether these effects are sex dependent. We also use novel object recognition (NOR) task to examine the effect of MS on memory and the effect of ethanol on it. Finally, we attempted to ameliorate postnatal stress-induced memory deficits by using VU-29, a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of the metabotropic glutamate type 5 (mGlu5) receptor. In males, we noted deficits in the levels of glutamate, glycine and glutamine and increases in GABA in the hippocampus. In addition, the values of perirhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex and insular cortex and CA3 were decreased in these animals. MS females, in contrast, demonstrated significant increase in glutamate levels and decrease in GABA levels in the hippocampus. Here, the CA1 values alone were increased. VU-29 administration ameliorated these cognitive deficits. Thus, MS stress disturbs amino acids levels mainly in the hippocampus of adult male rats, and enhancement of glutamate neurotransmission reversed recognition memory deficits in these animals.
