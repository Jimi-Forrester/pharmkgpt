12708225|t|The characteristics of dementia caregiving onset.
12708225|a|This study examined the characteristics of entry into the caregiving role for family and friends of older adults suffering from dementia. Using data from a large community survey of informal caregivers of patients who visited the University of Kentucky's Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (n = 1055), respondents were classified into one of four onset sequences: recognition-diagnosis, care provision, recognition-care, and diagnosis dependent. A multinomial logistic regression identified several characteristics (i.e., caregiver income, time since onset, care recipient gender, care recipient living status, and primary caregiver identification) that were significantly associated with various caregiving onset patterns. The findings describe the complexity of the entry process and its potential association with health-related transitions in the caregiving career.
