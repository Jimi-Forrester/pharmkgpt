34692987|a|INTRODUCTION: The pathogenesis of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is not fully understood. GPR39, an orphan G-protein coupled receptor, is implicated in neurological disorders but its role in VCI is unknown. METHODS: We performed GPR39 immunohistochemical analysis in post mortem brain samples from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and control subjects. DNA was analyzed for GPR39 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and correlated with white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden on pre mortem magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: GPR39 is expressed in aged human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, localized to microglia and peri-capillary cells resembling pericytes. GPR39-capillary colocalization, and density of GPR39-expressing microglia was increased in aged brains compared to young. SNP distribution was equivalent between groups; however, homozygous SNP carriers were present only in the MCI group, and had higher WMH volume than wild-type or heterozygous SNP carriers. DISCUSSION: GPR39 may play a role in aging-related VCI, and may serve as a therapeutic target and biomarker for the risk of developing VCI.
