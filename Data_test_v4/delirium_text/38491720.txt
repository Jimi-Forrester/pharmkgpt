38491720|a|AIMS: Previous studies have shown the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with reductions in volume across a spectrum of non-SARS-CoV-2 hospitalizations. In the present study, we examine the impact of the pandemic on patient safety and quality of care. DESIGN: This is a retrospective population-based study of discharge abstracts. METHODS: We applied a set of nationally validated indicators for measuring the quality of inpatient care to hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada between January 2010 and December 2022. We measured 90-day mortality after selected types of higher risk admissions (such as cancer surgery and cardiovascular emergency) and the rate of patient harm events (such as delirium, pressure injuries and hospital-acquired infections) occurring during the hospital stay. RESULTS: A total 13,876,377 hospitalization episodes were captured. Compared with the pre-pandemic period, and independent of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the pandemic period was associated with higher rates of mortality after bladder cancer resection (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 1.20 (1.07-1.34)) and open repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm (aRR 1.45 (1.06-1.99)). The pandemic was also associated with higher rates of delirium (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.04 (1.02-1.06)), venous thromboembolism (aOR 1.10 (1.06-1.13)), pressure injuries (aOR 1.28 (1.24-1.33)), aspiration pneumonitis (aOR 1.15 (1.12-1.18)), urinary tract infections (aOR 1.02 (1.01-1.04)), Clostridiodes difficile infection (aOR 1.05 (1.02-1.09)), pneumothorax (aOR 1.08 (1.03-1.13)), and use of restraints (aOR 1.12 (1.10-1.14)), but was associated with lower rates of viral gastroenteritis (aOR 0.22 (0.18-0.28)). During the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2-positive admissions were associated with a higher likelihood of various harm events. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with higher rates of patient harm for a wide range of non-SARS-CoV-2 inpatient populations. IMPACT: Understanding which quality measures are improving or deteriorating can help health systems prioritize quality improvement initiatives.
