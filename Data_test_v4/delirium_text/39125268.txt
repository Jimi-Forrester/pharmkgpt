39125268|t|Salidroside: A Promising Agent in Bone Metabolism Modulation.
39125268|a|Rhodiola rosea, a long-lived herbaceous plant from the Crassulaceae group, contains the active compound salidroside, recognized as an adaptogen with significant therapeutic potential for bone metabolism. Salidroside promotes osteoblast proliferation and differentiation by activating critical signaling pathways, including bone morphogenetic protein-2 and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, essential for bone formation and growth. It enhances osteogenic activity by increasing alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization markers, while upregulating key regulatory proteins including runt-related transcription factor 2 and osterix. Additionally, salidroside facilitates angiogenesis via the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor pathway, crucial for coupling bone development with vascular support. Its antioxidant properties offer protection against bone loss by reducing oxidative stress and promoting osteogenic differentiation through the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 pathway. Salidroside has the capability to counteract the negative effects of glucocorticoids on bone cells and prevents steroid-induced osteonecrosis. Additionally, it exhibits multifaceted anti-inflammatory actions, notably through the inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 expression, while enhancing the expression of interleukin-10. This publication presents a comprehensive review of the literature on the impact of salidroside on various aspects of bone tissue metabolism, emphasizing its potential role in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and other diseases affecting bone physiology.
