37103356|t|Diversity, Biosynthesis and Bioactivity of Aeruginosins, a Family of Cyanobacteria-Derived Nonribosomal Linear Tetrapeptides.
37103356|a|Aeruginosins, a family of nonribosomal linear tetrapeptides discovered from cyanobacteria and sponges, exhibit in vitro inhibitory activity on various types of serine proteases. This family is characterized by the existence of the 2-carboxy-6-hydroxy-octahydroindole (Choi) moiety occupied at the central position of the tetrapeptide. Aeruginosins have attracted much attention due to their special structures and unique bioactivities. Although many studies on aeruginosins have been published, there has not yet been a comprehensive review that summarizes the diverse research ranging from biogenesis, structural characterization and biosynthesis to bioactivity. In this review, we provide an overview of the source, chemical structure as well as spectrum of bioactivities of aeruginosins. Furthermore, possible opportunities for future research and development of aeruginosins were discussed.
