36832292|t|Alzheimer Disease Classification through Transfer Learning Approach.
36832292|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a slow neurological disorder that destroys the thought process, and consciousness, of a human. It directly affects the development of mental ability and neurocognitive functionality. The number of patients with Alzheimer's disease is increasing day by day, especially in old aged people, who are above 60 years of age, and, gradually, it becomes cause of their death. In this research, we discuss the segmentation and classification of the Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of Alzheimer's disease, through the concept of transfer learning and customizing of the convolutional neural network (CNN) by specifically using images that are segmented by the Gray Matter (GM) of the brain. Instead of training and computing the proposed model accuracy from the start, we used a pre-trained deep learning model as our base model, and, after that, transfer learning was applied. The accuracy of the proposed model was tested over a different number of epochs, 10, 25, and 50. The overall accuracy of the proposed model was 97.84%.
