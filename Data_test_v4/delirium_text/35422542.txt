35422542|t|A Comparative Study of Analgesic Efficacy of Intrathecal Bupivacaine with Ketamine Versus Bupivacaine with Magnesium Sulphate in Parturients Undergoing Elective Caesarian Sections.
35422542|a|Background and Aims: Spinal anaesthesia is the most preferred technique of anaesthesia in parturient, undergoing lower segment caesarean sections (LSCS) which provides effective pain relief during intra operative and early postoperative period. However, recent studies demonstrate that about 50%-70% of patients experience moderate to severe pain after LSCS indicating that postoperative pain remains poorly managed. The aim of our study was to compare intrathecal magnesium sulphate (Mgso4) and ketamine as adjuvants to hyperbaric bupivacaine in parturients posted for elective caesarean sections under spinal anaesthesia to determine their effectiveness in extending the duration of analgesia. Materials and Methods: After institutional ethical committee approval, 82 parturient undergoing elective LSCS were enrolled into the prospective randomized double blinded study. Group BK (n = 41) received intrathecal ketamine (25 mg) as additive to hyperbaric bupivacaine and group BM (n = 41) received magnesium sulphate (75 mg) as additive to hyperbaric bupivacaine. Time of onset of sensory analgesia, motor blockade, duration of analgesia was noted down. Intraoperative hemodynamics and any adverse effects of study drugs were noted. Results: The mean duration of analgesia in group BK was significantly longer (P < 0.05) than in Group BM. The onset of sensory and motor blockade was significantly early in Group BK compared to Group BM. Hemodynamics was better maintained in Group BK with less requirement of ephedrine compared to Group BM. The visual analog scale scores were significantly lower without side effects in both the groups. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that the duration, quality of analgesia, hemodynamic stability was better with intra thecal ketamine as an adjuvant to bupivacaine compared to intrathecal MgSo4 without any significant side effects on mother and child.
