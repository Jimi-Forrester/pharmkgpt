31685741|t|[Effect of Digital Labels on Electronic Medical Records for Reducing the Use of Benzodiazepine Receptor Agonists].
31685741|a|Benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZDs) should be appropriately used owing to the associated risks of delirium and falls. Since January 2018, the liaison team pharmacist at Iizuka Hospital has been applying digital labels with recommendations for the reduction of use and changes in the medication orders and prescriptions of BZDs on electronic medical records of patients in the surgical ward. This study aimed to verify the effectiveness of reducing the use of BZDs via the implementation of digital labels. Patients in the surgical ward were retrospectively assessed for changes in medication orders and prescription ratios of BZDs before and after the implementation of digital labels. The ratio of the number of digital labels implemented to the number of confirmations of medication orders and prescriptions of BZDs was 15.0% at the start of implementation; however, the ratio gradually and significantly decreased to 3.6%. The medication order ratio of BZDs was 52.2% before the implementation of digital labels; however, this ratio decreased to 2.7% and 5.6% immediately and 4 months after the implementation of digital labels, respectively. The present study showed that medication orders for BZDs were reduced after the implementation of digital labels and that the reduction effect was maintained for a certain period of time. Thus, the liaison team pharmacist-led approach can contribute to the proper use of BZDs.
