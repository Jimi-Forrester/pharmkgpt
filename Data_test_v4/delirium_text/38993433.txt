38993433|t|Intraoperative Dissociation and Migration of the Trial Bipolar Cup in Hip Hemiarthroplasty: A Rare Case.
38993433|a|Femoral neck fractures are an ever-increasing pathology, and with the elderly population on the rise, cases of cemented bipolar hemiarthroplasties are also on the rise. This is a rare case of intraoperative dissociation and migration of the trial components of bipolar hemiarthroplasty. Considering the current literature, all junior surgeons should be aware of this possible development during trial reduction. We present the case of an 82-year-old Caucasian woman suffering from a left femoral neck fracture due to a fall. She was treated surgically with a cemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty, but after trial reduction, the trial components dissociated and migrated inside the pelvis. The attempts at recovery through the current approach failed, and a new incision and approach were needed. A small ilioinguinal incision was performed, and the recovery of the trial cup was successful. The patient recovered with no considerable problems. As the reasons for this rare complication are largely unknown, the surgeon should be careful and take measures to prevent this scenario. Moreover, it is wise to weigh the pros and cons of retrieval through other approaches and choose the best course of action for the patient.
