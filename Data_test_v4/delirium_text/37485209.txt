37485209|t|Neuropsychiatric Outcomes in Intensive Care Unit Survivors.
37485209|a|BACKGROUND: Over the last two decades, there has been phenomenal advancement in critical care medicine and patient management. Many patients recover from life-threatening illnesses that they might not have survived a decade ago. Despite a decrease in mortality, these survivors endure long-lasting sequelae like physical, mental, and emotional symptoms. METHODS: Patients after intensive care unit (ICU) discharge were assessed in a follow-up outpatient department (OPD) clinic for anxiety, stress, and depression. Patients were asked to fill out the questionnaires Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and Short Form-36 (SF-36) for assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) at 4th, 6th, and 8th months after discharge. ICU data were recorded, including patients' demographics, severity of illness and length of stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation. Patients who failed to follow-up in OPD on designated dates were assessed telephonically. RESULTS: Depression showed a positive, strong, and moderate correlation between length of stay and mechanical ventilation duration. A positive correlation was found between stress and length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation. A positive strong correlation was found between anxiety and length of ICU stay, and a moderate positive correlation was found between anxiety and duration of mechanical ventilation. A weak correlation was found between age and neuropsychiatric outcomes. CONCLUSION: The severity of depression, anxiety, and stress was significantly higher at four months compared to six months. Severity decreased with time. Prolonged ICU stay increased levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. HRQOL improved from four to six months.
