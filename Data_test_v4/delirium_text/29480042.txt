29480042|t|Memorcise and Alzheimer's disease.
29480042|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating disease influencing a multitude of outcomes, including memory function. Recent work suggests that memory may be influenced by exercise ('memorcise'), even among those with AD. The present narrative review details (1) the underlying mechanisms of AD; (2) whether exercise has a protective effect in preventing AD; (3) the mechanisms through which exercise may help to prevent AD; (4) the mechanisms through which exercise may help attenuate the progression of AD severity among those with existing AD; (5) the effects and mechanisms through which exercise is associated with memory among those with existing AD; and (6) exercise recommendations for those with existing AD. Such an understanding will aid clinicians in their ability to use exercise as a potential behavioral strategy to help prevent and treat AD.
