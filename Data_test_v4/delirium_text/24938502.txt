24938502|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of rivastigmine patch associated with physical exercise versus rivastigmine patch alone in quality of life (QOL), cognition, activities of daily living (ADL) and functional mobility in Alzheimer's disease (AD)subjects. METHODS: A randomized, controlled, single-blinded trial was conducted in 40 patients with mild to moderate stages of AD. All patients were daily treated with rivastigmine transdermal patch at a stable dose of 4.6 mg and randomized into two groups: physical exercises or control. The exercise program consisted of aerobic, flexibility, strength and balance movements, twice a week for 6 months. Main outcomes were Quality of Life in Alzheimer's disease scale (QOL), Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (ADL), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and "Time Up and Go Test". RESULTS: Thirty-four patients completed the study. After 6 months, there was a significant improvement in QOL of patients randomized to physical exercise group (P< 0.05). In both groups, there was an improvement on caregivers QOL (P>0.05). When considering cognitive functions, there was no difference between groups. The ability to perform ADL worsened in the group enrolled to RTP alone. There was an improvement in functional mobility in the group treated with RTP. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the association between physical exercises and RTP improves QOL in patients with AD. Cognition remained unchanged in both groups. Regarding the effect of physical exercises in ADL, further trials are necessary to confirm these results.
