35506731|a|AIMS/BACKGROUND: Delirium affects around 20% of older inpatients, increasing mortality and length of stay. Around 30% of cases are preventable. The authors sought to determine compliance of the admissions to the Older People's Unit of the Royal University Hospital Bath with the national and internal guidelines for delirium screening and improve its use on admission. METHODS: A total of 60 patients' notes were inspected for compliance. Subsequently, the authors implemented teaching, changed the admission proforma and re-wrote the hospital guidelines for delirium. The notes were rescreened at 6 and 18 months. RESULTS: Initially, 25% of notes met the national standards and 63% met the hospital criteria. At 6 months this was 52% and 82% respectively, and at 18 months it was 41% and 87% respectively. The proportion of patients screened via multiple methods also increased. CONCLUSIONS: There was a sustained improvement in compliance with the national and hospital standards for delirium screening. There was some degradation in the national standard but the proportion of patients meeting the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence standard was still higher than pre-intervention.
