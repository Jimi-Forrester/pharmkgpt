34527425|t|Extracellular Vesicles in Premature Aging and Diseases in Adulthood Due to Developmental Exposures.
34527425|a|The developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) is a paradigm that links prenatal and early life exposures that occur during crucial periods of development to health outcome and risk of disease later in life. Maternal exposures to stress, some psychoactive drugs and alcohol, and environmental chemicals, among others, may result in functional changes in developing fetal tissues, creating a predisposition for disease in the individual as they age. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) may be mediators of both the immediate effects of exposure during development and early childhood as well as the long-term consequences of exposure that lead to increased risk and disease severity later in life. Given the prevalence of diseases with developmental origins, such as cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, osteoporosis, metabolic dysfunction, and cancer, it is important to identify persistent mediators of disease risk. In this review, we take this approach, viewing diseases typically associated with aging in light of early life exposures and discuss the potential role of EVs as mediators of lasting consequences.
