34606748|a|Wheat embryo globulin nutrient (WEGN), with wheat embryo globulin (WEG) as the main functional component, is a nutritional combination that specifically targets memory impairment. In this study, we explored the protective role of WEGN on Alzheimer's disease (AD)-triggered cognitive impairment, neuronal injury, oxidative stress, and acetylcholine system disorder. Specifically, we established an AD model via administration of d-galactose (d-gal) and Aluminum chloride (AlCl3) for 70 days, then on the 36th day, administered animals in the donepezil and WEGN (300, 600, and 900 mg/kg) groups with drugs by gavage for 35 days. Learning and memory ability of the treated rats was tested using the Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition (NOR) test, while pathological changes and neuronal death in their hippocampus CA1 were detected via HE staining and Nissl staining. Moreover, we determined antioxidant enzymes by measuring levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in serum, cortex, and hippocampus, whereas changes in the acetylcholine system were determined by evaluating choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities, as well as choline acetylcholine (Ach) content. Results revealed that rats in the WEGN group exhibited significantly lower escape latency, as well as a significantly higher number of targeted crossings and longer residence times in the target quadrant, relative to those in the model group. Notably, rats in the WEGN group spent more time exploring new objects and exhibited lower damage to their hippocampus neuron, had improved learning and memory activity, as well as reversed histological alterations, relative to those in the model group. Meanwhile, biochemical examinations revealed that rats in the WEGN group had significantly lower MDA levels and AChE activities, but significantly higher GSH, SOD, and ChAT activities, as well as Ach content, relative to those in the model group. Overall, these findings indicate that WEGN exerts protective effects on cognitive impairment, neuronal damage, oxidative stress, and choline function in AD rats treated by d-gal/AlCl3.
