15882808|t|Estradiol regulates APP mRNA alternative splicing in the mice brain cortex.
15882808|a|Alternative splicing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), one of the candidate genes for Alzheimer's disease, yields three major mRNAs, which give rise to APP770, APP751 and APP695 protein isoforms. Out of these three isoforms, APP695 is expressed most predominantly in the brain. The splicing and processing of APP are shown to be influenced by several factors including hormones. In this study, we report the effect of withdrawal and administration of sex steroid hormones on the alternative splicing of APP mRNA during aging in the brain cortex of mice of both sexes. The level of APP695 mRNA isoform was higher in intact adult as compared to old mice of both sexes. Gonadectomy upregulated the APP695 mRNA isoform levels in all groups except in adult female where the level was downregulated. Estradiol supplementation upregulated the level of APP695 mRNA isoform in all groups except in old male where the level was downregulated. Thus these results show that the level of APP695 mRNA changes with age and estradiol may play a key role in the development of Alzheimer's disease by modulating the level of APP mRNA isoforms.
