37008045|t|Roles of Ependymal Cells in the Physiology and Pathology of the Central Nervous System.
37008045|a|Ependymal cells are indispensable components of the central nervous system (CNS). They originate from neuroepithelial cells of the neural plate and show heterogeneity, with at least three types that are localized in different locations of the CNS. As glial cells in the CNS, accumulating evidence demonstrates that ependymal cells play key roles in mammalian CNS development and normal physiological processes by controlling the production and flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain metabolism, and waste clearance. Ependymal cells have been attached to great importance by neuroscientists because of their potential to participate in CNS disease progression. Recent studies have demonstrated that ependymal cells participate in the development and progression of various neurological diseases, such as spinal cord injury and hydrocephalus, raising the possibility that they may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the disease. This review focuses on the function of ependymal cells in the developmental CNS as well as in the CNS after injury and discusses the underlying mechanisms of controlling the functions of ependymal cells.
