OBJECTIVE: Baseline (BL) white matter hyperintensities (WMH) were examined for associations with month-24 (M24) and longitudinal Abeta1-42 change in cognitively normal (CN) subjects. The interaction of WMH and Abeta1-42 on memory and executive function were also examined. METHODS: This study included 72 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Multivariable linear regression models evaluated associations between baseline WMH/intracranial volume ratio, M24 and change in Abeta1-42 over two years. Linear mixed effects models evaluated interactions between BL WMH/ICV and Abeta1-42 on memory and executive function. RESULTS: Mean age of the subjects (Nmales = 36) = 73.80 years, SD = 6.73; mean education years = 17.1, SD = 2.4. BL WMH was significantly associated with M24 Abeta1-42 (p = 0.008) and two-year change in Abeta1-42 (p = 0.006). Interaction between higher WMH and lower Abeta1-42 at baseline was significantly associated with worse memory at baseline and M24 (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: BL WMH was associated with M24 and longitudinal Abeta1-42 change in CN. The interaction between higher WMH and lower Abeta1-42 was associated with poorer memory. Since SVD is associated with longitudinal Abeta1-42 pathology, and the interaction of both factors is linked to poorer cognitive outcomes, the mitigation of SVD may be correlated with reduced amyloid pathology and milder cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer's disease.
