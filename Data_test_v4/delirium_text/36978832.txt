36978832|t|Accelerated AGEing: The Impact of Advanced Glycation End Products on the Prognosis of Chronic Kidney Disease.
36978832|a|Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are aging products. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), AGEs accumulate due to the increased production, reduced excretion, and the imbalance between oxidant/antioxidant capacities. CKD is therefore a model of aging. The aim of this review is to summarize the present knowledge of AGEs in CKD onset and progression, also focusing on CKD-related disorders (cardiovascular diseases, sarcopenia, and nutritional imbalance) and CKD mortality. The role of AGEs as etiopathogenetic molecules, as well as potential markers of disease progression and/or therapeutic targets, will be discussed.
