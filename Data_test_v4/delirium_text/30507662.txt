30507662|t|Clinical Education to Decrease Perceived Barriers to Delirium Screening in Adult Intensive Care Units.
30507662|a|Despite current advances in critical care medicine, delirium remains a frequent complication of an intensive care unit stay. The consequences can be severe and far reaching, including an increase in mortality, length of stay, and long-term cognitive sequelae. Frequently, delirium can be missed by clinicians who fail to complete a standardized delirium screening tool and, therefore, many cases go unrecognized and untreated. A multidimensional education program is one of the most effective methods to increase awareness of the condition and increase compliance in utilizing standardized delirium screening tools at the bedside.
