35528470|a|Background and aim: This study investigated the effect of Kava extract (Piper methysticum), a medicinal plant that has been worldly used by its anxiolytic effects, on monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity of mice brain after 21 days of treatment as well as anxiolytic and locomotor behavior. Furthermore, the in vitro inhibitory profile of Kava extract on MAO-B activity of mouse brain was evaluated. Experimental procedure: Mice were treated with Kava extract (10, 40, 100 and 400 mg/kg) for 21 days by gavage. After behavioral analysis (plus maze test and open field), MAO activity in different mouse brain structures (cortex, hippocampus, region containing the substantia nigra and striatum) were performed. MAO-B inhibitory profile was characterized in vitro. Results: The treatment with Kava extract (40 mg/kg) increased the percentage of entries of mice into the open arms. Ex vivo analysis showed an inhibition on MAO-B activity caused by Kava extract in cortex (10 mg/kg) and in the region containing the substantia nigra (10 and 100 mg/kg). In vitro, Kava extract also reversibly inhibited MAO-B activity with IC50 = 14.62 mug/mL and, increased Km values at the concentrations of 10 and 30 mug/mL and decreased Vmax value at 100 mug/mL. Conclusion: Kava extract showed different effects on MAO-B isoform depending on the brain structure evaluated. Therefore, the use of Kava extract could be promissory in pathologies where MAO-B is the pharmacological target.
