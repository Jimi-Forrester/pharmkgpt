28039689|t|Long Non-Coding RNA: Potential Diagnostic and Therapeutic Biomarker for Major Depressive Disorder.
28039689|a|BACKGROUND The criteria for diagnosing depression are based on behavioral observation and self-reporting of symptoms by the patients or guardians without any biological validation of the disease. This study aimed to identify long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as robust and predictive biomarkers for diagnosis and therapy response in major depressive disorder (MDD). MATERIAL AND METHODS We used human lncRNA 3.0 microarray profiling (which covers 30,586 human lncRNAs), using PBMCs from five MDD patients and five controls. Differentially expressed lncRNAs in the PBMCs of MDD patients were identified, of which 10 candidate lncRNAs were selected for real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis in a larger cohort of 138 MDD patients and 63 healthy controls. Then among the 138 MDD patients who received standard antidepressant treatment, 30 were randomly selected for lncRNAs expression retesting and symptomatology assessments after three-weeks and six-weeks of antidepressant treatment. RESULTS Six lncRNAs (TCONS_00019174, ENST00000566208, NONHSAG045500, ENST00000517573, NONHSAT034045, and NONHSAT142707) were significantly downregulated in MDD patients compared to control patients, and the area under the receiver operator curve (ROC) of these six lncRNAs cases, combined, was 0.719 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.617-0.821). There was no difference in the expression of these six lncRNAs based on gender (p>0.05) or age (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that the combined expression of six lncRNAs in PBMCs may serve as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and therapy response of MDD in the clinical setting.
