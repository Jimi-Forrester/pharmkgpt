39863750|t|A safe haven for cancer cells: tumor plus stroma control by DYRK1B.
39863750|a|The development of resistance remains one of the biggest challenges in clinical cancer patient care and it comprises all treatment modalities from chemotherapy to targeted or immune therapy. In solid malignancies, drug resistance is the result of adaptive processes occurring in cancer cells or the surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME). Future therapy attempts will therefore benefit from targeting both, tumor and stroma compartments and drug targets which affect both sides will be highly appreciated. In this review, we describe a seemingly paradoxical oncogenic mediator with this potential: The dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation regulated kinase 1B (DYRK1B). DYRK1B promotes proliferative quiescence and yet is overexpressed or amplified in many hyperproliferative malignancies including ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer. In particular the latter disease is a paradigmatic example for a therapy-recalcitrant and highly stroma-rich cancer entity. Here, recent evidence suggests that DYRK1B exerts its oncogenic features by installing a protective niche for cancer cells by directly affecting cancer cells but also the TME. Specifically, DYRK1B not only fosters cell-intrinsic processes like cell survival, chemoresistance, and disease recurrence, but it also upregulates TME and cancer cell-protective innate immune checkpoints and down-modulates anti-tumoral macrophage functionality. In this article, we outline the well-established cell-autonomous roles of DYRK1B and extend its importance to the TME and the control of the tumor immune stroma. In summary, DYRK1B appears as a single novel key player creating a safe haven for cancer cells by acting cell-intrinsically and-extrinsically, leading to the promotion of cancer cell survival, chemoresistance, and relapse. Thus, DYRK1B appears as an attractive drug target for future therapeutic approaches.
