37894169|t|SARS-CoV-2 and Brain Health: New Challenges in the Era of the Pandemic.
37894169|a|Respiratory viral infections have been found to have a negative impact on neurological functions, potentially leading to significant neurological impairment. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has precipitated a worldwide pandemic, posing a substantial threat to human lives. Growing evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may severely affect the CNS and respiratory system. The current prevalence of clinical neurological issues associated with SARS-CoV-2 has raised significant concerns. However, there needs to be a more comprehensive understanding of the specific pathways by which SARS-CoV-2 enters the nervous system. Based on the available evidence, this review focuses on the clinical neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and the possible mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 invades the brain.
