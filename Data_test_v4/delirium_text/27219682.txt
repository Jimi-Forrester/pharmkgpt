27219682|t|Non-polyphenolic compounds of a specific kind of dried grape (Maviz) inhibit memory impairments induced by beta-amyloid peptide.
27219682|a|OBJECTIVES: Although grape has been recently the topic of many investigations, Maviz (a kind of dried one) has remained neglected. The aim of this study was to assess anti-Alzheimer activity of Maviz. METHODS: To reach this goal, total phenolic content (TPC) of ethanolic (Eth) and aqueous (Aq) extracts were determined and radical scavenging activity was assayed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl. Chemical compositions of each extract were also determined via GC-Mass. Behavioral changes were studied via passive avoidance and Morris water maze in Abeta-induced model of Alzheimer's disease. Catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) determination were also done on rats' hippocampus. RESULTS: The results showed that seed Eth extract has a high level of TPC and radical scavenging activity. However, this extract had surprisingly no effect on memory and CAT and SOD activities. In contrast, fruit Aq and Eth extracts (containing furfurals as major compounds) inhibited memory impairment (P < 0.001) and elevated brain levels of CAT and SOD(P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: It seems that Maviz non-phenolic compounds-most probably 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and other similar derivatives-are responsible for these actions.
