29566430|t|Use of Antiepileptic Drugs and Dementia Risk-an Analysis of Finnish Health Register and German Health Insurance Data.
29566430|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between regular antiepileptic drug (AED) use and incident dementia. DESIGN: Case-control analysis. SETTING: Finnish public health register and German health insurance data. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with dementia of any type (German data, N=20,325) and Alzheimer's disease (AD; Finnish data, N=70,718) were matched with up to four control persons without dementia. MEASUREMENTS: We analyzed the association between regular AED use and dementia. To address potential protopathic bias, a lag time of 2 years between AED use and dementia diagnosis was introduced. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by applying conditional logistic regression, adjusted for potential confounding factors such as comorbidities and polypharmacy. RESULTS: Regular AED use was more frequent in individuals with dementia than controls. Regular use of AEDs was associated with a significantly greater risk of incident dementia (adjusted OR=1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.14-1.44) and AD (adjusted OR=1.15, 95% CI=1.09-1.22) than no AED use. We also detected a trend toward greater risk of dementia with higher exposure. When AEDs with and without known cognitive adverse effects (CAEs) were compared, a significantly greater risk of dementia was observed for substances with known CAEs (dementia: OR=1.59, 95% CI=1.36-1.86; AD: OR=1.19, 95% CI=1.11-1.27). CONCLUSION: AEDs, especially those with known CAEs, may contribute to incident dementia and AD in older persons.
