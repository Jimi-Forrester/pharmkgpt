38524244|a|Background and Objectives: Modifiable risk factors across the life course play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Studies have identified racial and ethnic disparities in ADRD risk factors. Few studies have explored the epidemiology of ADRD risk among Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) Americans, largely due to their classification as White in US national health surveys. Our aim was to estimate ADRD risk factors among MENA immigrants compared to US- and foreign-born non-Hispanic White adults. Research Design and Methods: We linked cross-sectional 2000-2017 National Health Interview Survey and 2001-2018 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data (N = 108 695; age >= 18 years). Modifiable risk factors for ADRD that were evaluated (yes or no) included less than ninth grade education, hearing loss, traumatic brain injury, hypertension, alcohol use, obesity, smoking, depressive symptoms, marital status, physical inactivity, and diabetes. Bivariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression were conducted. Regression models were adjusted by age and sex. Results: Compared to US-born White adults, MENA immigrants had higher odds of reporting less than 9th grade education (OR = 1.93; 95% CI = 1.17-3.21) and psychological health concerns (OR = 1.28; 95% CI = 1.06-1.56). Compared to foreign-born White adults, MENA immigrants had higher odds of diabetes (OR = 1.48; 95% CI = 1.06-2.08) and psychological health concerns (OR = 1.24; 95% CI = 1.01-1.54). Discussion and Implications: The findings provide the first comprehensive look at potentially modifiable risk factors for ADRD among MENA immigrants based on a life course model. Without a racial/ethnic identifier for MENA individuals on a national level, ADRD risk factors among US-born MENA adults and MENA immigrants cannot be examined. More research is needed to explore these risk factors by life stage (early, midlife, and late) to further determine ADRD risk and prevention strategies for MENA Americans.
