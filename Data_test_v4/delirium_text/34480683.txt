34480683|a|Reducing false discoveries caused by population stratification (PS) has always been a challenge in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The current literature established several single marker approaches including genomic control (GC), EIGENSTRAT and generalized linear mixed model association test (GMMAT) and multi-marker methods such as LASSO mixed model (LASSOMM). However, the single-marker methods require prespecifying an arbitrary p value threshold in the selection process, likely resulting in suboptimal precision or recall. On the other hand, it appears that LASSOMM is extremely computationally intensive and may not suitable for large-scale GWAS. In this paper, we proposed a simple multi-marker approach (PCA-LASSO) combining principal component analysis (PCA) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). We utilize PCA to correct for the confounding effects of PS and LASSO with built-in cross-validation for a data-driven selection. Compared to the current single-marker approaches, the proposed PCA-LASSO provides optimal balance between precision and recall, and consequently superior F1 scores. Similarly, compared to LASSOMM, PCA-LASSO markedly increases the precision while minimizing the loss of recall, and therefore improves the overall F1 score in presence of PS. More importantly, PCA-LASSO drastically reduces the computational time by > 1000 times when compared to LASSOMM. We applied PCA-LASSO to a real dataset of Alzheimer's disease and successfully identified SNP rs429358 (Gene APOE4) which has been widely reported to be associated with the onset and elevated risk of Alzheimer's disease. In conclusion, PCA-LASSO is a simple, fast, but accurate approach for GWAS in presence of latent PS.
