29699467|t|Nonpharmacologic and Medication Minimization Strategies for the Prevention and Treatment of ICU Delirium: A Narrative Review.
29699467|a|Delirium is a multifactorial entity, and its understanding continues to evolve. Delirium has been associated with increased morbidity, mortality, length of stay, and cost for hospitalized patients, especially for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Recent literature on delirium focuses on specific pharmacologic risk factors and pharmacologic interventions to minimize course and severity of delirium. While medication management clearly plays a role in delirium management, there are a variety of nonpharmacologic interventions, pharmacologic minimization strategies, and protocols that have been recently described. A PubMed search was performed to review the evidence for nonpharmacologic management, pharmacologic minimization strategies, and prevention of delirium for patients in the ICU. Recent approaches were condensed into 10 actionable steps to manage delirium and minimize medications for ICU patients and are presented in this review.
