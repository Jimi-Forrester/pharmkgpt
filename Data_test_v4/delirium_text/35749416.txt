35749416|a|Emergency department visits (EDV) are common among older adults with and without dementia. The risk factors and demands of EDVs for people with dementia have been well studied; however, the association between EDVs and conversion to dementia among people with predementia has not been thoroughly explored. To study the predictive value of EDVs in predementia's progression to dementia. The baseline predementia cohort registered from September 2015 to August 2017, with longitudinal follow-up in the History-based Artificial Intelligent Clinical Dementia Diagnostic System database, was retrospectively analyzed. The rates of conversion among the different EDVs were compared. Multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards analyses were applied to study the influence of EDVs on progression. Age, education, sex, neuropsychological tests, activities of daily living, neuropsychiatric symptoms, parkinsonism, and multiple vascular risk factors were adjusted for. A total of 512 participants were analyzed, including 339 (66.2%) non-converters and 173 (33.8%) converters with a mean follow-up of 3.3 (range 0.4-6.1) and 2.8 (range 0.5-5.9) years, respectively. Compared to people without EDV (EDV 0), the hazard ratios for conversion to dementia were 3.6, 5.9, and 6.9 in those with EDV once (EDV 1), twice (EDV 2), and more than twice (EDV >2), respectively. In addition, older age, lower education, poorer cognition, poorer ADL performance, and longer follow-up periods also increased the conversion rates. EDVs in the predementia stages highly predict progression to dementia. Therefore, a sound public health as well as primary healthcare system that provide strategies for better management of mental and physical condition might help prevention of EDVs among older people in the predementia stages.
