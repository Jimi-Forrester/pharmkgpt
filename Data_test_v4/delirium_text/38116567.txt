38116567|t|Ginkgo biloba Efficacy in the Treatment of Drug-Induced Parkinsonism: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
38116567|a|Background: Drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) is one of the most common movement disorders in approximately 20 - 35% of patients on antipsychotic medications. Managing the symptoms of DIP is challenging due to the limited number of potentially effective medications. On the other hand, this restricted possible treatment could have numerous side effects that ultimately result in patients stopping the medication all at once. The neuroprotective property of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb) emerged as an effective commodity for the additional treatment of psychiatric disorders. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of EGb in psychiatric patients with symptoms of DIP. Methods: A sample of 63 patients who met the inclusion criteria were recruited and randomly assigned to control and experimental groups. Both groups were followed for 3 months. One group received 80 mg of G. biloba three times a day, and the control group received a placebo. The patients were evaluated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Results: Ginkgo could change the intensity of rest tremors, the severity of motor symptoms, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Ginkgo biloba might alleviate the severity of parkinsonism and motor symptoms and could lead to changes in the two components of working memory and short-term memory. Conclusions: Ginkgo biloba extract can be used as an effective and safe treatment in the management of DIP, whether in patients diagnosed with psychotic disorders or mood disorders.
