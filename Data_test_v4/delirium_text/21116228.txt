21116228|t|Synthesis of benzofuran derivatives via rearrangement and their inhibitory activity on acetylcholinesterase.
21116228|a|During a synthesis of coumarins to obtain new candidates for treating Alzheimer's Disease (AD), an unusual rearrangement of a benzopyran group to a benzofuran group occurred, offering a novel synthesis pathway of these benzofuran derivatives. The possible mechanism of the novel rearrangement was also discussed. All of the benzofuran derivatives have weak anti-AChE activities compared with the reference compound, donepezil.
