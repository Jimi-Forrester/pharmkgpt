37066187|a|Background: Blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown is a component of the progression and pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). BBB dysfunction is primarily caused by reduced or disorganized tight junction or adherens junction proteins of brain microvascular endothelial cell (BMEC). While there is growing evidence of tight junction disruption in BMECs in AD, the functional role of adherens junctions during BBB dysfunction in AD remains unknown. Exosomes secreted from senescent cells have unique characteristics and contribute to modulating the phenotype of recipient cells. However, it remains unknown if and how these exosomes cause BMEC dysfunction in AD. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the potential roles of AD circulating exosomes and their RNA cargos in brain endothelial dysfunction in AD. Methods: We isolated exosomes from sera of five cases of AD compared with age- and sex-matched cognitively normal controls using size-exclusion chromatography technology. We validated the qualities and particle sizes of isolated exosomes with nanoparticle tracking analysis and atomic force microscopy. We measured the biomechanical natures of the endothelial barrier of BMECs, the lateral binding forces between live BMECs, using fluidic force miscopy. We visualized the paracellular expressions of the key adherens junction protein VE-cadherin in BMEC cultures and a 3D BBB model that employs primary human BMECs and pericytes with immunostaining and evaluated them using confocal microscopy. We also examined the VE-cadherin signal in brain tissues from five cases of AD and five age- and sex-matched cognitively normal controls. Results: We found that circulating exosomes from AD patients suppress the paracellular expression levels of VE-cadherin and impair the barrier function of recipient BMECs. Immunostaining analysis showed that AD circulating exosomes damage VE-cadherin integrity in a 3D model of microvascular tubule formation. We found that circulating exosomes in AD weaken the BBB depending on the RNA cargos. In parallel, we observed that microvascular VE-cadherin expression is diminished in AD brains compared to normal controls. Conclusion: Using in vitro and ex vivo models, our study illustrates that circulating exosomes from AD patients play a significant role in mediating the damage effect on adherens junction of recipient BMEC of the BBB in an exosomal RNA-dependent manner. This suggests a novel mechanism of peripheral senescent exosomes for AD risk.
