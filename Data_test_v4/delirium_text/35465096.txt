35465096|a|Regulation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) at synapses is a predominant mechanism for regulating synaptic strength. We identified the transmembrane protein synapse differentiation-induced gene 1 (SynDIG1; SD1) as an AMPAR interacting protein that regulates excitatory synaptic strength and AMPAR number both in vitro and in vivo. The related protein SynDIG4 (SD4; also known as PRRT1) was identified in several independent proteomic screens in complex with AMPARs, suggesting that it may function as an AMPAR auxiliary factor. Here, we show that the co-expression of SD4 with GluA1 or GluA2 homomeric AMPARs in COS cells leads to a 50 or 33% increase in the mean area of AMPAR puncta, respectively. This effect is accentuated when AMPAR puncta are stratified for co-localization with SD4, resulting in a 100 and 65% increase in GluA1 and GluA2 puncta, respectively. Chimeric proteins expressing only the membrane bound domain of SD4 co-expressed with full-length GluA1 or GluA2 recapitulated the effects of wild-type (WT) SD4. Additionally, the mean puncta area of GluA1 or GluA2 chimeras expressing the membrane and C-terminal domains increased significantly when co-localized with WT SD4. Similarly, the co-expression of GluA1 or GluA2 with SD4 results in a significant increase in the mean area of SD4 puncta co-localized with GluA1 or GluA2, respectively. Last, we observed a significant increase in the co-localization of SD4 with GluA1 after glycine induced long-term potentiation (LTP). The mean size of GluA1 puncta was significantly increased when stratified, indicating that co-localization with SD4 increases synaptic GluA1 cluster size during LTP. These data indicate mutually dependent clustering of SD4 and AMPAR subunits both in COS cells and primary hippocampal neurons, suggesting a mechanism for increased synaptic strength during chemical LTP.
