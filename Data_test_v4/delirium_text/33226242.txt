33226242|t|Unfolding the Role of a Flavone-Based Fluorescent Antioxidant towards the Misfolding of Amyloid Proteins: An Endeavour to Probe Amyloid Aggregation.
33226242|a|4'-N,N-Dimethylamino-3-hydroxyflavone (DMAHF), a synthetic fluorescent flavone analogue with potent antioxidant activity, was explored as a molecular rotor-like fluoroprobe for amyloid aggregations, a causative factor in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, type-2 diabetes, etc. During its interactions with (human) insulin amyloid aggregation (IAA), its microenvironment was changed. This instigated a drastic change in its excited-state intramolecular proton transfer-based dual emission behavior, which was tracked to monitor its amyloid probing activity. Thus, the amyloid probing potential of DMAHF was originated from its interactions with IAA, which were studied by various spectroscopic techniques and molecular docking and quantum-mechanical calculations. Morphological changes of the IAA in the presence of DMAHF were studied by scanning electron microscopy. DMAHF also probed efficiently the islet amyloid polypeptide deposition in the pancreatic beta-cells of diabetic mice. DMAHF showed significant sensitivity and specificity towards amyloid aggregation without having any complexity in its photophysical behavior. This indicates its potential as an ideal bio-friendly and cost-effective fluoroprobe for amyloid proteins.
