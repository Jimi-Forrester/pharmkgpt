38934858|a|BACKGROUND: A limited number of studies investigated the association between blood pressure variability (BPV) and cognitive impairment in patients with hypertension. This study aimed to identify the longitudinal association between BPV and cognitive decline and the role of blood pressure (BP) control in this association. METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants with hypertension from the HRS (Health and Retirement Study), the ELSA (English Longitudinal Study of Ageing), and the CHARLS (China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study) were included. Variation independent of the mean (VIM) was adopted to measure BPV. Cognitive function was measured by standard questionnaires, and a standardized Z score was calculated. Linear mixed-model and restricted cubic splines were adopted to explore the association between BPV and cognitive decline. The study included 4853, 1616, and 1432 eligible patients with hypertension from the HRS, ELSA, and CHARLS, respectively. After adjusting for covariates, per-SD increment of VIM of BP was significantly associated with global cognitive function decline in Z scores in both systolic BP (pooled beta, -0.045 [95% CI, -0.065 to -0.029]) and diastolic BP (pooled beta, -0.022 [95% CI, -0.040 to -0.004]) among hypertensive patients. Similar inverse associations were observed in patients with hypertension taking antihypertensive drugs and in patients with hypertension with well-controlled BP. CONCLUSIONS: High BPV was independently associated with a faster cognitive decline among patients with hypertension, even those with antihypertensive medications or well-controlled BP. Further studies are needed to confirm our results and determine whether reducing BPV can prevent or delay cognitive decline.
