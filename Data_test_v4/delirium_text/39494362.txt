39494362|a|Early detection of Alzheimer's disease is vital for timely treatment. Existing biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease reflect amyloid- and tau-related pathology, but it is unknown whether the disease can be detected before cerebral amyloidosis is observed. N-glycosylation has been suggested as an upstream regulator of both amyloid and tau pathology, and levels of the N-glycan structure bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) correlate with tau in blood and CSF already at pre-clinical stages of the disease. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate whether bisecting GlcNAc could predict future cognitive decline in patients from a memory clinic cohort, stratified by amyloid/tau status. We included 251 patients (mean age: 65.6 +- 10.6 years, 60.6% female) in the GEDOC cohort, from the Memory Clinic at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Patients were classified as amyloid/tau positive or negative based on CSF biomarkers. Cognitive decline, measured by longitudinal Mini-Mental State Examination scores, was followed for an average of 10.7 +- 4.1 years and modelled using non-linear mixed effects models. Additionally, bisecting GlcNAc levels were measured in hippocampus and cortex with lectin-based immunohistochemistry in 10 Alzheimer's disease and control brains. We found that CSF bisecting GlcNAc levels were elevated in tau-positive individuals compared with tau-negative individuals, but not in amyloid-positive individuals compared with amyloid-negative individuals. In the whole sample, high levels of CSF bisecting GlcNAc predicted earlier cognitive decline. Strikingly, amyloid/tau stratification showed that high CSF bisecting GlcNAc levels predicted earlier cognitive decline in amyloid-negative patients (beta = 2.53 +- 0.85 years, P = 0.003) and tau-negative patients (beta = 2.43 +- 1.01 years, P = 0.017), but not in amyloid- or tau-positive patients. Finally, histochemical analysis of bisecting GlcNAc showed increased levels in neurons in hippocampus and cortex of Alzheimer's disease compared with control brain (fold change = 1.44-1.49, P < 0.001). In conclusion, high CSF levels of bisecting GlcNAc reflected neuronal pathology and predicted cognitive decline in amyloid- and tau-negative individuals, suggesting that abnormal glycosylation precedes cerebral amyloidosis and tau hyper-phosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease. Bisecting GlcNAc is a promising novel early biomarker for Alzheimer's disease.
