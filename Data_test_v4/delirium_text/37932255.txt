37932255|t|LensAge index as a deep learning-based biological age for self-monitoring the risks of age-related diseases and mortality.
37932255|a|Age is closely related to human health and disease risks. However, chronologically defined age often disagrees with biological age, primarily due to genetic and environmental variables. Identifying effective indicators for biological age in clinical practice and self-monitoring is important but currently lacking. The human lens accumulates age-related changes that are amenable to rapid and objective assessment. Here, using lens photographs from 20 to 96-year-olds, we develop LensAge to reflect lens aging via deep learning. LensAge is closely correlated with chronological age of relatively healthy individuals (R2 > 0.80, mean absolute errors of 4.25 to 4.82 years). Among the general population, we calculate the LensAge index by contrasting LensAge and chronological age to reflect the aging rate relative to peers. The LensAge index effectively reveals the risks of age-related eye and systemic disease occurrence, as well as all-cause mortality. It outperforms chronological age in reflecting age-related disease risks (p < 0.001). More importantly, our models can conveniently work based on smartphone photographs, suggesting suitability for routine self-examination of aging status. Overall, our study demonstrates that the LensAge index may serve as an ideal quantitative indicator for clinically assessing and self-monitoring biological age in humans.
