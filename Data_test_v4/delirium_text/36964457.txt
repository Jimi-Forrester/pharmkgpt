36964457|a|Inhibitors of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) are major strategies to reduce levodopa degradation and thus to increase and prolong its effect in striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission in Parkinson's disease patients. While selegiline/rasagiline and tolcapone/entacapone have been available on the market for more than one decade, safinamide and opicapone have been approved in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Meanwhile, comprehensive data from several post-authorization studies have described the use and specific characteristics of the individual substances in clinical practice under real-life conditions. Here, we summarize current knowledge on both medication classes, with a focus on the added clinical value in Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, we outline practical considerations in the treatment of motor fluctuations and provide an outlook on ongoing studies with MAO-B and COMT inhibitors.
