17091913|a|Poor nutritional status significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality in elderly. Malnutrition and denutrition are amenable to interventions aimed to improve outcomes in acute conditions so that nutritional support is frequently initiated during hospitalisation. If the enteral route remains the first evidence-based choice when the gut is functional, this approach may be difficult to perform in some "geriatric" situations like delirium, agitation, coma or pulmonary congestion. In the first days of the acute condition, when the patient is still stable, an alternative to the enteral route may also be considered. Although there is no evidence that parenteral nutrition is better than enteral nutrition, the peripheral intravenous route may be of interest especially when the enteral route is contraindicated. Moreover, the technique of peripheral parenteral nutition reduces central cannulation-related complications like pneumothorax. We emphasize here the place of this alternative method for a short duration nutritional support when supplement of caloric intake is needed. We discuss indications, a practical approach, our experience and analyze the evidences for this complementary nutritional support.
