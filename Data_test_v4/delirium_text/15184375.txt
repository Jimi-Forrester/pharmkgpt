15184375|a|Alterations in the redox status of proteins have been implicated in the pathology of several neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. We report that peroxynitrite- and hydrogen peroxide-induced disulfides in the neuron-specific microtubule-associated proteins tau and microtubule-associated protein-2 are substrates for the ubiquitous thioredoxin reductase system composed of thioredoxin reductase, human or Escherichia coli thioredoxin, and NADPH. Tau and microtubule-associated protein-2 cysteine oxidation and reduction were quantitated by monitoring the incorporation of 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein, a thiol-specific labeling reagent. Cysteine oxidation of tau and microtubule-associated protein-2 to disulfides altered the ability of the proteins to promote the assembly of microtubules from purified porcine tubulin. Treatment of tau and microtubule-associated protein-2 with either the thioredoxin reductase system or small molecule reductants fully restores the ability of the MAPs to promote microtubule assembly. Thus changes in the redox state of microtubule-associated proteins may regulate microtubule polymerization in vivo.
