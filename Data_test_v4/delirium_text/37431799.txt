37431799|a|BACKGROUND: Elderly patients are prone to postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). The comparison of the effects of anesthetic adjuvant drugs on POCD in elderly patients undergoing noncardiac surgery remains controversial. METHODS: The final search took place on June 10, 2023. Randomized controlled trials including ketamine, ulinastatin, dexmedetomidine, parecoxib, and midazolam on the prevention and treatment of POCD in elderly undergoing noncardiac surgery were collected. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to quantitatively combine the evidence. RESULTS: A total of 35 randomized trials were finally included in this systematic review, and the overall risk of bias is Allocation concealment. These anesthetic adjuvant drugs did not show significant differences in preventing POCD on postoperative days 1 and 7 compared with each other, but ulinastatin may be more effective in preventing POCD than dexmedetomidine [odds ratio (OR) = 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) = (0.10, 0.71)] and parecoxib [OR = 0.3, 95% CI = (0.10, 0.82 on postoperative day 3. The efficiency ranking results also find that ulinastatin and ketamine might provide better effects regarding POCD prevention. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine and ulinastatin might have better effects in preventing POCD in elderly patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Our meta-analysis provided evidence for the use of ulinastatin and ketamine in the prevention of POCD in elderly patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.
