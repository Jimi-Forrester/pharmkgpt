31065417|a|Hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (hsSRS) microscopy has recently emerged as a powerful non-destructive technique for the label-free chemical imaging of biological samples. In most hsSRS imaging experiments, the SRS spectral range is limited by the total bandwidth of the excitation laser to ~300 cm-1 and a spectral resolution of ~25 cm-1. Here we present a novel approach for broadband hsSRS microscopy based on parabolic fiber amplification to provide linearly chirped broadened Stokes pulses. This novel hsSRS instrument provides >600 cm-1 spectral coverage and ~10 cm-1 spectral resolution. We further demonstrated broadband hsSRS imaging of the entire Raman fingerprint region for resolving the distribution of major biomolecules in fixed cells. Moreover, we applied broadband hsSRS in imaging amyloid plaques in human brain tissue with Alzheimer's disease.
