32906672|t|Regulation of Functional Protein Aggregation by Multiple Factors: Implications for the Amyloidogenic Behavior of the CAP Superfamily Proteins.
32906672|a|The idea that amyloid fibrils and other types of protein aggregates are toxic for cells has been challenged by the discovery of a variety of functional aggregates. However, an identification of crucial differences between pathological and functional aggregation remains to be explored. Functional protein aggregation is often reversible by nature in order to respond properly to changing physiological conditions of the cell. In addition, increasing evidence indicates that fast fibril growth is a feature of functional amyloids, providing protection against the long-term existence of potentially toxic oligomeric intermediates. It is becoming clear that functional protein aggregation is a complexly organized process that can be mediated by a multitude of biomolecular factors. In this overview, we discuss the roles of diverse biomolecules, such as lipids/membranes, glycosaminoglycans, nucleic acids and metal ions, in regulating functional protein aggregation. Our studies on the protein GAPR-1 revealed that several of these factors influence the amyloidogenic properties of this protein. These observations suggest that GAPR-1, as well as the cysteine-rich secretory proteins, antigen 5 and pathogenesis-related proteins group 1 (CAP) superfamily of proteins that it belongs to, require the assembly into an amyloid state to exert several of their functions. A better understanding of functional aggregate formation may also help in the prevention and treatment of amyloid-related diseases.
