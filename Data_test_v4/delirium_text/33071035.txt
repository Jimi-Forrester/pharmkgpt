33071035|t|Inherently and Conditionally Essential Protein Catabolism Genes of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
33071035|a|Proteases are critical virulence determinants of Porphyromonas gingivalis, an emerging Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and arthritis pathogen and established agent of periodontitis. Transposon sequencing has been employed to define the core essential genome of this bacterium and genes conditionally essential in multiple environments - abscess formation; epithelial colonization; and cigarette smoke toxin exposure; as well as to elucidate genes required for iron acquisition and a functional type 9 secretion system. Validated and predicted protein catabolism genes identified include a combination of established virulence factors and a larger set of seemingly more mundane proteolytic genes. The functions and relevance of genes that share essentiality in multiple disease-relevant conditions are examined. These common stress-related genes may represent particularly attractive therapeutic targets for the control of P. gingivalis infections.
