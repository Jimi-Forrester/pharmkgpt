28097890|a|In the present study, a new series of 2-[4-(pyrimidin-2-yl)piperazin-1-yl]-2-oxoethyl 4-substituted piperazine-1-carbodithioate derivatives (2a-n) were synthesized and screened for their monoamine oxidase A and B inhibitory activity. The structures of compounds were elucidated using spectroscopic methods and some physicochemical properties of new compounds were predicted using Molinspiration and MolSoft programs. Compounds 2-[4-(pyrimidin-2-yl)piperazin-1-yl]-2-oxoethyl 4-(4-nitrophenyl)piperazine-1-carbodithioate (2j) and 2-[4-(pyrimidin-2-yl)piperazin-1-yl]-2-oxoethyl 4-benzhydrylpiperazine-1-carbodithioate (2m) exhibited selective MAO-A inhibitory activity with IC50 = 23.10, 24.14 microM, respectively. Some of the biological results were found in accordance with the obtained in silico data based on Lipinski's fule of five.
