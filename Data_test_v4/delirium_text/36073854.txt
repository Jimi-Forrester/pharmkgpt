36073854|t|Alzheimer's Drug PBT2 Interacts with the Amyloid beta 1-42 Peptide Differently than Other 8-Hydroxyquinoline Chelating Drugs.
36073854|a|Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) was first described over a century ago, it remains the leading cause of age-related dementia. Innumerable changes have been linked to the pathology of AD; however, there remains much discord regarding which might be the initial cause of the disease. The "amyloid cascade hypothesis" proposes that the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide is central to disease pathology, which is supported by elevated Abeta levels in the brain before the development of symptoms and correlations of amyloid burden with cognitive impairment. The "metals hypothesis" proposes a role for metal ions such as iron, copper, and zinc in the pathology of AD, which is supported by the accumulation of these metals within amyloid plaques in the brain. Metals have been shown to induce aggregation of Abeta, and metal ion chelators have been shown to reverse this reaction in vitro. 8-Hydroxyquinoline-based chelators showed early promise as anti-Alzheimer's drugs. Both 5-chloro-7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline (CQ) and 5,7-dichloro-2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-8-hydroxyquinoline (PBT2) underwent unsuccessful clinical trials for the treatment of AD. To gain insight into the mechanism of action of 8HQs, we have investigated the potential interaction of CQ, PBT2, and 5,7-dibromo-8-hydroxyquinoline (B2Q) with Cu(II)-bound Abeta(1-42) using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), high energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) XAS, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). By XAS, we found CQ and B2Q sequestered ~83% of the Cu(II) from Abeta(1-42), whereas PBT2 sequestered only ~59% of the Cu(II) from Abeta(1-42), suggesting that CQ and B2Q have a higher relative Cu(II) affinity than PBT2. From our EPR, it became clear that PBT2 sequestered Cu(II) from a heterogeneous mixture of Cu(II)Abeta(1-42) species in solution, leaving a single Cu(II)Abeta(1-42) species. It follows that the Cu(II) site in this Cu(II)Abeta(1-42) species is inaccessible to PBT2 and may be less solvent-exposed than in other Cu(II)Abeta(1-42) species. We found no evidence to suggest that these 8HQs form ternary complexes with Cu(II)Abeta(1-42).
