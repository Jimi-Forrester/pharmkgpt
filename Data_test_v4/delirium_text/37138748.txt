37138748|t|Comparison of immune cell profiles associated with heatstroke, sepsis, or cardiopulmonary bypass: Study protocol for an exploratory, case-control study trial.
37138748|a|Introduction: Heatstroke is a life-threatening illness involving extreme hyperthermia and multi-organ failure, and it is associated with high mortality. The immune profiles of heatstroke have not been fully elucidated, and diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of heatstroke are lacking. This study will analyze immune profiles in heatstroke patients as they differ from profiles in patients with sepsis or aseptic inflammation patients in order to identify diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Methods: This exploratory, case-control study will recruit patients with heatstroke, patients with sepsis, patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass as well as healthy controls at West China Hospital of Sichuan University from 1 January 2023 to 31 October 2023. The four cohorts will be profiled at one time point in terms of lymphocytes, monocytes, natural killer cells, and granulocytes using flow cytometry, and cell populations will be visualized in two dimensions using t-SNE and UMAP, then clustered using PhenoGraph and FlowSOM. Gene expression in the specific immune cell populations will also be compared across the four cohorts, as will levels of plasma cytokines using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Outcomes in the cohorts will be monitored during 30-day follow-up. Discussion: This trial is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to improve the diagnosis of heatstroke and prediction of prognosis based on immune cell profiles. The study is also likely to generate new insights into immune responses during heatstroke, which may help clarify the disease process and lay the foundation for immunotherapies.
