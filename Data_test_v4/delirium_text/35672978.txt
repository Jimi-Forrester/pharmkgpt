35672978|t|Sequential Mapping - A Novel Approach to Map from ICD-10-CM to ICD-11.
35672978|a|BACKGROUND: ICD-11 will be used to report mortality statistics by WHO member countries starting in 2022. In the US, ICD-10-CM will likely continue to be used for morbidity coding for a long period of time. A map between ICD-10-CM and ICD-11 will therefore be useful for interoperability purpose between datasets coded with ICD-10-CM and ICD-11. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to explore novel approaches to automatically derive a map between ICD-10-CM and ICD-11 through the sequential use of existing maps. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sequential mapping through ICD-10 yielded better coverage and accuracy compared to mapping through SNOMED CT. CONCLUSIONS: Sequential mapping is useful in automatically creating a draft map from ICD-10-CM to ICD-11 and would reduce manual curation efforts in creating the final map. The various approaches offer different trade-offs among coverage, recall and precision.
