36937144|t|Unmet Needs in Complicated Urinary Tract Infections: Challenges, Recommendations, and Emerging Treatment Pathways.
36937144|a|While urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common types of infections globally, the wide variety of presentations and of severity of disease can make it difficult to manage. The definition for uncomplicated UTIs (uUTIs) is generally regarded as UTIs in healthy, non-pregnant women whereas all other UTIs are considered complicated. There is, however, a lack of consensus definition of complicated UTIs (cUTIs), leading to global differences in management. In addition, the patients who develop complicated UTIs generally have other comorbidities that warrant more urgent intervention. One of the biggest challenges in treating cUTIs is the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). While there have been recent drug approvals for new antibiotic to treat these resistant organisms, a multidisciplinary approach, including regulatory frameworks, provider education and public awareness campaigns, is crucial to limiting unnecessary treatments for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and uUTIs that can ultimately lead to more severe infections.
