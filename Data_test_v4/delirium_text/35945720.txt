35945720|t|Research on depression in Parkinson disease: A bibliometric and visual analysis of studies published during 2012-2021.
35945720|a|BACKGROUND: The diagnosis and treatment rate of Parkinson disease (PD) with depression has a low diagnostic rate, and there is no consensus on the choice of treatment mode. This study evaluates the global research trends of scientific outputs related to depression in PD from multiple perspectives, using a bibliometric analysis and visualization tool to scientifically analyze the knowledge from the literature. METHODS: Literature related to depression in PD published from 2012 to 2021 was included and selected from the Web of Science Core Collection database in October 2021. CiteSpace software was used to visualize and analyze co-occurrence analyses for countries, institutions, authors, and keywords. RESULTS: A total of 4533 articles from the Web of Science database were included. The United States made the largest contribution with the majority of publications (1215; 29.40%). Toronto University was the most productive institution. PD, depression, quality of life, dementia, nonmotor symptom, prevalence, anxiety, Alzheimer disease, symptom, and disorder would be significantly correlated with depression in PD. The current hot spots in this field focus on the following: risk factors for depression in PD, assessment scale of depression in PD, and rehabilitation of depression in PD. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis not only reveals the current research trends and hotspots but also provides some instructive suggestions on the development of depression in PD.
