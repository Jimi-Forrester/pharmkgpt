38540626|t|Sex Differences in the Impact of Dynapenic Abdominal Obesity on Mild Cognitive Impairment among Korean Elderly in the Community.
38540626|a|Abdominal obesity (AO) and dynapenia (DP) are associated with cognitive decline, and the relationship between dynapenic abdominal obesity (DAO), a combination of DP and AO, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been confirmed. This study aims to determine whether this relationship exhibits potential sex differences. The relationship between MCI and DAO was confirmed in 1309 community elderly individuals aged 65 years or older who were not diagnosed with dementia. The MCI was defined as a Korean mini-mental state examination (K-MMSE) score of 18-23 points. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted, categorizing participants into groups: a control group without AO or DP, an AO group, a DP group, and a DAO group. The study results showed that in women, both DP and DAO were significantly associated with MCI not only in the unadjusted Model 1 but also in Model 2, which adjusted for general characteristics and health behaviors, and Model 3, which additionally adjusted for chronic diseases and disease-related characteristics. In men, DP was associated with MCI in the unadjusted Model 1. The findings highlight sex differences in the impact of the DAO on MCI. These differences should be considered when studying the factors related to MCI in old age.
