38769398|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is broadly characterized by neurodegeneration, pathology accumulation, and cognitive decline. There is considerable variation in the progression of clinical symptoms and pathology in humans, highlighting the importance of genetic diversity in the study of AD. To address this, we analyze cell composition and amyloid-beta deposition of 6- and 14-month-old AD-BXD mouse brains. We utilize the analytical QUINT workflow- a suite of software designed to support atlas-based quantification, which we expand to deliver a highly effective method for registering and quantifying cell and pathology changes in diverse disease models. In applying the expanded QUINT workflow, we quantify near-global age-related increases in microglia, astrocytes, and amyloid-beta, and we identify strain-specific regional variation in neuron load. To understand how individual differences in cell composition affect the interpretation of bulk gene expression in AD, we combine hippocampal immunohistochemistry analyses with bulk RNA-sequencing data. This approach allows us to categorize genes whose expression changes in response to AD in a cell and/or pathology load-dependent manner. Ultimately, our study demonstrates the use of the QUINT workflow to standardize the quantification of immunohistochemistry data in diverse mice, - providing valuable insights into regional variation in cellular load and amyloid deposition in the AD-BXD model.
