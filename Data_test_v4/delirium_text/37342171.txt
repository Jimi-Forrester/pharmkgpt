37342171|a|Background: Increasing evidence indicates that metabolites are closely related to human diseases. Identifying disease-related metabolites is especially important for the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Previous works have mainly focused on the global topological information of metabolite and disease similarity networks. However, the local tiny structure of metabolites and diseases may have been ignored, leading to insufficiency and inaccuracy in the latent metabolite-disease interaction mining. Methods: To solve the aforementioned problem, we propose a novel metabolite-disease interaction prediction method with logical matrix factorization and local nearest neighbor constraints (LMFLNC). First, the algorithm constructs metabolite-metabolite and disease-disease similarity networks by integrating multi-source heterogeneous microbiome data. Then, the local spectral matrices based on these two networks are established and used as the input of the model, together with the known metabolite-disease interaction network. Finally, the probability of metabolite-disease interaction is calculated according to the learned latent representations of metabolites and diseases. Results: Extensive experiments on the metabolite-disease interaction data were conducted. The results show that the proposed LMFLNC method outperformed the second-best algorithm by 5.28 and 5.61% in the AUPR and F1, respectively. The LMFLNC method also exhibited several potential metabolite-disease interactions, such as "Cortisol" (HMDB0000063), relating to "21-Hydroxylase deficiency," and "3-Hydroxybutyric acid" (HMDB0000011) and "Acetoacetic acid" (HMDB0000060), both relating to "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency." Conclusion: The proposed LMFLNC method can well preserve the geometrical structure of original data and can thus effectively predict the underlying associations between metabolites and diseases. The experimental results show its effectiveness in metabolite-disease interaction prediction.
