36447509|a|Objectives: This study was aimed to estimate the need for palliative care in an urban resettlement colony of Dakshinpuri Extension, New Delhi. Material and Methods: This was a community-based cross-sectional study conducted in New Delhi. We trained four multipurpose workers to screen the households during their routine household-to-household visits. The screening for the need for palliative care was done using three questions - that is, (1) presence of a bedridden patient or (2) person in need for help in activities of daily living or (3) not able to go for work due to any physical chronic illness. If the answer to any of the three screening questions was yes for any member in a household, then these households were visited by a community physician trained in palliative care and a medical social service officer to confirm the need for palliative care. Patients were administered a semi-structured questionnaire containing the sociodemographic details and an assessment of disease status and review of health records was done. The patient and his/her caregiver were also assessed for awareness regarding palliative care. Results: A total of 2028 households were screened and the need for palliative care was found to be 1.5/1000 population (95% CI: 0.9-2.1). The mean age (SD) of patients who need palliative care was 60 years (SD-12.9). The common diseases which required palliative care were stroke with a focal neurological deficit (45.8%), osteoarthritis with marked dependence (20.8%) and cancer (12.5%). None of the patients was receiving palliative care as patients and their caregivers were not aware of the term palliative care/end of life care/home care for bedridden people/community-based care. Conclusion: The need for palliative care in an urban resettlement colony of North India was found to be 1.1/1000 population. Further studies are required to estimate the need for palliative care in North India.
