32746982|a|The increasing prevalence of non-communicable diseases, namely cancer, Alzheimer's (AD) and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), worldwide continues to be a major health burden. Research attempts have been made to understand the pathophysiology and develop effective therapeutic agents for these diseases using conventional in vitro and ex vivo models. Due to the complexity of human disease mechanisms, often these models fail to recapitulate clinically relevant pathologies. As such, interests are arising in the exploration of three-dimensional (3D) in-vitro models, which create an artificial environment to closely mimic in vivo human conditions. Several studies have developed 3D models for cancer, AD and CVD research which can greatly improve the understanding of biological mechanisms and mirror clinical drug activities. Thus, 3D cultures may provide new in-vitro models that recapitulate the architecture and biological mechanisms of human diseases prior to the need for the use of sentient animals.
