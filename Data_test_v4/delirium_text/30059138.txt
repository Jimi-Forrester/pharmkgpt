30059138|t|Impact of Interactive Education on Health Care Practitioners and Older Adults at Risk of Delirium: A Literature Review.
30059138|a|The current integrative literature review explored the impact of interactive delirium care education in facilitating knowledge transfer to health care practitioners and improving health outcomes for older adults. Academic databases, including MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science, were searched using the terms delirium and simulation or interactive education. Selected articles were analyzed using Critical Appraisals Skills Programme tools. Twenty studies were reviewed and three themes generated to explain the current understanding of the impact of interactive delirium care education on outcomes for: (a) individuals with delirium; (b) organizational health care; and (c) health care practitioners. The current review demonstrated that interactive education is a promising contemporary approach for raising awareness about best practice delirium care by health care practitioners. Due to gaps in the literature, future educational research in the area of delirium care education needs to adopt a more consistent method of reporting findings to ensure successful transferability across care settings.
