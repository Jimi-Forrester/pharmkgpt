30291488|t|Association between clusterin concentration and dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
30291488|a|Studies have showed that high clusterin (CLU) concentration was associated with increased risk of dementia. However, the results based on small samples remained controversial. The aim of our study was to determine the relationship between CLU concentration and the late-life cognitive outcomes including mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VAD), Parkinson's disease related dementia (PDD), Lewy body dementia (DLB) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). A comprehensive search was conducted to screen the eligible studies in online database PubMed, Web of Science and Embase from 1950 to January 2017 according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist. The CLU concentration data in brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum and plasma was collected to determine the strength of this association. The results were presented with standard difference of the mean (SDM) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 28 studies were identified to calculate the association between CLU concentration and dementia. The results showed that the CLU concentration in the plasma (SDM = 0.73, 95% CI 0.26-1.19, P = 0.002) and brain tissue (SDM = 0.71, 95% CI 0.10-1.32, P = 0.022) was increased in dementia compared to normal control. Subgroup analysis showed that the plasma CLU concentration was significantly increased only in the AD group (SDM = 1.85, 95% CI 0.84-2.85, P < 0.001), but not in MCI or other dementias. No association was found between serum and CSF clusterin concentration and dementia. This meta-analysis indicates that high CLU concentration in the plasma and brain is associated with dementia, especially in AD.
