36137875|a|BACKGROUND: Improving the self-efficacy of intensive care unit nurses for delirium care could help them adapt to the changing situation of delirium patients. Validated measures of nurses' self-efficacy of delirium care are lacking OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to develop a Delirium Care Self-Efficacy Scale for assessing nurses' confidence about caring for patients in the intensive care unit and to examine the scale's psychometric properties. METHODS: Draft scale items were generated from a review of relevant literature and face-to-face interviews with intensive care unit nurses; content validity was conducted with a panel of five experts in delirium. A group of nurses were recruited by convenience sampling from intensive care units (N = 299) for item analysis of the questionnaire, assessment of validity, and reliability of the scale. Nurse participants were recruited from nine adult critical care units affiliated with a hospital in Taiwan. Data were collected from August 2020 to July 2021. RESULTS: Content validity index was 0.98 for the initial 26 items, indicating good validity. The critical ratio for item discrimination was 14.47-19.29, and item-to-total correlations ranged from 0.67 to 0.81. Principal component analysis reduced items to 13 and extracted two factors, confidence in delirium assessment and confidence in delirium management, which explained 66.82% of the total variance. Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency was 0.94 with good test-retest reliability (r = 0.92). High scale scores among participants were significantly associated with age (>=40 years), work experience in an intensive care unit (>=10 years), delirium education, and willingness to use delirium assessment tools. CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed Delirium Care Self-Efficacy Scale demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity as a measure of confidence for intensive care nurses caring for and managing patients with delirium in the intensive care unit.
