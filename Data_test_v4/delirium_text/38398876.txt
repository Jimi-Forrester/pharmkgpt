38398876|a|Epilepsy often occurs with other neurological disorders, such as autism, affective disorders, and cognitive impairment. Research indicates that many neurological disorders share a common pathophysiology of dysfunctional energy metabolism, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and gut dysbiosis. The past decade has witnessed a growing interest in the use of metabolic therapies for these disorders with or without the context of epilepsy. Over one hundred years ago, the high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) was formulated as a treatment for epilepsy. For those who cannot tolerate the KD, other diets have been developed to provide similar seizure control, presumably through similar mechanisms. These include, but are not limited to, the medium-chain triglyceride diet, low glycemic index diet, and calorie restriction. In addition, dietary supplementation with ketone bodies, polyunsaturated fatty acids, or triheptanoin may also be beneficial. The proposed mechanisms through which these diets and supplements work to reduce neuronal hyperexcitability involve normalization of aberrant energy metabolism, dampening of inflammation, promotion of endogenous antioxidants, and reduction of gut dysbiosis. This raises the possibility that these dietary and metabolic therapies may not only exert anti-seizure effects, but also reduce comorbid disorders in people with epilepsy. Here, we explore this possibility and review the clinical and preclinical evidence where available.
