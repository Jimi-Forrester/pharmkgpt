22108818|t|Roles of NG2 glial cells in diseases of the central nervous system.
22108818|a|NG2 cells are a novel distinct class of central nervous system (CNS) glial cells, characterized by the expression of the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan NG2. They have been detected in a variety of human CNS diseases. As morphological, physiological and biomolecular studies of NG2 cells have been conducted, their roles have been gradually revealed. Research on cellular and molecular mechanisms in the pathophysiological state was built on the preliminary findings of their physiological functions; and in turn, this helps to clarify their physiological roles and leads to the identification of novel therapeutic targets. This review summarizes recent findings regarding the potential roles of NG2 cells in traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, glioma, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease and electroconvulsive therapy for depression.
