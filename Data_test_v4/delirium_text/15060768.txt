15060768|a|Little is known about the type and frequency of psycho-organic syndromes among prisoners. We report the case of a 20-year-old African HIV-I-positive male asylum seeker who developed increasingly bizarre behaviour in prison. The observation of complex behavioural disturbances with a hallucinatory-delusional state led to the diagnosis of delirium caused by AIDS-defining tuberculous meningoencephalitis. The patient improved with specific, symptomatic treatment. This case illustrates the difficulties in diagnosis when communication is impeded. Scrupulous differential diagnosis is necessary for all prisoners manifesting behavioural disturbances. We discuss the pathogenesis and diagnostic procedures of tuberculous meningoencephalitis.
