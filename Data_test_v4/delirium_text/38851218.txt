The diagnosis relies on clinical assessment, supporting examinations and exclusion of other possible aetiologies. One method that can be used to establish NPSLE is to conduct a re-evaluation by involving several fields of medical science. This study aims to reassess SLE cases with neuropsychiatric (NP) manifestations through multidisciplinary re-evaluation and determine the final diagnosis of NPSLE or non-NPSLE. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study used medical record data from patients with SLE with NP manifestations. Inclusion criteria included patients diagnosed with SLE, who had clinical manifestations of NP and were >18 years old. Multidisciplinary re-evaluation was conducted and agreed upon the diagnosis of NPSLE or non-NPSLE. RESULTS: We included 94 subjects with a total of 132 NP events consisting of 69 NPSLE and 63 non-NPSLE. After re-evaluating NPSLE events, 33.3% were still concluded to be NPSLE. Meanwhile, from the non-NPSLE group, 22.2% were then declared as NPSLE. There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics between the NPSLE and non-NPSLE groups. The proportion of NP events in both groups was almost the same except for cerebrovascular disease manifestations which were more common in the NPSLE group. Higher Mexican SLE Disease Activity Index scores with (p<0.001) or without NP (p=0.02) were observed in the NPSLE group compared with the non-NPSLE group, as well as higher proportion of active disease (p=0.03), higher anti-double-stranded DNA titres (p<0.001) and lower values of C3 (p=0.018) and C4 (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary re-evaluation can be used as a method to confirm the diagnosis of NPSLE. There is a tendency for overdiagnosis of NPSLE when clinicians are faced with NP events in patients with SLE. Complete clinical and supporting data are needed to determine the final diagnosis of NPSLE.
