7609670|t|Aluminum binds to the hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease: a hypothesis.
7609670|a|The hypterphosphorylation of tau proteins is a well-established step in the expression of the pathological features in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While a primary event that links aluminum and AD, the so-called 'aluminum hypotheses', is far from being demonstrated, however, the metal ion could be an important etiological factor, most likely not the only one, of AD etiopathogenesis acting as an aggregating agent of the cytoskeletal elements forming very stable bridges between phosphate groups of the hyperphosphorylated tau elements.
