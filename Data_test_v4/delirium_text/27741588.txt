27741588|t|Cancer-related delirium.
27741588|a|Delirium occurs in 85 to 90 per cent of patients with cancer in the last 24-48 hours of life. It is frightening and distressing for patients and families and is the one of the main reasons why the patient's care cannot be continued at home. The hallmark sign of delirium is a fluctuating level of consciousness, which can change by the hour. It is preceded by restlessness, insomnia, nightmares or irritability. Hypoactive delirium, where patients appear sluggish, is more common in older people.
