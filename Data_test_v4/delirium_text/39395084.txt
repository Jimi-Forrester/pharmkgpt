39395084|a|OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the impact of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) on dementia patients, utilizing real-world data. Specifically, it seeks to evaluate how TCM influences clinical outcomes by examining changes in the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, as well as its effect on medical expenses over a two-year period. Data from a multi-center research database spanning from 2004 to 2021 will be used to achieve these objectives, addressing the current gap in empirical data concerning intuitive outcomes and cognitive function assessments. METHODS: Propensity score matching was adopted to improve comparability among the intervention and control groups. Due to repeated dependent variable measurements, the generalized estimating equation was used to control for socio-demographic characteristics, regional characteristics, and Western medicine treatments for dementia. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, a total of 441 research subjects were included: 90 in the TCM intervention group and 351 in the non-TCM intervention group. The results of multivariate regression analysis showed that compared with the non-TCM intervention group, the MMSE scores in the TCM intervention group increased by 0.608 points each year. The annual change in CDR scores in the TCM intervention group was 0.702 times that of the non-TCM utilization group. After TCM intervention, annual outpatient expenses increased by US$492.2, hospitalization expenses increased by US$324.3, and total medical expenses increased by US$815.9, compared with the non-intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: TCM interventions significantly decelerate cognitive decline in dementia patients, evidenced by slower reductions in MMSE scores and mitigated increases in CDR scores. However, these benefits are accompanied by increased medical expenses, particularly for outpatient care. Future healthcare strategies should balance the cognitive benefits of TCM with its economic impact, advocating for its inclusion in dementia care protocols.
