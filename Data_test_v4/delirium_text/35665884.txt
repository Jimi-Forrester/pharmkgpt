35665884|a|The anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritic, and antimicrobial activities of some common Egyptian seaweeds in addition to their phytochemical and heavy metal contents were investigated. Phytochemical screening of the seaweed extracts showed the presence of different primary and secondary metabolites with different concentrations according to their species and the used solvent. The ethanolic extract of Colpmenia sinuosa (CSBE2) exhibited the maximum anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic activity at 1000 mug/ml concentration compared to other seaweed extracts. The dichloromethane extract of Corallina officinalis (CORM) exerted the highest antimicrobial activity with an average inhibition zone diameter (AV) = 15.29 mm and activity index (AI) = 1.53 and with the highest antagonistic activity against Escherichia coli (28 mm). It is followed by Ulva linza ethanolic extract (ULGE2) which recorded (AV) of 14.71 mm and (AI) of 1.30 with the highest antifungal activity against Candida albicans (30 mm). The collected seaweeds would therefore be a very promising source for treating inflammatory, arthritic, and microbial diseases. Moreover, the investigated seaweeds showed variable concentrations of heavy metals among various species. The mean concentrations of the heavy metals took the following order: Fe > Zn > Mn > Ba > Cu > As > Cr > Ni > Pb > V > Cd > Se > Co > Mo. Based on the permissible limits set by the WHO and CEVA, Pb and Ni in the studied seaweeds were found to be within the permissible limits, whereas Cd and Zn contents were at the borderline. Significant correlations were observed between studied parameters. The estimated daily intakes for most heavy metals were lower than the recommended daily intakes.
