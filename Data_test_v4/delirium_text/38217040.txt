38217040|a|BACKGROUND: Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is involved in regulating integrative brain function and synaptic transmission. Aberrant mGluR5 signaling and relevant synaptic failure play a key role in the initial pathophysiological mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study aims to investigate the association between mGluR5 availability and AD's biomarkers and cognitive function. METHODS: We examined 35 individuals with mGluR5 tracer [18F]PSS232 to assess mGluR5 availability, and with [18F]Florbetapir PET to assess global amyloid deposition, and [18F]FDG PET to assess glucose metabolism. The plasma neurofilament light (NfL) and p-tau181 levels in a subset of individuals were measured (n = 27). The difference in mGluR5 availability between the AD and normal control (NC) groups was explored. The associations of mGluR5 availability with amyloid deposition, glucose metabolism, gray matter volume (GMV), neuropsychological assessment scores, and plasma biomarkers were analyzed. RESULTS: The mGluR5 availability was significantly reduced in AD patients' hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus compared to NCs. Global amyloid deposition was positively associated with mGluR5 availability in the AD group and reversely associated in the NC group. The mGluR5 availability was positively correlated with regional glucose metabolism in the overall and stratified analyses. The availability of mGluR5 in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus demonstrated a strong relationship with the GMV of the medial temporal lobe, plasma p-tau181 or NfL levels, and global cognitive performance. CONCLUSIONS: [18F]PSS232 PET can quantify the changes of mGluR5 availability in the progression of AD. mGluR5 availability correlated not only with neuropathological biomarkers of AD but also with neurodegenerative biomarkers and cognitive performance. mGluR5 may be a novel neurodegenerative biomarker, and whether mGluR5 could be a potential therapeutic target for AD needs to be further studied.
