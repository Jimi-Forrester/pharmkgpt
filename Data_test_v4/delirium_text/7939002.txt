7939002|a|In the field of dementias, attention is focused on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the hope of a treatment which could stop its evolution. Although research tracks exist, this goal is not yet reached. Moreover, all demented patients do not suffer from AD. Our commitment is to provide all patients with the best available treatments. First, cognitive disorders should be detected and investigated early. Behavioural disturbances should be properly managed. Analysis and diagnosis must precede non specific sedation. The primary goal of any therapeutic approach is the patient's quality of life.
