37693503|a|Background: Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the primary cause of dementia, poses a significant global burden. Diagnosis typically involves invasive and costly methods like neuroimaging or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker testing of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and amyloid-beta 42/40 (Abeta 42/40 ). Such procedures are especially impractical in resource-constrained regions, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Blood-based biomarker testing may provide a more accessible screening opportunity. Objective: This study aims to examine if AD-related blood-based biomarkers are associated with cognitive test performance in the Congolese population, where limited research has been conducted. Methods: In this cross-sectional study of 81 Congolese individuals, cognitive assessments (Alzheimer's Questionnaire (AQ) and Community Screening Interview for Dementia (CSID)) distinguished dementia cases from controls. Blood draws were taken to assess p-tau 181 and Abeta 42/40 biomarkers. Relationships between the biomarkers and cognitive performance were analyzed using multiple linear regression models. Results: Plasma Abeta 42/40 was significantly associated with lower CSID scores and higher AQ scores, indicative of AD (p<0.001). These relationships were observed in healthy controls (CSID p=0.01, AQ p=0.03), but not in dementia cases. However, p-tau 181 did not exhibit significant associations with either measure. Factors such as age, sex, education, presence of APOE e4 allele, did not alter these relationships. Conclusion: Understanding relationships between AD-related screening tests and blood-biomarkers is a step towards utilization of blood-based biomarker tests as a screening tool for AD, especially in resource-limited regions. Further research should be conducted to evaluate blood biomarker test efficacy in larger samples and other populations.
