15783247|t|The use of dehydroepiandrosterone therapy in clinical practice.
15783247|a|Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) therapy is controversial due to sensationalized reports of epidemiologic studies and the over-the-counter availability of DHEA. Human clinical trials have investigated the potential efficacy of DHEA therapy in multiple conditions with resultant inconsistencies in findings. DHEA is unique compared with other adrenal steroids because of the fluctuation in serum levels found from birth into advancing age. The lower endogenous levels of DHEA and DHEA sulfate found in advancing age have been correlated with a myriad of health conditions. Also, some studies suggest gender-specific actions of endogenous and exogenous DHEA. We reviewed only pharmacokinetic studies and human clinical trials investigating the efficacy of DHEA therapy that were placebo-controlled as these provided the most reliable scientific basis for the evaluation of DHEA therapy. Pharmacodynamic studies suggest that doses of 30-50mg of oral DHEA may produce physiologic androgen levels, especially in women. These studies report a dose-dependent effect and lack of accumulation of serum androgen levels. Pharmacologic studies also reveal a gender-specific response to DHEA therapy such that testosterone levels are increased in women but not in men. Clinical trials suggest that 50mg of oral DHEA, but not <30mg, can increase serum androgen levels to within the physiologic range for young adults with primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, possibly improve sexual function, improve mood and self-esteem, and decrease fatigue/exhaustion. Whereas DHEA replacement therapy may be effective in treating patients with adrenal insufficiency, human clinical trials investigating its efficacy in conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, HIV, Alzheimer disease, advancing age, male sexual dysfunction, perimenopausal symptoms, depression, and cardiovascular disease have not provided consistent findings.
