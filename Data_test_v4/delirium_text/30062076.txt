30062076|t|Delayed Hypoxic Reversible Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome.
30062076|a|We report a case of postanoxic leukoencephalopathy in a patient who started to have cognitive and behavioral changes weeks after the anoxic insult along with white matter lesions on neuroimaging and demyelination on brain biopsy. His disease course followed a steady decline initially both clinically and radiologically and assumed a steady plateau. Months after his decline, the patient was seen to be completely functional with substantially improved mental status examination and resolution of white matter changes on imaging. The course of this disease entity usually assumes a plateau after clinical worsening with little improvement subsequently. However, our patient showed a dramatic recovery to his baseline after a few months. In this article, we review mechanisms, presentation and the sequelae of hypoxic injury to the brain.
