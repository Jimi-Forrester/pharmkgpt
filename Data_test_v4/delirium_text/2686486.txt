2686486|a|In this review we discuss the symptoms, etiology and therapy of reversible organic mental disorders following surgery. Acute confusional states and delirium still pose difficult and unsolved problems in our operative wards and intensive care units. They are a major cause of morbidity and mortality following geriatric surgery. It is necessary to keep a watchful eye for signs of mild cerebral impairment. Slight disorientation, minor fear, depression or delusions can be the first step towards an aggressive or delirious restlessness. Changes in cognitive skills and a reduction in the operative level are useful guidelines. In most cases more than one etiological factor contributes to the psychopathology. The list of possible causes is long and the frequency and importance varies greatly. Preexisting dementia, unrecognized hypoxia, massive surgical procedures, extracorporeal circulation during cardiac surgery, drug and alcohol withdrawal, infections and the use of multiple medications with cerebral side effects can all interfere. A total, but reversible cerebral alteration or sometimes local damage with neurological dysfunction is thought to be part of the pathomechanism. Disorders of the blood-brain barrier, changes in transmitter turnover, disturbances in the circadian rhythm and REM sleep phases are also being considered. When attempting to make a diagnosis, one should look for signs of neurological damage, withdrawal reactions and exclude or verify major or menacing etiological factors. The therapeutic strategy consists of treatment of the underlying organic diseases, consistent and attentive care that provides orientation and support, and carefully selected medication. The change in pharmacokinetics during old age, and the anticholinergic or other confusion-inducing properties in drugs should be remembered. The administration of either minor or major tranquilizers should be in accordance with a clear treatment strategy.
