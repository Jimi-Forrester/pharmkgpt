26413719|t|Marital Status, Lifestyle and Dementia: A Nationwide Survey in Taiwan.
26413719|a|BACKGROUND: Evidence of an association between lifestyle and marital status and risk of dementia is limited in Asia. METHODS: In this nationwide population-based cross-sectional survey, participants were selected by computerized random sampling from all 19 counties in Taiwan. A total of 10432 residents were assessed by a door-to-door in-person survey, among whom 7035 were normal and 929 were diagnosed with dementia using the criteria recommended by National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association. Premorbid lifestyle habits and demographic data including marital status were compared between normal subjects and participants with dementia. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, gender, education, body mass index, smoking, drinking, marital status, sleep habits, exercise, social engagement and co-morbidities including hypertension, diabetes and cerebrovascular diseases, an increased risk for dementia was found in people with widow or widower status (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.15-1.77) and people who used to take a nap in the afternoon (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.02-1.72). Decreased risk was found in people with the habit of regular exercise (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.09-0.16), adequate night sleep (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.39-0.76) and regular social engagement (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.36-0.77). CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide preliminary evidence of possible risk-reduction effects for dementia, including regular exercise even in modest amounts, social engagement and adequate night sleep, whereas people with the widow/widower status or who used to take an afternoon nap might have increased risk of dementia.
