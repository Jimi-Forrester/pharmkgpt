30138818|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common serious neurodegenerative disorders in the world. The incidence of PD appears to be growing and this illness has an unknown pathogenesis. PD is characterized by selective loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), with an enigmatic cause in most individuals. Current pharmacotherapies and surgery provide symptomatic relief but their effects against the progressive degeneration of neuronal cells are strongly limited if present at all. Therefore, uncovering novel molecular mechanisms of DA cell death and new potentially disease-modifying pharmacological targets is an important task for basic research. Significant progress has been made in understanding the role of disturbed sphingolipid metabolism, particularly relating to ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, the neuroprotective potential of an S1P receptors (S1PR) modulator, fingolimod (FTY720), in multiple sclerosis (MS) and numerous other diseases has been observed over the past decade. In this review, we briefly summarise recent achievements in defining intracellular S1PR-dependent actions, discuss their significance to therapeutic approaches, and explore their neuroprotective potential as a target in PD treatment.
