28971459|a|New research data on Alzheimer's Disease define it as a clinicobiological entity, which has a long preclinical and presymptomatic phase. Emphasis has been given in early detection and diagnosis, which will allow professionals, caregivers and patients themselves to plan and adjust better to the response of the disease. Primary care physicians, who most often are the first to witness and perceive cognitive impairment, may play a central role in the diagnostic procedure, but frequently they are reluctant to be engaged to the screening procedure. The aim of this study is to model a practical guideline for mental assessment and screening, which will be part of a whole step-to-step medical instruction policy for primary care physicians. After a careful review of the literature, we propose a two-visits approach. This approach combines the measures to be administered in each visit, with a detailed list of close-ended questions on the factors concerning Alzheimer's screening. The tests are automatically available to the physician through hyperlink connection and the scores are immediately calculated. Clinical trials will follow to test the validity of the proposed guidance.
