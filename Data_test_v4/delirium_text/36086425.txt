36086425|t|A Multi-scale Attention-based Convolutional Network for Identification of Alzheimer's Disease based on Hippocampal Subfields.
36086425|a|Hippocampus is an important anatomical region for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) identification. In this paper, a multi-scale attention-based convolutional network is proposed for AD identification. The two dimensional (2D) images in three different planes of hippocampal subfields are used as input of three branches of the proposed network, which achieves effective extraction of three dimensional (3D) data features while reducing the network complexity and improving the computational efficiency. The end-to-end 2D multi-scale attention-based deep learning network improves the diversity of the extracted features and captures significance of various voxels for classification, which achieves significant classification performance without handcrafted feature extraction and model stacking. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on AD identification. The proposed method will be useful for further medical analysis on hippocampal subfields of the brain for diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease.
