31511075|a|BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibition has dramatically transformed the treatment of malignant melanoma. With increasing use, their unique spectrum of immune-mediated toxicity has become apparent. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of sequential immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in a patient with metastatic melanoma treated with single-agent anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) therapy, pembrolizumab. Although numerous cases of irAEs have been reported, sequential multi-organ involvement, including progressive atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, autoimmune nephritis, autoimmune hepatitis, and autoimmune encephalitis after cessation of therapy, has not been previously documented. CONCLUSIONS: Immunosuppression resulted in clinical remission of each irAE, highlighting the importance of vigilance for autoimmune complications in patients treated with checkpoint inhibition, even after immunotherapy cessation.
