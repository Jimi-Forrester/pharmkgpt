39226703|t|Geriatric Trauma Intensive Care Unit Admission Guideline is Associated With Reduction in Unplanned Intensive Care Unit Admissions.
39226703|a|INTRODUCTION: Geriatric trauma patients experience disproportionate adverse outcomes compared to younger patients with similar injuries and represent an important target for quality improvement. Our institution created a Geriatric Trauma Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Admission Guideline to identify high-risk patients and elevate their initial level of care. The goal of implementation was reducing unplanned ICU admissions (UIAs), a recognized surrogate marker for adverse outcomes. METHODS: The Geriatric Trauma ICU Admission Guideline was implemented on July 1, 2020, at a large academic level-1 trauma center. Using trauma registry data, we retrospectively analyzed geriatric patients who met the criteria for ICU admission 2 y preimplementation and postimplementation. The main outcome was UIAs in the target geriatric population. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, ventilator days, mortality, and 30-d readmissions. Characteristics between groups were compared with t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, or chi-square test. Risk-adjusted logistic and negative binomial regressions were used for the categorical and continuous outcomes, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 1075 patients were identified with 476 in the preimplementation and 599 in the postimplementation group. The groups were similar across most demographic and physiologic characteristics, with the exception of a higher incidence of hypertension in the preimplementation group (77.7% versus 71.6%, P = 0.02) and COVID in the postimplementation group (3.8% versus 0.4%, P < 0.001). While mechanism of injury was similar, there was a higher incidence of traumatic brain injury in the preimplementation group (35.1% versus 26.2%, P = 0.002). In the postimplementation group, there was a higher incidence >=3 rib fractures (68% versus 61.3%, P = 0.02) and an expected increase in initial ICU level of care (69.5% versus 37.1%, P < 0.001). The odds of a UIA after guideline implementation were reduced by half (adjusted odds ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.3-0.92). There was not a significant difference in the secondary outcomes of mortality, 30-d readmission, hospital-free days, ICU-free days, or ventilator-free days. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the Geriatric Trauma ICU Admission Guideline was associated with a reduction in UIAs by half in the target population. There was not a significant change in hospital-free days, ICU-free days, ventilator-free days, mortality, 30-d readmission, or venous thromboembolism. Further research is needed to better refine admission guidelines, examine the association of preventative admission on delirium, and determination of criteria that would allow safe, earlier downgrade.
