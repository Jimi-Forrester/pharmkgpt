20811648|a|Information about recent visual decline (RVD) and its consequences is limited. The aim was to investigate this in an observational, prospective study. Participants were recipients of community home services, >/=65 years, from Ontario (Canada, n = 101618), Finland (the-RAI-database, STAKES, n = 1103), and 10 other European countries (the-Aged-in-HOmeCarestudy (AdHOC), n = 3793). The instrument RAI-HC version 2.0 was used in all sites. RVD was assessed by the item "Worsening of vision compared to status 90 days ago" and was present in 6-49% in various sites, more common among persons living alone, and in females. In the AdHOC sample, RVD was independently associated with declining social activity and limited outdoors activities due to fear of falling. The combination of stable vision impairment (SVI) and RVD was independently associated with IADL loss. RVD is common and has greater impact than SVI on social life and function. Caregivers should be particularly aware of RVD, its consequences, and help patients to seek assessments, treatment, and rehabilitation.
