35237298|t|A New Prognostic Risk Score: Based on the Analysis of Autophagy-Related Genes and Renal Cell Carcinoma.
35237298|a|Introduction: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients suffer from its high recurrence and metastasis rate, and a new prognostic risk score to predict individuals with high possibility of recurrence or metastasis is in urgent need. Autophagy has been found to have a dual influence on tumorigenesis. In this study we aim to analyze autophagy related genes (ATGs) and ccRCC patients and find a new prognostic risk score. Method: Analyzing differential expression genes (DEGs) in TCGA-KIRC dataset, and took intersection with ATGs. Through lasso, univariate, and multivariate cox regression, DEGs were chosen, and the coefficients and expression levels of them were components constructing the formula of risk score. We analyzed mRNA expression of DEGs in tumor and normal tissue in ONCOMINE database and TCGA-KIRC dataset. The Human Protein Atlas (HPA) was used to analyze protein levels of DEGs. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was examined in STRING and visualized in cytoscape. Functional enrichment analysis was performed in RStudio. To prove the ability and practicibility of risk score, we analyzed univariate and multivariate cox regression, Kaplan-Meier curve (K-M curve), risk factor association diagram, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) of survival and nomogram, and the performance of nomogram was evaluated by calibration curve. Then we further explored functional enrichment related to risk groups through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and Metascape database. At last, we investigated immune cell infiltration of DEGs and two risk groups through TIMER database and "Cibersort" algorithm. Result: We identified 7 DEGs (BIRC5, CAPS, CLDN7, CLVS1, GMIP, IFI16, and TCIRG1) as components of construction of risk score. All 7 DEGs were differently expressed in ccRCC and normal tissue according to ONCOMINE database and TCGA-KIRC dataset. Functional enrichment analysis indicated DEGs, and their most associated genes were shown to be abundant in autophagy-related pathways and played roles in tumorigenesis and progression processes. A serious analysis proved that this risk score is independent from the risk signature of ccRCC patients. Conclusion: The risk score constructed by 7 DEGs had the ability of predicting prognosis of ccRCC patients and was conducive to the identification of novel prognostic molecular markers. However, further experiment is still needed to verify its ability and practicability.
