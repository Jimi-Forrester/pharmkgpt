6441959|a|The muscarinic agonist RS 86 was administered to patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) in a series of controlled clinical trials. Daily doses were up to 3.0 mg orally for a maximum duration of 18 weeks. RS 86 produced typical peripheral cholinergic effects, but appeared to be better tolerated than similar drugs, such as physostigmine and arecoline. Positive clinical changes with regard to cognitive functions, mood, and social behavior were seen in a minority of AD and SDAT patients. Psychometric tests suggested improvement of functions entailing a speed component. RS 86 is a suitable drug for further clinical experiments in AD and SDAT.
