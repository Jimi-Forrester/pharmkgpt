36039860|t|Reactive sulfur species and their significance in health and disease.
36039860|a|Reactive sulfur species (RSS) have been recognized in the last two decades as very important molecules in redox regulation. They are involved in metabolic processes and, in this way, they are responsible for maintenance of health. This review summarizes current information about the essential biological RSS, including H2S, low molecular weight persulfides, protein persulfides as well as organic and inorganic polysulfides, their synthesis, catabolism and chemical reactivity. Moreover, the role of RSS disturbances in various pathologies including vascular diseases, chronic kidney diseases, diabetes mellitus Type 2, neurological diseases, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and in the most current problem of COVID-19 is presented. The significance of RSS in aging is also mentioned. Finally, the possibilities of using the precursors of various forms of RSS for therapeutic purposes are discussed.
