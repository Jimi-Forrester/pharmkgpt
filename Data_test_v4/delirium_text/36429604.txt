36429604|t|The Landscape of Outpatient Palliative Care in Germany: Results from a Retrospective Analysis of 14,792 Patients.
36429604|a|BACKGROUND: Palliative care comprises multiprofessional, integrated, person-centered healthcare services for patients and their families facing problems related to progressive or advanced diseases and limited life expectancy. Although non-oncology patients' needs are similar to those of tumor patients, they are often underestimated. The purpose of our study was to investigate the actual utilization of palliative care services in Germany, especially in the outpatient setting. METHODS: Using the IQVIA Disease Analyzer database, a total of 14,792 outpatients from 805 primary care practices in Germany with documented palliative care and related diagnosis between 2018 and 2021 were analyzed. Proportions of different diagnoses among patients receiving outpatient palliative care were stratified by gender and different age groups. RESULTS: The most common underlying diagnosis for outpatient palliative care was cancer (55%), followed by heart failure (16%) and dementia (8%), with age- and sex-specific differences found in the proportion of diagnoses for utilization. While the relative proportions of cancers decreased with age (87% in the 18- to 50-year-old age group versus 37% in the 80-plus age group), the proportion of palliative care related to heart failure increased in the older population (2% in the 18- to 50-year-old age group versus 25% in the 80-plus age group). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an overview of the situation of outpatient palliative care in Germany and shows age- and gender-specific trends regarding the underlying medical diagnoses. Based on these data, palliative care should be adapted to current demographic developments.
