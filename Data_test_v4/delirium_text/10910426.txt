10910426|a|The authors compared Apo-E epsilon 4 frequencies for Cuban American and white non-Hispanic persons with and without Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Apo-E epsilon 4 allele conferred as large a risk for AD in Cuban Americans as for white non-Hispanics, a finding that differs from those for Hispanic subjects as a whole.
