38844605|a|The proteasome-associated deubiquitinase USP14 is a potential drug target. Using an inducible USP14 knockout system in colon cancer cells, we found that USP14 depletion impedes cellular proliferation, induces cell cycle arrest, and leads to a senescence-like phenotype. Transcriptomic analysis revealed altered gene expression related to cell division and cellular differentiation. USP14 knockout cells also exhibited changes in morphology, actin distribution, and expression of actin cytoskeletal components. Increased ubiquitin turnover was observed, offset by upregulation of polyubiquitin genes UBB and UBC. Pharmacological inhibition of USP14 with IU1 increased ubiquitin turnover but did not affect cellular growth or morphology. BioGRID data identified USP14 interactors linked to actin cytoskeleton remodeling, DNA damage repair, mRNA splicing, and translation. In conclusion, USP14 loss in colon cancer cells induces a transient quiescent cancer phenotype not replicated by pharmacologic inhibition of its deubiquitinating activity.
