20298515|t|Alterations in the complement cascade in post-traumatic stress disorder.
20298515|a|BACKGROUND: In the present study we assessed the functional state of the major mediator of the immune response, the complement system, in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: Thirty one PTSD patients within 13 years from traumatic event and the same number of sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers were involved in this study. In the blood serum of the study subjects hemolytic activities of the classical and alternative complement pathways, as well as the activities of the individual complement components have been measured. Correlation analysis between all measured parameters was also performed. RESULTS: According to the results obtained PTSD is characterized by hyperactivation of the complement classical pathway, hypoactivation of the complement alternative pathway and overactivation of the terminal pathway. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained provide further evidence on the involvement of the inflammatory component in pathogenesis of PTSD.
