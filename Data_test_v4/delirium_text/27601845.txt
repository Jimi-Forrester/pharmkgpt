27601845|t|In vitro Antioxidant and Enzymatic Approaches to Evaluate Neuroprotector Potential of Blechnum Extracts without Cytotoxicity to Human Stem Cells.
27601845|a|BACKGROUND: Investigation of selected plant extracts on multi-targets related to neurodegeneration, such as monoamine oxidases (MAO), cholinesterase enzymes, and antioxidant activities (AOA) is a useful tool for identification of new scaffolds. OBJECTIVE: This work investigated biological effects of three Blechnum methanol extracts from Brazil and chemical profile of the most active sample. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AOA included scavenging of hydroxyl and nitric oxide radicals, also lipid peroxidation inhibition. Enzymatic modulation of Blechnum binervatum, Blechnum brasiliense, and Blechnum occidentale extracts on MAO and cholinesterases was conducted. Moreover, total phenol content was performed with all samples, and high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection mass spectrometry HPLC-DAD-MS analysis was carried out with B. brasiliense. Possible toxic effects were evaluated on Wistar rats polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) and human stem cells. RESULTS: B. brasiliense extract presented the highest phenolic amount (9.25 g gallic acid equivalent/100 g extract) and lowest IC50 values (112.3 +- 2.61 and 176.1 +- 1.19 mug/mL) against hydroxyl radicals and on lipid peroxidation, respectively, showing strong AO effects. On nitric oxide assay and cholinesterase inhibition, all extracts were considered inactive. MAO-A selective action was evidenced, being B. brasiliense powerful against this enzyme (IC50: 72.7 mug/mL), followed by B. occidentale and B. binervatum (IC50: 130.85 and 165.2 mug/mL). No cytotoxic effects were observed on PMN and human stem cells treated with Blechnum extracts. HPLC-DAD-MS analysis of B. brasiliense allowed the identification of chlorogenic and rosmarinic acids. CONCLUSION: Our results especially highlight B. brasiliense, with pronounced phenols content and strong effects on selected targets related to neurodegeneration, being characterized as a natural safe source of bioactive hydroxycinnamic acids. SUMMARY: Blechnum crude extracts showed high phenolic amounts and valuable IC50 values on targets related with neurodegenerative disordersBlechnum brasiliense was the most active sample, with strong radical scavenging and lipid peroxidation inhibition, also with monoamine oxidases: A selective modulationNo cytotoxic effects were observed on polymorphonuclear cells rat cells and human stem cells treated with Blechnum extractsHigh-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-mass spectrometry analysis of Blechnum brasiliense allowed the identification of hydroxycinnamic derivatives: Chlorogenic and rosmarinic acids. Abbreviations used: IC50: half maximal inhibitory concentration; MAO: monoamine oxidase; MAO-A: monoamine oxidase isoform A; MAO-B: monoamine oxidase isoform B; HO : hydroxyl radical.
