31985080|t|Effect of Timing of Intravenous Fentanyl Administration on the Incidence of Posttonsillectomy Nausea and Vomiting.
31985080|a|OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: Fentanyl is commonly administered toward the end of tonsillectomy to prevent emergence delirium and reduce postoperative pain. However, it can delay emergence from anesthesia and increase the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). The goal of our study was to compare the risk of PONV based on the timing of fentanyl administration at the end of tonsillectomy in children. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. METHODS: One hundred forty patients aged 3 to 7 years undergoing tonsillectomy were divided into two groups. Fentanyl (1 mug/kg) was administered at the end of surgery in group 1 (n = 70) and at 10 to 15 minutes before the end of surgery in group 2 (n = 70). Time to regular breathing and time to emergence from anesthesia were measured from the end of surgery. PONV and pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium scale scores were assessed every 10 minutes after admission to the postanesthesia care unit. RESULTS: Incidences of PONV (2.9% vs. 2.9%, P > .99) and emergence delirium (11.4% vs. 5.7%, P = .23) were not significantly different between the two groups. Time to regular breathing (mean difference = 2.3 minutes; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9 to 3.7 minutes) and time to emergence (median difference = 6.5 minutes; 95% CI, 2.5 to 10.5 minutes) were significantly longer in group 1 than in group 2. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no beneficial effect on PONV, recovery of regular breathing and consciousness was quicker with earlier fentanyl administration. Emergence delirium was well-controlled, similar to that with fentanyl administration at the end of surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1b Laryngoscope, 2020.
