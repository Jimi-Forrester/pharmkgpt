37786539|t|External validation of the first prognostic nomogram for older adults with cancer.
37786539|a|Background: The geriatric oncology population tends to be complex because of multimorbidity, functional and cognitive decline, malnutrition and social frailty. Prognostic indices for predicting survival of elderly cancer patients to guide treatment remain scarce. A nomogram based on all domains of the geriatric assessment was previously developed at the National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS) to predict overall survival (OS) in elderly cancer patients. This nomogram comprised of six variables (age, eastern cooperative oncology group performance status, disease stage, geriatric depression scale (GDS), DETERMINE nutritional index and serum albumin). Objectives: To externally validate the NCCS prognostic nomogram. Design: This is a prospective cohort study. Methods: The nomogram was developed based on a training cohort of 249 patients aged >=70 years who attended the NCCS outpatient geriatric oncology clinic between May 2007 and November 2010. External validation of the nomogram using the Royston and Altman approach was carried out on an independent testing cohort of 252 patients from the same clinic between July 2015 and June 2017. Model misspecification, discrimination and calibration were assessed. Results: Median OS of the testing cohort was 3.1 years, which was significantly higher than the corresponding 1.0 year for the training cohort (log-rank p < 0.001). The nomogram achieved a high level of discrimination in the testing cohort (0.7112), comparable to the training cohort (0.7108). Predicted death probabilities were generally well calibrated with the observed death probabilities, as the joint test of calibration-in-the-large estimates at year 1, 2 and 3 from zeros and calibration slope from one was insignificant with p = 0.432. There were model misspecifications in GDS and serum albumin. Conclusion: This study externally validated the prognostic nomogram in an independent cohort of geriatric oncology patients. This supports the use of this nomogram in clinical practice.
