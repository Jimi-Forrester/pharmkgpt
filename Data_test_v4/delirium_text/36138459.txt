36138459|t|Changes in sensory, postural stability and gait functions depending on cognitive decline, and possible markers for detection of cognitive status.
36138459|a|BACKGROUND: Numerous people never receive a formal dementia diagnosis. This issue can be addressed by early detection systems that utilize alternative forms of classification, such as gait, balance, and sensory function parameters. In the present study, said functions were compared between older adults with healthy cognition, older adults with low executive function, and older adults with cognitive impairment, to determine which parameters can be used to distinguish these groups. RESULTS: A group of cognitively healthy older men was found to have a significantly greater gait cadence than both the low executive function group (113.1 +- 6.8 vs. 108.0 +- 6.3 steps/min, p = 0.032) and the cognitively impaired group (113.1 +- 6.8 vs. 107.1 +- 7.4 steps/min, p = 0.009). The group with low executive function was found to have more gait stability than the impaired cognition group, represented by the single limb support phase (39.7 +- 1.2 vs. 38.6 +- 1.3%, p = 0.027). Additionally, the healthy cognition group had significantly greater overall postural stability than the impaired cognition group (0.6 +- 0.1 vs. 1.1 +- 0.1, p = 0.003), and the low executive function group had significantly greater mediolateral postural stability than the impaired cognition group (0.2 +- 0.1 vs. 0.6 +- 0.6, p = 0.012). The low executive function group had fewer mistakes on the sentence recognition test than the cognitively impaired (2.2 +- 3.6 vs. 5.9 +- 6.4, p = 0.005). There were no significant differences in visual capacity, however, the low executive function group displayed an overall greatest ability. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with low executive function showcased a lower walking pace, but their postural stability and sensory functions did not differ from those of the older adults with healthy cognition. The variables concluded as good cognitive status markers were (1) gait cadence for dividing cognitively healthy from the rest and (2) single limb support portion, mediolateral stability index, and the number of mistakes on the sentence recognition test for discerning between the low executive function and cognitive impairment groups.
