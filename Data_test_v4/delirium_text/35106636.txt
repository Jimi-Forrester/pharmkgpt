35106636|a|A quest for identification of novel, safe and efficient natural compounds, as additives in the modern food and cosmetic industries, has been prompted by concerns about toxicity and side effects of synthetic products. Plant phenolic compounds are one of the most documented natural products due to their multifarious biological applications. Grape (Vitis vinifera) is an important source of phenolic compounds such as phenolic acids, tannins, quinones, coumarins and, most importantly, flavonoids/flavones. This review crisply encapsulates enzyme inhibitory activities of various grape polyphenols towards different key human-ailment-associated enzymes: xanthine oxidase (gout), tyrosinase (hyperpigmentation), alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase (diabetes mellitus), pancreatic lipase (obesity), cholinesterase (Alzheimer's disease), angiotensin i-converting enzymes (hypertension), alpha-synuclein (Parkinson's disease) and histone deacetylase (various diseases). The review also depicts the enzyme inhibitory mechanism of various grape polyphenols and briefly discusses their stature as potential therapeutic and drug development candidates. KEY POINTS:   Nineteen major bioactive polyphenols from the grape/grape products and their disease targets are presented   Sixty-two important polyphenols as enzyme inhibitors from grape/grape products are presented   A thorough description and graphical presentation of biological significance of polyphenols against various diseases.
