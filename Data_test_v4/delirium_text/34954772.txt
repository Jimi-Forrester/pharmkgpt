34954772|a|OBJECTIVES: To verify whether mesenchymal stem cells cocultured with tanshinone IIA may ameliorate Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting oxidative stress. METHODS: Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups named Sham, Abeta25-35, mesenchymal stem cells, and mesenchymal stem cells (tanshinone IIA). The rats were treated according to different groups. The neurobehavioral performance of Sprague-Dawley rats was evaluated via Morris water maze test. Histological changes were checked via hematoxylin-eosin staining. The levels of total antioxidant activity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and malondialdehyde in hippocampus were assayed by ELISA kit. The levels of Abeta, p-tau/tau, and p-AMP-activated protein kinase/AMP-activated protein kinase in hippocampus were checked by Western blot. RESULTS: Our research showed that the injection of mesenchymal stem cells (tanshinone IIA) into the hippocampus alleviated learning and memory deficits and reduced hippocampal neuronal injury in the Alzheimer's disease rats. Moreover, mesenchymal stem cells (tanshinone IIA) treatment suppressed oxidative stress, attenuated Abeta accumulation reduced Tau hyperphosphorylation, and enhanced the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase in the hippocampus of the Alzheimer's disease rats. However, there were almost no significant difference between the mesenchymal stem cells and Abeta25-35 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Mesenchymal stem cells (tanshinone IIA) transplantation may be a potential treatment for curing Alzheimer's disease, which may be related to the inhibition of oxidative stress.
