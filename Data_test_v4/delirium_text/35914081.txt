35914081|t|A Quality Improvement Study on Delirium Awareness Day: In Pursuit of Missed Delirium Diagnoses.
35914081|a|The current study aimed to screen for delirium in hospitalized older adults and assess the validity of the Turkish version of the 4A's Test (4AT-TR) as a feasible tool to integrate in routine patient care. The point prevalence of delirium according to clinical evaluation in routine practice was detected among all patients aged >=60 years in 12 pilot wards. Delirium screening was then conducted by two arms: (a) nurses using the 4AT-TR and (b) geriatricians according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) criteria. Prevalence of delirium according to clinical impression was 3.3% (n = 4), whereas prevalence was 12.4% (n = 17) according to DSM-5 criteria and 13.8% (n = 17) according to the 4AT-TR. The 4AT-TR performed by nurses had a sensitivity of 66.6% and specificity of 93.5%. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for delirium diagnosis was 0.819 (p < 0.001). Most delirium cases remain undetected unless a routine and formal delirium assessment is integrated in hospital care of high-risk patients. The 4AT-TR performed by nurses seems to be a valid tool for determining delirium in hospitalized older adults. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 48(8), 43-51.].
