38786459|t|Comparison of Financial Hardship and Healthcare Utilizations Associated with Cancer in the United States Medicare Programs during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
38786459|a|BACKGROUND: In the United States, Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with cancer often face significant financial challenges due to the expensive nature of cancer treatments and increased cost-sharing responsibilities. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the financial hardships and healthcare utilizations faced by those enrolled in Medicare Advantage (MA) compared to those in traditional fee-for-service Medicare (TM) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study aims to investigate the subjective financial hardships experienced by individuals enrolled in TM and MA and to determine whether these two Medicare programs exhibit differences in healthcare utilization during the pandemic. METHODS: We utilized data from the 2020-2022 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), focusing on nationally representative samples of cancer survivors aged 65 or older. Financial hardship was categorized into three distinct groups: material (e.g., problems with medical bills), psychological (e.g., worry about paying), and behavioral (e.g., delayed care due to cost). Healthcare utilization included wellness visits (preventive care), emergency care services, hospitalizations, and telehealth. We used survey design-adjusted analysis to compare the study outcomes between MA and TM. RESULTS: Among a weighted sample of 4.4 million Medicare beneficiaries with cancer (mean age: 74.9), 76% were enrolled in MA plans. Cancer survivors with a college degree (59.3% vs. 49.8%) and high family income (38.2% vs. 31.1%) were more likely to enroll in MA plans. There were no significant differences in any material, psychological, or behavioral financial hardship domains between beneficiaries with MA and TM plans except forgone counseling due to cost. For healthcare utilization measures, cancer survivors in MA were more likely than those in TM to have flu vaccination (77.2% vs. 70.1%) and experience lower hospitalizations (16.0% vs. 20.0%). However, there were no differences in other health service utilizations between MA and TM. CONCLUSION: While no significant differences were observed in any materialized, psychological, or behavioral financial hardships, older cancer survivors enrolled in MA plans were more likely to receive vaccinations and lower hospitalization rates during COVID-19. Although other preventive or primary care visits (i.e., wellness visits) were higher, their difference did not reach statistical significance. As MA grows in popularity, it is essential to consistently monitor and evaluate the performance and outcomes of Medicare plans for cancer survivors as we navigate the post-pandemic landscape.
