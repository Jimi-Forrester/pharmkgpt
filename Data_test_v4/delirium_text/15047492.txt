15047492|a|Inflammatory and regulatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, -6, -8, -10 and -12) regulate both the humoral and cellular immune responses. Cytokines have diverse peripheral and central functions. They are critical mediators of protective host responses, including defense against microbial invasion and tumorigenesis. However, the production of specific proinflammatory cytokines must be tightly regulated and compartmentalized to prevent the overexpression of these molecules that can end in chronic inflammation and tissue injury. Many diseases like autoimmune disease (rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, arteriosclerosis, Crohn's disease), neurodegenerative disease (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease), tumor invasion and metastasis correlate with a deregulation in cytokine action. Thus, cytokines network provides an attractive and intensely competitive area of potential targets for therapeutic intervention. To monitor such secretion patterns in presence of putative drugs obtained by high throughput screening (HTS) some new techniques recently appeared on the market. We here compared results obtained by CBA (BD Cytometric Bead Array) to IC50 values obtained by classical sandwich Elisa. The complexity and cost of this new method is largely compensated by simultaneous testing of 6 cytokines in only 25 micro L of cell supernatant.
