33123190|t|Alzheimer's Disease as a Result of Stimulus Reduction in a GABA-A-Deficient Brain: A Neurocomputational Model.
33123190|a|Several research studies point to the fact that sensory and cognitive reductions like cataracts, deafness, macular degeneration, or even lack of activity after job retirement, precede the onset of Alzheimer's disease. To simulate Alzheimer's disease earlier stages, which manifest in sensory cortices, we used a computational model of the koniocortex that is the first cortical stage processing sensory information. The architecture and physiology of the modeled koniocortex resemble those of its cerebral counterpart being capable of continuous learning. This model allows one to analyze the initial phases of Alzheimer's disease by "aging" the artificial koniocortex through synaptic pruning, by the modification of acetylcholine and GABA-A signaling, and by reducing sensory stimuli, among other processes. The computational model shows that during aging, a GABA-A deficit followed by a reduction in sensory stimuli leads to a dysregulation of neural excitability, which in the biological brain is associated with hypermetabolism, one of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
