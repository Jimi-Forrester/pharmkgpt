37494900|t|Geriatric Pain Protocol: Impact of Multimodal Pain Care for Elderly Orthopaedic Trauma Patients.
37494900|a|Hip fractures are costly, and associated complications are the leading cause of injury-related deaths in persons 65 years or older. Pain medications in this population can be more potent, have a longer duration of action, and have serious side effects (Chau et al., 2008). Hip fractures are projected to reach 6.26 million worldwide by 2050 (Gullberg et al., 1997; Kannus et al., 1996). Morrison et al. (2003) report that uncontrolled pain leads to increased hospital length of stay (LOS), delayed physical therapy, and long-term functional impairment. The Geriatric Pain Protocol (GPP) is Cedars-Sinai's multimodal pain management solution, addressing the needs of older adult inpatients who have suffered fractures. Can the implementation of GPP reduce the morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) used, LOS, and postoperative outcomes compared with non-GPP patients? Study participants included hip fracture patients admitted between February 1, 2019, and March 5, 2021; data were collected prospectively from electronic medical records. Inclusion criteria were patients 65 years or older with a hip fracture sustained from a ground-level fall and surgical candidate. Participants were divided into two categories: Geriatric Fracture Program (GFP) and non-GFP, with physician participation in the GFP being the differentiating factor. End points included postoperative pain, postoperative opioid utilization, LOS, complications, and 30-day readmission rates. The Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher's exact test were used for data analysis. Spearman's rank-based correlation coefficient was used to assess associations. The GPP decreased MME daily totals on Days 1 and 2 and improved pain management compared with non-GPP patients. The MMEs were lower in the GPP group than in the non-GPP group for both Postoperative Day 1 (POD1) (p = .007) and POD2 (p = .043); Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) Pain on POD1 was lower in the GPP group (vs. non-GPP, p = .013). There were no group differences in NRS POD2 Pain or complications (all ps > .1). The study sample (N = 453) had no significant difference between sex and LOS (all ps > .3). Although not statistically significant, the 30-day readmission rate trended lower in patients treated in accordance with the GPP. Use of the multimodal GPP reduced pain levels and MME totals for older adult hip fracture inpatients. More data are needed to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed protocol. Future studies should explore the possibilities of using the GPP across the geriatric orthopaedic patient care continuum.
