34192920|t|2021 John Charnley Award: A protocol-based strategy when using hemiarthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty for femoral neck fractures decreases mortality, length of stay, and complications.
34192920|a|AIMS: While interdisciplinary protocols and expedited surgical treatment improve the management of hip fractures in the elderly, the impact of such interventions on patients specifically undergoing arthroplasty for a femoral neck fracture is not clear. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of an interdisciplinary protocol for the management of patients with a femoral neck fracture who are treated with an arthroplasty. METHODS: In 2017, our institution introduced a standardized interdisciplinary hip fracture protocol. We retrospectively reviewed adult patients who underwent hemiarthroplasty (HA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA) for femoral neck fracture between July 2012 and March 2020, and compared patient characteristics and outcomes between those treated before and after the introduction of the protocol. RESULTS: A total of 157 patients were treated before the introduction of the protocol (35 (22.3%) with a THA), and 114 patients were treated after its introduction (37 (32.5%) with a THA). The demographic details and medical comorbidities were similar in the two groups. Patients treated after the introduction of the protocol had a significantly reduced median time between admission and surgery (22.8 hours (interquartile range (IQR) 18.8 to 27.7) compared with 24.8 hours (IQR 18.4 to 43.3) (p = 0.042), and a trend towards a reduced mean time to surgery (24.1 hours (SD 10.7) compared with 46.5 hours (SD 165.0); p = 0.150), indicating reduction in outliers. Patients treated after the introduction of the protocol had a significantly decreased rate of major complications (4.4% vs 17.2%; p = 0.005), decreased median hospital length of stay in hospital (4.0 days vs 4.8 days; p = 0.008), increased rate of discharge home (26.3% vs 14.7%; p = 0.030), and decreased one-year mortality (14.7% vs 26.3%; p = 0.049). The 90-day readmission rate (18.2% vs 21.7%; p = 0.528) and 30-day mortality (3.7% vs 5.1%; p = 0.767) did not significantly differ. Patients who underwent HA were significantly older than those who underwent THA (82.1 years (SD 10.4) vs 71.1 years (SD 9.5); p < 0.001), more medically complex (mean Charlson Comorbidity Index 6.4 (SD 2.6) vs 4.1 (SD 2.2); p < 0.001), and more likely to develop delirium (8.5% vs 0%; p = 0.024). CONCLUSION: The introduction of an interdisciplinary protocol for the management of elderly patients with a femoral neck fracture was associated with reduced time to surgery, length of stay, complications, and one-year mortality. Such interventions are critical in improving outcomes and reducing costs for an ageing population. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2021;103-B(7 Supple B):3-8.
