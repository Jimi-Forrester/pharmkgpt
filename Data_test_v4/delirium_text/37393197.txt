37393197|a|Major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) CNS cellular localization and function is still being determined after previously being thought to be absent from the brain. MHC-I expression has been reported to increase with brain aging in mouse, rat, and human whole tissue analyses, but the cellular localization was undetermined. Neuronal MHC-I is proposed to regulate developmental synapse elimination and tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we report that across newly generated and publicly available ribosomal profiling, cell sorting, and single-cell data, microglia are the primary source of classical and non-classical MHC-I in mice and humans. Translating ribosome affinity purification-qPCR analysis of 3-6- and 18-22-month-old (m.o.) mice revealed significant age-related microglial induction of MHC-I pathway genes B2m, H2-D1, H2-K1, H2-M3, H2-Q6, and Tap1 but not in astrocytes and neurons. Across a timecourse (12-23 m.o.), microglial MHC-I gradually increased until 21 m.o. and then accelerated. MHC-I protein was enriched in microglia and increased with aging. Microglial expression, and absence in astrocytes and neurons, of MHC-I-binding leukocyte immunoglobulin-like (Lilrs) and paired immunoglobin-like type 2 (Pilrs) receptor families could enable cell -autonomous MHC-I signaling and increased with aging in mice and humans. Increased microglial MHC-I, Lilrs, and Pilrs were observed in multiple AD mouse models and human AD data across methods and studies. MHC-I expression correlated with p16INK4A, suggesting an association with cellular senescence. Conserved induction of MHC-I, Lilrs, and Pilrs with aging and AD opens the possibility of cell-autonomous MHC-I signaling to regulate microglial reactivation with aging and neurodegeneration.
