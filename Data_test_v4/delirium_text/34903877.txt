34903877|t|B cells in central nervous system disease: diversity, locations and pathophysiology.
34903877|a|B cells represent a relatively minor cell population within both the healthy and diseased central nervous system (CNS), yet they can have profound effects. This is emphasized in multiple sclerosis, in which B cell-depleting therapies are arguably the most efficacious treatment for the condition. In this Review, we discuss how B cells enter and persist in the CNS and how, in many neurological conditions, B cells concentrate within CNS barriers but are rarely found in the parenchyma. We highlight how B cells can contribute to CNS pathology through antibody secretion, antigen presentation and secretion of neurotoxic molecules, using examples from CNS tumours, CNS infections and autoimmune conditions such as neuromyelitis optica and, in particular, multiple sclerosis. Overall, understanding common and divergent principles of B cell accumulation and their effects within the CNS could offer new insights into treating these devastating neurological conditions.
