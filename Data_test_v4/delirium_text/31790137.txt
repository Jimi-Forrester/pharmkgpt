31790137|a|BACKGROUND: traumatic injuries are increasingly affecting older patients who are prone to more complications and poorer recovery compared to younger patients. Practices of trauma health care providers therefore need to be adapted to meet the needs of geriatric trauma patients. OBJECTIVE: to assess the implementation of the American College of Surgeons best practice guidelines on geriatric trauma management across level I to III Canadian trauma centres. METHODS: 69 decision-makers working in Canadian trauma centres were approached to complete a web-based practice survey. Percentages and means were calculated to describe the level of best practice guideline implementation. RESULTS: 50 decision-makers completed the survey for a response rate of 72%. Specialised geriatric trauma resources were utilised in 37% of centres. Implementation of mechanisms to evaluate common geriatric issues (e.g. frailty, malnutrition and delirium) varied from 28 to 78% and protocols for the optimisation of geriatric care (e.g. Beers criteria to adjust medication, anticoagulant reversal and early mobilisation) from 8 to 56%. Guideline recommendations were more often implemented in level I and level II trauma centres. The adjustment of trauma team activation criteria to the geriatric population and transition of care protocols were more frequently used by level III centres. CONCLUSION: despite the growing number of older patients admitted in Canadian trauma centres annually, the implementation of best practice guidelines on geriatric trauma management is still limited. Prospective multicentre studies are required to develop and evaluate interdisciplinary knowledge translation initiatives that will promote the uptake of guidelines by trauma centres.
