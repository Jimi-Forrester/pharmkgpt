36081891|t|Neural basis of visuospatial tests in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia.
36081891|a|Background: Recent models of visuospatial functioning suggest the existence of three main circuits emerging from the dorsal ("where") route: parieto-prefrontal pathway, parieto-premotor, and parieto-medial temporal. Neural underpinnings of visuospatial task performance and the sparing of visuospatial functioning in bvFTD are unclear. We hypothesized different neural and cognitive mechanisms in visuospatial tasks performance in bvFTD and AD. Methods: Two hundred and sixteen participants were enrolled for this study: 72 patients with bvFTD dementia and 144 patients with AD. Visual Object and Space Perception Battery Position Discrimination and Number Location (VOSP-PD and VOSP-NL) and Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) were administered to examine visuospatial functioning, together with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. FDG-PET was acquired to evaluate brain metabolism. Voxel-based brain mapping analyses were conducted to evaluate the brain regions associated with visuospatial function in bvFTD and AD. Results: Patients with AD performed worst in visuospatial tasks in mild dementia, but not at prodromal stage. Attention and executive functioning tests showed higher correlations in bvFTD than AD with ROCF, but not VOSP subtests. Visuospatial performance in patients with bvFTD was associated with bilateral frontal regions, including the superior and medial frontal gyri, supplementary motor area, insula and middle cingulate gyrus. Conclusion: These findings support the role of prefrontal and premotor regions in visuospatial processing through the connection with the posterior parietal cortex and other posterior cortical regions. Visuospatial deficits should be interpreted with caution in patients with bvFTD, and should not be regarded as hallmarks of posterior cortical dysfunction.
