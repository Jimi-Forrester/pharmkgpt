37508508|t|S1P Lyase Deficiency in the Brain Promotes Astrogliosis and NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation via Purinergic Signaling.
37508508|a|Astrocytes are critical players in brain health and disease. Brain pathologies and lesions are usually accompanied by astroglial alterations known as reactive astrogliosis. Sphingosine 1-phosphate lyase (SGPL1) catalysis, the final step in sphingolipid catabolism, irreversibly cleaves its substrate sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). We have shown that neural ablation of SGPL1 causes accumulation of S1P and hence neuronal damage, cognitive deficits, as well as microglial activation. Moreover, the S1P/S1P-receptor signaling axis enhances ATP production in SGPL1-deficient astrocytes. Using immunohistochemical methods as well as RNA Seq and CUT&Tag we show how S1P signaling causes activation of the astrocytic purinoreceptor P2Y1 (P2Y1R). With specific pharmacological agonists and antagonists, we uncover the P2Y1R as the key player in S1P-induced astrogliosis, and DDX3X mediated the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, including caspase-1 and henceforward generation of interleukin-1ss (IL-1ss) and of other proinflammatory cytokines. Our results provide a novel route connecting S1P metabolism and signaling with astrogliosis and the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a central player in neuroinflammation, known to be crucial for the pathogenesis of numerous brain illnesses. Thus, our study opens the door for new therapeutic strategies surrounding S1P metabolism and signaling in the brain.
