33524056|a|Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) infection is a major cause of airway inflammation in immunocompromised and cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) and tyrosine kinases are integral to inflammatory responses and are therefore potential targets for novel anti-inflammatory therapies. We have determined the involvement of specific kinases in Pa-induced inflammation. The effects of kinase inhibitors against p38MAPK, MEK 1/2, JNK 1/2, Syk or c-Src, a combination of a p38MAPK with Syk inhibitor, or a novel narrow spectrum kinase inhibitor (NSKI), were evaluated against the release of the proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine, IL-6 and CXCL8 from BEAS-2B and CFBE41o- epithelial cells by Pa. Effects of a Syk inhibitor against phosphorylation of the MAPKs were also evaluated. IL-6 and CXCL8 release by Pa were significantly inhibited by p38MAPK and Syk inhibitors (p<0.05). Phosphorylation of HSP27, but not ERK or JNK, was significantly inhibited by Syk kinase inhibition. A combination of p38MAPK and Syk inhibitors showed synergy against IL-6 and CXCL8 induction and an NSKI completely inhibited IL-6 and CXCL8 at low concentrations. Pa-induced inflammation is dependent on p38MAPK primarily, and Syk partially, which is upstream of p38MAPK. The NSKI suggests that inhibiting specific combinations of kinases is a potent potential therapy for Pa-induced inflammation.
