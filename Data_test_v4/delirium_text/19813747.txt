19813747|t|Toward a rational design of multitarget-directed antioxidants: merging memoquin and lipoic acid molecular frameworks.
19813747|a|Novel multitargeted antioxidants 3-6 were designed by combining the antioxidant features, namely, a benzoquinone fragment and a lipoyl function, of two multifunctional lead candidates. They were then evaluated to determine their profile against Alzheimer's disease. They showed antioxidant activity, improved following enzymatic reduction, in mitochondria and T67 cell line. They also displayed a balanced inhibitory profile against amyloid-beta aggregation and acetylcholinesterase, emerging as promising molecules for neuroprotectant lead discovery.
