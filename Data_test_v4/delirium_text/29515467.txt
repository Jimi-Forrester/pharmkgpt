29515467|t|Early Intervention and a Direction of Novel Therapeutics for the Improvement of Functional Outcomes in Schizophrenia: A Selective Review.
29515467|a|BACKGROUND: A recent review reported that the median proportion of patients recovering from schizophrenia was 13.5% and that this did not change over time. Various factors including the duration of untreated psychosis, cognitive impairment, negative symptoms, and morphological changes in the brain influence the functional outcome of schizophrenia. The authors herein reviewed morphological changes in the brain of schizophrenia patients, effects of early intervention, and a direction of developing novel therapeutics to achieve significant improvement of the functional outcome. METHODS: A selective review of the literature including studies from our department was performed. RESULTS: Longitudinal structural neuroimaging studies on schizophrenia revealed that volume reductions in the peri-Sylvian regions (e.g., superior temporal gyrus and insula), which are related to positive psychotic symptoms, progress around the onset (critical stage) of schizophrenia, but become stable in the chronic stage. On the other hand, morphological changes in the fronto-thalamic regions and lateral ventricle, which are related to negative symptoms, neurocognitive dysfunction, and the functional outcome, progress during both the critical and chronic stages. These changes in the peri-Sylvian and fronto-thalamic regions may provide a pathophysiological basis for Crow's two-syndrome classification. Accumulated evidence from early intervention trials suggests that the transition risk from an at-risk mental state (ARMS) to psychosis is approximately 30%. Differences in the cognitive performance, event-related potentials (e.g., mismatch negativity), and brain morphology have been reported between ARMS subjects who later developed psychosis and those who did not. Whether early intervention for ARMS significantly improves the long-term recovery rate of schizophrenia patients remains unknown. With respect to the development of novel therapeutics, animal models of schizophrenia based on the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor hypofunction hypothesis successfully mimicked behavioral changes associated with cognitive impairments characteristic of the disease. Furthermore, these animal models elicited histological changes in the brain similar to those observed in schizophrenia patients, i.e., decreased numbers of parvalbumin-positive interneurons and dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in the frontal cortex. Some antioxidant compounds were found to ameliorate these behavioral and histological abnormalities. CONCLUSION: Early intervention coupled with novel therapeutics may offer a promising approach for substantial improvement of the functional outcome of schizophrenia patients.
