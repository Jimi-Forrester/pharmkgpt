27258414|t|Non-Fibrillar Oligomeric Amyloid-beta within Synapses.
27258414|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by memory loss, insidious cognitive decline, profound neurodegeneration, and the extracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in senile plaques and intracellular accumulation of tau in neurofibrillary tangles. Loss and dysfunction of synapses are believed to underlie the devastating cognitive decline in AD. A large amount of evidence suggests that oligomeric forms of Abeta associated with senile plaques are toxic to synapses, but the precise sub-synaptic localization of Abeta and which forms are synaptotoxic remain unknown. Here, we characterize the sub-synaptic localization of Abeta oligomers using three high-resolution imaging techniques, stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, immunogold electron microscopy, and Forster resonance energy transfer in a plaque-bearing mouse model of AD. With all three techniques, we observe oligomeric Abeta inside synaptic terminals. Further, we tested a panel of Abeta antibodies using the relatively high-throughput array tomography technique to determine which forms are present in synapses. Our results show that different oligomeric Abeta species are present in synapses and highlight the potential of array tomography for rapid testing of aggregation state specific Abeta antibodies in brain tissue.
