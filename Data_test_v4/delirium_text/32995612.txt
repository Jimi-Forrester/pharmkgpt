32995612|a|Leishmaniasis is the most widespread pathogenic disease in several countries. Currently, no effective vaccines are available, and the control of Leishmaniasis primarily relies on decade-old chemotherapy. The treatment for the Leishmaniasis is not up to the mark. Current therapy for Leishmaniasis is ancient and requires hospitalization for the administration. These medications are also highly toxic and resistant. beta-carboline, a natural indole containing alkaloid, holds a vital position in the field of medicinal chemistry with a diversified pharmacological action. The current review focuses mainly on the anti-leishmanial effects of beta-carboline analogs and their synthetic strategies, structural activity relationship studies (SAR). The past ten years alterations unveiled by beta-carboline analogs present in phytoconstituents and various derivatives of synthesized analogs with the mechanism of action were briefly shortlisted and illustrated.
