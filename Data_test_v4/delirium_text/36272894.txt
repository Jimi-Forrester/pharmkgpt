36272894|a|BACKGROUND: Hospitalized lung transplant (LT) recipients (LTRs) have higher post-LT morbidity and mortality than those who are well enough to wait for transplant at home. Outcomes after LT for COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (CARDS) may be even worse; thus, we compared post-LT outcomes between hospitalized LTRs transplanted for CARDS and those transplanted for restrictive lung disease (RLD). METHODS: Between 2014 and 2021, hospitalized LTRs >=18 years old with CARDS or RLD were included. Primary and secondary outcomes were 1-year post-LT survival and postoperative morbidity. For each patient in the CARDS group, an analysis of 1-to-1 matched patients from the RLD group was performed using logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: Of 764 LTRs, 163 (21.3%) were hospitalized at the time of LT; 132 met the inclusion criteria: 11 (8.3%) were transplanted for CARDS and 121 (91.7%) for RLD. LTRs with CARDS were younger with longer pre-LT hospitalization stays and higher rates of pretransplant mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and ECMO as a bridge to transplant. A propensity-matched analysis demonstrated comparable rates of intrathoracic adhesions, posttransplant duration of mechanical ventilation, PGD3 at 72 hours, and delayed chest closure. Compared to LTRs with RLD, those with CARDS had significantly longer posttransplant hospital stays and a higher prevalence of ACR >=A2 and DSA >2000 MFI, but comparable 1-year survival rates. CONCLUSION: Even with careful selection, LT for patients with CARDS was associated with significant morbidity; however, 1-year survival of recipients with CARDS was comparable to that of matched hospitalized recipients with RLD.
