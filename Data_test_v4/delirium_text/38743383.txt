38743383|t|Nucleic acid aptamer-based electrochemical sensor for the detection of serum P-tau231 and the instant screening test of Alzheimer's disease.
38743383|a|The instant screening of patients with a tendency towards developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) is significant for providing preventive measures and treatment. However, the current imaging-based technology cannot meet the requirements in the early stage. Developing biosensor-based liquid biopsy technology could be overcoming this bottleneck problem. Herein, we developed a simple, low-cost, and sensitive electrochemical aptamer biosensor for detecting phosphorylated tau protein threonine 231 (P-tau231), the earliest and one of the most efficacious abnormally elevated biomarkers of AD. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were electrochemically synthesized on a glassy carbon electrode as the transducer, exhibiting excellent conductivity, and were applied to amplify the electrochemical signal. A nucleic acid aptamer was designed as the receptor to capture the P-tau231 protein, specifically through the formation of an aptamer-antigen complex. The proposed biosensor showed excellent sensitivity in detecting P-tau 231, with a broad linear detection range from 10 to 107 pg/mL and a limit of detection (LOD) of 2.31 pg/mL. The recoveries of the biosensor in human serum ranged from 97.59 to 103.26%, demonstrating that the biosensor could be used in complex practical samples. In addition, the results showed that the developed biosensor has good repeatability, reproducibility, and stability, which provides a novel method for the early screening of AD.
