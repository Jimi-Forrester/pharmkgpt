38439069|t|AcumenTM hypotension prediction index guidance for prevention and treatment of hypotension in noncardiac surgery: a prospective, single-arm, multicenter trial.
38439069|a|BACKGROUND: Intraoperative hypotension is common during noncardiac surgery and is associated with postoperative myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, stroke, and severe infection. The Hypotension Prediction Index software is an algorithm based on arterial waveform analysis that alerts clinicians of the patient's likelihood of experiencing a future hypotensive event, defined as mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg for at least 1 min. METHODS: Two analyses included (1) a prospective, single-arm trial, with continuous blood pressure measurements from study monitors, compared to a historical comparison cohort. (2) A post hoc analysis of a subset of trial participants versus a propensity score-weighted contemporaneous comparison group, using external data from the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG). The trial included 485 subjects in 11 sites; 406 were in the final effectiveness analysis. The post hoc analysis included 457 trial participants and 15,796 comparison patients. Patients were eligible if aged 18 years or older, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 3 or 4, and scheduled for moderate- to high-risk noncardiac surgery expected to last at least 3 h. MEASUREMENTS: minutes of mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 65 mmHg and area under MAP < 65 mmHg. RESULTS: Analysis 1: Trial subjects (n = 406) experienced a mean of 9 +- 13 min of MAP below 65 mmHg, compared with the MPOG historical control mean of 25 +- 41 min, a 65% reduction (p < 0.001). Subjects with at least one episode of hypotension (n = 293) had a mean of 12 +- 14 min of MAP below 65 mmHg compared with the MPOG historical control mean of 28 +- 43 min, a 58% reduction (p< 0.001). Analysis 2: In the post hoc inverse probability treatment weighting model, patients in the trial demonstrated a 35% reduction in minutes of hypotension compared to a contemporaneous comparison group [exponentiated coefficient: - 0.35 (95%CI - 0.43, - 0.27); p < 0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: The use of prediction software for blood pressure management was associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in the duration of intraoperative hypotension. Further studies must investigate whether predictive algorithms to prevent hypotension can reduce adverse outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trial number: NCT03805217.
