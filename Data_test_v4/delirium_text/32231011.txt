32231011|t|Contribution of Neurotrophins to the Immune System Regulation and Possible Connection to Alcohol Addiction.
32231011|a|The first references to neurotrophic factors date back to the middle of the 20th century when the nerve growth factor (NGF) was first discovered. Later studies delivered a large amount of data on neurotrophic factors. However, many questions regarding neurotrophin signaling still remain unanswered. One of the principal topics in neurotrophin research is their role in the immune system regulation. Another important research question is the possible involvement of neurotrophin signaling in the pathological processes associated with alcoholism. Among known neurotrophins, NT-4 remains the least studied and appears to be involved in alcoholism and chronic stress pathogenesis. In this review we discuss known neurotrophin signaling cascades mediated by different neurotrophin receptors, as well as provide a generalization of the data regarding the influence of neurotrophins NGF, BDNF, and NT-4 on the immune system and their potential contribution to the pathogenesis of alcoholism.
