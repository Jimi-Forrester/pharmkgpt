17982896|a|The development of therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has focused on drugs designed to correct the loss of cholinergic function within the central nervous system. Quantitative EEG (qEEG) changes associated with AD consist of background slowing. One way to study the effects of cholinergic drugs may be through assessment of their qEEG effects. The aim of the current work was to evaluate the effect of long-term treatment with tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA) on qEEG in AD patients.
