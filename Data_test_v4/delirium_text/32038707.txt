32038707|t|Integrating Multi-Omics Data to Identify Novel Disease Genes and Single-Neucleotide Polymorphisms.
32038707|a|Stroke ranks the second leading cause of death among people over the age of 60 in the world. Stroke is widely regarded as a complex disease that is affected by genetic and environmental factors. Evidence from twin and family studies suggests that genetic factors may play an important role in its pathogenesis. Therefore, research on the genetic association of susceptibility genes can help understand the mechanism of stroke. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has found a large number of stroke-related loci, but their mechanism is unknown. In order to explore the function of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the molecular level, in this paper, we integrated 8 GWAS datasets with brain expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) dataset to identify SNPs and genes which are related to four types of stroke (ischemic stroke, large artery stroke, cardioembolic stroke, small vessel stroke). Thirty-eight SNPs which can affect 14 genes expression are found to be associated with stroke. Among these 14 genes, 10 genes expression are associated with ischemic stroke, one gene for large artery stroke, six genes for cardioembolic stroke and eight genes for small vessel stroke. To explore the effects of environmental factors on stroke, we identified methylation susceptibility loci associated with stroke using methylation quantitative trait loci (MQTL). Thirty-one of these 38 SNPs are at greater risk of methylation and can significantly change gene expression level. Overall, the genetic pathogenesis of stroke is explored from locus to gene, gene to gene expression and gene expression to phenotype.
