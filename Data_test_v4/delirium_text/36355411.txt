36355411|t|Older patients with COVID-19 and neuropsychiatric conditions: A study of risk factors for mortality.
36355411|a|BACKGROUND: Little is known about risk factors for mortality in older patients with COVID-19 and neuropsychiatric conditions. METHODS: We conducted a multicentric retrospective observational study at Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris. We selected inpatients aged 70 years or older, with COVID-19 and preexisting neuropsychiatric comorbidities and/or new neuropsychiatric manifestations. We examined demographics, comorbidities, functional status, and presentation including neuropsychiatric symptoms and disorders, as well as paraclinical data. Cox survival analysis was conducted to determine risk factors for mortality at 40 days after the first symptoms of COVID-19. RESULTS: Out of 191 patients included (median age 80 [interquartile range 74-87]), 135 (71%) had neuropsychiatric comorbidities including cognitive impairment (39%), cerebrovascular disease (22%), Parkinsonism (6%), and brain tumors (6%). A total of 152 (79%) patients presented new-onset neuropsychiatric manifestations including sensory symptoms (6%), motor deficit (11%), behavioral (18%) and cognitive (23%) disturbances, gait impairment (11%), and impaired consciousness (18%). The mortality rate at 40 days was 19.4%. A history of brain tumor or Parkinsonism or the occurrence of impaired consciousness were neurological factors associated with a higher risk of mortality. A lower Activities of Daily Living score (hazard ratio [HR] 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-0.82), a neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio >= 9.9 (HR 5.69, 95% CI 2.69-12.0), and thrombocytopenia (HR 5.70, 95% CI 2.75-11.8) independently increased the risk of mortality (all p < .001). CONCLUSION: Understanding mortality risk factors in older inpatients with COVID-19 and neuropsychiatric conditions may be helpful to neurologists and geriatricians who manage these patients in clinical practice.
