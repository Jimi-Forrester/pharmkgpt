37542601|a|BACKGROUND: This study analyzes the effect of frailty and Post-Operative Delirium (POD) on the functional status at hospital discharge and at 4-month follow-up in patients with hip fracture (HF). METHODS: Multicenter prospective observational study of older patients with HF admitted to 12 Italian Orthogeriatric centers (July 2019-August 2022). POD was assessed using the 4AT. A 26-item Frailty Index (FI) was created using data collected on admission. The outcome measures were Cumulated Ambulation Score (CAS) <= 2 at discharge and a telephone-administered CAS <= 2 after 4 months. Poisson regression models were used to assess the effect of frailty and POD on outcomes. RESULTS: 984 patients (median age 84 years, IQR = 79-89) were recruited: 480 (48.7%) were frail at admission, 311 (31.6%) developed POD, and 158 (15.6%) had both frailty and POD. In a robust Poisson regression, frailty alone (Relative Risk, RR = 1.56, 95% Confidence Intervals, CI 1.19-2.04, p = 0.001) and its combination with POD (RR = 2.57, 95% CI 2.02-3.26, p < 0.001) were associated with poor functional status at discharge. At 4-month follow-up, the combination of frailty with POD (RR 3.65, 95% CI 1.85-7.2, p < 0.001) increased the risk of poor outcome more than frailty alone (RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.21-4.66, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: POD development exacerbates the negative effect that frailty exerts on functional outcomes in HF patients.
