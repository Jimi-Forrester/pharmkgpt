34120376|t|Delirium and depression in cardiac surgery: A comprehensive review of risk factors, pathophysiology, and management.
34120376|a|BACKGROUND: Mental health and wellbeing continue to gain more attention as they are inextricably associated with clinical outcomes, particularly quality of life. Many medical ailments and major surgeries affect patients' mental health, including depression and delirium. AIMS: The objective of this manuscript was to comprehensively review and critically examine the literature pertaining to cardiac surgery, depression, and delirium. METHODS: This is a narrative review article. We performed our search analysis by using the following key words: "Cardiac Surgery", "Depression", "Delirium", "Clinical outcomes", and "Mental Health". Search analysis was done on MedLine PubMed, accessing indexed peer-reviewed publications. RESULTS: Cardiac Surgery is a life-altering intervention indicated to improve morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Psychiatric conditions before and after cardiac surgery worsen patient prognosis and increase mortality rate. Specifically, preoperative depression increases postoperative depression and is associated with impaired functional status, slow physical recovery, and an increased readmission rate. DISCUSSION: Although the exact pathophysiology between depression and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is unknown, several pathways have been implicated. Unmanaged depression can also lead to other psychological conditions such as delirium. Like depression, the exact association between delirium and CVD is not well understood, but believed to be multifactorial. CONCLUSION: Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of the links between depression, delirium, and cardiovascular surgery. We critically examine the current data that pertains to the pathophysiology of these debilitating mental health issues in the context of cardiac surgery. Finally, we summarize the various treatment options available for managing depression and delirium in the cardiac surgery patient population.
