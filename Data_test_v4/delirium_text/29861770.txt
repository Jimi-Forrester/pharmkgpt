29861770|t|Research Progress in the Effect of Traditional Chinese Medicine for Invigoration on Neurotransmitter Related Diseases.
29861770|a|Tonic traditional Chinese medicine is widely used in clinical practice and is categorized into four main drugs, namely, Qi-supplementing, Blood-enriching, Yin-nourishing, and Yang-tonifying. Neurotransmitters play a coordinating role in the nervous system, visceral function, and stress response. The excitation or suppression of the central nervous system is closely related to various diseases, such as insomnia, depression, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and perimenopausal syndrome. An increasing amount of evidence shows that Chinese tonic herb and its active ingredients can delay the occurrence and development of these diseases by modulating related neurotransmitters and their receptors, including norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), acetylcholine (ACh), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In the present report, studies on the treatment of these neurotransmitter related diseases in relation to the application of tonic Chinese medicine are reviewed.
