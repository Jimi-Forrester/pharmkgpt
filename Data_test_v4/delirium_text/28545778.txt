28545778|t|Current pharmacological developments in 2,3,4',5-tetrahydroxystilbene 2-O-beta-D-glucoside (TSG).
28545778|a|2,3,4',5-tetrahydroxystilbene 2-O-beta-D-glucoside (TSG), a resveratrol analog with glucoside, is purified from a traditional Chinese herbal medicine polygonum multiflorum. It has been extensively studied in last decade and known to exert strong anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, and free radical scavenging activities, and therefore has been listed as a potential agent for disease therapies. Recent studies extend well-beyond effects of TSG on the injury of neurons, cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells, and report important functions of TSG in a lot of pathophysiological conditions. For example, TSG has been shown to prevent the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in microglia and macrophages in vitro, and ameliorate pro-inflammatory responses in animal models with neurodegeneration, atherosclerosis, and rat paw or ear oedema. TSG can prevent the proliferation of vascular smooth cells, gastrointestinal dysfunctions, platelet aggregation, osteoblastic injury, diabetic nephropathy and melanogenesis. TSG is also indicated to facilitate long-term potentiation and learning and memory in both normal and pathological conditions. These effects to some extent enrich the understanding about the role of TSG in disease prevention and therapy. However, to date, we still have no outlined knowledges about the pharmacological effects of TSG, though the role of TSG in aging and Alzheimer's disease has been reviewed in recent years. Here, we summarize the current pharmacological developments of TSG as well as its possible mechanisms in disease prevention and therapy, aiming to push the understanding about the protective role of TSG as well as its preclinical assessment of novel applications.
