38165298|t|EEG Correlates in the 3 Variants of Primary Progressive Aphasia.
38165298|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The 3 clinical presentations of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) reflect heterogenous neuropathology, which is difficult to be recognized in vivo. Resting-state (RS) EEG is promising for the investigation of brain electrical substrates in neurodegenerative conditions. In this study, we aim to explore EEG cortical sources in the characterization of the 3 variants of PPA. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, single-center, memory center-based cohort study. Patients with PPA and healthy controls were consecutively recruited at the Neurology Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute (Milan, Italy). Each participant underwent an RS 19-channel EEG. Using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography, EEG current source densities were estimated at voxel level and compared among study groups. Using an RS functional MRI-driven model of source reconstruction, linear lagged connectivity (LLC) values within language and extra-language brain networks were obtained and analyzed among groups. RESULTS: Eighteen patients with logopenic PPA variant (lvPPA; mean age = 72.7 +- 6.6; % female = 52.4), 21 patients with nonfluent/agrammatic PPA variant (nfvPPA; mean age = 71.7 +- 8.1; % female = 66.6), and 9 patients with semantic PPA variant (svPPA; mean age = 65.0 +- 6.9; % female = 44.4) were enrolled in the study, together with 21 matched healthy controls (mean age = 69.2 +- 6.5; % female = 57.1). Patients with lvPPA showed a higher delta density than healthy controls (p < 0.01) and patients with nfvPPA (p < 0.05) and svPPA (p < 0.05). Patients with lvPPA also displayed a greater theta density over the left posterior hemisphere (p < 0.01) and lower alpha2 values (p < 0.05) over the left frontotemporal regions than controls. Patients with nfvPPA showed a diffuse greater theta density than controls (p < 0.05). LLC was altered in all patients relative to controls (p < 0.05); the alteration was greater at slow frequency bands and within language networks than extra-language networks. Patients with lvPPA also showed greater LLC values at theta band than patients with nfvPPA (p < 0.05). DISCUSSION: EEG findings in patients with PPA suggest that lvPPA-related pathology is associated with a characteristic disruption of the cortical electrical activity, which might help in the differential diagnosis from svPPA and nfvPPA. EEG connectivity was disrupted in all PPA variants, with distinct findings in disease-specific PPA groups. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that EEG analysis can distinguish PPA due to probable Alzheimer disease from PPA due to probable FTD from normal aging.
