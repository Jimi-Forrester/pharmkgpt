33653770|a|BACKGROUND: Information on the epidemiology of patients in hospital with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Canadian acute care hospitals is needed to inform infection prevention and control strategies and public health measures. The aim of this surveillance was to describe the epidemiology of patients in hospital with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in a network of Canadian acute care hospitals between Mar. 1 and Aug. 31, 2020. METHODS: Through prospective surveillance, we identified adult and pediatric patients in hospital with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 using a standard definition between Mar. 1 and Aug. 31, 2020, through the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program (CNISP), a network of 78 hospitals. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics and data on treatment, interventions and outcomes were reviewed and described. RESULTS: As of Aug. 31, 2020, the CNISP had received data for 1906 patients in hospital with COVID-19 in 49 sentinel hospitals in 9 provinces. The majority of patients in hospital with COVID-19 were older (median age 71 yr) and had underlying medical conditions (85.8%). Few children with COVID-19 were admitted to a participating hospital (n = 37, 1.9%). Acquisition of COVID-19 in hospitals was infrequent (6.4% of all cases). A total of 32.8% of patients were admitted from a long-term care facility or retirement home. Health care workers constituted 10.6% of adult patients aged 18-65 years in hospital with COVID-19. Thirty-day attributable mortality was 16.2%. Hospital admission rates peaked in mid-April and were highest in Ontario and Quebec. INTERPRETATION: Surveillance findings indicate that a high proportion of Canadian patients in hospital with COVID-19 during the first 6 months of the pandemic were older adults with underlying medical conditions. Active surveillance of patients in hospital with COVID-19 is critical to enhancing our knowledge of the epidemiology of COVID-19 and to identifying populations at risk for severe outcomes, which will help guide Canada's response in the coming months.
