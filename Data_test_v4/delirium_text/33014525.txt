33014525|a|Aging is a major risk factor for the development of osteoarthritis (OA). One hallmark of aging is loss of proteostasis resulting in increased cellular stress and cell death. However, its effect on the development of OA is not clear. Here, using knee articular cartilage tissue from young and old cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), we demonstrate that with aging there is loss of molecular chaperone expression resulting in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cell death. Chondrocytes from aged articular cartilage showed decreased expression of molecular chaperones, including protein disulfide isomerase, calnexin, and Ero1-like protein alpha, and increased immunohistochemical staining for ER stress markers (phosphorylated IRE1 alpha, spliced X-box binding protein-1, activating transcription factor 4 and C/EBP homologous protein), and apoptotic markers [cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase], suggesting that decreased expression of molecular chaperone during aging induces ER stress and chondrocyte apoptosis in monkey articular cartilage. Apoptosis induced by aging-associated ER stress was further confirmed by TUNEL staining. Aged monkey cartilage also showed increased expression of nuclear protein 1 (Nupr1) and tribbles related protein-3 (TRB3), known regulators of apoptosis and cell survival pathways. Treatment of cultured monkey chondrocytes with a small molecule chemical chaperone, 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA, a general ER stress inhibitor) or PERK Inhibitor I (an ER stress inhibitor specifically targeting the PERK branch of the unfolded protein response pathway), decreased the expression of ER stress and apoptotic markers and reduced the expression of Nupr1 and TRB3. Consistent with the above finding, knockdown of calnexin expression induces ER stress and apoptotic markers in normal human chondrocytes in vitro. Taken together, our study clearly demonstrates that aging promotes loss of proteostasis and induces ER stress and chondrocyte apoptosis in articular cartilage. Thus, restoring proteostasis using chemical/molecular chaperone or ER stress inhibitor could be a therapeutic option to treat aged-linked OA.
