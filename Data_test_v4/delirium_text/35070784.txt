35070784|a|BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a great impact on individuals from all over the world, particularly on individuals with mental disorders. Several studies found more pronounced psychiatric symptoms, notably symptoms of depression and anxiety. AIM: To assess the situation of patients with serious mental illness (SMI: Affective disorders and schizophrenia) regarding their mental health outcome during the pandemic. METHODS: A systematic search using the databases PubMed and MEDLINE was conducted, employing the key words "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2", "psychiatric/mental disorder/illness", "affective/mood disorder", "bipolar disorder", "(major) depression", "schizoaffective disorder", and "schizophrenia". Studies that had been published up until January 9, 2021 were included. Information of studies in languages other than English and German was mostly taken from their English abstracts. RESULTS: The literature search concluded in the finding of 36 studies containing relevant clinical data. A general impairment of the mental health of individuals with SMI could be detected, particularly in individuals with affective disorders, as compared to those with schizophrenia. Compared to healthy controls, symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress were more pronounced in individuals with SMI. Relevant factors found that impacted their mental health were age, resilience, and socioeconomic environment, especially the shortage of mental health services, lack of social support, and inadequate information about COVID-19. CONCLUSION: In light of these results, mental health services should be reinforced, notably the use of telemental health services. Furthermore, supplying individuals with SMI with adequate information about the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing their resilience is important. When researching the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with SMI, standardization as well as follow-up studies are needed to enable better comparability and understanding.
