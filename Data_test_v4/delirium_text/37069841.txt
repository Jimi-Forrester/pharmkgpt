37069841|a|Nitrofurantoin and cephalexin are commonly used antibiotics for treating urinary tract infections. Hyponatremia secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) has been reported as a rare side effect of nitrofurantoin but has never been a reported side effect of cephalexin. We report a case of a 48-year-old female who developed severe hyponatremia complicated by generalized tonic-clonic seizures after a course of antibiotics (nitrofurantoin followed by cephalexin) used for treating a urinary tract infection. She presented to the emergency department with a one-week history of dizziness, nausea, fatigue, and listlessness. She also had a two-week history of persistent urinary frequency despite completing a course of nitrofurantoin followed by a course of cephalexin. While in the emergency department waiting room, she had two episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Immediate post-ictal blood test results revealed severe hyponatremia and lactic acidosis. Results were consistent with severe SIADH and she was subsequently managed with hypertonic saline and fluid restriction. She was discharged after 48 hours of admission when her serum sodium levels normalized. Though we believe that nitrofurantoin was the culprit drug, we still asked the patient to avoid future use of both nitrofurantoin and cephalexin. Healthcare providers need to be aware of antibiotic-induced SIADH when assessing patients with hyponatremia.
