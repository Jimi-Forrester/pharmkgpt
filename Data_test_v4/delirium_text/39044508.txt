39044508|t|Safety, Efficacy and Clinical Applications of Focused Ultrasound-Mediated Blood Brain Barrier Opening in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.
39044508|a|Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by cognitive decline and brain pathology involving amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Current drug development focuses on disease-modifying therapies, primarily antibodies targeting amyloid or tau. However, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses a challenge for drug delivery to the brain. Pre- and early clinical data suggests that Focused Ultrasound (FUS) technology safely enhances BBB permeability without damaging brain tissue, enabling drug delivery. This systematic review discusses the application of FUS to open the BBB for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We review the safety, efficacy, and potential biological effects of FUS-mediated BBB opening in AD patients.
