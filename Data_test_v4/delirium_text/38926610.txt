38926610|t|The impact of telomere length on the risk of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study.
38926610|a|Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) affects mainly aged populations. The gradual shortening of telomere length (TL) is one of the hallmarks of aging. Whereas the genetic contribution of TL to the iNPH is incompletely understood. We aimed to investigate the causal relationship between TL and iNPH through the Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. We respectively obtained 186 qualified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TL and 20 eligible SNPs of iNPH for MR analysis. The result of MR analysis showed that genetically predicted longer TL was significantly associated with a reduced odd of iNPH (odds ratio [OR] = 0.634 95% Confidence interval [CI] 0.447-0.899, p = 0.011). The causal association remained consistent in multivariable MR (OR = 0.530 95% CI 0.327-0.860, p = 0.010). However, there was no evidence that the iNPH was causally associated with the TL (OR = 1.000 95% CI 0.996-1.004, p = 0.955). Our study reveals a potential genetic contribution of TL to the etiology of iNPH, that is a genetically predicted increased TL might be associated with a reduced risk of iNPH.
