38022096|t|Acute Psychosis and Mania: An Uncommon Complication of Dengue Fever.
38022096|a|Dengue fever is primarily known as a mosquito-borne viral infection that causes a range of physical symptoms, ranging from myalgia to bleeding tendencies. However, there is growing recognition of its potential to trigger psychiatric manifestations, although such cases remain relatively rare. We report a case of acute dengue fever in a 25-year-old male who developed mania and psychotic symptoms after one week of infection. A comprehensive diagnostic workup, including laboratory tests, including cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and neuroimaging, confirmed the absence of organic causes for his psychiatric symptoms, except for his prior exposure to the dengue virus. The patient was initiated on mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medications, leading to a gradual improvement in his mental health.
