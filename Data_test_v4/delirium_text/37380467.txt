37380467|a|A Japanese subgroup analysis from the Asian phase II study of darinaparsin in patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety outcomes of the Japanese population. In this Asian phase II study, darinaparsin was administered to 65 patients, including 37 Japanese patients. In the Japanese population, the histopathological type of PTCL was PTCL, not otherwise specified in 26 patients (70.3%), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma in 9 patients (24.3%) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) -negative in 2 patients (5.4%), and the median patient age was 70.0 (range: 43-85). 94.6% and 35.1% of the Japanese population had previously received multi-agent and single-agent regimen, respectively. The efficacy and safety were summarized and compared between the overall and Japanese populations. Based on central assessment, the overall response rate was 22.2% (8/36; 90% confidence interval [CI]: 11.6-36.5) in the Japanese population and 19.3% (11/57; 90% CI: 11.2-29.9) in the overall population. There were no essential differences in the safety profile of darinaparsin between the Japanese population and the overall population. The results of this subgroup analysis indicate that the efficacy and safety profiles of the Japanese subpopulation were broadly consistent with that of the overall population, and that darinaparsin is potentially an effective treatment with a manageable safety profile in Japanese patients with relapse or refractory PTCL.
