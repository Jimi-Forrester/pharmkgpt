35982488|a|BACKGROUND: Uncoupled extracellular matrix (ECM) causes cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis (OA) by suppressing the synthesis and activating the degradation of ECM components. Gingko biloba is a natural Chinese herb with a variety of biological functions; however, the extent to which it can protect against OA and the mechanisms involved are unknown. METHODS: In our study, using bioinformatics tools, we were able to identify an important lactone, bilobalide (BB), from Gingko biloba. In vitro experiments were performed to evaluate the potential therapeutic effects of BB on ECM homeostasis. In vivo experiments were conducted to assess the protection of systemic administration of BB on cartilage degeneration. Molecular mechanisms underlying BB-regulated anti-arthritic role were further explored. RESULTS: In interleukin-1beta-incubated human chondrocytes, in vitro treatment with BB increased the expression of cartilage anabolic proteins, while inhibiting the activities of ECM degrading enzymes. In a mice model, systemic administration of BB, in vivo, prevented post-traumatic cartilage erosion and attenuated the formation of abnormal osteophytes in the subchondral bone. Mechanistically, the activation of the adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) signaling pathway was involved in the anti-arthritic effects of BB. In vitro, blocking BB's chondroprotection with the AMPK-specific inhibitor Compound C abrogated it. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that BB extracted from Gingko biloba regulates ECM balance to prevent OA by activating the AMPK-SIRT1 signaling pathway. This study proposed the monomer BB, a traditional Chinese medicine, as a de novo therapeutic insight for OA. Schematic representation of the experimental design. Based on the bioinformatic analysis, bilobalide (BB), a natural herb Gingko biloba-derived ingredient, was identified as a candidate for treating osteoarthritis. In vitro, BB treatment not only facilitates cartilage extracellular matrix synthesis but also inhibits proteolytic enzyme activities. In vivo intraperitoneal injection of BB improves cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone sclerosis. BB, in particular, had anti-arthritic effects by activating the AMPK-SIRT1 signaling pathway.
