30955315|a|Objective: To investigate the association between orexin-2 receptor (OX2R) gene polymorphisms and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: A total of 350 patients with AD diagnosed at the People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2014 to January 2018 were enrolled as the case group, and 350 healthy subjects were selected as the control group, and their general demographic data were collected. The peripheral blood samples were collected for DNA extraction, and the polymorphisms of 6 loci in OX2R gene in the two groups were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene sequencing. The differences in genotype and gene frequency distribution between the two groups were compared. Results: The genotype distribution of OX2R gene rs2653349 and rs2292041 in the case group was significantly different from that in the control group (P<0.05). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that rs2653349(GA+AA) genotype was an independent risk factor for AD(P=0.009). Five haplotypes were found in the haplotype analysis, and there were differences between the case group and the control group: rs2653349+rs2292041 GA type(chi(2)=10.922, P=0.000 1), rs2653349+rs2292041+ rs3122169 GAA type (chi(2)=8.687, P=0.003), ATC type(chi(2)=8.329, P=0.003 9), rs2653349+ rs2292041 AT type(chi(2)=6.504, P=0.010 8), rs2653349+rs2292041+rs3122169 ATA type(chi(2)=17.511, P=0.000 1). Conclusion: The OX2R gene rs2653349 and rs2292041 polymorphisms in the Han population of Henan may be associated with AD, and the A allele may be a susceptible factor for AD.
