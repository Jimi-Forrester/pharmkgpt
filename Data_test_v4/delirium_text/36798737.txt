Methods: Among individuals aged 51-99 years residing in Skane, Sweden, in 2009, we identified those with a doctor-diagnosed OA and no dementia during 1998-2009 (n = 57,733). Treating ID as a time-varying exposure, we followed people from January 1, 2010 or their 60th birthday (whichever occurred last) until hospitalization for ACSCs, death, 100th birthday, relocation outside Skane, or December 31, 2019 (whichever occurred first). Using age as time scale, we applied flexible parametric survival models, adjusted for confounders, to assess the associations between ID and hospitalization for ACSCs. Results: There were 58 and 33 hospitalizations for ACSCs per 1000 person-years among OA people with and without ID, respectively. The association between ID and hospitalization for any ACSCs was age-dependent with higher risk in ages<86 years and lower risks in older ages. Between ages 60 and 100 years, persons with ID had, on average, 5.8 (95% CI 0.9, 10.7), 1.6 (-2.6, 5.9) and 3.1 (2.3, 4.0) fewer hospital-free years for any, chronic and acute ACSCs, respectively, compared with persons without ID. Conclusions: Among persons with OA, while ID was associated with increased risks of hospitalization for ACSCs in younger ages, it was associated with decreased risk in oldest ages. These results suggest the need for improvement in quality of ambulatory care including the continuity of care for people with OA having dementia.
