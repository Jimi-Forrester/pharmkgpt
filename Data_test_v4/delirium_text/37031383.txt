37031383|a|NEW FINDINGS: What is the topic of this review? This review focuses on the physiological role of the cytokine interleukin-1beta in the CNS. What advances does it highlight? Traditionally, interleukin-1beta is known as a key mediator of inflammation and immunity. This review highlights the more recent findings describing how interleukin-1beta signalling is required to maintain homeostasis in the CNS. ABSTRACT: Since its discovery in the early 1940s, the interleukin-1 (IL-1) cytokine family has been associated primarily with acute and chronic inflammation. The family member IL-1beta is produced by different leucocytes, endothelial cells and epithelial cells. This cytokine has been characterized as a key modulator of inflammation and innate immunity because it induces the transcription of several downstream inflammatory genes. More recently, several groups have demonstrated that IL-1beta production is also required to maintain homeostasis in several organ systems. This review focuses on providing an overview of the more recently characterized role of IL-1beta in the physiology of the CNS. So far, IL-1beta signalling has been implicated in neuronal survival, neurite growth, synaptic pruning, synaptic transmission, neuroplasticity and neuroendocrine functions.
