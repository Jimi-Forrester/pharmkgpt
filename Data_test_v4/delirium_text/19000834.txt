19000834|t|Chronophin mediates an ATP-sensing mechanism for cofilin dephosphorylation and neuronal cofilin-actin rod formation.
19000834|a|Actin and its key regulatory component, cofilin, are found together in large rod-shaped assemblies in neurons subjected to energy stress. Such inclusions are also enriched in Alzheimer's disease brain, and appear in transgenic models of neurodegeneration. Neuronal insults, such as energy loss and/or oxidative stress, result in rapid dephosphorylation of the cellular cofilin pool prior to its assembly into rod-shaped inclusions. Although these events implicate a role for phosphatases in cofilin rod formation, a mechanism linking energy stress, phosphocofilin turnover, and subsequent rod assembly has been elusive. We demonstrate the ATP-sensitive interaction of the cofilin phosphatase chronophin (CIN) with the chaperone hsp90 to form a biosensor that mediates cofilin/actin rod formation. Our results suggest a model whereby attenuated interactions between CIN and hsp90 during ATP depletion enhance CIN-dependent cofilin dephosphorylation and consequent rod assembly, thereby providing a mechanism for the formation of pathological actin/cofilin aggregates during neurodegenerative energy flux.
