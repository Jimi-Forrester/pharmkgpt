32999167|a|Yokukansan is a Kampo formula that is commonly used by the elderly because it is expected to improve peripheral symptoms of dementia and delirium. However, side effects from its use are frequently reported in the elderly. In particular, pseudoaldosteronism caused by the licorice contained in yokukansan leads to hypertension, hypokalemia, and muscle weakness, which may result in death. This study aimed to identify the risk factors of pseudoaldosteronism with yokukansan use. Using cases reported in the Japanese Adverse Drug Report (JADER) database, the reporting odds ratio (ROR) was calculated and compared to assess the risk of pseudoaldosteronism for each licorice-containing Kampo formula. We also analyzed the risk factors for pseudoaldosteronism in patients taking yokukansan. Yokukansan (ROR 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9-2.8; p < 0.001) had a higher risk of pseudoaldosteronism than that of other licorice-containing Kampo formulas. Furthermore, the results of a logistic regression analysis in patients taking yokukansan showed that the licorice dose (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-2.0; p < 0.01), older age (<70 years, OR 5.9, 95% CI 1.8-20; p < 0.01), dementia (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.6-4.9; p < 0.001), low body weight (<50 kg, OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-3.5; p = 0.034) were risk factors for pseudoaldosteronism, Although not significant, treatment with loop diuretics (OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.98-3.5; p = 0.059) tended to increase the risk of pseudoaldosteronism. In summary, patients must understand the risk factors when considering taking yokukansan and reduce the licorice dose they consume.
