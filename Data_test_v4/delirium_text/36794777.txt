36794777|t|The Relationship Between Periodontal Disease and Breast Cancer: From Basic Mechanism to Clinical Management and Prevention.
36794777|a|PURPOSE: Periodontal disease is potentially related to certain kinds of cancer. This review aimed to summarize the relationship between periodontal disease and breast cancer, providing some strategies for the clinical treatment and periodontal health care of breast cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, prospective and retrospective clinical studies, case series and reports were collected using search terms entered into the PubMed, Google Scholar and JSTOR databases. RESULTS: Research has provided some evidence that periodontal disease is related to the occurrence and development of breast cancer. Periodontal disease and breast cancer have some common pathogenic factors. Periodontal disease may affect the initiation and development of breast cancer involving microorganisms and inflammation. Periodontal health is affected by radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy for breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Periodontal therapy for breast cancer patients should be performed differently according to the stage of cancer treatment. Adjuvant endocrine treatment (e.g. bisphosphonates) has a great impact on oral treatment. Periodontal therapy contributes to the primary prevention of breast cancer. Periodontal health care of breast cancer patients is worthy of clinician attention.
