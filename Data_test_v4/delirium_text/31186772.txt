31186772|a|Effect of continuous use of dexmedetomidine during general anesthesia on perioperative levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in patients undergoing radical resection of ovarian cancer was investigated. The initial treatment of ovarian cancer is mainly radical surgery. Most patients with ovarian cancer radical surgery can achieve good results, but the use of improper anesthetic drugs in radical surgery can easily lead to unstable patient vital signs. Therefore, the selection of appropriate anesthetic drugs has become the key to radical ovarian cancer surgery. There are few reports on the use of dexmedetomidine in anesthesia for ovarian cancer radical surgery. This study was performed to retrospectively analyze the case data of patients undergoing laparoscopic ovarian cancer radical surgery, and to compare the hemodynamics of dexmedetomidine anesthesia with midazolam anesthesia and the concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-6, to provide reference for clinical implementation of ovarian cancer radical surgery. The hemodynamics of patients in the dexmedetomidine group were stable compared with the midazolam group. Serum TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels were significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group than that in the midazolam group. If dexmedetomidine were continuously used during general anesthesia, the perioperative serum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 could be effectively reduced in patients undergoing radical resection of ovarian cancer, and the perioperative stress response was suppressed.
