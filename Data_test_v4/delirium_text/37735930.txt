37735930|a|Alzheimer's causes cognitive dysfunction. This study investigated the neuro-promoting effects of cordycepin on amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) synthesis in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Cordycepin was found to boost SH-SY5Y cell proliferation and decreased AD pathology. APP, PS1, and PS2 were downregulated whereas ADAM10 and SIRT1 were upregulated by cordycepin. Cordycepin also reduced APP secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Cordycepin alleviated oxidative stress by the upregulation of GPX and SOD, as well as autophagy genes (LC3, ATG5, and ATG12). Cordycepin activity was also found to be SIRT1-dependent. Therefore, cordycepin may relieve the neuronal degeneration caused by APP overproduction, and oxidative stress.
