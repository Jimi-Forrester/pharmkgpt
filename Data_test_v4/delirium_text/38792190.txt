38792190|t|Discovery and Synthesis of Hydroxy-l-Proline Blockers of the Neutral Amino Acid Transporters SLC1A4 (ASCT1) and SLC1A5 (ASCT2).
38792190|a|As a conformationally restricted amino acid, hydroxy-l-proline is a versatile scaffold for the synthesis of diverse multi-functionalized pyrrolidines for probing the ligand binding sites of biological targets. With the goal to develop new inhibitors of the widely expressed amino acid transporters SLC1A4 and SLC1A5 (also known as ASCT1 and ASCT2), we synthesized and functionally screened synthetic hydroxy-l-proline derivatives using electrophysiological and radiolabeled uptake methods against amino acid transporters from the SLC1, SLC7, and SLC38 solute carrier families. We have discovered a novel class of alkoxy hydroxy-pyrrolidine carboxylic acids (AHPCs) that act as selective high-affinity inhibitors of the SLC1 family neutral amino acid transporters SLC1A4 and SLC1A5. AHPCs were computationally docked into a homology model and assessed with respect to predicted molecular orientation and functional activity. The series of hydroxyproline analogs identified here represent promising new agents to pharmacologically modulate SLC1A4 and SLC1A5 amino acid exchangers which are implicated in numerous pathophysiological processes such as cancer and neurological diseases.
