38269563|a|A major proportion (90 %) of patients with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders develop during the disease at least one of the Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD). BPSD often leads to complications for patients (hospitalization, institutionalization). Caregivers are often family members, and it may be difficult for them to manage the disruptive behavior or apathy of their loved ones. This situation often generates physical and psychological symptoms. The Nice University Hospital (France) and the Bien Vieillir Nice 2030 project offer at-home non-pharmacological therapies to reduce BPSD, combined with psychoeducational sessions to improve caregiver skills. A team of psychologists went to the patients' homes 3 times per week to provide personalized non-pharmacological therapies for the patients and educational programs for their caregivers. The monocentric feasibility study was carried out among 20 patient-caregiver pairs (over 7 months). Cohen-Mansfield Inventory Scales, Zarit Burden Interviews, Caregiver Reaction Inventories, and Dementia Quality of life interviews were performed during the study. The Mederic Alzheimer Foundation (MAF) conducted an external evaluation of the project. Analysis of the results showed a significant reduction (p <= 0,05) in the number of BPSD on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory scale (p = 0,034). As well as a significant reduction in the behavioral symptoms of agitation on the CMAI scale (p = 0,041). A non-significant reduction in caregiver burden was also noted. Even if the results are encouraging, it is essential to conduct a medico-economic analysis to validate the feasibility of the PsyDoMa model. More clinical studies are needed to conclude.
