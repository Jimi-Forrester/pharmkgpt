36277536|t|Immunosuppressant Responsive Neuropsychiatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Manifestations Initially Diagnosed As Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder.
36277536|a|Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a well-documented multi-system autoimmune disease with increased frequency noted in younger females and among minority populations. Disease-defining signs and symptoms can vary widely and involve multiple organ systems including the nervous system. Involvement of the nervous system, known as neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) can present as manifestations consistent with central nervous system or peripheral nervous system pathologies, with the former including presentations of psychiatric illnesses. This case report reviews a 21-year-old Black female's presentation that was most notable for psychosis with other findings on examination and laboratory investigation resulting in a diagnosis of NPSLE. Our patient had a positive initial response to high-dose steroids with improvement of her psychosis and was planned for further treatment with the well-known chemotherapy and immunomodulatory agent, cyclophosphamide.
