32403292|a|Several chronic neuroinflammatory diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), have the so-called 'redox imbalance' in common, a dynamic system modulated by various factors. Among them, alteration of the mitochondrial functionality can cause overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with the consequent induction of oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis. Considering the failure of clinical trials with drugs that eliminate ROS directly, research currently focuses on approaches that counteract redox imbalance, thus restoring normal physiology in a neuroinflammatory condition. Herein, we used SH-SY5Y cells treated with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), a neurotoxin broadly employed to generate experimental models of PD. Cells were pre-treated with the Rho-modulating Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1), before the addition of 6-OHDA. Then, cell viability, mitochondrial morphology and dynamics, redox profile as well as autophagic markers expression were assessed. We found that CNF1 preserves cell viability and counteracts oxidative stress induced by 6-OHDA. These effects are accompanied by modulation of the mitochondrial network and an increase in macroautophagic markers. Our results confirm the Rho GTPases as suitable pharmacological targets to counteract neuroinflammatory diseases and evidence the potentiality of CNF1, whose beneficial effects on pathological animal models have been already proven to act against oxidative stress through an autophagic strategy.
