28149046|a|Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) interaction with Receptor for AGEs (RAGE) activates downstream signaling and evokes inflammatory responses in vascular cells. Therefore, it is of interest to design a novel series of molecules with a library of 352 compounds based on natural Isoflavone and Argpyrimidine moities. The compounds screened against the optimized structure of RAGE (PDB code: 3CJJ) using MolDock aided with molecular docking algorithm. This exercise identified compound number 62 with appreciable ADME properties having no toxicity and pharmacophore features. Therefore, compound 62 identified as a RAGE inhibitor is proposed for further validation in the context of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and vascular complications.
