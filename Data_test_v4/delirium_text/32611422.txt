32611422|a|BACKGROUND: Bilateral thalamic lesions are rare. Here, we describe a case of probable acute disseminating encephalomyelitis (ADEM) with symmetrical bilateral thalamic lesions. CASE PRESENTATION: An 85-year-old man presented with weakness of the lower limbs and urinary retention for 1 day, soon followed by coma. He had an H1N1 influenza vaccination 3 months ago. A lumbar puncture showed positive oligoclonal bands and negative results for anti-AQP4 antibodies. A head MRI demonstrated focal symmetrical bilateral thalamic lesions. An MRI of the thoracic spinal cord showed longitudinally extensive lesions in the spinal cord. He was diagnosed with probable ADEM. Despite being treated with IVIG, the patient remained unconscious and died a month later from pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: In cases with bilateral thalamic lesions, the possibility of ADEM should be considered. The characteristics of the thalamic lesions and imaging findings in other parts of the brain or spinal cord should be taken into account in association with the clinical and laboratory information in making a correct diagnosis.
