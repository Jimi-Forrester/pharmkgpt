33337365|a|BACKGROUND: Although previous phase II and III clinical trials conducted in Japan showed that zonisamide improved parkinsonism in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), some differences in efficacy outcomes were observed between the trials. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to further examine the efficacy and safety of zonisamide in DLB patients with parkinsonism in a post hoc analysis of pooled data from the previous phase II and III trials. METHODS: Both trials featured a 4-week run-in period followed by a 12-week treatment period with a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized, multicenter trial design. In our pooled analysis, the primary outcome was the change in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III total score. Other outcomes included the changes in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory-10 (NPI-10) scores, and the incidence of adverse events. RESULTS: Zonisamide significantly decreased the UPDRS part III total and individual motor symptom scores but did not affect the MMSE or NPI-10 scores at week 12. There was no difference in the incidence of adverse events between the zonisamide and placebo groups except for decreased appetite, which had an increased frequency in the zonisamide 50 mg group compared with placebo. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that zonisamide improved parkinsonism with DLB without deterioration of cognitive function and or worsening behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.
