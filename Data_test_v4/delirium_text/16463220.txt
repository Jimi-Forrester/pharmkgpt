16463220|a|The author reviews two decades of clinical research directed towards the links between disturbances of the oculomotor functions and the severity and progress of Alzheimer's disease. Two basically different streams of research are identified. The first based on precise, quantitative examination of automatic or reflexive eye movements, including saccadic refixation and smooth pursuit. Using both predictable and random changes of the stimuli parameters, researchers have isolated the oculomotor functions of prediction and planning that relate to more advanced processing compared to the simple stimulus-driven responses. Disorders of the smooth eye movement control and of saccadic refixation have been used for quantifying the motor dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. The second stream of research has been targeted on more cognitive components and their expression in visual interactions with the surroundings, with subjects exposed to deliberated modified visual environments, that would normally evoke curiosity and emotional responses, and modulate awareness.
