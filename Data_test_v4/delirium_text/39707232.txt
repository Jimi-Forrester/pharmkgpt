39707232|a|INTRODUCTION: Patients with cancer experience physical, mental, and social pain that affects themselves and their families. The increasing cancer incidence and advances in treatment have increased the number of cancer survivors in Korea, and there is an influx of patients in Seoul and other metropolitan areas, leading to shortages of continuous care and comprehensive life support facilities. Patients must travel long distances for treatment, which poses logistical and quality-of-life challenges. METHODS: This prospective cohort study targets patients with incurable cancer (n = 720) and their families (n = 288) from ten regional cancer centers and two affiliated hospitals in Korea. The sub-cohorts are based on treatment refusal, spinal metastasis with symptoms, catheter-related symptoms, and skeletal-related events. Medical records and patient-reported outcomes will be collected every three months and for up to three years, with surveys for guardians conducted for one-year post-patient demise. DISCUSSION: The dynamic nature of cancer significantly affects patients and their caregivers. It is necessary to identify the factors that affect their quality of life to integrate them into society. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study will inform the establishment of a regional cancer center consortium. This will address the unmet needs of local cancer patients and their families, enhance their overall quality of life, and contribute to the well-being of the local community.
