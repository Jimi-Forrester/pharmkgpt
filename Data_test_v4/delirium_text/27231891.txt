27231891|t|Synthesis and Characterization of Glutamic-Chitosan Hydrogel for Copper and Nickel Removal from Wastewater.
27231891|a|Chitosan was reacted with four concentrations (2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mmol) of glutamic acid resulting in four types of glutamic-chitosan hydrogels (GCs), the activity of the resulted compounds on the removal of copper(II) and nickel(II) from wastewater were tested. The results indicated that by increasing glutamic acid concentration from GCs-1 to GCs-4, the efficiency of removing Cu(II) and Ni(II) were decreased, which may be due to a decrease in the pore size of the hydrogels as a result of the increased degree of crosslinking.
