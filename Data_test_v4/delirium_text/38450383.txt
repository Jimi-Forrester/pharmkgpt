38450383|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent form of dementia. It is characterized by pronounced neuronal degeneration with formation of neurofibrillary tangles and deposition of amyloid beta throughout the central nervous system. Animal models have provided important insights into the pathogenesis of AD and they have shown that different brain cell types including neurons, astrocytes and microglia have important functions in the pathogenesis of AD. However, there are difficulties in translating promising therapeutic observations in mice into clinical application in patients. Alternative models using human cells such as human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may provide significant advantages, since they have successfully been used to model disease mechanisms in neurons and in glial cells in neurodegenerative diseases in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we summarize recent studies that describe the transplantation of human iPSC-derived neurons, astrocytes and microglial cells into the forebrain of mice to generate chimeric transplantation models of AD. We also discuss opportunities, challenges and limitations in using differentiated human iPSCs for in vivo disease modeling and their application for biomedical research.
