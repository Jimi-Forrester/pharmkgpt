39531138|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Supplementation of nicotinamide mononucleotides (NMN) has been claimed to improve metabolic function. We reviewed human randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of NMN to evaluate its effect on markers of glucose and lipid metabolism. RECENT FINDINGS: Eight RCTs on NMN (dosage ranged 250-2000 mg/d for a duration of 14 days to 12 weeks) involving a total of 342 middle-age/older adults (49% females, mainly non-diabetic) reporting at least one outcome on glucose control or lipid profile published in 2021-2023 were reviewed. The random-effects meta-analyses indicated no significant benefit of NMN on fasting glucose, fasting insulin, glycated hemoglobin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance and lipid profile. Based on the small number of RCTs involving mainly relatively healthy adults, short-term supplementation of NMN of 250-2000 mg/d did not show significantly positive impacts on glucose control and lipid profile.
