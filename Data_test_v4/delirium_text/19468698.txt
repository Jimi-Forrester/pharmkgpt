19468698|a|BACKGROUND: Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency is the most frequent innate disorder of the urea cycle and is X-chromosome linked. The disease normally manifests itself shortly after birth and is fatal when untreated. Due to the different expression and X-chromosomal inheritance the manifestation of symptoms can appear later particularly in girls and young women. The first symptoms are non-specific signs of elevated cerebral pressure as a result of a hyperammonemia, which range from nausea and headache up to cerebral herniation with fatal outcome. Measurement of plasma ammonia levels is a simple yet important screening test for patients with unexpected stupor or delirium. CASE REPORTS: The two case reports show the clinical range from acute decompensation with acute cerebral herniation followed by fatal outcome to recovery under emergency therapy without substantial neurological deficits. THERAPY: Emergency treatment consists of symptomatic securing of vital parameters and an immediate reduction in the ammonia level using high calorie, protein-free nutrition to avoid catabolism together with administration of arginine, benzoate or phenyl butyrate. In cases of coma with severe cerebral edema and the threat of a herniation reaction or excessive ammonia levels, emergency hemodialysis must be immediately carried out. CONCLUSIONS: In the clinical routine it is extremely important to consider a metabolic defect at an early phase and among others to determine the ammonia level so that the appropriate treatment can be instigated in time.
