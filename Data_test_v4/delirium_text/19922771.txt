19922771|t|Differential gene expression analysis of human entorhinal cortex support a possible role of some extracellular matrix proteins in the onset of Alzheimer disease.
19922771|a|The onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been associated with the specific vulnerability of neurons in the upper layers of the entorhinal cortex. To define the molecular characteristics of those neurons, we have used microarrays to define the gene expression in that region. In this way, we identified several genes that are expressed distinctly in the upper and lower layers of the entorhinal cortex. These include the genes encoding the matrix Gla protein, collagen type 1alpha2, reelin, semaphorin 3C or the relaxin receptor, all related to the extracellular matrix. Thus, differences in the extracellular matrix components between the upper and lower layers of the entorhinal cortex may in part explain the vulnerability of neurons present in the upper layers of this brain region in disorders like AD.
