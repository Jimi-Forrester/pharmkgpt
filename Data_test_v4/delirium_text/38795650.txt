38795650|a|OBJECTIVE: Huntington's Disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by the mutation of the Htt gene, impacting all aspects of living and functioning. Among cognitive disabilities, spatial capacities are impaired, but their monitoring remains scarce as limited by lengthy experts' assessments. Language offers an alternative medium to evaluate patients' performance in HD. Yet, its capacities to assess HD's spatial abilities are unknown. Here, we aimed to bring proof-of-concept that HD's spatial deficits can be assessed through speech. METHODS: We developed the Spatial Description Model to graphically represent spatial relations described during the Cookie Theft Picture (CTP) task. We increased the sensitivity of our model by using only sentences with spatial terms, unlike previous studies in Alzheimer's disease. 78 carriers of the mutant Htt, including 56 manifest and 22 premanifest individuals, as well as 25 healthy controls were included from the BIOHD & (NCT01412125) & Repair-HD (NCT03119246) cohorts. The convergence and divergence of the model were validated using the SelfCog battery. RESULTS: Our Spatial Description Model was the only one among the four assessed approaches, revealing that individuals with manifest HD expressed fewer spatial relations and engaged in less spatial exploration compared to healthy controls. Their graphs correlated with both visuospatial and language SelfCog performances, but not with motor, executive nor memory functions. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the proof-of-concept using our Spatial Description Model that language can grasp HD patient's spatial disturbances. By adding spatial capabilities to the panel of functions tested by the language, it paves the way for eventual remote clinical application.
