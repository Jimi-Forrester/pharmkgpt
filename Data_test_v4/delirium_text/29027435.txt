29027435|a|To establish the integration of Alzheimer's disease(AD) and blood stasis syndrome tree shrew model. Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) was used to intervene the model to testify the stability of the model. The level of blood stasis of each group in the tree shrew model was evaluated by analyzing five traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) characterizations, four blood coagulation indexes, plasma nitric oxide (NO) level, plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD) level in each group. Hematoxylin and eosin(HE) staining was used to observe the morphological changes of brain hippocampal neuron cell of each group. Immunohistochemical staining was used to assay the ChAT and SYP levels in brain hippocampus of each group.The blood stasis characterization of the integration of disease and syndrome group was more obvious than the AD group, and that of the drug administration group was lower than that of the integration of disease and syndrome group. Abeta1-42, APP, P-Tau, ChAT and SYP level of AD group were lower than those in the blank group, which were further reduced in the model of integration of disease and syndrome. However, the administration of PNS relieved the reduction, indicating that the AD and blood stasis integration syndrome tree shrew model is stable.
