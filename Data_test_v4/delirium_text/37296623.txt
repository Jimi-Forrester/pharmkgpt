37296623|t|Restoring Axonal Organelle Motility and Regeneration in Cultured FUS-ALS Motoneurons through Magnetic Field Stimulation Suggests an Alternative Therapeutic Approach.
37296623|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating motoneuron disease characterized by sustained loss of neuromuscular junctions, degenerating corticospinal motoneurons and rapidly progressing muscle paralysis. Motoneurons have unique features, essentially a highly polarized, lengthy architecture of axons, posing a considerable challenge for maintaining long-range trafficking routes for organelles, cargo, mRNA and secretion with a high energy effort to serve crucial neuronal functions. Impaired intracellular pathways implicated in ALS pathology comprise RNA metabolism, cytoplasmic protein aggregation, cytoskeletal integrity for organelle trafficking and maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and function, cumulatively leading to neurodegeneration. Current drug treatments only have marginal effects on survival, thereby calling for alternative ALS therapies. Exposure to magnetic fields, e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulations (TMS) on the central nervous system (CNS), has been broadly explored over the past 20 years to investigate and improve physical and mental activities through stimulated excitability as well as neuronal plasticity. However, studies of magnetic treatments on the peripheral nervous system are still scarce. Thus, we investigated the therapeutic potential of low frequency alternating current magnetic fields on cultured spinal motoneurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells of FUS-ALS patients and healthy persons. We report a remarkable restoration induced by magnetic stimulation on axonal trafficking of mitochondria and lysosomes and axonal regenerative sprouting after axotomy in FUS-ALS in vitro without obvious harmful effects on diseased and healthy neurons. These beneficial effects seem to derive from improved microtubule integrity. Thus, our study suggests the therapeutic potential of magnetic stimulations in ALS, which awaits further exploration and validation in future long-term in vivo studies.
