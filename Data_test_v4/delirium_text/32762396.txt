32762396|t|Modeling Quality of Life in Alzheimer Disease: The Impact of Cognitive, Functional, and Mood Variables in Self and Carers' Perceptions.
32762396|a|Quality of life (QoL) includes complex interactions between objective and subjective factors. Through structural equation modeling, we analyzed people with Alzheimer disease (PwAD) and carers' ratings to identify the factors associated with PwAD QoL. We included 264 PwAD and their carers. Model 1, carers' ratings of PwAD QoL, showed a bidirectional association with worse depressive symptoms, lower functionality, and impairment on awareness being linked. These variables were associated with burden and all of them directly affecting carers' ratings of PwAD QoL. Model 2, PwAD self-reported QoL, had the same bidirectional associations among the same variables with all of them influencing PwAD self-reported QoL. However, the interpretations of these similar associations should be different. The path analysis increased the understanding of the relationship between QoL and cognition, functionality, mood, awareness, and burden. Our findings bring together a number of consistent predictors and confirm their different effects in PwAD and carers' point of view about QoL.
