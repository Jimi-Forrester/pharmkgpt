39311590|a|Biofilms formed by Escherichia coli are composed of amyloid curli and cellulose and have been shown to be linked to pathogenicity, antibiotic resistance, and chronic infections. Guanabenz acetate (GABE), an antihypertensive drug, was identified as a potential strategic repurposing drug due to its biofilm inhibitory properties following an extensive antimicrobial screening assay of 2,202 Food and Drug Administration-approved non-antibiotic agents. The results of this study provide insights into the effectiveness of GABE as a therapeutic alternative against E. coli biofilm-associated infectious diseases. IMPORTANCE: Biofilm-associated bacterial infections are one of the major problems in medical settings. There are currently limited biofilm inhibitors available for clinical use. Guanabenz acetate, a drug used to treat high blood pressure, was found to be an effective anti-biofilm agent against Escherichia coli. Our results show that this drug can inhibit the production of cellulose and curli amyloid protein, which are the two main components of E. coli biofilms. Our findings highlight the possibility of repurposing a drug to prevent E. coli biofilm formation.
