25378725|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the associations between health and how people evaluate and experience their lives. METHODS: We analysed data from nationally-representative household surveys originally conducted in 2011-2012 in Finland, Poland and Spain. These surveys provided information on 10 800 adults, for whom experienced well-being was measured using the Day Reconstruction Method and evaluative well-being was measured with the Cantril Self-Anchoring Striving Scale. Health status was assessed by questions in eight domains including mobility and self-care. We used multiple linear regression, structural equation models and multiple indicators/multiple causes models to explore factors associated with experienced and evaluative well-being. FINDINGS: The multiple indicator/multiple causes model conducted over the pooled sample showed that respondents with younger age (effect size, beta = 0.19), with higher levels of education (beta = -0.12), a history of depression (beta = -0.17), poor health status (beta = 0.29) or poor cognitive functioning (beta = 0.09) reported worse experienced well-being. Additional factors associated with worse evaluative well-being were male sex (beta = -0.03), not living with a partner (beta = 0.07), and lower occupational (beta = -0.07) or income levels (beta = 0.08). Health status was the factor most strongly correlated with both experienced and evaluative well-being, even after controlling for a history of depression, age, income and other sociodemographic variables. CONCLUSION: Health status is an important correlate of well-being. Therefore, strategies to improve population health would also improve people's well-being.
