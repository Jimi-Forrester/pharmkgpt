28831385|a|Lysosomal diseases (LD) comprise a group of approximately 60 hereditary conditions caused by progressive accumulation of metabolites due to defects in lysosomal enzymes and degradation pathways, which lead to a wide range of clinical manifestations. The estimated combined incidence of LD is between 1 in 4000 to 1 in 13,000 live births, with recent data from pilot newborn screening studies showing even higher incidence. We aimed to determine the prevalence of the classical LD and other diseases caused by lysosome-related genes in our cohort of diagnostic odyssey patients. The Individualized Medicine Clinic at Mayo Clinic is increasingly utilizing whole exome sequencing (WES) to determine the genetic etiology of undiagnosed Mendelian disease. From September 2012 to April 2017, WES results from 350 patients with unexplained symptoms were reviewed. Disease-causing variants were identified in MYO6, CLN6, LRBA, KCTD7, and ARSB revealing a genetic diagnosis of a LD in 8 individuals from 5 families. Based on our findings, lysosome-related disorders may be collectively common, reaching up to 1.5% prevalence in a cohort of patients with undiagnosed diseases presenting to a genetics clinic.
