18682132|a|OBJECTIVE: Delirium is a frequent problem during hospital admission in the elderly. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the occurrence of delirium in patients aged more than 94 years admitted to hospital for femur fracture. A further aim was to analyze the possible existence of differences in length of hospital stay or in-hospital mortality according to the presence or absence of delirium. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 25 patients (mean age 96.8 years) admitted for femur fracture were included. Functional status was determined through the Barthel index and comorbidity through Charlson's index. Diagnosis of delirium was based on the Confusional Assessment Method. RESULTS: There were 13 women (52%) and 12 men. The mean Barthel score before admission was 64.6 +/- 22 and the mean Charlson Index was 1.4 +/- 1. The mean length of hospital stay was 15.2 +/- 1.4 days. Five patients (20%) died during admission. Twelve patients (48%) developed delirium. Mortality (25% vs 15.4%) and the mean number of days of hospital stay (17.5 vs 13 days) were higher in patients with delirium, although these differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Practically half the patients aged more than 94 years with fracture of the femur had an episode of delirium during admission.
