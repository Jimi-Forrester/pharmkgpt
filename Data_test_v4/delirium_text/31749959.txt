31749959|a|Imbalance between amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide synthesis and clearance results in Abeta deregulation. Failure to clear these peptides appears to cause the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In recent years, microRNAs have become established key regulators of biological processes that relate among others to the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD. This review article gives an overview on microRNAs that are involved in the Abeta cascade and discusses their inhibitory impact on their target mRNAs whose products participate in Abeta clearance. Understanding of the mechanism of microRNA in the associated signal pathways could identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD.
