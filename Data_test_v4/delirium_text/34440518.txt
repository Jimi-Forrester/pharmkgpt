34440518|t|Drug Repurposing for the Management of Depression: Where Do We Stand Currently?
34440518|a|A slow rate of new drug discovery and higher costs of new drug development attracted the attention of scientists and physicians for the repurposing and repositioning of old medications. Experimental studies and off-label use of drugs have helped drive data for further studies of approving these medications. A deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of depression encourages novel discoveries through drug repurposing and drug repositioning to treat depression. In addition to reducing neurotransmitters like epinephrine and serotonin, other mechanisms such as inflammation, insufficient blood supply, and neurotoxicants are now considered as the possible involved mechanisms. Considering the mentioned mechanisms has resulted in repurposed medications to treat treatment-resistant depression (TRD) as alternative approaches. This review aims to discuss the available treatments and their progress way during repositioning. Neurotransmitters' antagonists, atypical antipsychotics, and CNS stimulants have been studied for the repurposing aims. However, they need proper studies in terms of formulation, matching with regulatory standards, and efficacy.
