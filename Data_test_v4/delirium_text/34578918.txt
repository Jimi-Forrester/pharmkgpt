34578918|a|Neurodegenerative disorders are devastating diseases in which aging is a major risk factor. High-fat diet (HFD) seems to contribute to cognition deterioration, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Moreover, resveratrol (RSV) has been reported to counteract the loss of cognition associated with age. Our study aimed to investigate whether the adenosinergic system and plasma membrane cholesterol are modulated by HFD and RSV in the cerebral cortex of C57BL/6J and SAMP8 mice. Results show that HFD induced increased A1R and A2AR densities in C57BL/6J, whereas this remained unchanged in SAMP8. Higher activity of 5'-Nucleotidase was found as a common effect induced by HFD in both mice strains. Furthermore, the effect of HFD and RSV on A2BR density was different depending on the mouse strain. RSV did not clearly counteract the HFD-induced effects on the adenosinergic system. Besides, no changes in free-cholesterol levels were detected in the plasma membrane of cerebral cortex in both strains. Taken together, our data suggest a different modulation of adenosine receptors depending on the mouse strain, not related to changes in plasma membrane cholesterol content.
