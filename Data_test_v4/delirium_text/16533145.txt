16533145|t|Therapeutic targets for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: current treatments and prospects for more effective therapies.
16533145|a|Although amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was described more than 130 years ago, the cause(s) of most cases of this adult motor neuron disease remains a mystery. With the discovery of mutations in one gene (Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase) as a primary cause of some forms of ALS, model systems have been developed that have helped us begin to understand mechanisms involved in motor neuron death and enabled testing of potential new therapies. Several other genes have been implicated as risk factors in motor neuron diseases, including neurofilaments, cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and angiogenin. With advances in the basic research of the disease, many hypotheses accounting for motor neuron death are being explored, including loss of trophic support, protein mishandling, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, axonal abnormalities and inflammation. Many of these mechanisms are the focus of research in other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease.
