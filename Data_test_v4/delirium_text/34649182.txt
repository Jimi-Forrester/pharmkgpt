34649182|t|Discovery of PT-65 as a highly potent and selective Proteolysis-targeting chimera degrader of GSK3 for treating Alzheimer's disease.
34649182|a|GSK3 is a promising target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we describe the design and synthesize of a series of GSK3 degraders based on a click chemistry platform. A series of highly potent GSK3 degraders were obtained. Among them, PT-65 exhibited most potent degradation potency against GSK3alpha (DC50 = 28.3 nM) and GSK3beta (DC50 = 34.2 nM) in SH-SY5Y cells. SPR assay confirmed that PT-65 binds to GSK3beta with high affinity (KD = 12.41 nM). The proteomic study indicated that PT-65 could selectively induced GSK3 degradation. Moreover, PT-65 could effectively suppress GSK3beta and Abeta mediated tau hyperphosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner and protect SH-SY5Y cells from Abeta caused cell damage. We also confirmed that PT-65 could suppress OA induced tau hyperphosphorylation and ameliorate learning and memory impairments in vivo model of AD. In summary, PT-65 might be a promising candidate for the treatment of AD.
