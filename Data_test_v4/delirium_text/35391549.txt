35391549|a|PURPOSE: The diagnosis of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) can be challenging. Aim of this study was to use a novel T1 mapping method to enrich the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected iNPH. METHODS: Using 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) we prospectively evaluated rapid high-resolution T1 mapping at 0.5 mm resolution and 4 s acquisition time in 15 patients with suspected iNPH and 8 age-matched, healthy controls. T1 mapping in axial sections of the cerebrum, clinical and neuropsychological testing were performed prior to and after cerebrospinal fluid tap test (CSF-TT). T1 relaxation times were measured in 5 predefined periventricular regions. RESULTS: All 15 patients with suspected iNPH showed gait impairment, 13 (86.6%) showed signs of cognitive impairment and 8 (53.3%) patients had urinary incontinence. Gait improvement was noted in 12 patients (80%) after CSF-TT. T1 relaxation times in all periventricular regions were elevated in patients with iNPH compared to controls with the most pronounced differences in the anterior (1006 +- 93 ms vs. 911 +- 77 ms; p = 0.023) and posterior horns (983 +- 103 ms vs. 893 +- 68 ms; p = 0.037) of the lateral ventricles. Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scores at baseline were negatively correlated with T1 relaxation times (r < -0.5, p < 0.02). Higher T1 relaxation times were significantly correlated with an improvement of the 3-m timed up and go test (r > 0.6 and p < 0.03) after CSF-TT. CONCLUSION: In iNPH-patients, periventricular T1 relaxation times are increased compared to age-matched controls and predict gait improvement after CSF-TT. T1 mapping might enrich iNPH work-up and might be useful to indicate permanent shunting.
