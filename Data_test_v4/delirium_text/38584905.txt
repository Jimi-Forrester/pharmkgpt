38584905|a|Introduction: Sudden onset of reduced consciousness, psychomotor agitation and mydriasis are all indicative of an anticholinergic toxidrome. It is important to note that numerous drugs, as well as certain herbs and plants, possess anticholinergic properties. Case description: An 84-year-old female patient had sudden nocturnal onset of uncoordinated hand movements and altered mental status. Shortly after, the patient's 83-year-old husband developed symptoms of dysarthria, gait ataxia, vertigo, and delirium. Conclusion: Anticholinergic syndrome consists of a combination of central and peripheral anticholinergic symptoms. Physostigmine given intravenously resulted in rapid reversal of symptoms. Thorn apple seeds had been accidentally ingested and were identified as the cause. LEARNING POINTS: The clinical presentation of an anticholinergic toxidrome includes both central and peripheral symptoms such as altered consciousness, mydriasis, dry mucous membranes and skin, and tachycardia.Prompt recognition of anticholinergic toxidrome and the administration of physostigmine can lead to rapid reversal of symptoms and improved patient outcomes.Treatment with physostigmine is indicated when a patient with an agitated delirium does not respond adequately to titrated benzodiazepines.
