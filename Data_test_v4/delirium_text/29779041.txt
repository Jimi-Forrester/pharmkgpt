29779041|a|The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still unknown, but the deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and chronic inflammation indicates that immune disturbances are involved in AD pathogenesis. Recent genetic studies have revealed that many candidate genes are expressed in both microglia and myeloid cells which infiltrate into the AD brains. Invading myeloid cells controls the functions of resident microglia in pathological conditions, such as AD pathology. AD is a neurologic disease with inflammatory component where the immune system is not able to eliminate the perpetrator, while, concurrently, it should prevent neuronal injuries induced by inflammation. Recent studies have indicated that AD brains are an immunosuppressive microenvironment, e.g., microglial cells are hyporesponsive to Abeta deposits and anti-inflammatory cytokines enhance Abeta deposition. Immunosuppression is a common element in pathological disorders involving chronic inflammation. Studies on cancer-associated inflammation have demonstrated that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have a crucial role in the immune escape of tumor cells. Immunosuppression is not limited to tumors, since MDSCs can be recruited into chronically inflamed tissues where inflammatory mediators enhance the proliferation and activation of MDSCs. AD brains express a range of chemokines and cytokines which could recruit and expand MDSCs in inflamed AD brains and thus generate an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Several neuroinflammatory disorders, e.g., the early phase of AD pathology, have been associated with an increase in the level of circulating MDSCs. We will elucidate the immunosuppressive armament of MDSCs and present evidences in support of the crucial role of MDSCs in the pathogenesis of AD.
