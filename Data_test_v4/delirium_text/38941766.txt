38941766|t|Functional network centrality indicates interactions between APOE4 and age across the clinical spectrum of AD.
38941766|a|Advanced age is the most important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and carrier-status of the Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele is the strongest known genetic risk factor. Many studies have consistently shown a link between APOE4 and synaptic dysfunction, possibly reflecting pathologically accelerated biological aging in persons at risk for AD. To test the hypothesis that distinct functional connectivity patterns characterize APOE4 carriers across the clinical spectrum of AD, we investigated 128 resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) datasets from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (ADNI), representing all disease stages from cognitive normal to clinical dementia. Brain region centralities within functional networks, computed as eigenvector centrality, were tested for multivariate associations with chronological age, APOE4 carrier status and clinical stage (as well as their interactions) by partial least square analysis (PLSC). By PLSC analysis two distinct brain activity patterns could be identified, which reflected interactive effects of age, APOE4 and clinical disease stage. A first component including sensorimotor regions and parietal regions correlated with age and AD clinical stage (p < 0.001). A second component focused on medial-frontal regions and was specifically related to the interaction between age and APOE4 (p = 0.032). Our findings are consistent with earlier reports on altered network connectivity in APOE4 carriers. Results of our study highlight promise of graph-theory based network centrality to identify brain connectivity linked to genetic risk, clinical stage and age. Our data suggest the existence of brain network activity patterns that characterize APOE4 carriers across clinical stages of AD.
