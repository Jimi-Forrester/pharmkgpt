38907362|t|Is there evidence for using ketamine among individuals with dementia?
38907362|a|The aim of this short narrative review was to evaluate the existing literature regarding the clinical use of ketamine among individuals with dementia, especially those with behavioral disturbances. PubMed, Cochrane, and Ovid (Embase, APA PsycINFO, and MEDLINE) databases were searched for abstracts using the search terms "ketamine" AND "dementia." Only articles describing the use of ketamine in individuals with dementia were included. Articles that did not include individuals with dementia, did not use ketamine, were published in a non-English language, primarily described animal studies, or were reviews were excluded. Three case reports met the inclusion criteria. One described the use of subcutaneous ketamine for depression, one described the use of intramuscular ketamine for acute agitation, and one described the use of S-ketamine as anesthesia during electroconvulsive therapy for depression and catatonia. No significant adverse effects were reported in any of the cases. Although the use of ketamine in the treatment of depression and agitation associated with dementia has potential, the current evidence remains limited. High-quality prospective studies are needed to confirm the observations of these case reports before ketamine can be used to treat behavioral disturbances in individuals with dementia.
