18556992|a|Long-term excessive alcohol consumption is the most common risk factor for the development of chronic pancreatitis. Management of patients with alcohol-associated chronic pancreatitis can be complicated by problems associated with dependency, psychosocial burden, and physical changes like malnutrition and hepatic insufficiency. The records of 372 consecutive patients who underwent lateral pancreaticojejunostomy (LPJ, n = 184), pancreatoduodenectomy (PD, n = 97), or distal pancreatectomy (DP, n = 91) for chronic pancreatitis were retrospectively analyzed. Long-term outcome was assessed by patient survey with a median follow up of 5.5 +/- 0.2 years. Of 372 patients, 171 underwent surgery for alcohol-associated chronic pancreatitis. According to patient questioning, the prevalence of alcohol cessation before surgery in the 171 patients was 81 per cent. Operative morbidity in the 171 patients was 20 per cent, 50 per cent, and 26 per cent after LPJ, PD, and DP, respectively, with an overall perioperative mortality rate of 2 per cent. None of the patients developed delirium tremens using an alcohol withdrawal protocol. Continued alcohol abuse before surgery did not affect perioperative morbidity (P > 0.05). Follow up was available for a total of 229 patients, of which 39 per cent with alcohol-associated chronic pancreatitis had died compared with 16 per cent in the nonalcohol group (P < 0.001). Of the remaining 171 patients, 45 per cent with alcohol-associated chronic pancreatitis had good pain control compared with 49 per cent of the remainder (P > 0.05). Continuation of alcohol abuse after operation did not affect success for pain control at follow up (P > 0.05). Surgical treatment of alcohol-associated chronic pancreatitis can be performed with similar morbidity and mortality compared with other forms of chronic pancreatitis. Alcohol cessation is preferred but not mandated to achieve good operative long-term outcome. Caution needs to be taken to prevent postoperative alcohol withdrawal. Long-term follow up with psychosocial support and management of co-existing addictions is important.
