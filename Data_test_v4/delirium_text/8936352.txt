8936352|a|We have previously demonstrated with MRI that as well as marked white matter involvement in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), atrophy of the corpus callosum may also be present. This finding prompted us to study possible correlations between atrophy of the corpus callosum and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and between white matter lesions and the severity of the disease. We compared the corpus callosum and white matter lesions on MRI from 15 AD patients and 15 controls. The white matter lesions were scored according to the Scheltens' rating scale. We found a significant reduction of the area of the corpus callosum and more severe white matter lesions in AD patients than in controls. Both atrophy of the corpus callosum and the severity of lesions depended mainly on the diagnosis of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type and on age but not on the diagnosis of presenile AD. We demonstrated a negative correlation between white matter lesions scores and areas of corpus callosum in AD patients and no correlation between the white matter lesions and the severity of the disease. We demonstrated that white matter lesions including WMH and atrophy of the corpus callosum are more frequent in AD than in controls. The predominance of white matter lesions in senile AD may be explained by the combination of aging and disease processes.
