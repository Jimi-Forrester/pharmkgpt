33375325|t|Pathophysiology and Treatment of Pruritus in Elderly.
33375325|a|Pruritus is a relatively common symptom that anyone can experience at any point in their life and is more common in the elderly. Pruritus in elderly can be defined as chronic pruritus in a person over 65 years old. The pathophysiology of pruritus in elderly is still unclear, and the quality of life is reduced. Generally, itch can be clinically classified into six types: Itch caused by systemic diseases, itch caused by skin diseases, neuropathic pruritus, psychogenic pruritus, pruritus with multiple factors, and from unknown causes. Senile pruritus can be defined as a chronic pruritus of unknown origin in elderly people. Various neuronal mediators, signaling mechanisms at neuronal terminals, central and peripheral neurotransmission pathways, and neuronal sensitizations are included in the processes causing itch. A variety of therapies are used and several novel drugs are being developed to relieve itch, including systemic and topical treatments.
