36110433|t|Treatment Modalities for Dementia in Down's Syndrome: A Literature Review.
36110433|a|Down's syndrome (DS) is the most well-known chromosomal abnormality characterized by an extra chromosome 21 and multiple systemic issues. The higher production of amyloid precursor protein (APP), the precursor peptide of beta-amyloid, predisposes persons with DS to early Alzheimer's disease (AD). The prevalence of dementia has increased as a function of the extended life expectancy of persons with DS. Because we know little about the treatment of dementia in persons with DS, this review focuses on the pathophysiology and management strategies to improve the overall quality of life.
