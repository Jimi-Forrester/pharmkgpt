34333996|a|Older adults living with dementia are at risk for more complex health care transitions than individuals without this condition, non-impaired individuals. Poor quality care transitions have resulted in a growing body of qualitative empirical literature that to date has not been synthesized. We conducted a systematic literature review by applying a meta-ethnography approach to answer the following question: How do older adults with dementia and/or their caregivers experience and perceive healthcare transition: Screening resulted in a total of 18 studies that met inclusion criteria. Our analysis revealed the following three categories associated with the health care transition: (1) Feelings associated with the healthcare transition; (2) processes associated with the healthcare transition; and (3) evaluating the quality of care associated with the health care transition. Each category is represented by several themes that together illustrate an interconnected and layered experience. The health care transition, often triggered by caregivers reaching a "tipping point," is manifested by a variety of feelings, while simultaneously caregivers report managing abrupt transition plans and maintaining vigilance over care being provided to their family member. Future practice and research opportunities should be more inclusive of persons with dementia and should establish ways of better supporting caregivers through needs assessments, addressing feelings of grief, ongoing communication with the care team, and integrating more personalized knowledge at points of transition.
