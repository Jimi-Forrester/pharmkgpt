36647387|t|A KO mouse model for the lncRNA Lhx1os produces motor neuron alterations and locomotor impairment.
36647387|a|Here, we describe a conserved motor neuron-specific long non-coding RNA, Lhx1os, whose knockout in mice produces motor impairment and postnatal reduction of mature motor neurons (MNs). The ER stress-response pathway result specifically altered with the downregulation of factors involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR). Lhx1os was found to bind the ER-associated PDIA3 disulfide isomerase and to affect the expression of the same set of genes controlled by this protein, indicating that the two factors act in conjunction to modulate the UPR. Altogether, the observed phenotype and function of Lhx1os indicate its important role in the control of MN homeostasis and function.
