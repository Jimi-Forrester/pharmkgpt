10705163|a|In 64 individuals with dementia (26 Alzheimer type, 34 of vascular origin and 4 other types of dementia) apolipoprotein E genotype was identified. Frequency of epsilon4 allele was 36.5% in Alzheimer patients and 32.4% in vascular dementia ones. In a group of 39 nondemented individuals of the same age the epsilon4 frequency was 11.5%. In demented patients, carriers of epsilon4, a tendency to higher plasma levels of atherogenic lipids (total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) as compared with noncarriers was observed. It is possible that the epsilon4 form may aggravate the course of dementia through a moderate influence on the atherogenic lipoprotein level. The results showed that both Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia shared the same risk factors which is consistent with current opinion about a link existing between these two types of dementia.
