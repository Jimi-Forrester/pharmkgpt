33773163|a|This study investigated supra- and infratentorial structural gray and white matter (GM, WM) alterations in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) as an indicator of secondary harm due to chronic cervical cord compression and micro trauma. With MRI-based anatomical assessment and subsequent voxel-based morphometry analyses, pre- and postoperative volume alterations in the primary motor cortex (MI), the primary somatosensory cortex (SI), the supplementary motor area (SMA), and the cerebellum were analyzed in 43 DCM patients and 20 controls. We assessed disease-related symptom severity by the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale (mJOA). The study also explored symptom severity-based brain volume alterations as well as their association with clinical status. Patients had lower mJOA scores (p = .000) and lower GM volume than controls in SI (p = .016) and cerebellar regions (p = .001). Symptom severity-based subgroup analyses revealed volume reductions in almost all investigated GM ROIs (MI: p = .001; CB: p = .040; SMA: p = .007) in patients with severe clinical symptoms as well as atrophy already present in patients with moderate symptom severity. Clinical symptoms in DCM were associated with cortical and cerebellar volume reduction. GM volume alterations may serve as an indicator of both disease severity and ongoing disease progression in DCM, and should be considered in further patient care and treatment monitoring.
