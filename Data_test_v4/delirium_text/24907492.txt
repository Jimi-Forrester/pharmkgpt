24907492|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease are progressive neurodegenerative diseases with very different epidemiology and etiology. AD is a common cause of dementia with a complex polyfactorial etiology, including both genetic and environmental risk factors, while NPC is a very rare autosomal recessive disease. However, the diseases share some disease-related molecular pathways, including abnormal cholesterol metabolism, and involvement of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau pathology. Here we review recent studies on these pathological traits, focusing on studies of Abeta and tau pathology in NPC, and the importance of the NPC1 gene in AD. Further studies of similarities and differences between AD and NPC may be useful to increase the understanding of both these devastating neurological diseases.
