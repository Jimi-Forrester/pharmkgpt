36224322|a|Neuronal death and synaptic loss are principal pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid beta oligomers (AbetaOs) constitute the main neurotoxin underscoring AD pathology. AbetaOs interact with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), resulting in neurotoxic events, including activation of apoptosis and synaptic impairment. Carnosic acid (CA), extracted from Salvia rosmarinus, has been verified its neuroprotective effects in AD. However, the precise mechanisms by which CA induces synaptic protection remain unclear. In this study, we established an in vitro AD model using SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. We observed that CA improved neuronal survival by suppressing apoptosis. Moreover, CA restored synaptic impairments by increasing expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), and synaptophysin (Syn). Furthermore, we found these protective effects were dependent on inhibiting the phosphorylation of NMDAR subtype 2B (NMDAR2B), which further suppressed calcium overload and promoted activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway. Administration of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), an agonist of NMDARs, abolished these effects of CA. Our findings demonstrate that CA exerts neuroprotective effects in an in vitro model of AD by regulating NMDAR2B and its downstream cascades, highlighting the therapeutic potential of CA as a NMDARs-targeted candidate in the treatment of AD.
