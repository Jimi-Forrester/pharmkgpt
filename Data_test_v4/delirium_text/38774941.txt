38774941|t|Does photobiomodulation alter mitochondrial dynamics?
38774941|a|Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the leading causes of disease development. Dysfunctional mitochondria limit energy production, increase reactive oxygen species generation, and trigger apoptotic signals. Photobiomodulation is a noninvasive, nonthermal technique involving the application of monochromatic light with low energy density, inducing non-thermal photochemical effects at the cellular level, and it has been used due to its therapeutic potential. This review focuses on the mitochondrial dynamic's role in various diseases, evaluating the possible therapeutic role of low-power lasers (LPL) and light-emitting diodes (LED). Studies increasingly support that mitochondrial dysfunction is correlated with severe neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases. Furthermore, a disturbance in mitofusin activity is also associated with metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. The effects of PBM on mitochondrial dynamics have been observed in cells using a human fibroblast cell line and in vivo models of brain injury, diabetes, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease, and skin injury. Thus, new therapies aiming to improve mitochondrial dynamics are clinically relevant. Several studies have demonstrated that LPL and LED can be important therapies to improve health conditions when there is dysfunction in mitochondrial dynamics.
