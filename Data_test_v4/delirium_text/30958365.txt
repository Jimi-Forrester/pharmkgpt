30958365|t|A 2.5-Year Longitudinal Assessment of Naturalistic Driving in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease.
30958365|a|BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence shows that cognitively normal older adults with preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) make more errors and are more likely to receive a marginal/fail rating on a standardized road test compared to older adults without preclinical AD, but the extent to which preclinical AD impacts everyday driving behavior is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine self-reported and naturalistic longitudinal driving behavior among persons with and without preclinical AD. METHOD: We prospectively followed cognitively normal drivers (aged 65 + years) with (n = 10) and without preclinical AD (n = 10) for 2.5 years. Preclinical AD was assessed using amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) with Pittsburgh Compound B. The Driving Habits Questionnaire assessed self-reported driving outcomes. Naturalistic driving was captured using a commercial GPS data logger plugged into the on-board diagnostics II port of each participant's vehicle. Data were sampled every 30 seconds and all instances of speeding, hard braking, and sudden acceleration were recorded. RESULTS: Preclinical AD participants went to fewer places/unique destinations, traveled fewer days, and took fewer trips than participants without preclinical AD. The preclinical AD group reported a smaller driving space, greater dependence on other drivers, and more difficulty driving due to vision difficulties. Persons with preclinical AD had fewer trips with any aggression and showed a greater decline across the 2.5-year follow-up period in the number of days driving per month and the number of trips between 1-5 miles. CONCLUSION: Changes in driving occur even during the preclinical stage of AD.
