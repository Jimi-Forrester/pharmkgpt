25650198|t|Drug therapies in older adults (part 1).
25650198|a|Prescribing for older adults represents a significant challenge as the UK population ages. Physiological decline and the rising prevalence of frailty increase the likelihood of altered pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, suboptimal prescribing and adverse effects among this growing cohort of the population. In the first of two articles, we begin by considering these issues and posit four key questions which should be considered when prescribing for older adults. Does this agent reflect the priorities of the patient? Are there alternatives - with greater efficacy, effectiveness or tolerability - that might be considered? Are the dose, frequency and formulation appropriate? How does this prescription relate to concurrent medication? We also describe current drug therapies in two disease states with a predilection for older adults: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and osteoporosis. Using these examples we highlight the limitations of evidence-based medicine and guidelines in this cohort of the population, illustrating the reliance on sub-group analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of drug therapies for older adults in osteoporosis and the underutilisation of appropriate treatments for patients with AD as a result of flawed guidelines.
