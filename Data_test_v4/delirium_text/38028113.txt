38028113|t|The Analgesic Effects of Preemptive Ultrasound-Guided Pericapsular Nerve Group Block in Comparison with Erector Spinae Plane Block in Elderly Undergoing Hip Arthroplasty: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
38028113|a|Background: Perioperative pain management strategies in the elderly undergoing hip arthroplasty need special and safe preemptive care. Objectives: The primary aim of this study was to compare the analgesic effects of preemptive ultrasound-guided pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block and lumbar erector spinae plane block (L-ESPB) in the elderly undergoing hip arthroplasty. The time to the first postoperative rescue analgesia was measured. The secondary aim was to assess the ease of spinal positioning (EOSP), onset of sensory block, block performance time, and patient satisfaction. Methods: Before positioning for spinal anesthesia, 69 elderly patients undergoing hip arthroplasty were randomized into three groups (n = 23 per group). The first intervention group received ultrasound-guided PENG block with 20 mL bupivacaine 0.25%; the second intervention group received ultrasound-guided L-ESPB using the same dose of bupivacaine. In the control group, patients received spinal anesthesia without any block. Results: The time to first postoperative rescue analgesic (morphine) was significantly prolonged in the PENG group (13.3 +- 3.5 h) compared to the L-ESPB (9.5 +- 2.3 h) and control (2.6 +- 0.4 h) groups. The EOSP score was significantly higher in the PENG group compared to the L-ESPB and control groups (P < 0.001). The block performance time and oneset of the sensory block were significantly shorter in the PENG group compared to the L-ESPB group. The highest patient satisfaction scores were observed in the PENG group. Conclusions: Preemptive pericapsular nerve group block postponed the need for postoperative analgesia and eased spinal positioning compared to L-ESPB in the elderly undergoing hip arthroplasty.
