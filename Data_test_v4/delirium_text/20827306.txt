20827306|t|Coordinated increased expression of Cyclooxygenase2 and nuclear factor kappaB is a steady feature of urinary bladder carcinogenesis.
20827306|a|OBJECTIVES: The inescapable relationship between chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis has long been established. Our objective was to investigate COX-2 and NF-kappaB immunohistochemical expression in a large series of normal epithelium and bladder carcinomas. METHODS: Immunohistochemical methodology was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from urinary bladder carcinomas of 140 patients (94 males and 46 females with bladder carcinomas). RESULTS: COX-2 expression is increased in the cytoplasm of bladder cells, during loss of cell differentiation (r(s) = 0.61, P-value < .001) and in muscle invasive carcinomas (P-value < .001). A strong positive association between tumor grade and nuclear expression of NFkappaB has been established. A positive correlation between COX-2 and nuclear NFkappaB immunoreactivity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The possible coordinated upregulation of NFkappaB and COX-2, during bladder carcinogenesis, indicates that agents inhibitors of these two molecules may represent a possible new treatment strategy, by virtue of their role in bladder carcinogenesis.
