31627366|t|Antiamoebic Activities of Indolocarbazole Metabolites Isolated from Streptomyces sanyensis Cultures.
31627366|a|Indolocarbazoles are a family of natural alkaloids characterized by their potent protein kinase and topoisomerase I inhibitory activity. Among them, staurosporine (1) has exhibited promising inhibitory activity against parasites. Based on new insights on the activity and mechanism of action of STS in Acanthamoeba parasites, this work reports the isolation, identification, and the anti-Acanthamoeba activity of the minor metabolites 7-oxostaurosporine (2), 4'-demethylamino-4'-oxostaurosporine (3), and streptocarbazole B (4), isolated from cultures of the mangrove strain Streptomyces sanyensis. A clear correlation between the antiparasitic activities and the structural elements and conformations of the indolocarbazoles 1-4 was observed. Also, the study reveals that 7-oxostaurosporine (2) affects membrane permeability and causes mitochondrial damages on trophozoites of A. castellanii Neff.
