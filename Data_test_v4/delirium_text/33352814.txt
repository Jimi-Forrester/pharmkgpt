33352814|t|New Application of 1,2,4-Triazole Derivatives as Antitubercular Agents. Structure, In Vitro Screening and Docking Studies.
33352814|a|A series of 1,2,4-triazole derivatives were synthesized and assigned as potential anti-tuberculosis substances. The molecular and crystal structures for the model compounds C1, C12, and C13 were determined using X-ray analysis. The X-ray investigation confirmed the synthesis pathway and the assumed molecular structures for analyzed 1,2,4-triazol-5-thione derivatives. The conformational preferences resulting from rotational degrees of freedom of the 1,2,4-triazole ring substituents were characterized. The lipophilicity (logP) and electronic parameters as the energy of frontier orbitals, dipole moments, NBO net charge distribution on the atoms, and electrostatic potential distribution for all structures were calculated at AM1 and DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level. The in vitro test was done against M. tuberculosis H37Ra, M. phlei, M. smegmatis, and M. timereck. The obtained results clearly confirmed the antituberculosis potential of compound C4, which turned out to be the most active against Mycobacterium H37Ra (MIC = 0.976 mug/mL), Mycobaterium pheli (MIC = 7.81 mug/mL) and Mycobacerium timereck (62.6 mug/mL). Satisfactory results were obtained with compounds C8, C11, C14 versus Myc. H37Ra, Myc. pheli, Myc. timereck (MIC = 31.25-62.5 mug/mL). The molecular docking studies were carried out for all investigated compounds using the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cytochrome P450 CYP121 enzyme as molecular a target connected with antimycobacterial activity.
