21422530|t|Induction of the C-terminal proteolytic cleavage of AbetaPP by statins.
21422530|a|Statins are drugs commonly used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis, with the goal of reducing vascular diseases such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Statins have also been suggested as a therapeutic option for Alzheimer's disease (AD), although their benefit in AD remains controversial. We have previously shown that the intracellular C-terminal cleavage of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) is a major contributor to the neuronal toxicity seen in AD, and that this cleavage can be induced by amyloid-beta. We now report that certain brain permeable statins are also able to induce the C-terminal cleavage of AbetaPP and associated cell death, whereas other statins do not. This statin effect on AbetaPP exceeded the effects of all other FDA-approved drugs in a library composed of these compounds, suggesting that this effect on AbetaPP cleavage is unique to a subset of the statins. Furthermore, the greatest effect occurred with cerivastatin, which has previously been shown to be the statin associated with the greatest risk of rhabdomyolysis. These results may have implications for the choice of which statins to evaluate in AD therapeutic trials; furthermore, the results may inform statin choice in individuals who are at high risk for the development of AD, such as those with an apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele.
