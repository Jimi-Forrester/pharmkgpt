39322940|t|Amyloid Fibril Formation on Neuronal Cells in the Coexistence of Abeta40 and Abeta42.
39322940|a|The abnormal aggregation and subsequent deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in the brain are considered central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The two major species of Abeta are Abeta40 and Abeta42, present at an approximate ratio of 9: 1. Accumulating evidence suggests that neuronal membranes are an important platform of amyloidogenesis by Abeta. However, information on the aggregational behaviors of coexistent Abeta40 and Abeta42 on membranes is lacking. In this study, the aggregation and resultant cytotoxicity of coexistent Abeta40 and Abeta42 at a physiologically relevant ratio were investigated by fluorescence techniques. We found that the degree of coexistence of both Abetas in aggregates increased as the assembly proceeded, and reached a maximum in fibrils. However, the cytotoxicity of the mixed fibrils was weaker than that of Abeta42 fibrils, indicating that Abeta40 attenuates the toxicity of Abeta42 by forming mixed fibrils. In contrast, the degree of coexistence was significantly lower in aqueous phase aggregation, highlighting different aggregation mechanisms between in membranes and in the aqueous phase.
