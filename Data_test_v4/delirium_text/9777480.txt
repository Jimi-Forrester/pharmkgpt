9777480|a|Meta-analytic methods were used to determine the sensitivity of neuropsychological, structural, and physiological measures to temporal-hippocampal system function in dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Effect sizes are reported for the California Verbal Learning Test, the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, structural (i.e., magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), and functional (i.e., positron emission tomography [PET], single photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]) neuroimaging methods. Overall, effect sizes from MRI studies are larger than those obtained from SPECT and PET, respectively, but not as large as those obtained from the neuropsychological measures. On the basis of this finding, the neuropsychological and gross pathologic similarities between Alzheimer's disease, other dementing conditions, and mixed dementias, warrants the coupling of neuropsychological evaluation for its sensitivity with neuroimaging visualization for its specificity in improving diagnostic and differential accuracy.
