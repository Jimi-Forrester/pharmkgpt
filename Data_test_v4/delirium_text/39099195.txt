39099195|t|Using Synbiotics as a Therapy to Protect Mental Health in Alzheimer's Disease.
39099195|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that represents a major cause of dementia worldwide. Its pathogenesis involves multiple pathways, including the amyloid cascade, tau protein, oxidative stress, and metal ion dysregulation. Recent studies have suggested a critical link between changes in gut microbial diversity and the disruption of the gut-brain axis in AD. Previous studies primarily explored the potential benefits of probiotics and prebiotics in managing AD. However, studies have yet to fully describe a novel promising approach involving the use of synbiotics, which include a combination of active probiotics and new-generation prebiotics. Synbiotics show potential for mitigating the onset and progression of AD, thereby offering a holistic approach to address the multifaceted nature of AD. This review article primarily aims to gain further insights into the mechanisms of AD, specifically the intricate interaction between gut bacteria and the brain via the gut-brain axis. By understanding this relationship, we can identify potential targets for intervention and therapeutic strategies to combat AD effectively. This review also discusses substantial evidence supporting the role of synbiotics as a promising AD treatment that surpasses traditional probiotic or prebiotic interventions. We find that synbiotics may be used not only to address cognitive decline but also to reduce AD-related psychological burden, thus enhancing the overall quality of life of patients with AD.
