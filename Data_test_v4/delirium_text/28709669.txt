28709669|a|OBJECTIVE: To characterize patients treated with olanzapine pamoate in French centers and investigate the conditions of use of olanzapine pamoate in real-life treatment situation. METHODS: Data came from French sites participating in an international post-authorization safety study. In this observational study, patients diagnosed with schizophrenia were receiving commercially available olanzapine pamoate, in accordance with their physician's usual standard of care. Data were collected during routine visits within the standard course of patient care. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty eight patients (male, 73.9%; mean age, 39.4 years; mean duration of disease, 12.7years) received olanzapine pamoate and were included in the study by 32 investigative psychiatrists distributed across 20 different sites (psychiatric hospitals). During the period of analysis, a total of 2975 injections of olanzapine pamoate was administered to the patients. The mean duration of olanzapine pamoate exposure was 475 days (1.3years). During follow-up, 13.8% of all patients had at least one psychiatric hospitalization, 15.9% had at least one same-day psychiatric hospitalization (information documented for 116patients), and 44.2% received at least one concomitant drug. Three cases of post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome were reported during the analysis period. Treatment emergent adverse events (incidence, 20.3%) were in line with the known profile of olanzapine. CONCLUSION: Patients were administered olanzapine pamoate and monitored in compliance with label recommendations. The safety profile assessment of olanzapine pamoate in actual conditions was consistent with that described in clinical studies.
