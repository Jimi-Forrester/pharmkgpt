2812238|t|Venn diagrams and neuronal vulnerability.
2812238|a|Greenamyre and Young note that there is poor correlation between which hippocampal regions are damaged in Alzheimer's disease and which have the highest concentrations of NMDA receptors. They conclude that EAAs can thus only be necessary, but not sufficient to explain Alzheimer's damage. We note that this is in fact probably the rule rather than the exception: some of the most credible agents which damage neurons are merely necessary, but not sufficient to explain selective neuronal vulnerability.
