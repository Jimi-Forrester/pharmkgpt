30158600|t|Prolyl isomerase Pin1: a promoter of cancer and a target for therapy.
30158600|a|Pin1 is the only known peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) that specifically recognizes and isomerizes the phosphorylated Serine/Threonine-Proline (pSer/Thr-Pro) motif. The Pin1-mediated structural transformation posttranslationally regulates the biofunctions of multiple proteins. Pin1 is involved in many cellular processes, the aberrance of which lead to both degenerative and neoplastic diseases. Pin1 is highly expressed in the majority of cancers and its deficiency significantly suppresses cancer progression. According to the ground-breaking summaries by Hanahan D and Weinberg RA, the hallmarks of cancer comprise ten biological capabilities. Multiple researches illuminated that Pin1 contributes to these aberrant behaviors of cancer via promoting various cancer-driving pathways. This review summarized the detailed mechanisms of Pin1 in different cancer capabilities and certain Pin1-targeted small-molecule compounds that exhibit anticancer activities, expecting to facilitate anticancer therapies by targeting Pin1.
