16988484|a|Aberrant neurite growth is one of the neuropathological signatures of the Alzheimer's disease brain, both around amyloid plaques and in the cortical neuropil. Disruption of neuroinhibitory or repulsive growth and guidance signals, as well as of neurotrophic or permissive signals, may contribute to this dystrophic growth. Hence, therapeutic efforts directed exclusively at restoring neurotrophic activity are unlikely to meet with success. The molecular species responsible for neuroinhibitory effects in the Alzheimer's disease brain are beginning to be elucidated.
