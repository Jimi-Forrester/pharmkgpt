21615891|t|Withdrawal-induced delirium associated with a benzodiazepine switch: a case report.
21615891|a|INTRODUCTION: Introduced in the early 1960s, diazepam remains among the most frequently prescribed benzodiazepine-type sedatives and hypnotics. Patients with chronic use of short-acting benzodiazepines are frequently switched to diazepam because the accumulating, long-acting metabolite, N-desmethyl-diazepam, prevents benzodiazepine-associated withdrawal symptoms, which can occur during trough plasma levels of short-acting benzodiazepines. Although mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms are frequently observed during benzodiazepine switching to diazepam, severe medical complications associated with this treatment approach have thus far not been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old female Caucasian with major depression, alcohol dependence and benzodiazepine dependence was successfully treated for depression and, after lorazepam-assisted alcohol detoxification, was switched from lorazepam to diazepam to facilitate benzodiazepine discontinuation. Subsequent to the benzodiazepine switch, our patient unexpectedly developed an acute delirious state, which quickly remitted after re-administration of lorazepam. A newly diagnosed early form of mixed dementia, combining both vascular and Alzheimer-type lesions, was found as a likely contributing factor for the observed vulnerability to benzodiazepine-induced withdrawal symptoms. CONCLUSION: Chronic use of benzodiazepines is common in the elderly and a switch to diazepam often precedes benzodiazepine discontinuation trials. However, contrary to common clinical practice, benzodiazepine switching to diazepam may require cross-titration with slow tapering of the first benzodiazepine to allow for the build-up of N-desmethyl-diazepam, in order to safely prevent severe withdrawal symptoms. Alternatively, long-term treatment with low doses of benzodiazepines may be considered, especially in elderly patients with chronic use of benzodiazepines and proven vulnerability to benzodiazepine-associated withdrawal symptoms.
