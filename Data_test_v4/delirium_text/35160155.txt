35160155|t|Inflammatory Predictors of Prognosis in Patients with Traumatic Cerebral Haemorrhage: Retrospective Study.
35160155|a|We aimed to evaluate the relationship between neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR), systemic inflammation index (SII), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score in patients with traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage (TICH). We retrospectively investigated 95 patients with TICH hospitalised at the Neurosurgery Department in Zielona Gora from January 2017 to March 2021. Routine blood tests were performed 5 h after injury. NRL and SII were significantly higher in patients with GCS <= 8 than patients with GCS > 8 and exceeded reference values in 95% of patients. GCS was inversely correlated with NLR and SII. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis confirmed the value of NLR and SII regarding GCS score; Area Under the Curve (AUC) 0.748, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.615-0.880. An optimised NLR cut-off value of 0.154 was identified with a sensitivity of 0.90 and specificity of 0.56. The value of SII regarding GCS was confirmed with ROC curves; AUC 0.816, 95% CI 0.696-0.935. An optimised NLR cut-off value of 0.118 was identified with a sensitivity of 0.95 and specificity of 0.57. NLR and SII are significantly related to GCS scores and are promising predictors of clinical prognosis in TICH patients.
