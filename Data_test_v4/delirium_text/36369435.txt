36369435|a|Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) was previously found to show neuroprotective effect on nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) induced signalings. Also, numerous studies reported the emerging roles of long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) involved in neurodegenerative disease. However, the biological mechanism of LPC and expression profile of lncRNAs has not been reported. Here, lncRNAs in PC12 cells under LPC and NGF treatment were analyzed using high throughput sequencing technology for the first time. We identified 564 annotated and 1077 novel lncRNAs in PC12 cells. Among them, 121 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in the PC12 cells under LPC stimulation. KEGG analysis showed that differentially expressed mRNAs co-expressed with lncRNAs mainly enriched in ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease etc. LncRNA-mRNA network analysis showed that lncRNA ENSRNOT00000082515 had interactions with 626 different mRNAs suggesting that lncRNA ENSRNOT00000082515 probably play vital role. Finally, sequencing data were validated by qRT-PCR for ENSRNOT00000084874, ENSRNOT00000082515, LNC_001033 forward Fgf18, Vcam1, and Pck2.
