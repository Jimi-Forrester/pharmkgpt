36935184|t|Evaluation of anticholinergic burden in elderly outpatients and the risk factors.
36935184|a|OBJECTIVES: The use of anticholinergic drugs in the elderly may lead to negative events such as falls, delirium, urinary retention and cognitive decline, and the higher the number of anticholinergic drugs use, the more such negative events occur. This study aims to analyze the risk factors associated with the prescription of total anticholinergic drugs in elderly outpatients and evaluate the rationality of anticholinergic drugs, and to provide a reference for reducing the adverse effects of anticholinergic drugs. METHODS: A list of drugs with anticholinergic activity based on the Beers criteria was established. The basic information (such as age and gender), clinical diagnosis, and medications of elderly outpatient were extracted from hospital electronic medical records, and the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) Scale was used to calculate the anticholinergic burden for each patient. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the potential risk factors for the occurrence of problems such as multiple medication and insomnia. RESULTS: A total of 1 840 prescriptions for elderly patients were reviewed. Of these patients, ACB score was more than or equal to 1 in 648 (35.22%) patients. Number of prescription medication (95% CI: 1.221 to 1.336) and insomnia (95% CI: 3.538 to 6.089) were independent factors affecting ACB scores (both P<0.01). Medications for patients of ACB scores were most commonly treated with the central nervous system drugs (such as alprazolam and eszopiclone) and for the cardiovascular system drugs (such as metoprolol and nifedipine). CONCLUSIONS: There is a high rate of ACB drugs use in geriatric patients, and the clinical focus should be on multiple medication prescriptions, especially on the central nervous system drugs (such as alprazolam and eszopiclone) and cardiovascular system drugs (such as metoprolol and nifedipine). The prescription review should be emphasized to reduce adverse reactions to anticholinergic drugs in elderly patients.
