36062857|a|Progressive degeneration in the morphology and functions of neuronal cells leads to multifactorial pathogenesis conditions of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, nitric oxide toxicity, and neuro-inflammation to mediate heterogeneous types of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Epilepsy, Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD), more prominently among aging populations. In this editorial, complex mechanisms, challenges, and advancements made in the discovery of new neurotherapeutics, as well as designing approaches being adopted to fabricate brain-targeted delivery systems, are discussed.
