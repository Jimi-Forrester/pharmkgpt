35056736|t|High-Efficiency Expression and Purification of DNAJB6b Based on the pH-Modulation of Solubility and Denaturant-Modulation of Size.
35056736|a|The chaperone DNAJB6b delays amyloid formation by suppressing the nucleation of amyloid fibrils and increases the solubility of amyloid-prone proteins. These dual effects on kinetics and equilibrium are related to the unusually high chemical potential of DNAJB6b in solution. As a consequence, the chaperone alone forms highly polydisperse oligomers, whereas in a mixture with an amyloid-forming protein or peptide it may form co-aggregates to gain a reduced chemical potential, thus enabling the amyloid peptide to increase its chemical potential leading to enhanced solubility of the peptide. Understanding such action at the level of molecular driving forces and detailed structures requires access to highly pure and sequence homogeneous DNAJB6b with no sequence extension. We therefore outline here an expression and purification protocol of the protein "as is" with no tags leading to very high levels of pure protein based on its physicochemical properties, including size and charge. The versatility of the protocol is demonstrated through the expression of an isotope labelled protein and seven variants, and the purification of three of these. The activity of the protein is bench-marked using aggregation assays. Two of the variants are used to produce a palette of fluorescent DNAJB6b labelled at an engineered N- or C-terminal cysteine.
