31136894|t|Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of rutacecarpine derivatives as multitarget-directed ligands for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
31136894|a|A series of 3-amino-substituted rutacecarpine derivatives were synthesized to identify novel multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs) for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Biological evaluation showed that most of the synthesized compounds inhibited butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and exerted antioxidant effects. Among the synthesized compounds, 6n was subjected to further biological evaluation. Lineweaver-Burk plotting and molecular modeling illustrated that 6n bound simultaneously to the peripheral anionic site (PAS) and catalytic sites (CAS) of BuChE. Furthermore, 6n modulated Abeta aggregation; chelated biometals; presented good absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity properties; and showed remarkable neuroprotective activity. Previous research has shown that the optimized compound 6n has considerable potential for development as an MTDL for the treatment of AD.
