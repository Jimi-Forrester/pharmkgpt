37513946|t|Interactive Associations between PPARgamma and PPARGC1A and Bisphosphonate-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw in Patients with Osteoporosis.
37513946|a|Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) is a rare but severe adverse effect that can occur as a result of bisphosphonate treatment. This study aimed to examine the relationship between PPARgamma and PPARGC1A polymorphisms and the BRONJ development in female osteoporosis patients undergoing bisphosphonate treatment. We prospectively conducted this nested case-control study at the Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital between 2014 and 2018. We assessed five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PPARgamma and six SNPs of PPARGC1A and performed a multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine the independent risk factors for developing BRONJ. There were a total of 123 patients included in this study and 56 patients (45.5%) developed BRONJ. In the univariate analysis, PPARGC1A rs2946385 and rs10020457 polymorphisms were significantly associated with BRONJ (p = 0.034, p = 0.020, respectively), although the results were not statistically significant in the multivariable analysis. Patients with the combined genotypes of GG in both PPARgamma rs1151999 and PPARGC1A rs2946385 showed a 3.03-fold higher risk of BRONJ compared to individuals with other genotype combinations after adjusting for confounders (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-9.11). Old age (>=70 years) and duration of bisphosphonate use (>=60 months) increased the risk of BRONJ. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the predicted probability was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.69-0.87, p < 0.001), demonstrating a satisfactory level of discriminatory power. Our study elucidated that PPARgamma and PPARGC1A polymorphisms were interactively associated with BRONJ development. These results have potential implications for tailoring personalized treatments for females undergoing bisphosphonate therapy for osteoporosis.
