34959275|a|Natural compounds are emerging as effective agents for the treatment of malignant diseases. The active constituent of alpha-mangostin from the pericarp of Garcinia mangostana L. has earned significant interest as a plant base compound with anticancer properties. Despite alpha-mangostin's superior properties as an anticancer agent, its applications are limited due to its poor solubility and physicochemical stability, rapid systemic clearance, and low cellular uptake. Our review aimed to summarize and discuss the nanoparticle formulations of alpha-mangostin for cancer drug delivery systems from published papers recorded in Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar. We investigated various types of alpha-mangostin nanoformulations to improve its anticancer efficacy by improving bioavailability, cellular uptake, and localization to specific areas These nanoformulations include nanofibers, lipid carrier nanostructures, solid lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, nanomicelles, liposomes, and gold nanoparticles. Notably, polymeric nanoparticles and nanomicelles can increase the accumulation of alpha-mangostin into tumors and inhibit tumor growth in vivo. In addition, polymeric nanoparticles with the addition of target ligands can increase the cellular uptake of alpha-mangostin. In conclusion, nanoformulations of alpha-mangostin are a promising tool to enhance the cellular uptake, accumulation in cancer cells, and the efficacy of alpha-mangostin as a candidate for anticancer drugs.
