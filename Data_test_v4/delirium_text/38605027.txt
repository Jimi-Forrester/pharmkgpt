38605027|a|Deep brain stimulation (DBS) modulates local and widespread connectivity in dysfunctional networks. Positive results are observed in several patient populations; however, the precise mechanisms underlying treatment remain unknown. Translational DBS studies aim to answer these questions and provide knowledge for advancing the field. Here, we systematically review the literature on DBS studies involving models of neurological, developmental and neuropsychiatric disorders to provide a synthesis of the current scientific landscape surrounding this topic. A systematic analysis of the literature was performed following PRISMA guidelines. 407 original articles were included. Data extraction focused on study characteristics, including stimulation protocol, behavioural outcomes, and mechanisms of action. The number of articles published increased over the years, including 16 rat models and 13 mouse models of transgenic or healthy animals exposed to external factors to induce symptoms. Most studies targeted telencephalic structures with varying stimulation settings. Positive behavioural outcomes were reported in 85.8% of the included studies. In models of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, DBS-induced effects were associated with changes in monoamines and neuronal activity along the mesocorticolimbic circuit. For movement disorders, DBS improves symptoms via modulation of the striatal dopaminergic system. In dementia and epilepsy models, changes to cellular and molecular aspects of the hippocampus were shown to underlie symptom improvement. Despite limitations in translating findings from preclinical to clinical settings, rodent studies have contributed substantially to our current knowledge of the pathophysiology of disease and DBS mechanisms. Direct inhibition/excitation of neural activity, whereby DBS modulates pathological oscillatory activity within brain networks, is among the major theories of its mechanism. However, there remain fundamental questions on mechanisms, optimal targets and parameters that need to be better understood to improve this therapy and provide more individualized treatment according to the patient's predominant symptoms.
