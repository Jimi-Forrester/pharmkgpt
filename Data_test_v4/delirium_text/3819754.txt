3819754|t|Do white matter changes on MRI and CT differentiate vascular dementia from Alzheimer's disease?
3819754|a|MRI showed white matter changes in all 29 patients with vascular dementia and in eight out of 22 patients with Alzheimer's disease. The corresponding figures for CT were 26 and 1, respectively. White matter changes are therefore a useful diagnostic aid in the differential diagnosis between vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
