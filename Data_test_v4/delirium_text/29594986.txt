29594986|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, where beta-amyloid (Abeta) plays a key role in forming conglomerated senile plaques. The receptor of advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is considered a therapeutic target since it transports Abeta into the central nervous system, favoring the pathology progression. Due to the lack of effective therapies for AD, several therapeutic approaches are under development, being vaccines considered a promising alternative. Herein, the use of the Algevir system was explored to produce in the Schizochytrium sp. microalga the LTB:RAGE vaccine candidate. Algevir relies in an inducible geminiviral vector and led to yields of up to 380 microg LTB:RAGE/g fresh weight biomass at 48-h post-induction. The Schizochytrium-produced LTB:RAGE vaccine retained its antigenic activity and was highly stable up to temperatures of 60  C. These data demonstrate the potential of Schizochytrium sp. as a platform for high production of thermostable recombinant antigens useful for vaccination against AD.
