37108211|t|Vascular Dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease: Alterations in the Plasma Contact and Fibrinolytic Systems.
37108211|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting millions of people worldwide. The classical hallmarks of AD include extracellular beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles, although they are often accompanied by various vascular defects. These changes include damage to the vasculature, a decrease in cerebral blood flow, and accumulation of Abeta along vessels, among others. Vascular dysfunction begins early in disease pathogenesis and may contribute to disease progression and cognitive dysfunction. In addition, patients with AD exhibit alterations in the plasma contact system and the fibrinolytic system, two pathways in the blood that regulate clotting and inflammation. Here, we explain the clinical manifestations of vascular deficits in AD. Further, we describe how changes in plasma contact activation and the fibrinolytic system may contribute to vascular dysfunction, inflammation, coagulation, and cognitive impairment in AD. Given this evidence, we propose novel therapies that may, alone or in combination, ameliorate AD progression in patients.
