36944398|a|The gamma-secretase complex catalyzes the intramembrane cleavage of C99, a carboxy-terminal fragment of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Two paralogs of its catalytic subunit presenilin (PS1 and PS2) are expressed which are autocatalytically cleaved into an N-terminal and a C-terminal fragment (NTF, CTF) during maturation of gamma-secretase. In this study, we compared the efficiency and specificity of C99 cleavage by PS1- and PS2-containing gamma-secretases. Mass spectrometric analysis of cleavage products obtained in cell-free and cell-based assays revealed that the previously described lower Abeta38 generation by PS2 is accompanied by a reciprocal increase in Abeta37 production. We further found PS1 and PS2 to show different preferences in the choice of the initial cleavage site of C99. However, the differences in Abeta38 and Abeta37 generation appear to mainly result from altered subsequent stepwise cleavage of Abeta peptides. Apart from these differences in cleavage specificity, we confirmed a lower efficiency of initial C99 cleavage by PS2 using a detergent-solubilized gamma-secretase system. By investigating chimeric PS1/2 molecules we show that the membrane-embedded, non-conserved residues of the NTF mainly account for the differential cleavage efficiency and specificity of both presenilins. At the level of individual transmembrane domains (TMDs), TMD3 was identified as a major modulator of initial cleavage site specificity. The efficiency of endoproteolysis strongly depends on non-conserved TMD6 residues at the interface to TM2, i.e., at a putative gate of substrate entry. Taken together, our results highlight the role of individual presenilin TMDs in the cleavage of C99 and the generation of Abeta peptides.
