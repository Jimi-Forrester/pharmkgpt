27566070|t|Natural Compounds and Neuroprotection: Mechanisms of Action and Novel Delivery Systems.
27566070|a|Neurodegeneration characterizes pathologic conditions, ranging from Alzheimer's disease to glaucoma, with devastating social and economic effects. It is a complex process implicating a series of molecular and cellular events, such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein misfolding, excitotoxicity and inflammation. Natural compounds, because of their broad spectrum of pharmacological and biological activities, could be possible candidates for the management of such multifactorial morbidities. However, their therapeutic potential against neurodegenerative diseases has been hampered by their poor bioavailability and subsequent insufficient delivery to the brain. This article provides an overview of the molecular mechanisms through which natural compounds exert their neuroprotective effects, as well as the development of novel natural compound-loaded delivery systems that could improve their neuroavailability.
