38866655|t|The pattern of cortical thickness associated with executive dysfunction in MCI and SCC: The MEMENTO cohort.
38866655|a|BACKGROUND: The association between the pattern of cortical thickness (CT) and executive dysfunction (ED) in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) is still poorly understood. We aimed to investigate the association between CT and ED in a large French cohort (MEMENTO) of 2323 participants with MCI or SCC. METHODS: All participants with available CT and executive function data (verbal fluency and Trail Making Test [TMT]) were selected (n=1924). Linear regressions were performed to determine relationships between executive performance and the brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) and CT using FreeSurfer. RESULTS: The global executive function score was related to the BPF (sss: 0.091, P<0.001) and CT in the right supramarginal (sss: 0.060, P=0.041) and right isthmus cingulate (sss: 0.062, P=0.011) regions. Literal verbal fluency was related to the BPF (sss: 0.125, P<0.001) and CT in the left parsorbitalis region (sss: 0.045, P=0.045). Semantic verbal fluency was related to the BPF (sss: 0.101, P<0.001) and CT in the right supramarginal region (sss: 0.061, P=0.042). The time difference between the TMT parts B and A was related to the BPF (sss: 0.048, P=0.045) and CT in the right precuneus (sss: 0.073, P=0.019) and right isthmus cingulate region (sss: 0.054, P=0.032). CONCLUSIONS: In a large clinically based cohort of participants presenting with either MCI or SCC (a potential early stage of Alzheimer's disease [AD]), ED was related to the BPF and CT in the left pars orbitalis, right precuneus, right supramarginal, and right isthmus cingulate regions. This pattern of lesions adds knowledge to the conventional anatomy of ED and could contribute to the early diagnosis of AD.
