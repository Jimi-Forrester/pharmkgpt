36093697|t|Hyperorality in Frontotemporal Dementia: Cognitive and Psychiatric Symptom Profiles in Early-Stage Disease.
36093697|a|Hyperorality is a distinctive feature of the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), but little is known about its significance in early-stage disease. This study examined the cognitive and psychiatric symptom profiles associated with hyperorality, using data from subjects with early-stage bvFTD enrolled in Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers. We found that hyperorality was not associated with cognitive performance, but was associated with psychosis, elation, and disinhibition. Hyperorality may share neurobiology with a subset of early psychiatric symptoms, a finding which could help identify targets for future treatment.
