38159060|a|INTRODUCTION: The implications of positive tau positron emission tomography (T) with negative beta amyloid positron emission tomography (A) are not well understood. We investigated cognitive performance in participants who were T+ but A-. METHODS: We evaluated 98 participants from the Mayo Clinic who were T+ and A-. Participants were matched 2:1 to A- and T- cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls. Cognitive test scores were compared between different groups. RESULTS: The A-T+ group demonstrated lower performance than the A-T- group on the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) (p < 0.001), Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory I (p < 0.001) and Logical Memory II (p < 0.001), Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) delayed recall (p = 0.004), category fluency (animals p = 0.005; vegetables p = 0.021), Trail Making Test A and B (p < 0.001), and others. There were no significant differences in demographic features or apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 genotype between CU A-T+ and CI A-T+. DISCUSSION: A-T+ participants show an association with lower cognitive performance.
