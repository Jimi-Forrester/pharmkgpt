35779816|t|Tissue repair strategies: What we have learned from COVID-19 in the application of MSCs therapy.
35779816|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection evokes severe proinflammatory storm and pulmonary infection with the number of confirmed cases (more than 200 million) and mortality (5 million) continue to surge globally. A number of vaccines (e.g., Moderna, Pfizer, Johnson/Janssen and AstraZeneca vaccines) have been developed over the past two years to restrain the rapid spread of COVID-19. However, without much of effective drug therapies, COVID-19 continues to cause multiple irreversible organ injuries and is drawing intensive attention for cell therapy in the management of organ damage in this devastating COVID-19 pandemic. For example, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have exhibited promising results in COVID-19 patients. Preclinical and clinical findings have favored the utility of stem cells in the management of COVID-19-induced adverse outcomes via inhibition of cytokine storm and hyperinflammatory syndrome with coinstantaneous tissue regeneration capacity. In this review, we will discuss the existing data with regards to application of stem cells for COVID-19.
