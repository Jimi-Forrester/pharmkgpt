35662001|a|Cytokine storms and extra-activated cytokine signaling pathways can lead to severe tissue damage and patient death. Activation of inflammatory signaling pathways during Cytokine storms are an important factor in the development of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), which is the major health problem today, causing systemic and local inflammation. Cytokine storms attract many inflammatory cells that attack the lungs and other organs and cause tissue damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are expressed in a different type of tissues. inhibition of ACE2 activity impairs renin-angiotensin (RAS) function, which is related to the severity of symptoms and mortality rate in COVID-19 patients. Different signaling cascades are activated, affecting various organs during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nowadays, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19, but scientists have recognized and proposed several treatment alternatives, including applying cytokine inhibitors, immunomodulators, and plasma therapy. Herein, we have provided the detailed mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine signaling and its connection with pathophysiological features in different organs. Possible treatment options to cope with the severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are also discussed.
