32535658|a|MAIN CONCLUSION: Nitro/oxidative modifications of proteins and RNA nitration resulted from altered peroxynitrite generation are elements of the indirect mode of action of canavanine and meta-tyrosine in plants Environmental conditions and stresses, including supplementation with toxic compounds, are known to impair reactive oxygen (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) homeostasis, leading to modification in production of oxidized and nitrated derivatives. The role of nitrated and/or oxidized biotargets differs depending on the stress factors and developmental stage of plants. Canavanine (CAN) and meta-tyrosine (m-Tyr) are non-proteinogenic amino acids (NPAAs). CAN, the structural analog of arginine, is found mostly in seeds of Fabaceae species, as a storage form of nitrogen. In mammalian cells, CAN is used as an anticancer agent due to its inhibitory action on nitric oxide synthesis. m-Tyr is a structural analogue of phenylalanine and an allelochemical found in root exudates of fescues. In animals, m-Tyr is recognized as a marker of oxidative stress. Supplementation of plants with CAN or m-Tyr modify ROS and RNS metabolism. Over the last few years of our research, we have collected the complex data on ROS and RNS metabolism in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) plants exposed to CAN or m-Tyr. In addition, we have shown the level of nitrated RNA (8-Nitro-guanine) in roots of seedlings, stressed by the tested NPAAs. In this review, we describe the model of CAN and m-Tyr mode of action in plants based on modifications of signaling pathways induced by ROS/RNS with a special focus on peroxynitrite induced RNA and protein modifications.
