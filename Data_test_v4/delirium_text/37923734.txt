37923734|t|GRSF1 antagonizes age-associated hypercoagulability via modulation of fibrinogen mRNA stability.
37923734|a|Age-associated hypercoagulability is accompanied by the increase of plasma levels of some coagulation factors including fibrinogen which may contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thrombotic diseases in elderly people. However, the underlying mechanism of increased plasma fibrinogen concentration during aging is still elusive. GRSF1 belongs to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins F/H (hnRNP F/H) subfamily. Here, we report that GRSF1 attenuates hypercoagulability via negative modulation of fibrinogen expression. We demonstrated that GRSF1 negatively regulated fibrinogen expression at both mRNA and protein levels. GRSF1 directly interacted with the coding region (CDS) of FGA, FGB, and FGG mRNAs, and decreased their stability thus mitigating fibrinogen expression. We further identified that only a few G-tracts within the Fib C domain of FGA, FGB, and FGG CDS and the qRRM2 domain of GRSF1 were required for their interaction. Moreover, we confirmed hypercoagulability and the decrease of GRSF1 expression level during mice aging. Functionally, GRSF1 overexpression in old mice liver decreased fibrinogen plasma level, reduced hypercoagulability, and mitigated blood coagulation activity, whereas GRSF1 knockdown in young mice liver increased fibrinogen plasma level and promoted blood coagulation activity. Collectively, our findings unveil a novel posttranscriptional regulation of fibrinogen by GRSF1 and uncover a critical role of GRSF1 in regulating blood coagulation activity.
