30131337|t|A d-enantiomeric peptide interferes with heteroassociation of amyloid-beta oligomers and prion protein.
30131337|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. One AD hallmark is the aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) into soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils. Several studies have reported that oligomers rather than fibrils are the most toxic species in AD progression. Abeta oligomers bind with high affinity to membrane-associated prion protein (PrP), leading to toxic signaling across the cell membrane, which makes the Abeta-PrP interaction an attractive therapeutic target. Here, probing this interaction in more detail, we found that both full-length, soluble human (hu) PrP(23-230) and huPrP(23-144), lacking the globular C-terminal domain, bind to Abeta oligomers to form large complexes above the megadalton size range. Following purification by sucrose density-gradient ultracentrifugation, the Abeta and huPrP contents in these heteroassemblies were quantified by reversed-phase HPLC. The Abeta:PrP molar ratio in these assemblies exhibited some limited variation depending on the molar ratio of the initial mixture. Specifically, a molar ratio of about four Abeta to one huPrP in the presence of an excess of huPrP(23-230) or huPrP(23-144) suggested that four Abeta units are required to form one huPrP-binding site. Of note, an Abeta-binding all-d-enantiomeric peptide, RD2D3, competed with huPrP for Abeta oligomers and interfered with Abeta-PrP heteroassembly in a concentration-dependent manner. Our results highlight the importance of multivalent epitopes on Abeta oligomers for Abeta-PrP interactions and have yielded an all-d-peptide-based, therapeutically promising agent that competes with PrP for these interactions.
