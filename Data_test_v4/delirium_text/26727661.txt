26727661|t|FTO modulates fibrogenic responses in obstructive nephropathy.
26727661|a|Genome-wide association studies have shown that variants in fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene are robustly associated with body mass index and obesity. These FTO variants are also associated with end stage renal disease and all-cause mortality in chronic kidney diseases. However, the exact role of FTO in kidneys is currently unknown. Here we show that FTO expression is increased after ureteral obstruction and renal fibrosis. Deficiency of the FTO gene attenuates the fibrogenic responses induced by ureteral obstruction in the kidney. Renal tubular cells deficient of FTO produce less alpha-SMA after TGF-beta stimulation. FTO is indispensable for the extracellular matrix synthesis after ureteral obstruction in kidneys. Indeed, global gene transcriptions amplitude is reduced in FTO deficient kidneys after ureteral obstruction. These data establish the importance of FTO in renal fibrosis, which may have potential therapeutic implications.
