38790985|a|The synergic role of vitamin D and the intestinal microbiota in the regulation of the immune system has been thoroughly described in the literature. Vitamin D deficiency and intestinal dysbiosis have shown a pathogenetic role in the development of numerous immune-mediated and allergic diseases. The physiological processes underlying aging and sex have proven to be capable of having a negative influence both on vitamin D values and the biodiversity of the microbiome. This leads to a global increase in levels of systemic inflammatory markers, with potential implications for all immune-mediated diseases and allergic conditions. Our review aims to collect and analyze the relationship between vitamin D and the intestinal microbiome with the immune system and the diseases associated with it, emphasizing the effect mediated by sexual hormones and aging.
