28984594|t|Alzheimer's Disease: The Alternative Serotonergic Hypothesis of Cognitive Decline.
28984594|a|The pathognomonic feature of Alzheimer's disease is a loss of declarative memory. This has generally been attributed to early involvement of medial temporal lobe structures with neurofibrillary tangles and loss of neurons in the entorhinal cortex. However, there has been a re-emerging emphasis on the causal role of brainstem monoaminergic nuclei as involvement of the cholinergic basal forebrain loses prominence. The rejection of this latter theory of cognitive decline is related to inconsistencies in time course and modest effects of treatment using cholinergic agents. The amyloid hypothesis of cortical dysfunction is also losing favor as current trials of plaque dissolution are proving again disappointing. Recent pre-clinical studies on APP/PS1 (familial Alzheimer's disease) transgenic mouse models using serotonergic receptor modulating agents, demonstrate clear neuroprotective effects. The involvement of midbrain raphe in the earliest stages of dementia requires a reassessment of relevant pathophysiology beyond behavioral and affective dimensions. Indeed, a theory of serotonergic modulation of explicit memory formation by direct enhancement of synaptic strength could change the view of the role of these nuclei in AD and lead to more effective treatments.
