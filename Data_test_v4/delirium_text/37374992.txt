37374992|a|The human gut, required for ingesting and processing food, extracting nutrients, and excreting waste, is made up of not just human tissue but also trillions of microbes that are responsible for many health-promoting functions. However, this gut microbiome is also associated with multiple diseases and negative health outcomes, many of which do not have a cure or treatment. One potential mechanism to alleviate these negative health effects caused by the microbiome is the use of microbiome transplants. Here, we briefly review the gut's functional relationships in laboratory model systems and humans, with a focus on the different diseases they directly affect. We then provide an overview of the history of microbiome transplants and their use in multiple diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, as well as Clostridioides difficile infections, and irritable bowel syndrome. We finally provide insights into areas of research in which microbiome transplant research is lacking, but that simultaneously may provide significant health improvements, including age-related neurodegenerative diseases.
