39002091|t|MAMs and Mitochondrial Quality Control: Overview and Their Role in Alzheimer's Disease.
39002091|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most widespread neurodegenerative disorder, distinguished by a gradual onset and slow progression, presenting a substantial challenge to global public health. The mitochondrial-associated membrane (MAMs) functions as a crucial center for signal transduction and material transport between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, playing a pivotal role in various pathological mechanisms of AD. The dysregulation of mitochondrial quality control systems is considered a fundamental factor in the development of AD, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent neurodegenerative events. Recent studies have emphasized the role of MAMs in regulating mitochondrial quality control. This review will delve into the molecular mechanisms underlying the imbalance in mitochondrial quality control in AD and provide a comprehensive overview of the role of MAMs in regulating mitochondrial quality control.
