2030370|a|In 12 ambulant patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease, a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 100 mg/day tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA) and 10 g/day lecithin is reported. The aim of the study was to find whether treatment would result in an improvement of cognition, of functioning in daily life, decrease of behavioural disturbances, and decrease in burden experienced by the carers. Two of the six THA-treated patients demonstrated an increase on cognitive test scores with a moderate increase in the other outcome measurements. There was, however, no difference between the two groups in any outcome measurement after treatment. In addition, we found a reversible rise of liver transaminases in 4 of 6 patients in the treated group. This pilot study is too small to draw definite conclusions on the use of THA alone or in combination with lecithin. Our results suggest, however, that semi-structured interviews with the carers may be of value in the evaluation of treatment effects in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
