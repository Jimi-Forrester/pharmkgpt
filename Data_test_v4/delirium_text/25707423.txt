25707423|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral ischemia and accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) are major risk factors for the development of dementia, including vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Cilostazol, an antiplatelet drug, has been shown to improve cerebral circulation and reduce accumulation of Abeta. In this study, the long-term effect of cilostazol on cognitive function was investigated retrospectively. METHODS: Medical records at Sumotoitsuki Hospital were surveyed to find all patients treated with cilostazol and evaluated by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) during at least two visits separated by an interval of more than 6 months. Patients receiving anti-dementia drugs were excluded. Temporal changes in MMSE scores were compared between patients treated with cilostazol (n = 70) and those who ceased administration of this drug (n = 22). The mean follow-up period was 691 days. RESULTS: Decrease in MMSE score was significantly ameliorated by administration of cilostazol. Subgroup analysis revealed that cilostazol significantly improved MMSE score in patients with mild cognitive impairment, though no significant effect was observed in patients with normal cognitive function or dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are limitations to such a retrospective study, these results significantly encourage undertaking a prospective cohort study to determine the effect of cilostazol on mild cognitive impairment where no treatments currently exist.
