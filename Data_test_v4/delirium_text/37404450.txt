37404450|t|Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients infected by the Omicron variants in Macao, China: A cross-sectional study.
37404450|a|Background and Aims: The evolving mutants of SARS-CoV-2 have made the COVID-19 pandemic sustained for over 3 years. In 2022, BA.4 and BA.5 were the Omicron variants dominating the spread globally. Although COVID-19 was no longer a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as announced by WHO, the SARS-CoV-2 variants remain a challenge to global healthcare under the circumstances of withdrawal and loosening of personal protective behavior in the post-quarantine era. This study aims to acknowledge the clinical characteristics caused by Omicron BA.4/BA.5 in COVID-19 naive people and analyze possible factors affecting disease severities. Methods: In this retrospective study, we report and analyze the clinical features of 1820 COVID-19 patients infected with the BA.4/BA.5 Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 during a local outbreak that occurred in Macao SAR, China, from June to July 2022. Results: A total of 83.5% of patients were symptomatic eventually. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and sore throat. Hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus were the leading comorbidities. There were significantly more elderly patients (p < 0.001), more patients with comorbidity (p < 0.001) and more patients without vaccination or not completing the series (p < 0.001) in the "Severe to Critical" group. All deceased patients were elderly with at least three comorbidities and were partial to totally dependent in their daily lives. Conclusion: Our data are consistent with a milder disease caused by BA.4/5 Omicron variants in the general population, while patients with old age and comorbidities have developed severe to critical diseases. Complete vaccination series and booster doses are effective strategies to reinforce protection against severe diseases and avoid mortality.
