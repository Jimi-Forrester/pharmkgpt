34925212|t|Total Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Burden on MRI Correlates With Cognitive Impairment in Outpatients With Amnestic Disorders.
34925212|a|Objectives: The main markers of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) on MRI may be entered into a scoring system, with the total score representing the overall burden of cSVD. An association between total cSVD score and cognitive dysfunction has been reported in several cohorts. The present study aimed to investigate this association in outpatients with amnestic disorders. Materials and Methods: Outpatients with amnestic complaints in a memory clinic (n = 289) were recruited retrospectively. All the patients had undergone clinical and cognitive evaluation at first presentation. Cognitive function was assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale. The total cSVD score was based on the following markers on MRI: lacune; white matter hyperintensities, microbleed, and enlarged perivascular spaces. The association between total cSVD score and MoCA score was tested via Spearman's analysis and a linear regression model. Results: Among the 289 patients, rates for 0-4 cSVD markers respectively ranged from 30.4 to 2.8%. A multiple linear regression model revealed an inverse correlation between the total cSVD score and MoCA score. The association remained significant after adjusting for gender, age, education, levels of medial temporal lobe atrophy, and classical vascular risk factors [beta = -0.729, 95% CI (-1.244, -0.213); P = 0.006]. When individual markers were individually analyzed after adjusting for the same factors, only microbleed associated with MoCA score [beta = -3.007, 95% CI (-4.533, -1.480), P < 0.001]. Conclusions: A significant association was demonstrated between total cSVD score and cognitive performance in the outpatients with amnestic disorders.
