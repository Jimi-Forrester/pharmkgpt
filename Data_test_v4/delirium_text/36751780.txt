36751780|t|The role of purinergic receptors in neural repair and regeneration after spinal cord injury.
36751780|a|Spinal cord injury is a serious injury of the central nervous system that results in neurological deficits. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying spinal cord injury, as well as the mechanisms involved in neural repair and regeneration, are highly complex. Although there have been many studies on these mechanisms, there is no effective intervention for such injury. In spinal cord injury, neural repair and regeneration is an important part of improving neurological function after injury, although the low regenerative ability of nerve cells and the difficulty in axonal and myelin regeneration after spinal cord injury hamper functional recovery. Large amounts of ATP and its metabolites are released after spinal cord injury and participate in various aspects of functional regulation by acting on purinergic receptors which are widely expressed in the spinal cord. These processes mediate intracellular and extracellular signalling pathways to improve neural repair and regeneration after spinal cord injury. This article reviews research on the mechanistic roles of purinergic receptors in spinal cord injury, highlighting the potential role of purinergic receptors as interventional targets for neural repair and regeneration after spinal cord injury.
