26708495|t|Reflexivity and exploring the meaning of delirium through media depictions: Methodological insights from a phenomenological study.
26708495|a|In the course of a phenomenological study that explored the experiences of family members during their older loved one's delirium, a range of delirium experiences depicted in artistic, creative, and linguistic media were reviewed. The search for, and compilation of, media sources for reflection during data analysis is described in this paper. In doing so, the researcher reveals how attentiveness and openness to varied depictions of lived experiences, as well as a valuing attitude toward challenging subjective perspectives, can enhance researcher reflexivity and appreciation of interpretive meanings. Turning to media depictions of delirium offered alternative perspectives on the experience. It challenged the researcher's assumptions, enhanced phenomenological reflection, promoted critique of evolving interpretations, and suggested meanings that might not have otherwise been realized. The approach used is a potent, although often overlooked, way to differentiate the nature of phenomena shared through lived experience data. Media-based methods and their use in phenomenology continue to be explored. Illustrations of how to integrate media sources, as well as discussion about the benefits and alternatives to more common uses, are needed.
