37546648|t|Enterobacter hormaechei-Driven Novel Biosynthesis of Tin Oxide Nanoparticles and Evaluation of Their Anti-aging, Cytotoxic, and Enzyme Inhibition Potential.
37546648|a|Nanotechnology is a research hotspot that has gained considerable interest due to its potential inferences in the bioscience, medical, and engineering disciplines. The present study uses biomass from the Enterobacter hormaechei EAF63 strain to create bio-inspired metallic tin oxide nanoparticles (SnO2 NPs). The biosynthesized NPs were extensively analyzed using UV spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) techniques. The identification of the crystalline phase was confirmed by XRD. The SEM technique elucidated the morphological characteristics and size of SnO2 NPs. SEM investigation revealed that the SnO2 NPs have a size of 10 nm with spherical morphology. The capping of NPs was confirmed by FTIR analysis that revealed the presence of different compounds found in the biomass of the E. hormaechei EAF63 strain. Later, EDX confirmed the elemental composition of NPs. Moreover, the synthesized SnO2 NPs were employed for important applications including anti-aging, anti-Alzheimer's, anti-inflammatory, anti-larvicidal, and antibacterial action against sinusitis pathogens. The highest value was observed for Streptococcus pyogenes (19.75 +- 0.46), followed by Moraxella catarrhalis (17.49 +- 0.82) and Haemophilus influenzae (15.31 +- 0.73), respectively. Among the used concentrations, the highest inhibition of 76.8 +- 0.93 for 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX) was observed at 400 mug/mL, followed by 67.4 +- 0.91 for cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1). So, as an outcome, E. hormaechei-mediated SnO2 NPs might be considered as the safe and effective nanoplatforms for multifunctional biological applications in the field of nanomedicine.
