7478265|t|Is the clustering of beta-amyloid (A beta) deposits in the frontal cortex of Alzheimer patients determined by blood vessels?
7478265|a|The clustering pattern of diffuse, primitive and classic beta-amyloid (A beta) deposits was studied in the upper laminae of the frontal cortex of 9 patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). A beta stained tissue was counterstained with collagen type IV antiserum to determine whether the clusters of A beta deposits were related to blood vessels. In all patients, A beta deposits and blood vessels were clustered, with in many patients, a regular periodicity of clusters along the cortex parallel to the pia. The classic A beta deposit clusters coincided with those of the larger blood vessels in all patients and with clusters of smaller blood vessels in 4 patients. Diffuse deposit clusters were related to blood vessels in 3 patients. Primitive deposit clusters were either unrelated to or negatively correlated with the blood vessels in six patients. Hence, A beta deposit subtypes differ in their relationship to blood vessels. The data suggest a direct and specific role for the larger blood vessels in the formation of amyloid cores in AD.
