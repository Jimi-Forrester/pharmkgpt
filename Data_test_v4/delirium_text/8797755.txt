8797755|t|Seasonal incidence of insect stings: autumn 'yellow jacket delirium'.
8797755|a|BACKGROUND: Insect stings are a common injury. One of the most important aspects of stings is prevention through patient awareness. Little is known, however, about when most stings occur. This study was designed to define the seasonal pattern of stings. METHODS: A retrospective review of the sting activity at a large emergency department (over 40,000 visits annually) was conducted for a 5-year period from 1991 to 1996. The clinical/financial data system identified 449 sting victims during this period. The average rate of stings was calculated for each month of the year. RESULTS: The 2 months with the highest sting rates were August and September. The monthly sting rates in late summer and autumn were significantly higher than for late spring and summer (P = .002). Sting rates in other months were much lower. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the highest incidence of stings occurs in late summer and early autumn. This is when yellow jacket "delirium" occurs, in preparation for cold weather. If studies in other settings confirm this pattern, the information can be used in modifying behavior to prevent stings.
