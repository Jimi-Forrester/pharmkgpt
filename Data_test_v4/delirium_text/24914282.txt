24914282|a|BACKGROUND: Cynanchum paniculatum, belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is used to treat various diseases, such as invigorate blood, alleviate edema and to relieve pain and toxicity for a long time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 4,5-Dimethoxypyrocatechol was isolated from the 80% methanol extract of C. paniculatum and its neuroprotective effect was evaluated by MTT assay. RESULTS: 4,5-Dimethoxypyrocatechol had neuroprotective effect on the glutamate-induced cellular oxidative death in HT22 cells. CONCLUSION: Furthermore, we found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and calcium concentration by oxidative stress were reduced by 4,5-dimethoxypyrocatechol in HT22 cells.
