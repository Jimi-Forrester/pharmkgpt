34484330|a|BACKGROUND: The role of ABL1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unclear. Therefore, this study aims to explore the potential role of ABL1 in the progression of HCC using bioinformatics methods. METHODS: We analyzed the expression, prognostic potential, and immune cell effect of ABL1 in HCC by using a variety of datasets. RESULTS: ABL1 is highly expressed in HCC and associated with unfavorable overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Functional network analysis revealed that ABL1 plays an important role in mitochondrial activity, ATP metabolism, protein translation and metabolism, various neurological diseases, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and notch signaling pathway. In addition, we found that ABL1 expression was closely correlated with B cells, CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. Furthermore, ABL1 expression was positively associated with the expression levels of immune checkpoint genes, such as PD-1L, TIM3, TIGIT, and CTLA4. CONCLUSION: ABL1 is associated with immune infiltration and prognosis of HCC.
