39800397|t|Brain health in Norwegian female former top-level football players: a protocol for a longitudinal cohort study.
39800397|a|INTRODUCTION: Repetitive head impacts (RHI) in sports may represent a risk factor for long-term cognitive and neurological sequelae. Recent studies have identified an association between playing football at the top level and an elevated risk of cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disease. However, these were conducted on men, and there is a knowledge gap regarding these risks in female athletes. This study aims to investigate the effect of head impacts on brain health in female former top-level football players. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a prospective cohort study, enroling female former football players and top-level athletes from sports without an inherent risk of RHI. All participants are born in 1980 or earlier. We plan to perform follow-up assessments at least three times over 20 years.The protocol includes neurocognitive assessments, self-reported neurocognitive outcomes, neurological examination, advanced brain MRI, and fluid biomarkers. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the South-East Regional Ethics Committee for Medical Research in Norway (2023/178330) and the Norwegian Agency for Shared Services in Education and Research (SIKT). A Data Protection Impact Assessment was developed by the research group and approved by SIKT and the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences. We will disseminate the results through peer-reviewed publications, academic conference presentations and webinars. We will communicate with the public and key stakeholders in football worldwide to inform and promote the development and implementation of potential preventive measures based on our study findings.
