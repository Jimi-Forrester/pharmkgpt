37777185|a|INTRODUCTION: Cytomegalovirus end-organ-disease (CMV EOD) is still a major cause of debilitating illness in people living with HIV, especially in developing countries. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of preemptive therapy against CMV EOD in HIV-positive adults with CMV viremia. METHODS: Systematic review of clinical trials by searching electronic databases and clinical trial registries, screening and selection of references, data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. The results were presented in a narrative synthesis. Aggregated analyzes for dichotomous outcomes were reported as odds ratios with 95 % Confidence Intervals. RESULTS: Four RTC were included. A reduction in the risk of CMV EOD with preemptive therapy was found OR=0.49 (95 % CI 0.31-0.76). We did not identify significant differences for all-cause mortality, adverse events, and withdrawal of the therapy secondary to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Preemptive therapy could be a potential option for preventing CMV EOD in people living with HIV.
