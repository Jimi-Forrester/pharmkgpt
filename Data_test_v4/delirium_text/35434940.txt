35434940|a|BACKGROUND: Aging-associated frailty has been connected to low-grade chronic inflammation and also to progressive monocytic activation. CD36 (cluster of differentiation 36, platelet glycoprotein 4 or fatty acid translocase) has been shown to induce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and to activate macrophage connected inflammation. This study aims to examine whether the expression of CD36 is up-regulated among frail older adults. METHODS: The demographic data, Fried Frailty Index, metabolic and inflammatory parameters of our observational study were obtained from the comprehensive geriatric assessment programme of a hospital-based outpatient department. The mRNA isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was used to determine the levels of CD36, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and CXC chemokine ligand-10 (CXCL10) mRNAs with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: A total of 189 older adults (58% female) were included in the analysis, and the mean age was 77.19 +- 6.12 years. The numbers of participants who fitted in the groups of robust, pre-frail, and frail were 46, 106, and 37, respectively. Our data showed that CD36 mRNA expression levels in PBMCs were the highest in the frail group (1.25 +- 0.53 in robust, 2.13 +- 1.02 in pre-frail, and 2.78 +- 1.15 in frail group, P < 0.001). Further regression analyses revealed that CD36 mRNA levels were positively correlated with both the pre-frail and frailty status in the univariate analysis (both P's < 0.001). What might suggest something worthy of further investigation is that, with potential confounders being adjusted for, CD36 remained as an independent factor that positively correlated with the pre-frail and frailty status in the multivariable analysis (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CD36 mRNA levels in PBMCs in robust older adults are significantly lower than in pre-frail and in frail. Our findings suggest that CD36 mRNA levels in PBMCs may be considered a potential biomarker for frail severity.
