31607783|a|Given current lack of therapies for dementia, there is substantial interest in identifying potentially modifiable risk factors. Clarifying the potential of these factors to mitigate risk as well as determining the mechanisms that link these factors to dementia is expected to lead to new approaches for both preventing and treating neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease. Modifiable factors include cardiovascular risks as well as related lifestyle-centric factors such as diet and physical activity (reviewed in this issue). Given reports that type 2 diabetes and associated features increase the risk for developing dementia, there has been tremendous interest in exploring whether use of antidiabetic medications may impact the risk of dementia, as well as whether antidiabetic medications could be used to prevent or treat dementia, particularly Alzheimer disease. This review will briefly cover the known links between diabetes and risk for dementia, the state of evidence linking antidiabetic treatments with either protection against dementia or possibly increased risk for cognitive dysfunction, and provide a brief overview of what has been learned from clinical trials testing antidiabetic treatments in Alzheimer disease.
