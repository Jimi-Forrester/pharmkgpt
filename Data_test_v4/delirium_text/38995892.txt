38995892|a|There is limited investigation about psychiatric symptoms experienced by older adults with mental health conditions or neurocognitive ones residing in a skilled nursing facility during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this descriptive-design study was to describe the psychiatric symptoms from the year before COVID-19 pandemic to the 1st year of the pandemic for older adults with a mental health condition or a neurocognitive one residing in a skilled nursing facility. A database (n = 84) was established from the extraction of already collected data on the assessment of older adults (n = 84) with mental health conditions or neurocognitive ones living in one skilled nursing facility. The timeframe was from March 1, 2019 to February 28, 2021, eight quarters of extracted data. Psychiatric symptoms were impaired decision making, altered level of consciousness, disorganized thinking, understanding or comprehension, disruptive behaviors, delirium, delusions, hallucinations, inattentiveness, impaired cognition, and depression. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Participants had a mean age of 74.2 +- 10.8. A description of the psychiatric symptoms over the 2 years was a decrease in the level of understanding along with an increase in delusions, disruptive behaviors (physical and verbal), impaired decision making, cognitive impairment, and inattentiveness. The findings focus on the description of the psychiatric symptoms associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings relate to the first step to address a gap in the literature about psychiatric symptoms and COVID-19 for nursing home residents. Future longitudinal and multisite studies are warranted to expound on these findings and the described psychiatric symptoms over time.
