34240555|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily caused by accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide extracellularly and neurofibrillary tangles intracellularly. Recently, it has been shown that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysregulation play an important role in pathology of AD. Therefore, modulating various targets such as Abeta aggregation, neuro-inflammation, and oxidative stress, genetic factors such as Apolipoprotein E gene (ApoE) are some of the ways to manage AD. Studying the natural products which can act as multifunctional agents could be key toward discovering new therapeutics. Ferulic acid (FA) represents one such natural product, which has exhibited great potential in this regard. Found in the plant cell walls, FA is an antioxidant, free radical scavenger with anti-inflammatory activity. Taking this into consideration, over the years, various derivatives have been reported as anti-AD molecules based on structure of FA. The present review explores the role of FA and its derivatives as therapeutic agents in AD.
