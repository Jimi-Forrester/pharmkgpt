34441814|t|Disease Manifestations in Mucopolysaccharidoses and Their Impact on Anaesthesia-Related Complications-A Retrospective Analysis of 99 Patients.
34441814|a|Patients with mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) frequently require anaesthesia for diagnostic or surgical interventions and thereby experience high morbidity. This study aimed to develop a multivariable prediction model for anaesthesia-related complications in MPS. This two-centred study was performed by retrospective chart review of children and adults with MPS undergoing anaesthesia from 2002 until 2018. We retrieved the patients' demographics, medical history, clinical manifestations, and indication by each anaesthesia. Multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression was calculated for a clinical model based on preoperative predictors preselected by lasso regression and another model based on disease subtypes only. Of the 484 anaesthesia cases in 99 patients, 22.7% experienced at least one adverse event. The clinical model resulted in a better forecast performance than the subtype-model (AICc 460.4 vs. 467.7). The most relevant predictors were hepatosplenomegaly (OR 3.10, CI 1.54-6.26), immobility (OR 3.80, CI 0.98-14.73), and planned major surgery (OR 6.64, CI 2.25-19.55), while disease-specific therapies, i.e., haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (OR 0.45, CI 0.20-1.03), produced a protective effect. Anaesthetic complications can best be predicted by surrogates for advanced disease stages and protective therapeutic factors. Further model validation in different cohorts is needed.
