34396707|a|AIM: We aimed to develop and evaluate a multifaceted and evidence-based delirium educational program for practitioners in nursing home settings. METHODS: A pre- and posttest comparison group design was employed. The recruited practitioners included nurses and care workers from two nursing homes. The intervention group (n = 51) received the developed delirium educational program for 3 weeks, whereas the control group (n = 23) received a delirium handbook. We examined pre- and posttest differences in the scores for delirium knowledge and confidence in providing delirium care. We also examined the nurses' ability to clinically detect delirium in patients and delirium incidence for 8-week periods both before and after the intervention. RESULTS: There were significant improvements in the participants' aptitudes (delirium knowledge and confidence in providing delirium care) and clinical practice (ability to clinically detect delirium in the patients) only in the intervention group; however, there were no significant differences in patient outcomes (incidence of delirium) between either group. Additionally, it was observed that the nurses' improved understanding of distinct clinical features of delirium, such as acute change or fluctuation, was the key factor that directly affected the success of delirium screening. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that implementation of a multifaceted and evidence-based delirium educational program for practitioners in nursing home settings was effective in promoting the knowledge, confidence, and ability to detect delirium. The developed program can also be implemented in settings where most patients are older individuals, such as geriatric care units, or long-term care hospitals.
