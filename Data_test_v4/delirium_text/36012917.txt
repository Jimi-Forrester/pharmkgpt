36012917|t|Montreal Cognitive Assessment for Evaluating Cognitive Impairment in Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A Systematic Review.
36012917|a|Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a severe condition with high mortality and extensive long-term morbidity. Although research has focused mainly on physical signs and disability for decades, in recent years, it has been increasingly recognized that cognitive and psychological impairments may be present in many patients with SAH, negatively impacting their quality of life. We performed a systematic review aiming to provide a comprehensive report on the diagnostic accuracy of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test for evaluating the presence of cognitive impairment in patients with SAH. Using appropriate search terms, we searched five databases (PubMed, Scopus, PsychINFO, Web of Sciences, and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature) up to January 2022. Two cross-sectional studies investigated the accuracy of MoCA in SAH patients in the subacute and chronic phase. We appraised the quality of the included studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) criteria. The MoCA test provides information about general cognitive functioning disturbances. However, a lower threshold than the original cutoff might be needed as it improves diagnostic accuracy, lowering the false positive rates. Further research is necessary for an evidence-based decision to use the MoCA in SAH patients.
