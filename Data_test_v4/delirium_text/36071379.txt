36071379|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication after hip fracture surgery that is associated with various short- and long-term outcomes. The mechanism of POD may be associated with the oxidative stress process. Uric acid has been shown to provide a neuroprotective effect in various neurodegenerative diseases through its antioxidant properties. However, it is unclear whether lower preoperative serum uric acid levels are associated with the development of POD after hip fracture surgery. Therefore, this study assessed the association of lower preoperative uric acid levels in patients with POD during hospitalization. METHODS: This is a matched retrospective case-control study that included 96 older patients (>=65 y) who underwent hip fracture surgery. POD was diagnosed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Patients diagnosed with POD (cases) were matched 1:1 with patients without POD (controls) on the basis of age, sex, and anesthesia type. The relationship between preoperative uric acid and POD was analyzed by multivariable analysis. RESULTS: The POD and non-POD groups each had 48 patients. In the univariate analysis, lower log preoperative serum uric acid value, higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and cerebrovascular disease were more likely in patients with POD than in those with no POD. Multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis showed that lower log preoperative serum uric acid (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.028; confidence interval [CI], 0.001-0.844; p = 0.040), higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (aOR, 1.314; 95% CI, 1.053-1.638; p = 0.015), and increased surgery duration (aOR, 1.034; 95% CI, 1.004-1.065; p = 0.024) were associated with increased risk of POD. CONCLUSIONS: Lower preoperative serum uric acid levels may be an independent risk factor for POD after adjustment for possible confounding factors. However, large prospective studies are needed to confirm this finding.
