17105660|t|Signal peptide peptidase (SPP) dimer formation as assessed by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) in intact cells.
17105660|a|BACKGROUND: Signal peptide peptidase (SPP) is an intramembrane cleaving protease identified by its cleavage of several type II membrane signal peptides. Conservation of intramembrane active site residues demonstrates that SPP, SPP family members, and presenilins (PSs) make up a family of intramembrane cleaving proteases. Because SPP appears to function without additional protein cofactors, the study of SPP may provide structural insights into the mechanism of intramembrane proteolysis by this biomedically important family of proteins. Previous studies have shown that SPP isolated from cells appears to be a homodimer, but some evidence exists that in vitro SPP may be active as a monomer. We have conducted additional experiments to determine if SPP exists as a monomer or dimer in vivo. RESULTS: Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) can be is used to determine intra- or intermolecular interactions by fluorescently labeling epitopes on one or two different molecules. If the donor and acceptor fluorophores are less than 10 nm apart, the donor fluorophore lifetime shortens proportionally to the distance between the fluorophores. In this study, we used two types of fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) pairs; cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) or Alexa 488 with Cy3 to differentially label the NH2- or COOH-termini of SPP molecules. A cell based SPP activity assay was used to show that all tagged SPP proteins are proteolytically active. Using FLIM we were able to show that the donor fluorophore lifetime of the CFP tagged SPP construct in living cells significantly decreases when either a NH2- or COOH-terminally YFP tagged SPP construct is co-transfected, indicating close proximity between two different SPP molecules. These data were then confirmed in cell lines stably co-expressing V5- and FLAG-tagged SPP constructs. CONCLUSION: Our FLIM data strongly suggest dimer formation between two separate SPP proteins. Although the tagged SPP constructs are expressed throughout the cell, SPP dimer detection by FLIM is seen predominantly at or near the plasma membrane.
