27678025|a|INTRODUCTION: Currently available drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD) target cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmissions without affecting the underlying disease process. Putative disease-modifying drugs are in development and target beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide and tau protein, the principal neurophatological hallmarks of the disease. Areas covered: Phase III clinical studies of emerging anti-Abeta drugs for the treatment of AD were searched in US and EU clinical trial registries and in the medical literature until May 2016. Expert opinion: Drugs in Phase III clinical development for AD include one inhibitor of the beta-secretase cleaving enzyme (BACE) (verubecestat), three anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies (solanezumab, gantenerumab, and aducanumab), an inhibitor of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) (azeliragon) and the combination of cromolyn sodium and ibuprofen (ALZT-OP1). These drugs are mainly being tested in subjects during early phases of AD or in subjects at preclinical stage of familial AD or even in asymptomatic subjects at high risk of developing AD. The hope is to intervene in the disease process when it is not too late. However, previous clinical failures with anti-Abeta drugs and the lack of fully understanding of the pathophysiological role of Abeta in the development of AD, put the new drugs at substantial risk of failure.
