38676962|a|BACKGROUND: A recent pilot study demonstrated that an interactive delirium educational intervention, The Delirium OSCE Education Package, had a positive impact on self-perceptions of confidence and competence in the use of delirium assessment tools and delirium knowledge; delirium knowledge scores; clinical practice; and planned practice change for participants. However, it is not known if The Delirium OSCE Education Package is superior to standard methods of professional development education. OBJECTIVE: To determine if The Delirium OSCE Education Package is superior to standard methods of professional development education on observations of delirium care in practice scores for post-registration nurses. DESIGN: Clustered randomised, controlled, and observer-blinded, multisite superiority trial with two parallel groups at each site. SETTINGS: Three private hospitals across New South Wales, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Registered nurses (RNs) (n = 153) or enrolled nurses (ENs) (n = 37) working in the eligible inpatient medical or surgical wards at each site. METHODS: Within each hospital site wards were clusters, with wards rather than individuals being randomised for The Delirium OSCE Education Package or standard professional development education at a ratio of 1:1. The primary outcome was observations of delirium care in practice, 6-weeks post (T1) allocated intervention. Secondary outcomes were self-perceived confidence and competence (self-efficacy) in delirium assessment tools and delirium knowledge; and delirium knowledge scores. RESULTS: A total of 51.3 % (n = 20) in the intervention group obtained a satisfactory observation of delirium care in practice score, compared to 34.9 % (n = 15) in the control group (p = 0.134, chi2). The odds of a satisfactory observation of delirium care in practice score for the intervention group was 10.1 times higher than the control (p = 0.009). The mean MCQ score and perceptions of confidence and competence in the intervention and control group increased from baseline to six-weeks post-intervention, however, there was no significant difference between the groups. CONCLUSION: The Delirium OSCE Education Package provides the foundation for facilitating change in delirium care. It is recommended that The Delirium OSCE Education Package is implemented as part of a multicomponent strategy involving a validation delirium screening and assessment tool, hospital-specific policy, interprofessional education, and delirium champions. Future studies are needed to evaluate the sustainability of the intervention and if there is a positive impact on patient-level outcomes.
