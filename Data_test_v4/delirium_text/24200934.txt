24200934|a|Accumulation of phospholipid hydroperoxide (PLOOH) in erythrocyte membranes is an abnormality found in patients with senile dementia, including those with Alzheimer's disease. In our previous studies, dietary xanthophylls (polar carotenoids such as lutein) were hypothesized to inhibit lipid peroxidation. In the present study, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial to assess the impact for a total of 2 months Chlorella supplementation (8 g Chlorella/day/person; equivalent to 22.9 mg lutein/day/person) on PLOOH and carotenoid concentrations in erythrocytes as well as plasma of 12 normal senior subjects. After 1 or 2 months of treatment, erythrocytes and plasma lutein concentrations increased in the Chlorella group but not in the placebo group. In the Chlorella-supplemented group, erythrocyte PLOOH concentrations after a total of 2 months of treatment were lower than the concentrations before supplementation. These results suggest that Chlorella ingestion improved erythrocyte antioxidant status and lowered PLOOH concentrations. These reductions might contribute to maintaining the normal function of erythrocytes and prevent the development of senile dementia.
