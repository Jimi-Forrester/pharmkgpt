31787111|t|Priming primary care providers to engage in evidence-based discussions about cannabis with patients.
31787111|a|Cannabis use has become increasingly common in the U.S. in recent years, with legalization for medical and recreational purposes expanding to more states. With this increase in use and access, providers should be prepared to have more conversations with patients about use. This review provides an overview of cannabis terminology, pharmacology, benefits, harms, and risk mitigation strategies to help providers engage in these discussions with their patients. Current evidence for the medical use of cannabis, cannabis-related diagnoses including cannabis use disorder (CUD) and withdrawal syndromes, and the co-use of opioids and cannabis are discussed. It is crucial that providers have the tools and information they need to deliver consistent, evidence-based assessment, treatment, prevention and harm-reduction, and we offer practical guidance in these areas.
