562488|t|Some biochemical aspects of chronic alcohol intoxication.
562488|a|Pathways of ethanol transformation and its respective metabolic disorders in the cell have been considered. One should note the role of acetaldehyde in the ethanol toxic effect. Acetaldehyde produces a significant effect upon the metabolism of biogenic amines in brain tissue. Chronic alcohol intoxication at a certain stage is connected with a considerable reduction in the ratio of alcohol dehydrogenase:acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (this ratio determines the severity of clinical signs in intoxication). The inhibition of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activity is an enzymological base of hallucinations and delirium tremens. The importance of the protective role of nutrition at chronic alcohol intoxication is shown.
