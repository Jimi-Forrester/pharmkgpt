25126120|a|OBJECTIVES: The Aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of clinico-radiological parameters on the outcome of the treatment in brain tuberculosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted in the Department of Neurosurgery and Neurology Skims Srinagar India for a period of two years from November 2009 to November 2011. A total of 61 patients presenting with brain tuberculosis admitted at skims during these two years were included in the study. Patients having clinical, laboratory and radiological findings suggestive of brain tuberculosis were included in the study. On correlating the CT characteristics-tuberculomas, basal exudates and hydrocephalus with sequelae at 6,12 and 18 months - focal deficit, cognitive impairment, and diplopia. RESULTS: It was seen that basal exudates correlated with all the three neurological sequelae i.e.; with focal deficit (P = 0.001), cognitive impairment (P = 0.011), and diplopia (P = 0.021). Hydrocephalus correlated well with cognitive impairment (P = 0.031) and tuberculoma correlated with none of these clinical characteristics. CONCLUSION: We concluded that the mortality and neurologic sequelae were directly related to the clinical stage of disease at presentation. Correlating the CT characteristics we concluded that basal exudates correlated with all the three sequelae i.e.; with focal deficit, cognitive impairment, and diplopia. Hydrocephalous correlated well with cognitive impairment and tuberculoma correlated with none of these clinical characteristics.
