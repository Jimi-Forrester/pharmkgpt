36644234|a|Background: Ubiquilin 2 (UBQLN2) is an adaptor of ubiquitinated proteins and the proteasome. The potential role of UBQLN2 in carcinogenesis has been demonstrated. However, its role in modulating the radiosensitivity of cancer is not clear. Here, we explored the radiosensitizing effect of silencing UBQLN2 on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and its mechanisms. Methods: We analyzed the prognostic role of UBQLN2 in the ESCC patient cohort from the Cancer Genomic Atlas (TCGA) database and our hospital. We also conducted a series of experiments in vivo and in vitro to investigate the effect of silencing UBQLN2 on ESCC radiosensitivity and its mechanisms. Results: UBQLN2 is highly expressed in ESCC tissues and positively correlated with poor overall survival (OS). The knockdown of UBQLN2 dramatically increased the radiosensitivity of ESCC cells. Mechanically, UBQLN2 suppression substantially upregulated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 could reverse the radiation-enhancing effect induced by UBQLN2 knockdown. The direct interaction between UBQLN2 and p38 MAPK was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP) assay. Furthermore, silencing UBQLN2 also inhibited the expression of phosphorylated DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (p-DNA-PKcs) after irradiation. Finally, the xenografted tumor experiment confirmed the radiosensitizing effect of silencing UBQLN2 on ESCC in vivo. Conclusion: Our results suggest that silencing UBQLN2 enhances the radiosensitivity of ESCC by activating p38 MAPK, and UBQLN2 may be a potential target to enhance the radiosensitivity of ESCC.
