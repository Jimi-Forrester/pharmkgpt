38927745|a|Brain lipid homeostasis is an absolute requirement for proper functionality of nerve cells and neurological performance. Current evidence demonstrates that lipid alterations are linked to neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD). The complexity of the brain lipidome and its metabolic regulation has hampered the identification of critical processes associated with the onset and progression of AD. While most experimental studies have focused on the effects of known factors on the development of pathological hallmarks in AD, e.g., amyloid deposition, tau protein and neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation, etc., studies addressing the causative effects of lipid alterations remain largely unexplored. In the present study, we have used a multifactor approach combining diets containing different amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), estrogen availabilities, and genetic backgrounds, i.e., wild type (WT) and APP/PS1 (FAD), to analyze the lipid phenotype of the frontal cortex in middle-aged female mice. First, we observed that severe n-3 PUFA deficiency impacts the brain n-3 long-chain PUFA (LCPUFA) composition, yet it was notably mitigated by hepatic de novo synthesis. n-6 LCPUFAs, ether-linked fatty acids, and saturates were also changed by the dietary condition, but the extent of changes was dependent on the genetic background and hormonal condition. Likewise, brain cortex phospholipids were mostly modified by the genotype (FAD>WT) with nuanced effects from dietary treatment. Cholesterol (but not sterol esters) was modified by the genotype (WT>FAD) and dietary condition (higher in DHA-free conditions, especially in WT mice). However, the effects of estrogen treatment were mostly observed in relation to phospholipid remodeling in a genotype-dependent manner. Analyses of lipid-derived variables indicate that nerve cell membrane biophysics were significantly affected by the three factors, with lower membrane microviscosity (higher fluidity) values obtained for FAD animals. In conclusion, our multifactor analyses revealed that the genotype, diet, and estrogen status modulate the lipid phenotype of the frontal cortex, both as independent factors and through their interactions. Altogether, the outcomes point to potential strategies based on dietary and hormonal interventions aimed at stabilizing the brain cortex lipid composition in Alzheimer's disease neuropathology.
