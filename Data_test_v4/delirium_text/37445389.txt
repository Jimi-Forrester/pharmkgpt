37445389|t|Heart Rate Variability for Outcome Prediction in Intracerebral and Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A Systematic Review.
37445389|a|This systematic review presents clinical evidence on the association of heart rate variability with outcome prediction in intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhages. The literature search led to the retrieval of 19 significant studies. Outcome prediction included functional outcome, cardiovascular complications, secondary brain injury, and mortality. Various aspects of heart rate recording and analysis, based on linear time and frequency domains and a non-linear entropy approach, are reviewed. Heart rate variability was consistently associated with poor functional outcome and mortality, while controversial results were found regarding the association between heart rate variability and secondary brain injury and cardiovascular complications.
