36056979|a|BACKGROUND: Dialysis central venous catheters (DCs) are used for various blood purification therapies. Accidental removal of a DC is a potentially life-threatening event. However, the risk factors associated with accidental removal have rarely been discussed in the literature. METHODS: We performed a 5 year retrospective, single-center, cohort study of patients who were admitted to the ward other than intensive care units and were inserted DCs. We compared patient characteristics between patients who used DCs with and without a history of accidental removal. RESULTS: There were 17 cases of accidental removal (3.5%) out of 489 DC insertions during the observation period. There was no significant difference between patients with and without accidental removal in terms of age, sex, reason for DC insertion, catheter type, or insertion site. The presence of dementia was 35 and 11% (p = 0.006), and that of delirium was 88 and 13% (p < 0.0001) in those with and without accidental removal, respectively. The median days from insertion to accidental removal were 5 (range 0-21) days, and removal occurred mainly at night (71%). One patient with accidental removal developed hemorrhagic shock, but there no deaths occurred due to accidental removal. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that to prevent accidental removal, sufficient attention should be paid to delirium that occurs after admission as well to pre-existing dementia at the time of admission. As accidental removal occurs most commonly early after insertion and at night, special attention should be paid during these periods.
