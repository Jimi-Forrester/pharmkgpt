31263455|t|From Mouth to Brain: Neuroendocrine Markers Play as a Crosstalk Among Oral and Neurodegenerative Diseases.
31263455|a|The neuroendocrine system consists of various cells distributed in non-endocrine functional structures, able to synthesize amines and peptides with both local (paracrine) and systemic (endocrine) effects. The presence of such cells, belonging to the neuroendocrine system, is highlighted by the presence of neuroendocrine markers: the most suggestive are chromogranin A, synaptophysin, S-100B protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein. The presence of neuroendocrine markers is commonly associated to the occurrence of neuroendocrine cancers, currently representing the 0.5 percent of all malignant tumors. Nevertheless, neuroendocrine markers have been found to be overexpressed in rare oral neuroendocrine tumors, but also in quite common inflammatory conditions, such as severe periodontitis. The monitoring of neuroendocrine markers is, thus, a common factor of interest among dentistry and neurology: the analysis of neuroendocrine markers in oral diseases may be predictive and prognostic about the severity of neurological diseases, such as lateral amyotrophic sclerosis and traumatic brain injuries. The aim of this mini-review is to highlight the role of neuroendocrine molecules as advantageous diagnostic and prognostic markers for both oral diseases and neurodegenerative disorders.
