37470978|t|Amyloid-Lowering Monoclonal Antibodies for the Treatment of Early Alzheimer's Disease.
37470978|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Numerous biomarker studies have clearly demonstrated that AD has a long asymptomatic phase, with the development of pathology occurring at least 2 decades prior to the development of any symptoms. These pathological changes include a stepwise development of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, followed by tau neurofibrillary tangles and subsequently extensive neurodegeneration in the brain. In this review, we discuss the first class of drugs intended to be disease modifying to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for AD-anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies-and the scientific rationale with which they were developed.
