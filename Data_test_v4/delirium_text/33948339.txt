33948339|t|Intracranial Metastasis from Prostate Cancer: Investigation, Incidence, and Imaging Findings in a Large Cohort of Australian Men.
33948339|a|OBJECTIVES: Prostate cancer metastasizing to the brain is remarkably uncommon, with the incidence never having been described in the modern setting. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence and imaging pattern of intracranial metastasis from prostate cancer in a large cohort of Australian men with prostate cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review was undertaken of imaging reports for all known prostate cancer patients, who underwent an imaging examination inclusive of the brain, between July 1, 2014, and July 1, 2020. Once an intracranial lesion was identified, all available imaging and clinical notes were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 5644 imaging examinations which included the brain were identified in 4341 prostate cancer patients. The majority (92.1%) of examinations were 68-Gallium-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (68Ga-PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Eight patients were identified as having an intracranial metastasis from prostate cancer, yielding an incidence of 0.18%. All patients had a Gleason score of 9 (where known), and the majority of patients (5/8) had a non-acinar variant of prostate cancer. At the time of diagnosis of intracranial metastasis, all patients had extensive metastatic disease. Imaging characteristics of the intracranial lesions were highly variable. CONCLUSION: The incidence of intracranial metastasis in prostate cancer patients has never been well-established. In this study, we determined the incidence as being 0.18%. Given the majority of metastasis constituted unexpected findings on routine restaging 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT, the incidence determined in our study is arguably the most accurate and clinically relevant described to date.
