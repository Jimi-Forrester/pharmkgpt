39093728|a|RATIONALE: SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated tumor (SMARCA4-UT) is a recently reported rare malignancy that can rapidly metastasize to tissues and organs throughout the body. The tumor is characterized by a lower response to platinum-based chemotherapy. More regrettably, the mean survival time of patients with this disease after diagnosis is only 4 to 7 months. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 58-year-old man was admitted to a hospital for fatigue, sudden syncope, and a mass-like shadow of his left upper lobe demonstrated by a pulmonary computed tomographic. Based on his subsequent clinical and pathological features, he was highly suspected of SMARCA4-UT. DIAGNOSES: Combined with next-generation sequencing genetic testing and immunohistochemical examination results, the patient was diagnosed with SMARCA4-UT. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received a left upper lobectomy and lymph node dissection, four-course chemotherapy divided into 8 sessions with the use of paclitaxel simply, and a proper post-discharge self-care. OUTCOMES: The patient's operation and chemotherapy were all successful and he maintained a high quality of life after surgery that far exceeded his predicted survival. LESSONS: Early diagnosis, higher education level, attention to the disease and complications, reducing chemotherapy damage, adequate nutrient intake, relieving symptoms, controlling depression, and maintaining immunity and the ability to perform activities of daily living may all be the positive factors that can prolong the survival of patients with SMARCA4-UT.
