10329396|t|Genome structure and chromosomal mapping of the gene for Fe65L2 interacting with Alzheimer's beta-amyloid precursor protein.
10329396|a|Recently we cloned the cDNA encoding human Fe65L2, which interacts with Alzheimer's beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). The protein has one WW domain and two PID elements (Neurosci. Lett. (1999) 261, 143-146.). Here, we report the entire genome structure and the chromosomal mapping of the Fe65L2 gene. The gene is composed of thirteen coding exons distributed over 6 kb and the genomic organization is similar to another Fe65 member, Fe65 gene. Two transcription start sites of the gene were found in a CpG island by primer extension analysis. Radiation hybrid mapping revealed that the Fe65L2 gene is on chromosome 5 between markers SHGC-9824 (D5S2374) and SHGC-8489 (D5S2569). Characterization of the Fe65L2 gene structure will be useful in the linkage analysis and search for mutations in the Fe65L2 gene in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
