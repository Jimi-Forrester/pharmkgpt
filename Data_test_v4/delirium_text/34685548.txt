34685548|t|Classification of Cell-in-Cell Structures: Different Phenomena with Similar Appearance.
34685548|a|A phenomenon known for over 100 years named "cell-in-cell" (CIC) is now undergoing its renaissance, mostly due to modern cell visualization techniques. It is no longer an esoteric process studied by a few cell biologists, as there is increasing evidence that CICs may have prognostic and diagnostic value for cancer patients. There are many unresolved questions stemming from the difficulties in studying CICs and the limitations of current molecular techniques. CIC formation involves a dynamic interaction between an outer or engulfing cell and an inner or engulfed cell, which can be of the same (homotypic) or different kind (heterotypic). Either one of those cells appears to be able to initiate this process, which involves signaling through cell-cell adhesion, followed by cytoskeleton activation, leading to the deformation of the cellular membrane and movements of both cells that subsequently result in CICs. This review focuses on the distinction of five known forms of CIC (cell cannibalism, phagoptosis, enclysis, entosis, and emperipolesis), their unique features, characteristics, and underlying molecular mechanisms.
