34063746|t|High Concentration of Heavy Metal and Metalloid Levels in Edible Campomanesia adamantium Pulp from Anthropic Areas.
34063746|a|This study aimed to quantify the extent of heavy metal, non-metal and metalloid levels in the Campomanesia adamantium pulp obtained from an area crossed by road experiencing high large vehicle traffic and intensive agriculture modern farming, to monitor the health risks associated with pulp consumption by humans. For this purpose, in three spots located within this area, ripe fruits were collected on the roadside, bush and farm-margin. Pulp samples were digested by microwave-assisted equipment, and chemical elements were quantified by ICP OES. The concentrations of K, Pb, Se, Fe, Mo, Zn, Co, Ni and Mn in the pulp collected in roadside/bush points showed statistical differences (p < 0.05). The heavy metals and metalloid concentrations that exceeded FAO/WHO standards were ordered Pb > As > Mo > Co > Ni > Mn > Cr. Therefore, among these metalloid and heavy metals, As, Pb and Cr were found to be higher in farm-margin > roadside > bush (1.5 x 10-3, 1.1 x 10-3 and 6.2 x 10-4), respectively. Therefore, As is the most important metalloid with higher levels in farm-margin, roadside and bush (1.5 x 10-3, 1.0 x 10-3 and 6.0 x 10-4 > 10-6-10-4 and 3.33, 2.30 and 1.34 > 1), respectively, to total cancer risk and hazard quotient, if 10 g daily of pulp are consumed.
