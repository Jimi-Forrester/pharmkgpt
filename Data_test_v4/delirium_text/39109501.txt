39109501|a|Recent advancements in Alzheimer's disease treatment have focused on the elimination of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque, a hallmark of the disease. Monoclonal antibodies such as lecanemab and donanemab can alter disease progression by binding to different forms of Abeta aggregates. However, these treatments raise concerns about adverse effects, particularly amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Careful assessment of safety, especially regarding ARIA, is crucial. ARIA results from treatment-related disruption of vascular integrity and increased vascular permeability, leading to the leakage of proteinaceous fluid (ARIA-E) and heme products (ARIA-H). ARIA-E indicates treatment-induced edema or sulcal effusion, while ARIA-H indicates treatment-induced microhemorrhage or superficial siderosis. The minimum recommended magnetic resonance imaging sequences for ARIA assessment are T2-FLAIR, T2* gradient echo (GRE), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). T2-FLAIR and T2* GRE are necessary to detect ARIA-E and ARIA-H, respectively. DWI plays a role in differentiating ARIA-E from acute to subacute infarcts. Physicians, including radiologists, must be familiar with the imaging features of ARIA, the appropriate imaging protocol for the ARIA workup, and the reporting of findings in clinical practice. This review aims to describe the clinical and imaging features of ARIA and suggest points for the timely detection and monitoring of ARIA in clinical practice.
