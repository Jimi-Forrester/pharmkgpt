38854460|t|Lost in Transition: Community-Dwelling Partners' Stories of Losing a Spouse to Cognitive Decline and Long-Term Care Facilities.
38854460|a|This qualitative narrative study presents three stories told by older community-dwelling partners to spouses moving into long-term care facilities because of cognitive decline. Applying Alvesson and Karreman's mystery method to these stories reveals that when spouses' caring needs increase, care partners must take on increasing loads of practical work and responsibilities. These partners become lost in the transitions between care work, extended family, and attending to their couplehood. When their spouses move into long-term care, living apart presents new challenges of care and couplehood, each day presenting new and unforeseen tasks to manage. Our findings suggest that if couplehood is to be maintained, well-established habits and work division between the spousal partners are both drivers and barriers. It necessitates agency, creativity from the community-dwelling partner, as well as a supportive extended family and sufficient economic resources. More knowledge is required regarding the interdependent expectations between the next-of-kin, long-term care residents, and caregiving staff members.
