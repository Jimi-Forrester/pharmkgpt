37123958|a|At present, there is no cure for dementia or its related cognitive impairments. Available treatments only provide symptomatic relief and do not alter the disease's progression and they suffer serious drawbacks limiting their clinical use, hence the need for alternative therapies. Although Launaea cornuta has been used traditionally to treat cognitive deficits, its pharmacological efficacy and safety have not been empirically validated, prompting this study. Acute oral toxicity of the extract was examined in Swiss albino mice using the up-and-down procedure described by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development guideline number 425. The Morris water maze technique was adopted in assessing cognitive-enhancing effects of the extract in ketamine-induced cognitive-impaired mice. The malondialdehyde concentrations in the whole brain of experimental mice involved in the MWM experiment were measured to determine the extract's anti-lipid peroxidation efficacy. Qualitative phytochemical screening of the extract was performed using standard procedures. Our results showed that the test extract was safe and did not cause any clinical signs of acute oral toxicity in mice at all doses (LD50 > 2000 mg/kg BW). Moreover, the extract significantly improved cognitive function in ketamine-induced cognitive-impaired mice in a dose-dependent manner, as indicated by reduced escape latency, navigation distance, and longer latency in the target quadrant during the probe trial. The extract also significantly reduced malondialdehyde concentrations in mice in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating its antioxidative stress efficacy. The studied extract contained various phytochemicals associated with cognitive enhancement and antioxidant efficacy, among other pharmacologic effects. Further empirical studies are needed to determine and characterise the extract's specific cognitive-enhancing compounds, specific mechanisms of action, and complete toxicity profiles.
