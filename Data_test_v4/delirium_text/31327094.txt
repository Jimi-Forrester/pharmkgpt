31327094|t|5,6-Diphenyl triazine-thio methyl triazole hybrid as a new Alzheimer's disease modifying agents.
31327094|a|In this study, new derivatives of 5,6-diphenyl triazine-thio methyl triazole hybrid were designed, synthesized and evaluated as multifunctional agents for Alzheimer's disease. Among all synthesized compounds, 4a and 4h showed the best inhibitory activities against BACE1 (40% and 37.5% muM inhibition at 50 microM, respectively). Molecular docking studies showed that compound 4a occupied the entire BACE1 enzyme and the thio triazine fragment deeply penetrates into S2 binding site via two hydrogen bonds with Thr72 and Gln73 amino acids. Different aromatic moieties occupy S'2 pocket via hydrophobic interactions. 6-Phenyl ring also had a potential hydrophobic interaction with S1 pocket. In vitro ChE inhibitory assay demonstrated that most of the derivatives exhibited more selectivity toward BuChE than AChE. 4c as the most potent BuChE inhibitor displayed an IC50 value of 6.4 microM, and 4b exhibited AChE inhibitory activity with 25.1% inhibition at 50 muM. Further, molecular docking studies revealed that the thiazolidinones moiety plays a key role in the inhibition mechanism by well fitting into the enzyme bounding pocket. Moreover, molecular docking study of 4a, 4b and 4c with ChE active site was also performed.
