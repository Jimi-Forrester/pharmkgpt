34239172|a|The purpose of this study is to clarify the survival benefit and acceptable extent of surgery for very elderly patients with pancreatic cancer. Patients (n=55) >=80 years with resectable pancreatic cancer were studied. 29 underwent pancreatectomy, 16 underwent chemotherapy, and 10 received best supportive care. Uni and multivariate analysis were performed to explore predictive factors for overall survival (OS) with surgery and chemotherapy (n=45). Postoperative survival of PD (pancreatoduodenectomy) and DP (distal pancreatectomy) and of PD-PVR (PD with portal vein resection) and PD were compared. OS was equivalent with surgery and chemotherapy (median survival time [MST]; 685 vs. 626 days, respectively; p=0.057); 6 patients surivived >=3 years after surgery. Pancreatectomy was not a prognostic factor. Survival was significantly worse with PD-PVR than with PD, but equivalent with PD and DP. Within 2 years after PD-PVR, 8 patients have died. Surgery was not a positive prognostic factor for very elderly patients with pancreatic cancer, but was the sole chance for survival >=3 years. Indication for PD-PVR for very elderly patients should be determined more cautiously compared with that for non-elderly patients.
