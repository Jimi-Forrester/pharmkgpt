37571654|t|The Objective Dementia Severity Scale Based on MRI with Contrastive Learning: A Whole Brain Neuroimaging Perspective.
37571654|a|In the clinical treatment of Alzheimer's disease, one of the most important tasks is evaluating its severity for diagnosis and therapy. However, traditional testing methods are deficient, such as their susceptibility to subjective factors, incomplete evaluation, low accuracy, or insufficient granularity, resulting in unreliable evaluation scores. To address these issues, we propose an objective dementia severity scale based on MRI (ODSS-MRI) using contrastive learning to automatically evaluate the neurological function of patients. The approach utilizes a deep learning framework and a contrastive learning strategy to mine relevant information from structural magnetic resonance images to obtain the patient's neurological function level score. Given that the model is driven by the patient's whole brain imaging data, but without any possible biased manual intervention or instruction from the physician or patient, it provides a comprehensive and objective evaluation of the patient's neurological function. We conducted experiments on the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, and the results showed that the proposed ODSS-MRI was correlated with the stages of AD 88.55% better than all existing methods. This demonstrates its efficacy to describe the neurological function changes of patients during AD progression. It also outperformed traditional psychiatric rating scales in discriminating different stages of AD, which is indicative of its superiority for neurological function evaluation.
