23643083|t|[The roles of C5a and C5aR antagonist in TNF-alpha secretion and CD88 expression of BV2 microglial cells treated with Abeta1-42 oligomer].
23643083|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of C5a in the release of TNF-alpha from microglial cells and its related mechanism, and identify the intervention effect of C5aR antagonist (C5aRA) in the pathological change of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Soluble Abeta1-42 oligomer was prepared, identified by atomic force microscopy. Then Abeta1-42 oligomer alone, or in a combination with different levels of C5a, C5aRA, or C5a+C5aRA was used to treat cultured BV2 cells. The non-treated BV2 cells served as controls. ELISA was used to detect the concentration of TNF-alpha, and flow cytometry to analyze the expression of C5a receptor (CD88). RESULTS: Abeta1-42 oligomer significantly stimulated BV2 cells to release TNF-alpha and CD88, compared to the control group (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). C5a further increased the release of TNF-alpha (P<0.05 vs Abeta1-42 group). In contrast, C5aRA inhibited remarkably the release of TNF-alpha stimulated by Abeta1-42 (P<0.01). Nevertheless, C5a or C5aRA didn't show a significant effect on the expression of CD88 in BV2 cells that was elevated by Abeta1-42 treatment (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: C5a promotes the release of TNF-alpha from microglial cells; Abeta1-42 can further boost the release and C5aRA can inhibite TNF-alpha secretion of microglial cells significantly.
