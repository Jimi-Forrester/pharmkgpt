33716102|t|Amyloid-beta (25-35) regulates neuronal damage and memory loss via SIRT1/Nrf2 in the cortex of mice.
33716102|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. AD is pathologically characterized by synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline due to the aggregation of a large amount of amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein in the brain. However, recent studies have discovered that the Abeta is produced as an antimicrobial peptide that acts against bacteria and viruses. This has renewed interest in the effect of Abeta on AD. Thus, in this study, we investigated the different concentrations of Abeta25-35 on neuroprotection and further explore the related mechanisms. Firstly, we detected the cognitive function using the Y-maze test, novel object recognition memory task and Morris water maze test. Then, we analyzed the ultrastructure of synapses and mitochondria, in addition to evaluating SOD levels. We also examined the effect of Abeta25-35 on the viability and structure of the primary neurons. The western blot analysis was used to measure the protein levels. The results showed that mice treated with high concentration of Abeta25-35 impaired the learning-memory ability and disordered the structure of neurons and mitochondria. Meanwhile, high concentration of Abeta25-35 decreased the SIRT1/Nrf2 related antioxidant capacity and induced apoptosis. In contrast, mice treated with low concentration of Abeta25-35 increased SOD levels and SIRT1/Nrf2 expressions, and induced autophagy. Our data suggest that low concentration of Abeta25-35 may increase SOD levels through SIRT1/Nrf2 and induce autophagy.
