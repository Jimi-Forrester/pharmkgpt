37522138|t|Subclinical retinopathy in systemic lupus erythematosus patients - optical coherence tomography study.
37522138|a|Introduction: The aim was to detect subclinical structural retinal abnormalities in optical coherence tomography (OCT) in ophthalmologically asymptomatic systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients without signs of lupus retinopathy or drug toxicity in fundus examination and in OCT and to assess the relationship between OCT parameters and disease activity, therapy type and burden on other organs to demonstrate the utility of OCT in early retinal impairment in SLE patients. Material and methods: Cross-sectional study. Thirty-three SLE patients (57 eyes) and 31 healthy individuals (56 eyes) were enrolled in the study. We excluded patients with evidence of lupus retinopathy or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) toxicity on OCT or fundus examination to reveal any subclinical changes. All patients underwent full ophthalmologic examination in the slit lamp including best corrected visual acuity, tonometry, and OCT. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution test was used to assess the normal distribution in quantitative values. The differences between the individual measured parameters in the groups were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Spearman's rank correlation test was used to assess the correlation between the measured parameters and quantitative clinical data. Results: There was no difference in the OCT findings between SLE and healthy control groups. Among the study group a negative correlation was found between disease duration and age and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in the inferior quadrant (p = 0.0063, p = 0.0036). No correlations were observed between examined retinal parameters and duration of hydroxychloroquine therapy, hydroxychloroquine as well as chloroquine cumulative dose and disease activity indices. Conclusions: Optical coherence tomography is a widespread ophthalmic modality used for SLE retinopathy and HCQ toxicity screening. Our study did not demonstrate its clinical potency in diagnosis of subclinical retinal involvement. An optical coherence tomography device seems to be less sensitive in subclinical retinal impairment detection than optical coherence tomography angiography.
