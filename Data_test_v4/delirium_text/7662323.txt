7662323|t|Acute phase reactant alpha 1-antichymotrypsin is increased in cerebrospinal fluid and serum of patients with probable Alzheimer disease.
7662323|a|Levels of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (alpha 1-ACT) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum from patients with probable Alzheimer disease (AD) of both early (e-AD) and late (l-AD) onset assessed by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were higher than those found in controls or in patients with vascular dementia (VD). A negative correlation between CSF levels of alpha 1-ACT and the stage of the disease was present in patients with both e-AD and l-AD. No difference in alpha 2-macroglobulin levels in CSF and serum from patients with e-AD, l-AD, VD, and nondemented controls was found. Serum concentrations of alpha 1-antitrypsin from l-AD subjects were within the normal range. Thus, increased levels of alpha 1-ACT in CSF and serum were specifically associated with AD, and the detection of this serpin in CSF may be useful in monitoring the progression of the disease.
