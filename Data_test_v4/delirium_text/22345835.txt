22345835|t|A Comparative Study of Treatment-seeking Inhalant Abusers Across Two Cohorts from a Tertiary Care Center in India.
22345835|a|CONTEXT: Inhalant abuse is the deliberate inhalation of a volatile substance to achieve an altered mental state. Inhalants continue to be a poorly recognizable risk for morbidity and mortality globally. AIMS: The current study explores the pattern of inhalant abuse across different year groups among the individuals seeking treatment form the de-addiction center of a tertiary care hospital. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The study was conducted at a tertiary care multi-specialty hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current study is a chart review of the cases with inhalant abuse/dependence presenting to the clinic. All the treatment records of the de-addiction clinic were reviewed and information was gathered regarding patients with inhalant abuse/dependence. The comparisons have been made across two different year groups. The two groups were compared for various continuous and categorical variables using the independent sample t test and chi(2) test/Fisher's exact test, respectively. The level of statistical significance was kept at P<0.05 for all these tests. RESULTS: The two study groups have been found comparable for various socio-demographic and inhalant use patterns. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the current study suggest that the pattern and parameters associated with inhalant use among those presenting to a tertiary care drug dependence center tend to remain stable.
