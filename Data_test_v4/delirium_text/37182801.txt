37182801|a|BACKGROUND: Multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) pathway have activity in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Lenalidomide demonstrated preliminary efficacy in DTC, but its safety and efficacy in combination with VEGFR targeted TKIs is unknown. We sought to determine the safety and efficacy of cediranib, a VEGFR targeted TKI, with or without lenalidomide, in the treatment of iodine 131-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicenter, open-label, randomized phase II clinical trial, 110 patients were enrolled and randomized to cediranib alone or cediranib with lenalidomide. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included response rate, duration of response, toxicity, and overall survival. Patients (>=18 years) with DTC who were refractory to further surgical or radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy as reviewed at a multispecialty tumor board conference, and evidence of disease progression within the previous 12 months and no more than 1 prior line of systemic therapy were eligible. RESULTS: Of the 110 patients, 108 started therapy and were evaluable for efficacy. The median PFS was 14.8 months (95% CI 8.5 to 23.8) in the cediranib arm and 11.3 months (95% CI 8.7 to 18.9) in the cediranib with lenalidomide arm (p=0.36). The 2-year overall survival was 64.8% (95% CI 43.3-86.4) and 75.3% (95% CI 59.4-91.0), respectively (p=0.80). The serious adverse event rate was 41% in the cediranib arm and 46% in the cediranib with lenalidomide arm. CONCLUSIONS: Single-agent therapy with cediranib showed promising efficacy in RAI refractory DTC similar to other VEGFR targeted TKIs, while the addition of lenalidomide did not result in clinically meaningful improvements in outcomes.
