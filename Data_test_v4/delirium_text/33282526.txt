33282526|t|Identification of Dysregulated Genes for Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Using Gene Expression Data in Brain.
33282526|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative complex brain disease that represents a public health concern. AD is considered the fifth leading cause of death in Americans who are older than 65 years which prioritizes the importance of understanding the etiology of AD in its early stages before the onset of symptoms. This study attempted to further understand Alzheimer's disease (AD) etiology by investigating the dysregulated genes using gene expression data from multiple brain regions. METHODS: A linear mixed-effects model for differential gene expression analysis was used in a sample of 15 AD and 30 control subjects, each with data from four different brain regions, in order to deal with the hierarchical multilevel data. Post-hoc Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analyses provided insights on the biological implications in AD progression. Supervised machine learning algorithms were used to assess the discriminative power of the top 10 candidate genes in distinguishing between the two groups. RESULTS: Enrichment analyses revealed biological processes and pathways that are related to structural constituents and organization of the axons and synapses. These biological processes and pathways imply dysfunctional axon and synaptic transmission between neuronal cells in AD. Random Forest classification algorithm gave the best accuracy on the test data with F1-score of 0.88. CONCLUSION: The differentially expressed genes were associated with axon and synaptic transmissions which affect the neuronal connectivity in cognitive systems involved in AD pathophysiology. These genes may open ways to explore new effective treatments and early diagnosis before the onset of clinical symptoms.
