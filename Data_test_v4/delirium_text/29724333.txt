29724333|a|The pain of not being recognised in the fight against Alzheimer's disease is a question of non-sharing rarely considered by medicine, but which is nevertheless a significant issue for the patient and carer. This anxiety relating to the fracture of the being emerges when being faced with the ordeal of Alzheimer's disease becomes a source of unfathomable helplessness. It is the question facing the caregiver with the arrival of the fateful stage of the non-recognition of the carer by the patient and the consequent lack of acknowledgement on the part of his or her family, and the non-sharing of his or her suffering which is not easily accepted by society.
