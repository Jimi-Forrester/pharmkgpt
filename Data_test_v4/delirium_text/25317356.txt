25317356|a|BACKGROUND: Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring in multiple trauma patients has become a common practice in monitoring the sedation levels. We aimed to assess the utility of BIS in the trauma intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in the trauma ICU at Hamad General Hospital in Qatar between 2011 and 2012. Patients were divided in two groups: Group I (without BIS monitoring) and Group II (with BIS monitoring). The depth of sedation was clinically evaluated with Ramsey Sedation Scale, changes in vital signs and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) level. Use of sedatives, analgesics, and muscle relaxants were also recorded. Data were compared using Chi-square and Student t-tests. RESULTS: A total of 110 mechanically ventilated trauma patients were enrolled with a mean age of 36 +- 14 years. The rate of head injury was greater in Group I when compared with Group II (94% vs. 81%, P = 0.04). In comparison to Group I, patients in Group II had lower GCS and higher mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) (6.3 +- 2.5 vs. 7.4 +- 2.7 and 25.5 +- 8.5 vs. 21.2 +- 4.7, respectively, P = 0.03). The used midazolam dose was less in Group II in comparison to Group I (5.2 +- 2.3 vs. 6.1 +- 2.1, P = 0.03). Also, fentanyl dose was less in Group II (152 +- 58 vs. 187 +- 59, P = 0.004). The rate of agitation, failure of extubation and tracheostomy in Group II were lower than those in Group I, P = 0.001. The length of stay for patients Group I was longer (14.6 +- 7.1 vs. 10.2 +- 5.9 days) in comparison to group II, P = 0.001. CONCLUSION: Management of multiple trauma patients in the trauma ICU with BIS monitoring was found to be associated with better outcomes. BIS monitoring is a guide for adjusting the dosage of sedative agents. It can also minimize agitation, failure of extubation, and length of stay in ICU.
