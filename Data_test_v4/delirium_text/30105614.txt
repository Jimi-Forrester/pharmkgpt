30105614|t|Donepezil improves the cognitive impairment in a tree shrew model of Alzheimer's disease induced by amyloid-beta1-40 via activating the BDNF/TrkB signal pathway.
30105614|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder which can contribute to memory loss and cognitive damage in the elderly; moreover, evidence from clinical and animal studies demonstrated that AD always exhibit severe cognitive deficits. However, the effects of donepezil medications on cognition are controversial. Additionally, it is unclear whether donepezil can protect neurons to improve cognitive function through the brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF)/tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) signalling pathway in the tree shrew (TS), which has a closer evolutionary relationship to primates than rodents. Here, we designed a study on an amyloid-beta1-40 (Abeta1-40)-induced TS model of AD and investigated the molecular mechanism by which donepezil protects neurons and improves cognitive function through activating the BDNF/TrkB signalling pathway. The results showed that donepezil could rescue Abeta1-40-induced spatial cognition deficits, and reverse Abeta1-40-induced temporal horn along with ADC enlargement in the TS brain. Meanwhile, it suppressed Abeta1-40-induced neuronal damage and loss of body weight. Intriguingly, donepezil could increase the choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) expression level and reduce the fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) expression level in the hippocampus and cortex of TS. Additionally, donepezil significantly upregulated the expression level of BDNF, as well as the phosphorylated level of TrkB. These results suggested that donepezil could protect neurocytes from senility and ameliorate learning and memory impairment in the TS model of AD, which appeared to be through regulating the cholinergic system and inhibiting the BDNF/TrkB-dependent signalling pathway. Moreover, the study underlines the potency of TS to be a novel animal model for research on AD, and it deserves intensive attention.
