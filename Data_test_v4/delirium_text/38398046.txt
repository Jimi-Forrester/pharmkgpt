38398046|t|Unlocking the Potential: Quercetin and Its Natural Derivatives as Promising Therapeutics for Sepsis.
38398046|a|Sepsis is a syndrome of organ dysfunction caused by an uncontrolled inflammatory response, which can seriously endanger life. Currently, there is still a shortage of specific therapeutic drugs. Quercetin and its natural derivatives have received a lot of attention recently for their potential in treating sepsis. Here, we provide a comprehensive summary of the recent research progress on quercetin and its derivatives, with a focus on their specific mechanisms of antioxidation and anti-inflammation. To obtain the necessary information, we conducted a search in the PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Cochrane library databases using the keywords sepsis, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-infection, quercetin, and its natural derivatives to identify relevant research from 6315 articles published in the last five years. At present, quercetin and its 11 derivatives have been intensively studied. They primarily exert their antioxidation and anti-inflammation effects through the PI3K/AKT/NF-kappaB, Nrf2/ARE, and MAPK pathways. The feasibility of these compounds in experimental models and clinical application were also discussed. In conclusion, quercetin and its natural derivatives have good application potential in the treatment of sepsis.
