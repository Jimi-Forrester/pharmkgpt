33411685|a|During the process of aging, the retina exhibits chronic oxidative stress (OS) damage. Our preliminary experiment showed that acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) could alleviate retinal damage caused by OS. This study aimed to explore whether ALDH2 could inhibit mice retinal cell apoptosis and enhance the function of unfolded protein response in endoplasmic reticulum (UPRER) through reducing OS in aging process. Retinal function and structure in vivo and in vitro were examined in aged ALDH2+ overexpression mice and ALDH2 agonist Alda1-treated aged mice. Levels of ALDH2, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), apoptosis and inflammatory cytokines were evaluated. Higher expression of ALDH2 was observed at the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and the inner nuclear layer (INL) in aged ALDH2+ overexpression and aged Alda1-treated mice. Moreover, aged ALDH2+ overexpression mice and aged Alda1-treated mice exhibited better retinal function and structure. Increased expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and ERS-related protein phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (peIF2alpha) and decreased expression of apoptosis-related protein, including C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), caspase12 and caspase9, and retinal inflammatory cytokines were detected in the retina of aged ALDH2+ overexpression mice and aged Alda1-treated mice. The expression of ALDH2 in the retina was decreased in aging process. ALDH2 could reduce retinal oxidative stress and apoptosis, strengthen UPRER during the aging process to improve retinal function and structure.
