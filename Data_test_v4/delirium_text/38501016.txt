38501016|t|Global biomarker trends in Parkinson's disease research: A bibliometric analysis.
38501016|a|As the second most common neurodegenerative disease globally, Parkinson's disease (PD) affects millions of people worldwide. In recent years, the scientific publications related to PD biomarker research have exploded, reflecting the growing interest in unraveling the complex pathophysiology of PD. In this study, we aim to use various bibliometric tools to identify key scientific concepts, detect emerging trends, and analyze the global trends and development of PD biomarker research.The research encompasses various stages of biomarker development, including exploration, identification, and multi-modal research. MOVEMENT DISORDERS emerged as the leading journal in terms of publications and citations. Key authors such as Mollenhauer and Salem were identified, while the University of Pennsylvania and USA stood out in collaboration and research output. NEUROSCIENCES emerged as the most important research direction. Key biomarker categories include alpha-synuclein-related markers, neurotransmitter-related markers, inflammation and immune system-related markers, oxidative stress and mitochondrial function-related markers, and brain imaging-related markers. Furthermore, future trends in PD biomarker research focus on exosomes and plasma biomarkers, miRNA, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, machine learning applications, and animal models of PD. These trends contribute to early diagnosis, disease progression monitoring, and understanding the pathological mechanisms of PD.
