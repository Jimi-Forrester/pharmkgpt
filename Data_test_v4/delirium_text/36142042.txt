36142042|a|As Alzheimer's disease develops, the central nervous system is gradually damaged. It is manifested by progressive dementia and the appearance of neurological and extrapyramidal symptoms that impair everyday functioning. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of physical exercise on cognitive and motor functions in various stages of Alzheimer's disease. Methods: Four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Ovid, and Cochrane Library) were searched for relevant papers published between 2012 and May 2022. The works were assessed in terms of the adopted inclusion criteria. The measures of the results were changed in the parameters assessing motor and cognitive functions. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration. This review was recorded with the Cochrane Library: CRD42022340496. The results of the database search showed 302 articles, 12 of which were included in the review. All studies have shown a significant positive effect on improving cognitive and motor functions. This systematic review revealed a beneficial effect in improving cognitive and motor functions after the application of various kinds of activities, especially in the early and mild stages of Alzheimer's disease.
