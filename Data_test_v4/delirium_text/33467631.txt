33467631|t|Formulation and Optimization of Nanospanlastics for Improving the Bioavailability of Green Tea Epigallocatechin Gallate.
33467631|a|The present study aimed to investigate the potential of nanospanlastics for boosting the bioavailability of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). EGCG has valuable effects like anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, and anti-tumorigenesis. Unfortunately, it has a low oral bioavailability due to its limited permeation and poor stability. To overcome these pitfalls, EGCG was fabricated as a nanospanlastic. Nanospanlastics are flexible nanovesicles that are composed of surfactants and edge activators (EAs). EAs improve the deformability of spanlastics by acting as a destabilizing factor of their vesicular membranes. EGCG-loaded spanlastics were prepared by an ethanol injection method, according to 23 factorial design, to explore the impact of different independent variables on entrapment efficiency (EE%), % drug released after 12 h (Q12h), and particle size (PS). In vitro characterization, ex vivo intestinal permeation test, and pharmacokinetic study of the optimized formula were performed. A newly developed RP-HPLC technique was adopted for the estimation of EGCG. The optimized formula (F4) demonstrated more prolonged drug release and a significant improvement in the EE%, permeability, deformability and stability than the corresponding niosomes. The pharmacokinetic study investigated that F4 had a more sustained drug release and a higher bioavailability than the conventional niosomes and free drugs. Nanospanlastics could be a promising approach for improving the bioavailability of EGCG.
