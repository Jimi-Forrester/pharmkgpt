38902707|a|BACKGROUND: The impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on outcome in perioperative organ injury (POI) has not yet been investigated sufficiently. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analysed data of surgical patients with POI, namely delirium, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute liver injury (ALI), or acute kidney injury (AKI), in Germany between 2015 and 2019. We compared in-hospital mortality, hospital length of stay (HLOS) and perioperative ventilation time (VT) in patients with and without COPD. RESULTS: We analysed the data of 1,642,377 surgical cases with POI of which 10.8% suffered from COPD. In-hospital mortality was higher (20.6% vs. 15.8%, p < 0.001) and HLOS (21 days (IQR, 12-34) vs. 16 days (IQR, 10-28), p < 0.001) and VT (199 h (IQR, 43-547) vs. 125 h (IQR, 32-379), p < 0.001) were longer in COPD patients. Within the POI examined, AKI was the most common POI (57.8%), whereas ALI was associated with the highest mortality (54.2%). Regression analysis revealed that COPD was associated with a slightly higher risk of in-hospital mortality (OR, 1.19; 95% CI:1.18-1.21) in patients with any POI. CONCLUSIONS: COPD in patients with POI is associated with higher mortality, longer HLOS and longer VT. Especially patients suffering from ALI are susceptible to the detrimental effects of COPD on adverse outcome.
