15178425|t|Insights from modelling the 3D structure of the extracellular domain of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.
15178425|a|Based on the crystal structure of acetylcholine-binding protein, the three-dimensional structures of the extracellular domain, or the ligand-binding domains, of the monomer, homodimer, and homopentamer of the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor were derived. The interface between two subunits, where the ligand-binding site is located, was investigated. Furthermore, an explicit definition of the ligand-binding pocket was illustrated that might provide useful clues for conducting various mutagenesis studies for finding drugs against schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.
