35879001|t|Study protocol for Video Images about Decisions to Improve Ethical Outcomes with Palliative Care Educators (VIDEO-PCE): a pragmatic stepped wedge cluster randomised trial of older patients admitted to the hospital
35879001|a|INTRODUCTION: Despite the known benefit to patients and families, discussions about goals, values and preferences for medical care in advancing serious illness often do not occur. Many system and clinician factors, such as patient and clinician reticence and shortage of specialty palliative care teams, contribute to this lack of communication. To address this gap, we designed an intervention to promote goals-of-care conversations and palliative care referrals in the hospital setting by using trained palliative care educators and video decision aids. This paper presents the rationale, design and methods for a trial aimed at addressing barriers to goals-of-care conversations for hospitalised adults aged 65 and older and those with Alzheimer's disease and related Dementias, regardless of age. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Video Image about Decisions to Improve Ethical Outcomes with Palliative Care Educators is a pragmatic stepped wedge, cluster randomised controlled trial, which aims to improve and extend goals-of-care conversations in the hospital setting with palliative care educators trained in serious illness communication and video decision aids. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with goals-of-care documentation in the electronic health record. We estimate that over 9000 patients will be included. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Boston Medical Center will serve as the single IRB of record for all regulatory and ethical aspects of this trial. BMC Protocol Number: H-41482. Findings will be presented at national meetings and in publications. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04857060; ClinicalTrials.gov.
