34357471|a|Infections and perioperative stress can lead to neuroinflammation, which in turn is linked to cognitive impairments such as postoperative delirium or postoperative cognitive dysfunctions. The alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist dexmedetomidine (DEX) prevents cognitive impairments and has organo-protective and anti-inflammatory properties. Macroautophagy (autophagy) regulates many biological processes, but its role in DEX-mediated anti-inflammation and the underlying mechanism of DEX remains largely unclear. We were interested how a pretreatment with DEX protects against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in adult male Wistar rats. We used Western blot and activity assays to study how DEX modulated autophagy- and apoptosis-associated proteins as well as molecules of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, and qPCR to analyse the expression of autophagy and inflammation-associated microRNAs (miRNA) in the spleen, cortex and hippocampus at different time points (6 h, 24 h, 7 d). We showed that a DEX pretreatment prevents LPS-induced impairments in autophagic flux and attenuates the LPS-induced increase in the apoptosis-associated protein cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) in the spleen. Both, DEX and LPS altered miRNA expression and molecules of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in the spleen and brain. While only a certain set of miRNAs was up- and/or downregulated by LPS in each tissue, which was prevented or attenuated by a DEX pretreatment in the spleen and hippocampus, all miRNAs were up- and/or downregulated by DEX itself - independent of whether or not they were altered by LPS. Our results indicate that the organo-protective effect of DEX may be mediated by autophagy, possibly by acting on associated miRNAs, and the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Preventive effects of DEX on LPS-induced inflammation. DEX restores the LPS-induced impairments in autophagic flux, attenuates PARP cleavage and alters molecules of the cholinergic system in the spleen. Furthermore, DEX alters and prevents LPS-induced miRNA expression changes in the spleen and brain along with LPS.
