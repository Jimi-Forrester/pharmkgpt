38069305|t|A Biomimetic Multiparametric Assay to Characterise Anti-Amyloid Drugs.
38069305|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most widespread form of senile dementia worldwide and represents a leading socioeconomic problem in healthcare. Although it is widely debated, the aggregation of the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) is linked to the onset and progression of this neurodegenerative disease. Molecules capable of interfering with specific steps in the fibrillation process remain of pharmacological interest. To identify such compounds, we have set up a small molecule screening process combining multiple experimental methods (UV and florescence spectrometry, ITC, and ATR-FTIR) to identify and characterise potential modulators of Abeta1-42 fibrillation through the description of the biochemical interactions (molecule-membrane Abeta peptide). Three known modulators, namely bexarotene, Chicago sky blue and indomethacin, have been evaluated through this process, and their modulation mechanism in the presence of a biomembrane has been described. Such a well-adapted physico-chemical approach to drug discovery proves to be an undeniable asset for the rapid characterisation of compounds of therapeutic interest for Alzheimer's disease. This strategy could be adapted and transposed to search for modulators of other amyloids such as tau protein.
