26226012|t|G-protein-coupled receptor kinases in inflammation and disease.
26226012|a|G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are serine/threonine protein kinases originally discovered for their role in G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) phosphorylation. Recent studies have demonstrated a much broader function for this kinase family including phosphorylation of cytosolic substrates involved in cell signaling pathways stimulated by GPCRs, as well as by non-GPCRs. In addition, GRKs modulate signaling via phosphorylation-independent functions. Because of these various biochemical functions, GRKs have been shown to affect critical physiological and pathophysiological processes, and thus are considered as drug targets in diseases such as heart failure. Role of GRKs in inflammation and inflammatory diseases is an evolving area of research and several studies including work from our lab in the recent years have demonstrated critical role of GRKs in the immune system. In this review, we discuss the classical and the newly emerging functions of GRKs in the immune system and their role in inflammation and disease processes.
