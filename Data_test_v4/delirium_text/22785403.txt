22785403|t|Probing and trapping a sensitive conformation: amyloid-beta fibrils, oligomers, and dimers.
22785403|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease with pathological misfolding of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta). The recent interest in Abeta misfolding intermediates necessitates development of novel detection methods and ability to trap these intermediates. We speculated that two regions of Abeta may allow for detection of specific Abeta species: the N-terminal and 22-35, both likely important in oligomer interaction and formation. We determined via epitomics, proteomic assays, and electron microscopy that the Abeta(42) species (wild type, DeltaE22, and MetOx) predominantly formed fibrils, oligomers, or dimers, respectively. The 2H4 antibody to the N-terminal of Abeta, in the presence of 2% SDS, primarily detected fibrils, and an antibody to the 22-35 region detected low molecular weight Abeta species. Simulated molecular modeling provided insight into these SDS-induced structural changes. We next determined if these methods could be used to screen anti-Abeta drugs as well as identify compounds that trap Abeta in various conformations. Immunoblot assays determined that taurine, homotaurine (Tramiprosate), myoinositol, methylene blue, and curcumin did not prevent Abeta aggregation. However, calmidazolium chloride trapped Abeta at oligomers, and berberine reduced oligomer formation. Finally, pretreatment of AD brain tissues with SDS enhanced 2H4 antibody immunostaining of fibrillar Abeta. Thus we identified and characterized Abetas that adopt specific predominant conformations (modified Abeta or via interactions with compounds), developed a novel assay for aggregated Abeta, and applied it to drug screening and immunohistochemistry. In summary, our novel approach facilitates drug screening, increases the probability of success of antibody therapeutics, and improves antibody-based detection and identification of different conformations of Abeta.
