39722699|a|Objective: We aimed to investigate the relationship between volumetric measurements of specific brain regions which were measured with artificial intelligence (AI) and various neuropsychological tests in patients with clinically isolated syndrome. Materials and methods: A total of 28 patients diagnosed with CIS were included in the study. The patients were administered Oktem Verbal Memory Processes Test, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Backward-Forward Digit Span Test, Stroop Test, Trail Making Test, Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), Brief Visuospatial Memory Test, Judgement of Line Orientation Test, Beck Depression Scale, Beck Anxiety Scale and Fatigue Severity Scale. Artificial intelligence assisted BrainLab Elements  Atlas-Based Automatic Segmentation program was used for calculating volumes. The measured volumes were compared with the reference database. In addition, neuropsychological test performances and volumetric measurements of the patients were compared. Results: Of the patients included in the study, 78.6% were female and 21.4% were male, with an average age of 33 years. Verbal Memory Processes Test, SDMT, Backward-Forward Digit Span, JLOT, and Stroop Test showed significant correlations with multiple anatomical regions, particularly the anterior thalamic nucleus, which was associated with the highest number of cognitive tests. The JLOT exhibited the strongest correlation with six different brain regions (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The Judgement of Line Orientation and Stroop Tests, correlated with multiple brain regions, especially the anterior thalamic nucleus, underscoring the importance of these tests in assessing cognitive function in CIS.
