36979508|a|Core-shell superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles hold great promise as a theranostic platform in biological systems. Herein, we report the biological effect of multifunctional cyclodextrin-appended SPIONs (CySPION) in mutant Npc1-deficient CHO cells compared to their wild type counterparts. CySPIONs show negligible cytotoxicity while they are strongly endocytosed and localized in the lysosomal compartment. Through their bespoke pH-sensitive chemistry, these nanoparticles release appended monomeric cyclodextrins to mobilize over-accumulated cholesterol and eject it outside the cells. CySPIONs show a high rate of transport across blood-brain barrier models, indicating their promise as a therapeutic approach for cholesterol-impaired diseases affecting the brain.
