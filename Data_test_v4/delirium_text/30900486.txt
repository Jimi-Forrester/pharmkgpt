30900486|t|The neuropathic pain: An overview of the current treatment and future therapeutic approaches.
30900486|a|Neuropathic pain is characterized by abnormal hypersensitivity to stimuli (hyperalgesia) and nociceptive responses to non-noxious stimuli (allodynia). The conditions and the pathophysiological states that determine the onset of neuropathic pain are heterogeneous, such as metabolic disorders, neuropathy caused by viral infections, and autoimmune diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS). Neuropathic pain in the general population is estimated to have a prevalence ranging between 3% and 17%. Most of the available treatments for neuropathic pain have moderate efficacy and present side effects that limit their use; therefore, other therapeutic approaches are needed for patients. In this article, the current standard of care treatment, the emerging pharmacological approaches from the completed phase III clinical trials, and the preclinical studies on novel promising therapeutic options will be reviewed.
