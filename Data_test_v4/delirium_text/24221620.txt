24221620|a|Part two of the CME article Psychotropic agents and psychopharmacotherapy in emergency medicine aims to give an understanding of the pharmacotherapy of psychiatric disorders in emergency medicine. In contrast to somatic emergencies, many emergency physicians are not familiar with the treatment of psychiatric emergencies, although there are guidelines and recommendations. In the following article, treatment recommendations for the 5 most common and relevant syndromes in emergency medicine (i.e., suicide, delirium, agitation, stupor, and syndromes due to psychopharmaceutical use) are described based on the German S2-Guideline Emergency Psychiatry that will be published soon.
