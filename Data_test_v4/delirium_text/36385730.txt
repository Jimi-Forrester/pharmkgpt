36385730|a|The mental health consequences of pandemic isolation have been well documented extending from psychological conditions such as anxiety and depression to increased falls risk, medication errors and delirium. Whilst risk factors associated with isolation are known, there remains a gap in the guidance for healthcare staff on how to assess for these risks and develop effective management plans. Using a structured professional judgement (SPJ) approach and the author's recent experience providing consultation and leadership to clinical staff working with at-risk patients during the pandemic, an isolation risk assessment and management guideline was developed. SPJ is an evidenced-based analytical method used to understand and mitigate risk that was primarily developed for the assessment and management of aggression and violence. This paper discusses an evidenced-based process used to develop the guideline and the application of its use from the author's clinical experience.
