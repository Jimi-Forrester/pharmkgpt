24954831|a|Pathophysiological evidence correlating locus ceruleus neuron loss with increased Alzheimer's disease pathology suggests that norepinephrine (NE) is neuroprotective. Here, we evaluated the effects of NE on amyloid-beta (Abeta)1-42-induced neurotoxicity and determined how NE exerts its actions in human SK-N-SH neurons. NE protected SK-N-SH cells against Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity only after a 4-hour treatment. The ability of NE to reduce Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity was independent of the adrenoceptor signaling pathway. Notably, NE downregulated Abeta1-42-mediated increases in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. However, NE did not affect Abeta1-42-induced activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) redox signaling pathway, known to be involved in oxidative stress. Among the antioxidants tested, N-acetyl cysteine and glutathione, which are not only ROS scavengers but also thiol-reducing agents, mimicked the protective effects of NE. Consistently, Kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1 inhibitors, which activated the Nrf2 pathway, failed to decrease Abeta1-42-induced ROS generation and elicited no protection against Abeta1-42. Taken together, these findings suggest that NE could exert neuroprotective function against Abeta1-42 via redox cycling and reduction of intracellular oxidative stress regardless of downstream activation of the Nrf2 pathway.
