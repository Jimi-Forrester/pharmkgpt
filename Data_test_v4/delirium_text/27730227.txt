27730227|a|In the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the production of HO  by copper-amyloid beta (Abeta) in the presence of ascorbate is known to be deleterious for the Abeta peptide itself and also for the surrounding molecules, thus establishing a direct link between AD and oxidative stress. The metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO) of Abeta primarily targets the residues involved in copper coordination during HO  production. In the present work, we demonstrate that the oxidative damage undergone by Abeta during MCO lead to a change in copper coordination, with enhanced catalytic properties that increases the rates of ascorbate consumption and HO  production, and the amount of HO  released by the system. This phenomenon is observed after the peptide has been sufficiently oxidized.
