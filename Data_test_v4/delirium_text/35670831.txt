35670831|t|Amyloids on Membrane Interfaces: Implications for Neurodegeneration.
35670831|a|Membrane interfaces are vital for various cellular processes, and their involvement in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease has taken precedence in recent years. The amyloidogenic proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases interact with the neuronal membrane through various means, which has implications for both the onset and progression of the disease. The parameters that regulate the interaction between the membrane and the amyloids remain poorly understood. The review focuses on the various aspects of membrane interactions of amyloids, particularly amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides and Tau involved in Alzheimer's and alpha-synuclein involved in Parkinson's disease. The genetic, cell biological, biochemical, and biophysical studies that form the basis for our current understanding of the membrane interactions of Abeta peptides, Tau, and alpha-synuclein are discussed.
