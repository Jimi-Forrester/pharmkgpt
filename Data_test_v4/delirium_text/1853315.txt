1853315|t|[Diaphragmatic injuries].
1853315|a|Diaphragmatic injuries are serious, since they can lead to herniation of abdominal organs into the thorax. The injury is simple to treat when diagnosed early. The operation can then be performed with direct suturing. Concomitant injuries are common, however, and complicate diagnosis and treatment in an acute situation. During the period 1980-90, 30 patients with diaphragmatic injuries where treated in Ulleval hospital, 18 after closed and 12 after penetrating trauma. 28 of the 30 patients also had associated injuries. In four patients the diagnosis was initially missed. The majority of the patients were treated by laparotomy. Four patients died during the primary admission to the hospital, one of them suddenly in delirium tremens, two from massive bleeding from a pelvic fracture and one from septicemia and multiorgan failure. One patient died four years later from pneumococcal septicemia. No patient died because of the diaphragmatic injury, and traumatic diaphragmatic hernia due to earlier injuries was not registered during the study period.
