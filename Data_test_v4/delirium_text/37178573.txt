37178573|a|The epsilon4 allele of the lipoprotein E gene (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor associated with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD). While the neuronal cell type-specific function of APOE4 in connection with AD pathology remains understudied. Therefore, we generated an induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) line from a 77-year-old female donor with ApoE4 genetic background. We reprogrammed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with non-integrative Sendai viral vectors containing reprogramming factors. Established iPSCs showed the capability of pluripotency, three-germ differentiation in vitro with normal karyotype. Hence, the generated iPSC could be a powerful tool to conduct further studies of AD mechanisms.
