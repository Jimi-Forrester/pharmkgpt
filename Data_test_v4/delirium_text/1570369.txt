1570369|t|[Clinical and laboratory differentiation of alcohol withdrawal syndrome ("predelirium") and alcoholic delirium].
1570369|a|In a retrospective study, data from 99 male and female inpatients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome or alcohol withdrawal delirium, treated between 1977 and 1987, were analyzed. DSM-III criteria were used to assign the diagnosis of either withdrawal delirium (with obligatory clouding of consciousness) or alcohol withdrawal syndrome (without disturbances of consciousness and/or perception). No statistically significant differences between the two groups were found with respect to the red and white blood count, liver enzymes, and electrolytes. Significant differences were found in calcium levels, lymphocyte counts, and in electrophoresis. However, these differences are of no use for diagnostic purpose. Moreover, they are unspecific with respect to etiology. Hence, the distinction between alcohol withdrawal syndrome and alcohol withdrawal delirium can only be made clinically, i.e., it is dependent on the presence or absence of a clouded consciousness. This is in line with the findings published by other investigators. In the light of our metabolic findings, alcohol withdrawal syndrome and alcohol withdrawal delirium represent the two extremes of a continuum rather than two separate nosological entities.
