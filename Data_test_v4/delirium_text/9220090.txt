9220090|a|Normal old adults and patients in an early phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD) were presented with photographs of common objects under two different encoding conditions: naming and naming along with category decisions. Memory was assessed with free recall, category cued recall, and recognition. For both groups, recognition was superior to cued recall which was higher than that for free recall. Most importantly, cue utilization in AD was optimized in the naming + category decision condition, although the normal old showed equivalent gains from cues following both encoding conditions. These results suggest that AD patients require more cognitive support at encoding than normal old adults to make effective use of retrieval cues. Dementia-related deficits in processing categorical information spontaneously may underlie the observed group differences in patterns of performance.
