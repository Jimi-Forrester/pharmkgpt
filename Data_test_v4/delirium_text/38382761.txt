38382761|t|Prognostic nutritional index and the risk of postoperative complications after spine surgery: a meta-analysis.
38382761|a|BACKGROUND: A low prognostic nutritional index (PNI) may reflect malnutrition, which has been associated with poor prognosis in patients with various clinical conditions. The aim of the systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the association between preoperative PNI and risk of postoperative complications in adult patients after spine surgery. METHODS: An extensive search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to identify relevant cohort studies. Random-effects models were employed to combine the findings, taking into account the potential influence of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Ten cohort studies involving 3249 patients receiving spine surgeries were included. Pooled results showed that a low preoperative PNI was associated with an increased risk of overall postoperative complications in these patients (odds ratio [OR]: 1.82, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.42 to 2.34, p < 0.001; I2 = 49%). Specifically, a preoperative malnutrition as evidenced by a low PNI was associated with a higher incidence of postoperative delirium (OR: 2.36, 95% CI: 1.52 to 3.66, p < 0.001; I2 = 38%) and surgical site infection (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.73, p = 0.001; I2 = 0%). Sensitivity analyses by excluding one study at a time did not significantly change the results (p all < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A preoperative low PNI may be a risk factor of increased incidence of overall postoperative complications, postoperative delirium, and surgical site infection in adult patients after spine surgeries.
