34334397|a|BACKGROUND: Histopathologic studies have demonstrated differential amyloid-beta (Abeta) burden between cortical sulci and gyri in Alzheimer's disease (AD), with sulci having a greater Abeta burden. OBJECTIVE: To characterize Abeta deposition in the sulci and gyri of the cerebral cortex in vivo among subjects with normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD, and to evaluate if these differences could improve discrimination between diagnostic groups. METHODS: T1-weighted 3T MR and florbetapir (amyloid) positron emission tomography (PET) data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). T1 images were segmented and the cortex was separated into sulci/gyri based on pial surface curvature measurements. T1 images were registered to PET images and regional standardized uptake value ratios (SUVr) were calculated. A linear mixed effects model was used to analyze the relationship between clinical variables and amyloid PET SUVr measurements in the sulci/gyri. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to define amyloid positivity. Logistic models were used to evaluate predictive performance of clinical diagnosis using amyloid PET SUVr measurements in sulci/gyri. RESULTS: 719 subjects were included: 272 NC, 315 MCI, and 132 AD. Gyral and sulcal Abeta increased with worsening cognition, however there was a greater increase in gyral Abeta. Females had a greater gyral and sulcal Abeta burden. Focusing on sulcal and gyral Abeta did not improve predictive power for diagnostic groups. CONCLUSION: While there were significant differences in Abeta deposition in cerebral sulci and gyri across the AD spectrum, these differences did not translate into improved prediction of diagnosis. Females were found to have greater gyral and sulcal Abeta burden.
