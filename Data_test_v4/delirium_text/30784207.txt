30784207|a|Deficiencies in N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)/glutamate receptor (NMDAR) signaling have been considered central to the cognitive impairments of schizophrenia; however, an NMDAR antagonist memantine (MEM) improves cognitive impairments of Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. These mechanisms of paradoxical clinical effects of NMDAR antagonists remain unclear. To explore the mechanisms by which MK801 and MEM affect thalamocortical transmission, we determined interactions between local administrations of MK801, MEM, system xc- (Sxc), and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) on extracellular glutamate and GABA levels in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MDTN) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) using dual-probe microdialysis with ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography. Effects of MK801 and MEM on Sxc activity were also determined using primary cultured astrocytes. Sxc activity was enhanced by MEM, but was unaffected by MK801. MK801 enhanced thalamocortical glutamatergic transmission by GABAergic disinhibition in the MDTN. In the MDTN and the mPFC, MEM weakly increased glutamate release by activating Sxc, whereas MEM inhibited thalamocortical glutamatergic transmission. Paradoxical effects of MEM were induced following secondary activation of inhibitory II-mGluR and III-mGluR by exporting glutamate from astroglial Sxc. The present results suggest that the effects of therapeutically relevant concentrations of MEM on thalamocortical glutamatergic transmission are predominantly caused by activation of Sxc rather than inhibition of NMDAR. These demonstrations suggest that the combination between reduced NMDAR and activated Sxc contribute to the neuroprotective effects of MEM. Furthermore, activation of Sxc may compensate for the cognitive impairments that are induced by hyperactivation of thalamocortical glutamatergic transmission following activation of Sxc/II-mGluR in the MDTN and Sxc/II-mGluR/III-mGluR in the mPFC.
