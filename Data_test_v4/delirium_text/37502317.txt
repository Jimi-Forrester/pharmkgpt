37502317|a|Peptide and protein selective modification at tyrosine residues has become an exploding field of research as tyrosine constitutes a robust alternative to lysine and cysteine-targeted traditional peptide/protein modification protocols. This review offers a comprehensive summary of the latest advances in tyrosine-selective cleavage, functionalization, and conjugation of peptides and proteins from the past three years. This updated overview complements the extensive body of work on site-selective modification of peptides and proteins, which holds significant relevance across various disciplines, including chemical, biological, medical, and material sciences.
