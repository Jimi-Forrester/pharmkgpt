1317403|a|Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections are usually found in immunocompromised persons and rarely present in those who are immunocompetent. We report a case of CMV colitis in an elderly woman presenting with delirium, prolonged fever, and diarrhea. Treatment with ganciclovir, an antiviral agent, resulted in resolution of the colitis within 3 weeks without noticeable side effects. Older adults may be more susceptible to CMV infection by virtue of age-related changes in immune function. The possibility of CMV colitis should be considered in an elderly person with persistent fever, diarrhea, and negative stool cultures.
