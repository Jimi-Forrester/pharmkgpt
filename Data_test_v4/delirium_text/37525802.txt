37525802|t|Investigating the Impact of Epilepsy on Cognitive Function: A Narrative Review.
37525802|a|It has been noted that people who have epilepsy have an increased propensity for cognitive dysfunction. We explored 25 relevant articles on PubMed and Cochrane Library after implementing inclusion criteria. Different factors have been postulated and studied that may cause cognitive dysfunction in these patients; structural brain abnormalities, polypharmacy of antiepileptic medication, and neuropsychiatric disorders are the most common causes. Cognitive assessments such as Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) and Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) are the mainstay tools used to diagnose the degree of cognitive decline, and alterations in EEG (electroencephalogram) parameters have also been noted in people with cognitive decline. The mechanisms and treatments for cognitive decline are still being studied, while attention has also been directed toward preventive and predictive methods. Early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment can help minimize its impact on the patient's quality of life. Regular cognitive assessments are essential for epileptic patients, particularly those on multiple antiepileptic drugs. While proper management of epilepsy and related comorbidities would reduce cognitive decline and improve the overall quality of life for people with epilepsy.
